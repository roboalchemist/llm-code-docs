# Building a Supply-Chain Copilot with OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks MCP Servers

## Solution Overview

In supply-chain operations, an agent can resolve questions that directly affect service levels and revenue: Do we have the inventory and capacity to satisfy current demand? Where will manufacturing delays occur, and how will those delays propagate downstream? Which workflow adjustments will minimise disruption? 

![Databricks MCP UI](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/databricks_mcp_ui.png)

This cookbook outlines the process for building a supply-chain copilot with the OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks Managed MCP. MCP enables the agent to query structured and unstructured enterprise data, such as inventory, sales, supplier feeds, local events, and more, for real-time visibility, early detection of material shortages, and proactive recommendations. An orchestration layer underpins the system, unifying:
- Queries against structured inventory, demand, and supplier data
- Time series forecasting for every wholesaler
- Graph based raw material requirements and transport optimizations
- Vector-indexed e-mail archives that enable semantic search across unstructured communications 
- Revenue risk calculation

By the end of this guide you will deploy a template that queries distributed data sources, predictive models, highlights emerging bottlenecks, and recommends proactive actions. It can address questions such as:
- What products are dependent on L6HUK material?
- How much revenue is at risk if we can’t produce the forecasted amount of product autoclave_1?
- Which products have delays right now?
- Are there any delays with syringe_1? 
- What raw materials are required for syringe_1?
- Are there any shortages with one of the following raw materials: O4GRQ, Q5U3A, OAIFB or 58RJD?
- What are the delays associated with wholesaler 9?

Stakeholders can submit a natural-language prompt and receive answers instantly.
This guide walks you through each step to implement this solution in your own environment.

## Architecture

The architecture presented in this cookbook layers an OpenAI Agent on top of your existing analytics workloads in Databricks. You can expose Databricks components as callable Unity Catalog functions. The agent is implemented with the [OpenAI Agent SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) and connects to [Databricks Managed MCP servers](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/mcp). 

The result is a single, near-real-time conversational interface that delivers fine-grained forecasts, dynamic inventory recommendations, and data-driven decisions across the supply chain. The architecture yields an agent layer that harnesses your existing enterprise data (structured and unstructured), classical ML models, and graph-analytics capabilities.

![Databricks MCP Architecture](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/databricks_mcp_architecture.png)

## Set up Databricks authentication

You can set up your Databricks authentication by adding a profile to `~/.databrickscfg`. A [Databricks configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/config-profiles) contains settings and other information that Databricks needs to authenticate. 

The snippet’s `WorkspaceClient(profile=...)` call will pick that up. It tells the SDK which of those stored credentials to load, so that your code never needs to embed tokens. Another option would be to create environment variables such as `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`, but using `~/.databrickscfg` is recommended.

Generate a workspace [personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/pat#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users) via Settings → Developer → Access tokens → Generate new token, then record it in `~/.databrickscfg`.

To create this Databricks configuration profile file, run the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/) databricks configure command, or follow these steps:
- If `~/.databrickscfg` is missing, create it: touch `~/.databrickscfg`
- Open the file: `nano ~/.databrickscfg`
- Insert a profile section that lists the workspace URL and personal-access token (PAT) (additional profiles can be added at any time):


```bash
[DEFAULT]
host  = https://dbc-a1b2345c-d6e7.cloud.databricks.com # add your workspace URL here
token = dapi123...    # add your PAT here
```


You can then run this sanity check command `databricks clusters list` with the Databricks CLI or SDK. If it returns data without prompting for credentials, the host is correct and your token is valid.

As a pre-requisite, Serverless compute and Unity Catalog must be enabled in the Databricks workspace. 

## (Optional) Databricks Supply Chain set up 

This cookbook can be used to work with your own Databricks supply chain datasets and analytical workloads.

Alternatively, you can accelerate your setup by using a tailored version of the Databricks’ Supply Chain Optimization Solution Accelerator. To do so, you can clone this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain) into your Databricks workspace and follow the instructions in the README [file](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/README.md). Running the solution will stand up every asset the Agent will later reach via MCP, from raw enterprise tables and unstructured e-mails to classical ML models and graph workloads. 

If you prefer to use your own datasets and models, make sure to wrap relevant components as Unity Catalog functions and define a Vector Search index as shown in the accelerator. You can also expose Genie Spaces.

The sample data mirrors a realistic pharma network: three plants manufacture 30 products, ship them to five distribution centers, and each distribution center serves 30-60 wholesalers. The repo ships time-series demand for every product-wholesaler pair, a distribution center-to-wholesaler mapping, a plant-to-distribution center cost matrix, plant output caps, and an e-mail archive flagging shipment delays. 

![Pharma Network](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/pharma_network.png)

Answering supply-chain operations questions requires modelling how upstream bottlenecks cascade through production, logistics, and fulfilment so that stakeholders can shorten lead times, avoid excess stock, and control costs. The notebooks turn these raw feeds into governed, callable artefacts:
- Demand forecasting & aggregation ([notebook 2](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/02_Fine_Grained_Demand_Forecasting.py)): Generates one-week-ahead SKU demand for every wholesaler and distribution center with a Holt-Winters seasonal model (or any preferred time-series approach). It leverages Spark’s parallelisation for large-scale forecasting tasks by using Pandas UDFs (taking your single node data science code and distributing it across multiple nodes). Forecasts are then rolled up to DC-level totals for each product. The output is a table  product_demand_forecasted with aggregate forecasts at the distribution center level.
- Raw-material planning ([notebook 3](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/03_Derive_Raw_Material_Demand.py)): Constructs a product-to-material using graph processing, propagating demand up the bill-of-materials hierarchy to calculate component requirements at scale. We transform the bill‑of‑materials into a graph so product forecasts can be translated into precise raw‑material requirements, yielding two tables: raw_material_demand and raw_material_supply.
- Transportation optimisation ([notebook 4](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/04_Optimize_Transportation.py)): Minimises plant to distribution center transportation cost under capacity and demand constraints, leveraging Pandas UDFs, outputting recommendations in shipment_recommendations.
- Semantic e-mail search ([notebook 6](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/06_Vector_Search.py)): Embeds supply-chain manager e-mails in a vector index using OpenAI embedding models, enabling semantic queries that surface delay and risk signals.

Each insight is wrapped as a Unity Catalog (UC) function in [notebook 5](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/05_Data_Analysis_%26_Functions.py) and [notebook 7](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/07_More_Functions.py), e.g. product_from_raw, raw_from_product, revenue_risk, lookup_product_demand, query_unstructured_emails. Because UC governs tables, models, and vector indexes alike, the Agent can decide at runtime whether to forecast, trace a BOM dependency, gauge revenue impact, fetch history, or search e-mails, always within the caller’s data-access rights.

The result is an end-to-end pipeline that forecasts demand, identifies raw‑material gaps, optimizes logistics, surfaces hidden risks, and lets analysts ask ad‑hoc questions and surface delay warnings.

After all notebooks have been executed (by running notebook 1), the Databricks environment is ready, you can proceed to build the Agent and connect it to Databricks.

## Connect to Databricks MCP servers

Currently, the [MCP spec](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) defines three kinds of servers, based on the transport mechanism they use: 
- stdio servers run as a subprocess of your application. You can think of them as running "locally".
- HTTP over SSE servers run remotely. You connect to them via a URL.
- Streamable HTTP servers run remotely using the Streamable HTTP transport defined in the MCP spec.

[Databricks-hosted MCP endpoints](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/mcp) (vector-search, Unity Catalog functions, Genie) sit behind standard HTTPS URLs and implement the Streamable HTTP transport defined in the MCP spec. Make sure that your workspace is serverless enabled so that you can connect to the Databricks managed MCP. 

## Integrate Databricks MCP servers into an OpenAI Agent 

The OpenAI Agent is available [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/mcp/building-a-supply-chain-copilot-with-agent-sdk-and-databricks-mcp/README.md). Start by installing the required dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need an OpenAI API key to securely access the API. If you're new to the OpenAI API, [sign up for an account](https://platform.openai.com/signup). You can follow [these steps](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries?project_id=proj_2NqyDkmG63zyr3TzOh64F2ac#create-and-export-an-api-key) to create a key and store it in a safe location. 

This cookbook shows how to serve this Agent with FastAPI and chat through a React UI. However, `main.py` is set up as a self‑contained REPL, so after installing the required dependencies and setting up the necessary credentials (including the Databricks host and personal-access token as described above), you can run the Agent directly from the command line with a single command:

```python
python main.py
```

The [main.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/mcp/building-a-supply-chain-copilot-with-agent-sdk-and-databricks-mcp/main.py) file orchestrates the agent logic, using the OpenAI Agent SDK and exposing Databricks MCP vector-search endpoints and Unity Catalog functions as callable tools. It starts by reading environment variables that point to the target catalog, schema, and Unity Catalog (UC) function path, then exposes two tools: vector_search, which queries a Databricks Vector Search index, and uc_function, which executes Unity Catalog functions via MCP. Both tools make authenticated, POST requests through httpx, returning raw JSON from the Databricks REST API. Both helpers obtain the workspace host and Personal Access Token through the _databricks_ctx() utility (backed by DatabricksOAuthClientProvider) and issue authenticated POST requests with httpx, returning raw JSON responses. 

Inside run_agent(), the script instantiates an Agent called “Assistant” that is hard-scoped to supply-chain topics. Every response must invoke one of the two registered tools, and guardrails force the agent to refuse anything outside logistics, inventory, procurement or forecasting. Each user prompt is processed inside an SDK trace context. A simple REPL drives the interaction: user input is wrapped in an OpenTelemetry-style trace, dispatched through Runner.run, and the final answer (or guardrail apology) is printed. The program is kicked off through an asyncio.run call in main(), making the whole flow fully asynchronous and non-blocking.

By confining all token‑handling details to this single module, any future changes to Databricks’ authentication scheme can be accommodated by updating this file.

The main agent hands its draft reply to this checker, which returns a Pydantic object with a Boolean is_supply_chain. If that flag is false, the guardrail raises a tripwire and the caller swaps in a refusal.

## Serve the agent with FastAPI 

To kick off the backend (Fast API), run the following command: 

```python
python -m uvicorn api_server:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000 (for FastAPI docs go to: http://localhost:8000/docs). 

The [api_server.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/mcp/building-a-supply-chain-copilot-with-agent-sdk-and-databricks-mcp/api_server.py) is a FastAPI backend that exposes your agent as a streaming /chat API endpoint. At startup it configures CORS so a local front-end can talk to it, then defines `build_mcp_servers()`, which authenticates to the caller’s Databricks workspace, constructs two HTTP “server tools” (one for vector search, one for Unity-Catalog functions), and pre-connects them for low-latency use. Each incoming POST to /chat contains a single user message. The handler spins up a fresh Agent whose mcp_servers list is populated by those streaming tools and whose model is forced to call a tool for every turn.

The endpoint streams tokens back to the browser while the agent reasons and calls MCP tools.

## Engage users through a React chat UI

In a different terminal, run the following to start the Frontend (React UI):

```python
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

The React chat UI in the [/ui folder](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/mcp/building-a-supply-chain-copilot-with-agent-sdk-and-databricks-mcp/ui) provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the backend agent. It features components for displaying the conversation history and a text input for sending messages. 

When a user submits a message, the UI sends it to the backend /chat endpoint and streams the agent’s response in real time, updating the chat window as new content arrives. The design emphasizes a conversational experience, making it easy for users to ask questions and receive answers from the Databricks-powered agent, all within a responsive and interactive web application.

In particular, the file [ChatUI.jsx](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/mcp/building-a-supply-chain-copilot-with-agent-sdk-and-databricks-mcp/ui/src/components/ChatUI.jsx) file contains the core logic for the chat interface, including how user messages are sent to the backend and how streaming responses from the agent are handled and displayed in real time.

const reader = response.body.getReader();
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  assistantMsg.text += new TextDecoder().decode(value);
  setMessages(m => {
    const copy = [...m];
    copy[copy.length - 1] = { ...assistantMsg };
    return copy;
  });
}
```

The UI streams and displays the agent’s response as it arrives, creating a smooth, real-time chat experience. Highlighting this will clearly show your readers how the UI achieves interactive, conversational feedback from your backend agent.

## Prompt the app

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 and try the following prompts:
- What products are dependent on L6HUK material?
- How much revenue is at risk if we can’t produce the forecasted amount of product autoclave_1?
- Which products have delays right now?
- Are there any delays with syringe_1? 
- What raw materials are required for syringe_1?
- Are there any shortages with one of the following raw materials: O4GRQ, Q5U3A, OAIFB or 58RJD?
- What are the delays associated with wholesaler 9?
The agent will call relevant tools and format a grounded answer for the user. 


## Trace Agent calls in the OpenAI API Dashboard

In the OpenAI API [dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/prompts) you can open the Traces view to see every function the agent invoked. In the example below, the agent first calls raw_from_product to fetch the material linked to a specific product, and then calls revenue_risk to estimate the revenue impact of a shortage.

## Next Steps

* You can consider adding multi-turn capabilities
* You can also add Genie Space MCP servers if you’d like to adapt this setup to your own workspace
