# Hello, world!

We're launching a new home for technical deep dives, notes on releases, and best practices for developers building with OpenAI. A place for our engineers to talk directly to you about our tools and features.

## Introducing the blog

When we ship new models or API features, we often want to highlight a few technical details or provide extra context. Not quite documentation, not quite changelog—think of it as notes from our engineering team. We'll post longer-form articles that help frame our tools and updates as you integrate with them.

We also have developer resources beyond the models and API platform—dashboard features, Codex, etc. We hope our writing here helps you discover these tools and build a strong mental model for using them.

Our first post, beyond this one, goes out today: [developer notes on the Realtime API](developers.openai.com/blog/realtime-api). It highlights a few important technical changes for anyone integrating with the GA Realtime API and new realtime models.

## Who it's for

This blog is for OpenAI developers. Anyone developing with the OpenAI platform—the API, our models, or our other developer tools—is encouraged to follow along.

What would you like us to write more about? What kind of content would help you build on OpenAI? We'd love to hear your ideas. Use the [developer community](https://community.openai.com/) forum or [@OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs) on X to give feedback.

## More to come

Today, we have our first two posts: the one you're currently reading and our [developer notes on the Realtime API](/blog/realtime-api). Check it out, see what you think, and stay tuned for future notes and deep dives.
