# Agent skills in Codex

- Date: 2025-12-19
- Products: Codex

Codex now supports **agent skills**: reusable bundles of instructions (plus optional scripts and resources) that help Codex reliably complete specific tasks.

Skills are available in both the Codex CLI and IDE extensions.

You can invoke a skill explicitly by typing `$skill-name` (for example, `$skill-installer` or the experimental `$create-plan` skill after installing it), or let Codex select a skill automatically based on your prompt.

Learn more in the [skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

#### Folder-based standard (agentskills.io)

Following the open [agent skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), a skill is a folder with a required `SKILL.md` and optional supporting files:

```text
my-skill/
  SKILL.md       # Required: instructions + metadata
  scripts/       # Optional: executable code
  references/    # Optional: documentation
  assets/        # Optional: templates, resources
```

#### Install skills per-user or per-repo

You can install skills for just yourself in `~/.codex/skills`, or for everyone on a project by checking them into `.codex/skills` in the repository.

Codex also ships with a few built-in system skills to get started, including `$skill-creator` and `$skill-installer`. The `$create-plan` skill is experimental and needs to be installed (for example: `$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder`).

#### Curated skills directory

Codex ships with a [small curated set of skills](https://github.com/openai/skills) inspired by popular workflows at OpenAI. Install them with `$skill-installer`, and expect more over time.
