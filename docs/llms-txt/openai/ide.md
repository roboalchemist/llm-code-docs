# Codex IDE extension

Codex is OpenAI's coding agent that can read, edit, and run code. It helps you build faster, squash bugs, and understand unfamiliar code. With the Codex VS Code extension, you can use Codex side by side in your IDE or delegate tasks to Codex Cloud.

ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans include Codex. Learn more about [what's included](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing).

## Extension setup

The Codex IDE extension works with VS Code forks like Cursor and Windsurf.

You can get the Codex extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt), or download it for your IDE:

- [Download for Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/openai.chatgpt)
- [Download for Cursor](cursor:extension/openai.chatgpt)
- [Download for Windsurf](windsurf:extension/openai.chatgpt)
- [Download for Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt)
- [Download for JetBrains IDEs](#jetbrains-ide-integration)

<DocsTip>
  The Codex VS Code extension is available on macOS and Linux. Windows support
  is experimental. For the best Windows experience, use Codex in a WSL workspace
  and follow our <a href="/codex/windows">Windows setup guide</a>.
</DocsTip>

After you install it, you'll find the extension in your left sidebar next to your other extensions.
If you're using VS Code, restart the editor if you don't see Codex right away.

If you're using Cursor, the activity bar displays horizontally by default. Collapsed items can hide Codex, so you can pin it and reorganize the order of the extensions.

## JetBrains IDE integration

If you want to use Codex in JetBrains IDEs like Rider, IntelliJ, PyCharm, or WebStorm, install the JetBrains IDE integration. It supports signing in with ChatGPT, an API key, or a JetBrains AI subscription.

### Move Codex to the right sidebar <a id="right-sidebar"></a>

In VS Code, you can drag the Codex icon to the right of your editor to move it to the right sidebar.

In some IDEs, like Cursor, you may need to temporarily change the activity bar orientation first:

1. Open your editor settings and search for `activity bar` (in Workbench settings).
2. Change the orientation to `vertical`.
3. Restart your editor.

Now drag the Codex icon to the right sidebar (for example, next to your Cursor chat). Codex appears as another tab in the sidebar.

After you move it, reset the activity bar orientation to `horizontal` to restore the default behavior.

### Sign in

After you install the extension, it prompts you to sign in with your ChatGPT account or API key. Your ChatGPT plan includes usage credits, so you can use Codex without extra setup. Learn more on the [pricing page](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing).

### Update the extension

The extension updates automatically, but you can also open the extension page in your IDE to check for updates.

### Set up keyboard shortcuts

Codex includes commands you can bind as keyboard shortcuts in your IDE settings (for example, toggle the Codex chat or add items to the Codex context).

To see all available commands and bind them as keyboard shortcuts, select the settings icon in the Codex chat and select **Keyboard shortcuts**.
You can also refer to the [Codex IDE extension commands](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide/commands) page.
