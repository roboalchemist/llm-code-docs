# GPT Action Library: Getting Started (Weather.gov)

## Introduction

This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information: 
- [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)
- [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)
- [Example of Buliding a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)

This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to a **Weather.gov** weather forecast. This Action takes a user’s question about a location, converts the lat-long into a weather forecast office (WFO), x, and y coordinates, then converts those 3 values into a weather forecast.

Note: When setting up the GPT Action, for authentication, leave it with "None". This is a public API and does not require any Authentication

### Value + Example Business Use Cases

**Value**: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to forecast the weather

**Example Use Cases**: 
- Users can plan out their day based on weather patterns
- Users can quickly visualize (including graphs) what the weather is forecasted to look like

## Application Information

### Application Key Links

## ChatGPT Steps

### Custom GPT Instructions 

Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.

```python
**Context**: A user needs information related to a weather forecast of a specific location.

**Instructions**:
1. The user will provide a lat-long point or a general location or landmark (e.g. New York City, the White House). If the user does not provide one, ask for the relevant location
2. If the user provides a general location or landmark, convert that into a lat-long coordinate. If required, browse the web to look up the lat-long point. 
3. Run the "getPointData" API action and retrieve back the gridId, gridX, and gridY parameters.
4. Apply those variables as the office, gridX, and gridY variables in the "getGridpointForecast" API action to retrieve back a forecast
5. Use that forecast to answer the user's question 

**Additional Notes**: 
- Assume the user uses US weather units (e.g. Farenheit) unless otherwise specified
- If the user says "Let's get started" or "What do I do?", explain the purpose of this Custom GPT
```
