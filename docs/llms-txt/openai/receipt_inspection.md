# Eval-Driven System Design: From Prototype to Production

## Overview

### Purpose of This Cookbook

This cookbook provides a **practical**, end-to-end guide on how to effectively use 
evals as the core process in creating a production-grade autonomous system to 
replace a labor-intensive human workflow. It's a direct product of collaborative 
experience dealing with projects where users may not have started with pristine 
labeled data or a perfect understanding of the problem - two issues that most tutorials gloss 
over but are in practice almost always serious challenges.

Making evals the core process prevents poke-and-hope guesswork and impressionistic
judgments of accuracy, instead demanding engineering rigor. This means we can make
principled decisions about cost trade-offs and investment. 

### Target Audience

This guide is designed for ML/AI engineers and Solution Architects who are
looking for practical guidance beyond introductory tutorials. This notebook is fully
executable and organized to be as modular as possible to support using code
samples directly in your own applications.

### Guiding Narrative: From Tiny Seed to Production System

We'll follow a realistic storyline: replacing a manual receipt-analysis service for validating expenses.

* **Start Small:** Begin with a very small set of labeled data (retail receipts). Many businesses don't have good ground truth data sets. 
* **Build Incrementally:** Develop a minimal viable system and establish initial evals. 
* **Business Alignment:** Evaluate eval performance in the context of business KPIs and
  dollar impact, and target efforts to avoid working on low-impact improvements.
* **Eval-Driven Iteration:** Iteratively improve by using eval scores to power model
  improvements, then by using better models on more data to expand evals and identify more
  areas for improvement.

### How to Use This Cookbook

This cookbook is structured as an eval-centric guide through the lifecycle of building
an LLM application.

1. If you're primarily interested in the ideas presented, read through the text and skim over
   the code.
2. If you're here because of something else you're working on, you can go ahead and jump to that
   section and dig into the code there, copy it, and adapt it to your needs.
3. If you want to really understand how this all works, download this notebook and run
   the cells as you read through it; edit the code to make your own changes, test your
   hypotheses, and make sure you actually understand how it all works together.

> Note: If your OpenAI organization has a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy, Evals will still be available, but will retain data to maintain application state.

## Use Case: Receipt Parsing

In order to condense this guide we'll be using a small hypothetical problem that's still complex
enough to merit detailed and multi-faceted evals. In particular, we'll be focused on how
to solve a problem given a limited amount of data to work with, so we're working with a
dataset that's quite small.

### Problem Definition

For this guide, we assume that we are starting with a workflow for reviewing and filing 
receipts. While in general, this is a problem that already has a lot of established 
solutions, it's analogous to other problems that don't have nearly so much prior work; 
further, even when good enterprise solutions exist there is often still a 
"last mile" problem that still requires human time.

In our case, we'll assume we have a pipeline where:

* People upload photos of receipts
* An accounting team reviews each receipt to categorize and approve or audit the expense

Based on interviews with the accounting team, they make their decisions based on

1. Merchant
2. Geographic location
3. Expense amount
4. Items or services purchased
5. Handwritten notes or annotations

Our system will be expected to handle most receipts without any human intervention, but
escalate low-confidence decisions for human QA. We'll be focused on reducing the total
cost of the accounting process, which is dependent on

1. How much the previous / current system cost to run per-receipt
2. How many receipts the new system sends to QA
3. How much the system costs to run per-receipt, plus any fixed costs
4. What the business impact is of mistakes, either receipts kicked out for review or mistakes missed
5. The cost of engineering to develop and integrate the system

### Dataset Overview

The receipt images come from the CC by 4.0 licensed
[Receipt Handwriting Detection Computer Vision Project](https://universe.roboflow.com/newreceipts/receipt-handwriting-detection)
dataset published by Roboflow. We've added our own labels and narrative spin in order to
tell a story with a small number of examples.

## Project Lifecycle

Not every project will proceed in the same way, but projects generally have some 
important components in common.

![Project Lifecycle](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/partner_project_lifecycle.png)

The solid arrows show the primary progressions or steps, while the dotted line 
represents the ongoing nature of problem understanding - uncovering more about
the customer domain will influence every step of the process. We wil examine 
several of these iterative cycles of refinement in detail below. 
Not every project will proceed in the same way, but projects generally have some common
important components.

### 1. Understand the Problem

Usually, the decision to start an engineering process is made by leadership who
understand the business impact but don't need to know the process details. In our
example, we're building a system designed to replace a non-AI workflow. In a sense this
is ideal: we have a set of domain experts, *the people currently doing the task* who we
can interview to understand the task details and who we can lean upon to help develop
appropriate evals.

This step doesn't end before we start building our system; invariably, our initial
assessments are an incomplete understanding of the problem space and we will continue to
refine our understanding as we get closer to a solution.

### 2. Assemble Examples (Gather Data)

It's very rare for a real-world project to begin with all the data necessary to achieve a satisfactory solution, let alone establish confidence.

In our case, we'll assume we have a decent sample of system *inputs*, in the form of but receipt images, but start without any fully annotated data. We find this is a not-unusual situation when automating an existing process. We'll walk through the process of incrementally expanding our test and training sets in collaboration with domain experts as we go along and make our evals progressively more comprehensive.

### 3. Build an End-to-End V0 System

We want to get the skeleton of a system built as quickly as possible. We don't need a
system that performs well - we just need something that accepts the right inputs and
provides outputs of the correct type. Usually this is almost as simple as describing the
task in a prompt, adding the inputs, and using a single model (usually with structured
outputs) to make an initial best-effort attempt.

### 4. Label Data and Build Initial Evals

We've found that in the absence of an established ground truth, it's not uncommon to 
use an early version of a system to generate 'draft' truth data which can be annotated 
or corrected by domain experts.

Once we have an end-to-end system constructed, we can start processing the inputs we
have to generate plausible outputs. We'll send these to our domain experts to grade 
and correct. We will use these corrections and conversations about how the experts 
are making their decisions to design further evals and to embed expertise in the system.

### 5. Map Evals to Business Metrics

Before we jump into correcting every error, we need to make sure that we're investing
time effectively. The most critical task at this stage is to review our evals and
gain an understanding of how they connect to our key objectives.

- Step back and assess the potential costs and benefits of the system
- Identify which eval measurements speak directly to those costs and benefits
- For example, what does "failure" on a particular eval cost? Are we measuring
  something worthwhile?
- Create a (non-LLM) model that uses eval metrics to provide a dollar value
- Balance performance (accuracy, or speed) with cost to develop and run

### 6. Progressively Improve System and Evals

Having identified which efforts are most worth making, we can begin iterating on 
improvements to the system. The evals act as an objective guide so we know when we've
made the system good enough, and ensure we avoid or identify regression. 

### 7. Integrate QA Process and Ongoing Improvements

Evals aren't just for development. Instrumenting all or a portion of a production
service will surface more useful test and training samples over time, identifying
incorrect assumptions or finding areas with insufficient coverage. This is also the only
way you can ensure that your models continue performing well long after your initial
development process is complete.

## V0 System Construction

In practice, we would probably be building a system that operates via a REST API,
possibly with some web frontend that would have access to some set of components and
resources. For the purposes of this cookbook, we'll distill that down to a pair of
functions, `extract_receipt_details` and `evaluate_receipt_for_audit` that collectively
decide what we should do with a given receipt.

- `extract_receipt_details` will take an image as input and produce structured output
  containing important details about the receipt.
- `evaluate_receipt_for_audit` will take that structure as input and decide whether or
  not the receipt should be audited.

> Breaking up a process into steps like this has both pros and cons; it is easier to
> examine and develop if the process is made up of small isolated steps. But you can
> progressively lose information, effectively letting your agents play "telephone". In
> this notebook we break up the steps and don't let the auditor see the actual receipt
> because it's more instructive for the evals we want to discuss.

We'll start with the first step, the literal data extraction. This is *intermediate*
data: it's information that people would examine implicitly, but often isn't recorded.
And for this reason, we often don't have labeled data to work from.

```python
%pip install --upgrade openai pydantic python-dotenv rich persist-cache -qqq
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv

# Place your API key in a file called .env
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Structured Output Model

Capture the meaningful information in a structured output.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Location(BaseModel):
    city: str | None
    state: str | None
    zipcode: str | None


class LineItem(BaseModel):
    description: str | None
    product_code: str | None
    category: str | None
    item_price: str | None
    sale_price: str | None
    quantity: str | None
    total: str | None


class ReceiptDetails(BaseModel):
    merchant: str | None
    location: Location
    time: str | None
    items: list[LineItem]
    subtotal: str | None
    tax: str | None
    total: str | None
    handwritten_notes: list[str]
```

> *Note*: Normally we would use `decimal.Decimal` objects for the numbers above and `datetime.datetime` objects for `time` field, but neither of those deserialize well. For the purposes of this cookbook, we'll work with strings, but in practice you'd want to have another level of translation to get the correct output validated.

### Basic Info Extraction

Let's build our `extract_receipt_details` function.

Usually, for the very first stab at something that might work, we'll simply feed ChatGPT
the available documents we've assembled so far and ask it to generate a prompt. It's not
worth spending too much time on prompt engineering before you have a benchmark to grade
yourself against! This is a prompt produced by o4-mini based on the problem description
above.

```python
BASIC_PROMPT = """
Given an image of a retail receipt, extract all relevant information and format it as a structured response.

# Task Description

Carefully examine the receipt image and identify the following key information:

1. Merchant name and any relevant store identification
2. Location information (city, state, ZIP code)
3. Date and time of purchase
4. All purchased items with their:
   * Item description/name
   * Item code/SKU (if present)
   * Category (infer from context if not explicit)
   * Regular price per item (if available)
   * Sale price per item (if discounted)
   * Quantity purchased
   * Total price for the line item
5. Financial summary:
   * Subtotal before tax
   * Tax amount
   * Final total
6. Any handwritten notes or annotations on the receipt (list each separately)

## Important Guidelines

* If information is unclear or missing, return null for that field
* Format dates as ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
* Format all monetary values as decimal numbers
* Distinguish between printed text and handwritten notes
* Be precise with amounts and totals
* For ambiguous items, use your best judgment based on context

Your response should be structured and complete, capturing all available information
from the receipt.
"""
```

### Test on one receipt

Let's evaluate just a single receipt and review it manually to see how well a smart model with a naive prompt can do.

<img src="https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/Supplies_20240322_220858_Raven_Scan_3_jpeg.rf.50852940734939c8838819d7795e1756.jpg" alt="Walmart_image" width="400"/>

```python
from rich import print

receipt_image_dir = Path("data/test")
ground_truth_dir = Path("data/ground_truth")

example_receipt = Path(
    "data/train/Supplies_20240322_220858_Raven_Scan_3_jpeg.rf.50852940734939c8838819d7795e1756.jpg"
)
result = await extract_receipt_details(example_receipt)
```

We'll get different answers if we re-run it, but it usually gets most things correct
with a few errors. Here's a specific example:

```python
walmart_receipt = ReceiptDetails(
    merchant="Walmart",
    location=Location(city="Vista", state="CA", zipcode="92083"),
    time="2023-06-30T16:40:45",
    items=[
        LineItem(
            description="SPRAY 90",
            product_code="001920056201",
            category=None,
            item_price=None,
            sale_price=None,
            quantity="2",
            total="28.28",
        ),
        LineItem(
            description="LINT ROLLER 70",
            product_code="007098200355",
            category=None,
            item_price=None,
            sale_price=None,
            quantity="1",
            total="6.67",
        ),
        LineItem(
            description="SCRUBBER",
            product_code="003444193232",
            category=None,
            item_price=None,
            sale_price=None,
            quantity="2",
            total="12.70",
        ),
        LineItem(
            description="FLOUR SACK 10",
            product_code="003444194263",
            category=None,
            item_price=None,
            sale_price=None,
            quantity="1",
            total="0.77",
        ),
    ],
    subtotal="50.77",
    tax="4.19",
    total="54.96",
    handwritten_notes=[],
)
```

The model extracted a lot of things correctly, but renamed some of the line
items - incorrectly, in fact. More importantly, it got some of the prices wrong, and it
decided not to categorize any of the line items.

That's okay, we don't expect to have perfect answers at this point! Instead, our
objective is to build a basic system we can evaluate. Then, when we start iterating, we
won't be 'vibing' our way to something that *looks* better -- we'll be engineering a
reliable solution. But first, we'll add an action decision to complete our draft system.

### Action Decision

Next, we need to close the loop and get to an actual decision based on receipts. This
looks pretty similar, so we'll present the code without comment.

Ordinarily one would start with the most capable model - `o3`, at this time - for a 
first pass, and then once correctness is established experiment with different models
to analyze any tradeoffs for their business impact, and potentially consider whether 
they are remediable with iteration. A client may be willing to take a certain accuracy 
hit for lower latency or cost, or it may be more effective to change the architecture
to hit cost, latency, and accuracy goals. We'll get into how to make these tradeoffs
explicitly and objectively later on. 

For this cookbook, `o3` might be too good. We'll use `o4-mini` for our first pass, so 
that we get a few reasoning errors we can use to illustrate the means of addressing
them when they occur.

Next, we need to close the loop and get to an actual decision based on receipts. This
looks pretty similar, so we'll present the code without comment.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

audit_prompt = """
Evaluate this receipt data to determine if it need to be audited based on the following
criteria:

1. NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED:
   - IMPORTANT: For this criterion, travel-related expenses include but are not limited
   to: gas, hotel, airfare, or car rental.
   - If the receipt IS for a travel-related expense, set this to FALSE.
   - If the receipt is NOT for a travel-related expense (like office supplies), set this
   to TRUE.
   - In other words, if the receipt shows FUEL/GAS, this would be FALSE because gas IS
   travel-related.

2. AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: The total amount exceeds $50

3. MATH_ERROR: The math for computing the total doesn't add up (line items don't sum to
   total)

4. HANDWRITTEN_X: There is an "X" in the handwritten notes

For each criterion, determine if it is violated (true) or not (false). Provide your
reasoning for each decision, and make a final determination on whether the receipt needs
auditing. A receipt needs auditing if ANY of the criteria are violated.

Return a structured response with your evaluation.
"""


class AuditDecision(BaseModel):
    not_travel_related: bool = Field(
        description="True if the receipt is not travel-related"
    )
    amount_over_limit: bool = Field(description="True if the total amount exceeds $50")
    math_error: bool = Field(description="True if there are math errors in the receipt")
    handwritten_x: bool = Field(
        description="True if there is an 'X' in the handwritten notes"
    )
    reasoning: str = Field(description="Explanation for the audit decision")
    needs_audit: bool = Field(
        description="Final determination if receipt needs auditing"
    )


async def evaluate_receipt_for_audit(
    receipt_details: ReceiptDetails, model: str = "o4-mini"
) -> AuditDecision:
    """Determine if a receipt needs to be audited based on defined criteria."""
    # Convert receipt details to JSON for the prompt
    receipt_json = receipt_details.model_dump_json(indent=2)

    response = await client.responses.parse(
        model=model,
        input=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "input_text", "text": audit_prompt},
                    {"type": "input_text", "text": f"Receipt details:\n{receipt_json}"},
                ],
            }
        ],
        text_format=AuditDecision,
    )

    return response.output_parsed
```

A schematic of the overall process shows two LLM calls:

![Process Flowchart](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/partner_process_flowchart.png)

If we run our above example through this model, here's what we get -- again, we'll use 
an example result here. When you run the code you might get slightly different results.

```python
audit_decision = await evaluate_receipt_for_audit(result)
print(audit_decision)
```

```python
audit_decision = AuditDecision(
    not_travel_related=True,
    amount_over_limit=True,
    math_error=False,
    handwritten_x=False,
    reasoning="""
    The receipt from Walmart is for office supplies, which are not travel-related, thus NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED is TRUE.
    The total amount of the receipt is $54.96, which exceeds the limit of $50, making AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT TRUE.
    The subtotal ($50.77) plus tax ($4.19) correctly sums to the total ($54.96), so there is no MATH_ERROR.
    There are no handwritten notes, so HANDWRITTEN_X is FALSE.
    Since two criteria (amount over limit and travel-related) are violated, the receipt
    needs auditing.
    """,
    needs_audit=True,
)
```

This example illustrates why we care about end-to-end evals and why we can't use them in
isolation. Here, the initial extraction had OCR errors and forwarded the prices to the
auditor that don't add up to the total, but the auditor fails to detect it and asserts
there are no math errors. However, missing this doesn't change the audit decision
because it did pick up on the other two reasons the receipt needs to be audited.

Thus, `AuditDecision` is factually incorrect, but the decision that we care about
is correct. This gives us an edge to improve upon, but also guides us toward making
sound choices for where and when we apply our engineering efforts.

With that said, let's build ourselves some evals!

## Initial Evals

Once we have a minimally functional system we should process more inputs and get domain
experts to help develop ground-truth data. Domain experts doing expert tasks may not
have much time to devote to our project, so we want to be efficient and start small,
aiming for breadth rather than depth at first.

> If your data *doesn't* require domain expertise, then you'd want to reach for a
> labeling solution (such as [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)) and attempt to annotate
> as much data as you can given the policy, budget, and data availability restrictions.
> In this case, we're going to proceed as if data labeling is a scarce resource; one we
> can rely on for small amounts each week, but these are people with other job
> responsibilities whose time and willingness to help may be limited. Sitting with these
> experts to help annotate examples can help make selecting future examples more
> efficient.

Because we have a chain of two steps, we'll be collecting tuples of type
`[FilePath, ReceiptDetails, AuditDecision]`. Generally, the way to do this is to take
unlabeled samples, run them through our model, and then have experts correct the output.
For the purposes of this notebook, we've already gone through that process for all the
receipt images in `data/test`.

### Additional Considerations

There's a little more to it than that though, because when you are evaluating a
multistep process it's important to know both the end to end performance and the
performance of each individual step, *conditioned on the output of the prior step*.

In this case, we want to evaluate:

1. Given an input image, how well do we extract the information we need?
2. Given receipt information, how good is our **judgement** for our audit decision?
3. Given an input image, how **successful** are we about making our final audit decision?

The phrasing difference between #2 and #3 is because if we give our auditor incorrect
data, we expect it to come to incorrect conclusions. What we *want* is to be confident
that the auditor is making the correct decision based on the evidence available, even if
that evidence is misleading. If we don't pay attention to that case, we can end up
training the auditor to ignore its inputs and cause our overall performance to degrade.

### Graders

The core component of an eval is the
[grader](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/graders). Our eventual eval is going to
use 18 of them, but we only use three kinds, and they're all quite conceptually
straightforward.

Here are examples of one of our string check graders, one of our text similarity
graders, and finally one of our model graders.

```python
example_graders = [
    {
        "name": "Total Amount Accuracy",
        "type": "string_check",
        "operation": "eq",
        "input": "{{ item.predicted_receipt_details.total }}",
        "reference": "{{ item.correct_receipt_details.total }}",
    },
    {
        "name": "Merchant Name Accuracy",
        "type": "text_similarity",
        "input": "{{ item.predicted_receipt_details.merchant }}",
        "reference": "{{ item.correct_receipt_details.merchant }}",
        "pass_threshold": 0.8,
        "evaluation_metric": "bleu",
    },
]

# A model grader needs a prompt to instruct it in what it should be scoring.
missed_items_grader_prompt = """
Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a receipt extraction model.

The following items are the actual (correct) line items from a specific receipt.

{{ item.correct_receipt_details.items }}

The following items are the line items extracted by the model.

{{ item.predicted_receipt_details.items }}

Score 0 if the sample evaluation missed any items from the receipt; otherwise score 1.

The line items are permitted to have small differences or extraction mistakes, but each
item from the actual receipt must be present in some form in the model's output. Only
evaluate whether there are MISSED items; ignore other mistakes or extra items.
"""

example_graders.append(
    {
        "name": "Missed Line Items",
        "type": "score_model",
        "model": "o4-mini",
        "input": [{"role": "system", "content": missed_items_grader_prompt}],
        "range": [0, 1],
        "pass_threshold": 1,
    }
)
```

Each grader evaluates some portion of a predicted output. This might be a very narrow
check for a specific field in a structured output, or a more holistic check that
judges an output in its entirety. Some graders can work without context, and evaluate an
output in isolation (for example, an LLM judge that is evaluating if a paragraph is rude
or inappropriate). Others can evaluate based on the input and output, while while the
ones we're using here rely on an output and a ground-truth (correct) output to compare
against.

The most direct way of using Evals provides a prompt and a model, and lets the eval run
on an input to generate output itself. Another useful method uses previously logged
responses or completions as the source of the outputs. It's not quite as simple, but the
most flexible thing we can do is to supply an item containing everything we want it to
use—this allows us to have the "prediction" function be an arbitrary system rather than
restricting it to a single model call. This is how we're using it in the examples below;
the `EvaluationRecord` shown below will be used to populate the `{{ }}` template
variables.

> **Note on Model Selection:**  
> Selecting the right model is crucial. While faster, less expensive models are often preferable in production, development workflows benefit from prioritizing the most capable models available. For this guide, we use `o4-mini` for both system tasks and LLM-based grading—while `o3` is more capable, our experience suggests the difference in output quality is modest relative to the substantial increase in cost. In practice, spending $10+/day/engineer on evals is typical, but scaling to $100+/day/engineer may not be sustainable.
>
> Nonetheless, it's valuable to periodically benchmark with a more advanced model like `o3`. If you observe significant improvements, consider incorporating it for a representative subset of your evaluation data. Discrepancies between models can reveal important edge cases and guide system improvements.

    correct_audit = AuditDecision.model_validate_json(audit_path.read_text())
    predicted_audit = await evaluate_receipt_for_audit(predicted_details, model)

    return EvaluationRecord(
        receipt_image_path=image_path.name,
        correct_receipt_details=correct_details,

) -> list[dict]:
    # Assemble paired samples of ground truth data and predicted results. You could
    # instead upload this data as a file and pass a file id when you run the eval.
    tasks = [

    ]
    return [{"item": record.model_dump()} for record in await asyncio.gather(*tasks)]


file_content = await create_dataset_content(receipt_image_dir)
```

Once we have the graders and the data, creating and running our evals is very straightforward:

```python
from persist_cache import cache


# We're caching the output so that if we re-run this cell we don't create a new eval.
@cache
async def create_eval(name: str, graders: list[dict]):
    eval_cfg = await client.evals.create(
        name=name,
        data_source_config={
            "type": "custom",
            "item_schema": EvaluationRecord.model_json_schema(),
            "include_sample_schema": False,  # Don't generate new completions.
        },
        testing_criteria=graders,
    )
    print(f"Created new eval: {eval_cfg.id}")
    return eval_cfg


initial_eval = await create_eval(
    "Initial Receipt Processing Evaluation", example_graders
)

# Run the eval.
eval_run = await client.evals.runs.create(
    name="initial-receipt-processing-run",
    eval_id=initial_eval.id,
    data_source={
        "type": "jsonl",
        "source": {"type": "file_content", "content": file_content},
    },
)
print(f"Evaluation run created: {eval_run.id}")
print(f"View results at: {eval_run.report_url}")
```

After you run that eval you'll be able to view it in the UI, and should see something
like the below.

## Connecting Evals to Business Metrics

Evals show you where you can improve, and help track progress and regressions over time.
But the three evals above are just measurements — we need to imbue them with raison
d'être.

The first thing we need is to add evaluations for the final stage of our receipt
processing, so that we can start seeing the results of our audit decisions. The next
thing we need, the most important, is a *model of business relevance*.

### A Business Model

It's almost never easy to work out what costs and benefits you could get out of a new
system depending on how well it performs. Often people will avoid trying to put
numbers to things because they know how much uncertainty there is and they don't want to
make guesses that make them look bad. That's okay; we just have to make our best guess,
and if we get more information later we can refine our model.

For this cookbook, we're going to create a simple cost structure:

- our company processes 1 million receipts a year, at a baseline cost of $0.20 /
  receipt
- auditing a receipt costs about $2
- failing to audit a receipt we should have audited costs an average of $30
- 5% of receipts need to be audited
- the existing process
  - identifies receipts that need to be audited 97% of the time
  - misidentifies receipts that don't need to be audited 2% of the time

This gives us two baseline comparisons:

- if we identified every receipt correctly, we would spend $100,000 on audits
- our current process spends $135,000 on audits and loses $45,000 to un-audited expenses

On top of that, the human-driven process costs an additional $200,000.

We're expecting our service to save money by costing less to run (≈1¢/receipt if we use
the prompts from above with `o4-mini`), but whether we save or lose money on audits and
missed audits depends on how well our system performs. It might be worth writing this as
a simple function — written below is a version that includes the above factors but
neglects nuance and ignores development, maintenance, and serving costs.


```python
def calculate_costs(fp_rate: float, fn_rate: float, per_receipt_cost: float):
    audit_cost = 2
    missed_audit_cost = 30
    receipt_count = 1e6
    audit_fraction = 0.05

    needs_audit_count = receipt_count * audit_fraction
    no_needs_audit_count = receipt_count - needs_audit_count

    missed_audits = needs_audit_count * fn_rate
    total_audits = needs_audit_count * (1 - fn_rate) + no_needs_audit_count * fp_rate

    audit_cost = total_audits * audit_cost
    missed_audit_cost = missed_audits * missed_audit_cost
    processing_cost = receipt_count * per_receipt_cost

    return audit_cost + missed_audit_cost + processing_cost


perfect_system_cost = calculate_costs(0, 0, 0)
current_system_cost = calculate_costs(0.02, 0.03, 0.20)

print(f"Current system cost: ${current_system_cost:,.0f}")
```


### Connecting Back To Evals

The point of the above model is it lets us apply meaning to an eval that would
otherwise just be a number. For instance, when we ran the system above we were wrong 85%
of the time for merchant names. But digging in, it seems like most instances are
capitalization issues or "Shell Gasoline" vs. "Shell Oil #2144" — problems that when
we follow through, do not appear to affect our audit decision or change our fundamental
costs.

On the other hand, it seems like we fail to catch handwritten "X"s on receipts about
half the time, and about half of the time when there's an "X" on a receipt that gets
missed, it results in a receipt not getting audited when it should. Those are
overrepresented in our dataset, but if that makes up even 1% of receipts, that 50%
failure would cost us $75,000 a year.

Similarly, it seems like we have OCR errors that cause us to audit receipts quite often
on account of the math not working out, up to 20% of the time. This could cost us almost
$400,000!

Now, we're in a place to add more graders and start working backwards from the audit
decision accuracy to determine which problems we should focus on.

Below are the rest of our graders and the results we get with our initial un-optimized
prompts. Note that at this point we do quite badly! Across our 20 samples (8 positive,
12 negative), we had two false negatives and two false positives. If we extrapolated to
our entire business, we'd be losing $375,000 on audits we missed and $475,000 on
unnecessary audits.

## Spin Up the Flywheel

Having our business model means we have a map of what's worth doing and what isn't. Our
initial evals are a road sign that lets us know we're moving in the right direction; but
eventually we'll need more signage. At this point in the process we usually have a lot
of different things we can work on, with a few linked cycles where improvement on one
will open up more room for improvement on a different cycle.

![Development Flywheel](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/partner_development_flywheel.png)

1. Our evals show us where we can improve, and we can immediately use them to guide us
   in model selection, prompt engineering, tool use, and fine-tuning strategies.
2. We're not done once system performs well according to our evals. That's when it's
   time to *improve our evals*. We will process more data, give it to our domain experts
   to review, and feed the corrections into building better, more comprehensive evals.

This cycle can go on for a while. We can speed it along by identifying the efficient
frontier of "interesting" data to examine. There are a few techniques for this, but an
easy one is re-running models on inputs to prioritize labeling inputs that don't
get consistent answers. This works especially well when using different underlying
models, and often even benefits from using less-intelligent models (if a dumb model
agrees with a smart model then it's probably not a hard problem).

Once it seems like we've hit a point of dimishing returns on performance, we can keep
using the same techniques to optimize model cost; if we have a system that performs
quite well, then fine-tuning or some form of model distillation will probably allow us
to get similar performance from smaller, cheaper, faster models.

## System Improvements

With our evals in place and an understanding of how they connect to our business metrics,
we're finally ready to turn our attention to improving the output of our system.

Above, we noted that we get merchant names wrong 85% of the time, more than any other
output we're evaluating. This looks pretty bad, and it's probably something we can
improve dramaticaly with only a little work, but instead let's start from the endpoint
of our business metrics and work backwards to see what issues caused incorrect
decisions.

When we do that, we see that the mistakes we made on merchant names are completely
uncorrelated with our final audit decision, and there's no evidence that they have any
impact on that decision. Based on our business model, we don't actually see a need to
improve it -- in other words, *not all evals matter*. Instead, we can examine
specifically the examples where we made a bad audit decision. There are only two of them
(out of 20). Examining them closely, we observe that in both cases the problem came from
the second stage of the pipeline making a wrong decision based on a non-problematic
extraction. And in fact, both of them come from a failure to reason correctly about
travel-related expenses.

In the first case, the purchase is a snowbroom from an auto-parts store. This is a
little bit of an edge case, but our domain experts identified this as a valid travel
expense (because drivers might need one to clear their windshield). This seems like
explaining the decision process in more detail and providing an analogous example would
correct the error.

In the second case, the purchase is some tools from a home improvement score. The tools
don't have anything to do with normal driving, so this receipt should be audited as a
"non-travel-related expense". In this case our model *correctly* identifies it as an
expense that's not travel-related, but then reasons incorrectly about that fact,
apparently misunderstanding that `true` for `not_travel_related` should imply `true` for
`needs_audit`. Again, this seems like an example where more clarity in our instructions
and a few examples should fix the issue.

Connecting this back to our cost model, we note that we have 1 false negative and 1
false positive, along with 7 true positives and 11 true negatives. Extrapolating this to
the frequencies we see in production, this would increase our overall costs by $63,000
per year.

Let's modify the prompt and re-run our evals to see how we do. We'll provide more
guidance in the form of a specific example in the instructions about engine oil
(different from a snow broom, but requires the same reasoning), and we'll include three
examples pulled from our training set (`data/train`) as few-shot guidance.

Evaluate this receipt data to determine if it need to be audited based on the following
criteria:

1. NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED:
   - IMPORTANT: For this criterion, travel-related expenses include but are not limited
   to: gas, hotel, airfare, or car rental.
   - If the receipt IS for a travel-related expense, set this to FALSE.
   - If the receipt is NOT for a travel-related expense (like office supplies), set this
   to TRUE.
   - In other words, if the receipt shows FUEL/GAS, this would be FALSE because gas IS
   travel-related.
   - Travel-related expenses include anything that could be reasonably required for
   business-related travel activities. For instance, an employee using a personal
   vehicle might need to change their oil; if the receipt is for an oil change or the
   purchase of oil from an auto parts store, this would be acceptable and counts as a
   travel-related expense.

2. AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: The total amount exceeds $50

3. MATH_ERROR: The math for computing the total doesn't add up (line items don't sum to
   total)
   - Add up the price and quantity of each line item to get the subtotal
   - Add tax to the subtotal to get the total
   - If the total doesn't match the amount on the receipt, this is a math error
   - If the total is off by no more than $0.01, this is NOT a math error

4. HANDWRITTEN_X: There is an "X" in the handwritten notes

For each criterion, determine if it is violated (true) or not (false). Provide your
reasoning for each decision, and make a final determination on whether the receipt needs
auditing. A receipt needs auditing if ANY of the criteria are violated.

Note that violation of a criterion means that it is `true`. If any of the above four
values are `true`, then the receipt needs auditing (`needs_audit` should be `true`: it
functions as a boolean OR over all four criteria).

If the receipt contains non-travel expenses, then NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED should be `true`
and therefore NEEDS_AUDIT must also be set to `true`. IF THE RECEIPT LISTS ITEMS THAT
ARE NOT TRAVEL-RELATED, THEN IT MUST BE AUDITED. Here are some example inputs to
demonstrate how you should act:

The modifications we made to the prompt above are:

1. Under item 1 concerning travel-related expenses, we added a bullet point

```
- Travel-related expenses include anything that could be reasonably required for
  business-related travel activities. For instance, an employee using a personal
  vehicle might need to change their oil; if the receipt is for an oil change or the
  purchase of oil from an auto parts store, this would be acceptable and counts as a
  travel-related expense.
```

2. We added more proscriptive guidance on how to evaluate for a math error.
   Specifically, we added the bullet points:

```
   - Add up the price and quantity of each line item to get the subtotal
   - Add tax to the subtotal to get the total
   - If the total doesn't match the amount on the receipt, this is a math error
   - If the total is off by no more than $0.01, this is NOT a math error
```

   This doesn't actually have to do with the issues we mentioned, but is another issue
   we noticed as a flaw in the reasoning provided by the audit model.

3. We added very strong guidance (we actually needed to state it and restate it
   emphatically) to say that non-travel-related expenses should be audited.

```
Note that violation of a criterion means that it is `true`. If any of the above four
values are `true`, then the receipt needs auditing (`needs_audit` should be `true`: it
functions as a boolean OR over all four criteria).

If the receipt contains non-travel expenses, then NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED should be `true`
and therefore NEEDS_AUDIT must also be set to `true`. IF THE RECEIPT LISTS ITEMS THAT
ARE NOT TRAVEL-RELATED, THEN IT MUST BE AUDITED.
```

4. We added three examples, JSON input/output pairs wrapped in XML tags.
3. We added three examples, JSON input/output pairs wrapped in XML tags.

With our prompt revisions, we'll regenerate the data to evaluate and re-run the same
eval to compare our results:

```python
file_content = await create_dataset_content(receipt_image_dir)

eval_run = await client.evals.runs.create(
    name="updated-receipt-processing-run",
    eval_id=full_eval.id,
    data_source={
        "type": "jsonl",
        "source": {"type": "file_content", "content": file_content},
    },
)

eval_run.report_url
```

When we ran the eval again, we actually still got two audit decisions wrong. Digging into
the examples we made a mistake on, it turns out that we completely fixed the issues we
identified, but our examples improved the reasoning step and caused two other issues to
surface. Specifically:

1. One receipt needed to be audited only because there was a mistake in extraction and
   a handwritten "X" wasn't identified. The audit model reasoned correctly, but based on
   incorrect data.
2. One receipt was extracted in such a way that a $0.35 debit fee wasn't visible, so the
   audit model identified a math error. This almost certainly happened because we
   provided it with more detailed instructions and clear examples that demonstrated it
   needed to actually add up all the line items in order to decide whether there was a
   math error. Again, this demonstrates correct behavior on the part of the audit model
   and suggests we need to correct the extraction model.

This is great, and we'll continue iterating on issues as we uncover them. This is the
cycle of improvement!

### Model Choice

When beginning a project, we usually start with one of the most capable models available, such as `o4-mini`, to establish a performance baseline. Once we’re confident in the model’s ability to solve the task, the next step is to explore smaller, faster, or more cost-effective alternatives.

Optimizing for inference cost and latency is essential, especially for production or customer-facing systems, where these factors can significantly impact overall expenses and user experience. For instance, switching from `o4-mini` to `gpt-4.1-mini` could reduce inference costs by nearly two-thirds—an example where thoughtful model selection leads to meaningful savings.

In the next section, we’ll rerun our evaluations using `gpt-4.1-mini` for both extraction and audit steps to see how well a more efficient model performs.

```python
file_content = await create_dataset_content(receipt_image_dir, model="gpt-4.1-mini")

eval_run = await client.evals.runs.create(
    name="receipt-processing-run-gpt-4-1-mini",
    eval_id=full_eval.id,
    data_source={
        "type": "jsonl",
        "source": {"type": "file_content", "content": file_content},
    },
)

eval_run.report_url
```

The results are pretty promising. It doesn't look like the extraction accuracy suffered
at all. We see one regression (the snowbroom again), but our audit decision is correct
twice as often as it was before our prompt changes.

![Eval Variations](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/partner_eval_variations.png)

This is great evidence that we'll be able to switch to a cheaper model, but it might
require more prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or some form of model-distillation. Note
however that according to our current model this would already be saving us money. We
don't quite believe that yet because we don't have a large enough sample — our real
false negative rate will be more than the 0 we see here.

```python
system_cost_4_1_mini = calculate_costs(
    fp_rate=1 / 12, fn_rate=0, per_receipt_cost=0.003
)

print(f"Cost using gpt-4.1-mini: ${system_cost_4_1_mini:,.0f}")
```


### Further improvements

This cookbook focuses on the philosophy and practicalities of evals, not the full range of model improvement techniques. For boosting or maintaining model performance (especially when moving to smaller, faster, or cheaper models), consider these steps in order—start from the top, and only proceed down if needed. For example, always optimize your prompt before resorting to fine-tuning; fine-tuning on a weak prompt can lock in bad performance even if you improve the prompt later.

![Model Improvement Waterfall](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/assets/images/partner_model_improvement_waterfall.png)

1. **Model selection:** try smarter models, or increase their reasoning budget.
2. **Prompt tuning:** clarify instructions and provide very explicit rules.
3. **Examples and context:** add few- or many-shot examples, or more context for the
   problem. RAG fits in here, and may be used to dynamically select similar examples.
4. **Tools use:** provide tools to solve specific problems, including access to external
   APIs, the ability to query databases, or otherwise enable the model to have its own
   questions answered.
5. **Accessory models:** add models to perform limited sub-tasks, to supervise and provide
   guardrails, or use a mixture of experts and aggregate solutions from multiple
   sub-models.
6. **Fine-tuning:** use labeled training data for supervised fine tuning, eval
   graders for reinforcement fine tuning, or different outputs for direct preference
   optimization.

The above options are all tools to maximize performance. Once you're trying to optimize
for a price:performance ratio, you'll usually have already done all of the above and
likely don't need to repeat most steps, but you can still fine-tune smaller models or
use your best model to train a smaller model (model distillation).

> One really excellent thing about OpenAI Evals is that you can use the same graders for
> [Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reinforcement_fine_tuning)
> to produce better model performance in an extremely sample-efficient manner. One note
> of caution is to make sure that you use separate training data and don't leak your
> eval datasets during RFT.

## Deploying and Post-Development
Building and deploying an LLM application is just the beginning—the real value comes from ongoing improvement. Once your system is live, prioritize continuous monitoring: log traces, track outputs, and proactively sample real user interactions for human review using smart sampling techniques.

Production data is your most authentic source for evolving your evaluation and training datasets. Regularly collect and curate fresh samples from actual use cases to identify gaps, edge cases, and new opportunities for enhancement.

In practice, leverage this data for rapid iteration. Automate periodic fine-tuning pipelines that retrain your models on recent, high-quality samples and automatically deploy new versions when they outperform existing ones in your evals. Capture user corrections and feedback, then systematically feed these insights back into your prompts or retraining process—especially when they highlight persistent issues.

By embedding these feedback loops into your post-development workflow, you ensure your LLM applications continuously adapt, stay robust, and remain closely aligned with user needs as they evolve.
