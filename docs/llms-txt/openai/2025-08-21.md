You can now attach images to your prompts in Codex web. This is great for asking Codex to implement frontend changes or follow up on whiteboarding sessions.

#### Container caching

![](https://developers.openai.com/images/codex/changelog/container_caching.png)

Codex now caches containers to start new tasks and followups 90% faster, dropping the median start time from 48 seconds to 5 seconds. You can optionally configure a maintenance script to update the environment from its cached state to prepare for new tasks. See the docs for more.

#### Automatic environment setup

Now, environments without manual setup scripts automatically run the standard installation commands for common package managers like yarn, pnpm, npm, go mod, gradle, pip, poetry, uv, and cargo. This reduces test failures for new environments by 40%.
