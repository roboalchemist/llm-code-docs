# Web search is now enabled by default

- Date: 2026-01-28
- Products: Codex

Codex now enables web search for local tasks in the Codex CLI and IDE Extension.
By default, Codex uses a web search cache, which is an OpenAI-maintained index of web results. Cached mode returns pre-indexed results instead of fetching live pages, while live mode fetches the most recent data from the web. If you are using `--yolo` or another [full access sandbox setting](https://developers.openai.com/codex/security), web search defaults to live results. To disable this behavior or switch modes, use the `web_search` configuration option:

- `web_search = "cached"` (default; serves results from the web search cache)
- `web_search = "live"` (fetches the most recent data from the web; same as `--search`)
- `web_search = "disabled"` to remove the tool
