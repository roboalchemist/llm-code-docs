## Frequently asked questions

### What are the usage limits for my plan?

The number of Codex messages you can send depends on the size and complexity of your coding tasks and whether you run them locally or in the cloud. Small scripts or simple functions may consume only a fraction of your allowance, while larger codebases, long-running tasks, or extended sessions that require Codex to hold more context will use significantly more per message.

<a id="shared-limits" class="footnote">
  *The usage limits for local messages and cloud tasks share a **five-hour

</a>

Enterprise and Edu plans without flexible pricing have the same per-seat usage limits as Plus for most features.

GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini can be used for local tasks, providing up to 4x more usage.

### What happens when you hit usage limits?

ChatGPT Plus and Pro users who reach their usage limit can purchase additional credits to continue working without needing to upgrade their existing plan.

Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans with [flexible pricing](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-the-enterprise-edu-and-business-plans) can purchase additional workspace credits to continue using Codex.

If you are approaching usage limits, you can also switch to the GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini model to make your usage limits last longer.

All users may also run extra local tasks using an API key, with usage charged at [standard API rates](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

### Where can I see my current usage limits?

You can find your current limits in the [Codex usage dashboard](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/usage). If you want to see your remaining limits during an active Codex CLI session, you can use `/status`.

### How do credits work?

Credits let you continue using Codex after you reach your included usage limits. Usage draws down from your available credits based on the models and features you use, allowing you to extend work without interruption.

Credit cost per message varies based on task size, complexity, and the reasoning required. The table shows average credit costs; these averages also apply to legacy GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex, and GPT-5-Codex-Mini. Average rates may evolve over time as new capabilities are introduced.

### What counts as Code Review usage?

Code Review usage applies only when Codex runs reviews through GitHub — for example, when you tag `@Codex` for review in a pull request or enable automatic reviews on your repository. Reviews run locally or outside of GitHub count toward your general usage limits.

### What can I do to make my usage limits last longer?

The usage limits and credits above are average rates. You can try the following tips to maximize your limits:

- **Control the size of your prompts.** Be precise with the instructions you give Codex, but remove unnecessary context.
- **Reduce the size of your AGENTS.md.** If you work on a larger project, you can control how much context you inject through AGENTS.md files by [nesting them within your repository](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md#layer-project-instructions).
- **Limit the number of MCP servers you use.** Every [MCP](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) you add to Codex adds more context to your messages and uses more of your limit. Disable MCP servers when you don’t need them.
- **Switch to GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini for simple tasks.** Using the mini model should extend your usage limits by roughly 4x.
