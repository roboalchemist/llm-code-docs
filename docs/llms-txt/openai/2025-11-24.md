# Usage and credits fixes

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Products: Codex

Minor updates to address a few issues with Codex usage and credits:

- Adjusted all usage dashboards to show "limits remaining" for consistency. The CLI previously displayed "limits used."
- Fixed an issue preventing users from buying credits if their ChatGPT subscription was purchased via iOS or Google Play.
- Fixed an issue where the CLI could display stale usage information; it now refreshes without needing to send a message first.
- Optimized the backend to help smooth out usage throughout the day, irrespective of overall Codex load or how traffic is routed. Before, users could get unlucky and hit a few cache misses in a row, leading to much less usage.
