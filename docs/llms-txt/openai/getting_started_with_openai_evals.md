# Getting Started with OpenAI Evals

**Note: OpenAI now has a hosted evals product with an API! We recommend you use this instead.
See [Evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)**

The [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals/tree/main) framework consists of
1. A framework to evaluate an LLM (large language model) or a system built on top of an LLM.
2. An open-source registry of challenging evals

This notebook will cover:
* Introduction to Evaluation and the [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals/tree/main) library
* Building an Eval
* Running an Eval

#### What are evaluations/ `evals`?

Evaluation is the process of validating and testing the outputs that your LLM applications are producing. Having strong evaluations ("evals") will mean a more stable, reliable application that is resilient to code and model changes. An eval is a task used to measure the quality of the output of an LLM or LLM system. Given an input prompt, an output is generated. We evaluate this output with a set of ideal answers and find the quality of the LLM system.

#### Importance of Evaluations

If you are building with foundational models like `GPT-4`, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Developing AI solutions involves an iterative design process. [Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand](https://youtu.be/XGJNo8TpuVA?feature=shared&t=1089) how different model versions and prompts might affect your use case.

With OpenAI’s [continuous model upgrades](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/continuous-model-upgrades), evals allow you to efficiently test model performance for your use cases in a standardized way. Developing a suite of evals customized to your objectives will help you quickly and effectively understand how new models may perform for your use cases. You can also make evals a part of your CI/CD pipeline to make sure you achieve the desired accuracy before deploying.

#### Types of evals

There are two main ways we can evaluate/grade completions: writing some validation logic in code
or using the model itself to inspect the answer. We’ll introduce each with some examples.

**Writing logic for answer checking**

The simplest and most common type of eval has an input and an ideal response or answer. For example,
we can have an eval sample where the input is "What year was Obama elected president for the first
time?" and the ideal answer is "2008". We feed the input to a model and get the completion. If the model
says "2008", it is then graded as correct. We can write a string match to check if the completion includes the phrase "2008". If it does, we consider it correct.

Consider another eval where the input is to generate valid JSON: We can write some code that
attempts to parse the completion as JSON and then considers the completion correct if it is
parsable.

**Model grading: A two stage process where the model first answers the question, then we ask a
model to look at the response to check if it’s correct.**

Consider an input that asks the model to write a funny joke. The model then generates a
completion. We then create a new input to the model to answer the question: "Is this following
joke funny? First reason step by step, then answer yes or no" that includes the completion." We
finally consider the original completion correct if the new model completion ends with "yes".

Model grading works best with the latest, most powerful models like `GPT-4` and if we give them the ability
to reason before making a judgment. Model grading will have an error rate, so it is important to validate
the performance with human evaluation before running the evals at scale. For best results, it makes
sense to use a different model to do grading from the one that did the completion, like using `GPT-4` to
grade `GPT-3.5` answers.

#### OpenAI Eval Templates

In using evals, we have discovered several "templates" that accommodate many different benchmarks. We have implemented these templates in the OpenAI Evals library to simplify the development of new evals. For example, we have defined 2 types of eval templates that can be used out of the box:

* **Basic Eval Templates**: These contain deterministic functions to compare the output to the ideal_answers. In cases where the desired model response has very little variation, such as answering multiple choice questions or simple questions with a straightforward answer, we have found this following templates to be useful.

* **Model-Graded Templates**: These contain functions where an LLM compares the output to the ideal_answers and attempts to judge the accuracy. In cases where the desired model response can contain significant variation, such as answering an open-ended question, we have found that using the model to grade itself is a viable strategy for automated evaluation.


### Getting Setup

First, go to [github.com/openai/evals](https://github.com/openai/evals), clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:openai/evals.git` and go through the [setup instructions](https://github.com/openai/evals). 

To run evals later in this notebook, you will need to set up and specify your OpenAI API key. After you obtain an API key, specify it using the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. 

Please be aware of the costs associated with using the API when running evals.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd

client = OpenAI()
```

## Building an evaluation for OpenAI Evals framework

At its core, an eval is a dataset and an eval class that is defined in a YAML file. To start creating an eval, we need

1. The test dataset in the `jsonl` format.
2. The eval template to be used

### Creating the eval dataset
Lets create a dataset for a use case where we are evaluating the model's ability to generate syntactically correct SQL. In this use case, we have a series of tables that are related to car manufacturing

First we will need to create a system prompt that we would like to evaluate. We will pass in instructions for the model as well as an overview of the table structure:
```
"TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\nTable car_makers, columns = [*,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\nTable car_names, columns = [*,MakeId,Model,Make]\nTable cars_data, columns = [*,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\nTable continents, columns = [*,ContId,Continent]\nTable countries, columns = [*,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\nTable model_list, columns = [*,ModelId,Maker,Model]\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]"
```

For this prompt, we can ask a specific question:
```
"Q: how many car makers are their in germany?"
```

And we have an expected answer:
```
"A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'"
```

The dataset needs to be in the following format:
```
"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "<input prompt>"}, {"role": "user", "content": <user input>}, "ideal": "correct answer"]
```

Putting it all together, we get:
```
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\nTable car_makers, columns = [*,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\nTable car_names, columns = [*,MakeId,Model,Make]\nTable cars_data, columns = [*,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\nTable continents, columns = [*,ContId,Continent]\nTable countries, columns = [*,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\nTable model_list, columns = [*,ModelId,Maker,Model]\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "Q: how many car makers are their in germany"}, "ideal": ["A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'"]}
```


One way to speed up the process of building eval datasets, is to use `GPT-4` to generate synthetic data

````````````python
## Use GPT-4 to generate synthetic data
# Define the system prompt and user input (these should be filled as per the specific use case)
system_prompt = """You are a helpful assistant that can ask questions about a database table and write SQL queries to answer the question.
    A user will pass in a table schema and your job is to return a question answer pairing. The question should relevant to the schema of the table,
    and you can speculate on its contents. You will then have to generate a SQL query to answer the question. Below are some examples of what this should look like.

    Example 1
    ```````````
    User input: Table museum, columns = [*,Museum_ID,Name,Num_of_Staff,Open_Year]\nTable visit, columns = [*,Museum_ID,visitor_ID,Num_of_Ticket,Total_spent]\nTable visitor, columns = [*,ID,Name,Level_of_membership,Age]\nForeign_keys = [visit.visitor_ID = visitor.ID,visit.Museum_ID = museum.Museum_ID]\n
    Assistant Response:
    Q: How many visitors have visited the museum with the most staff?
    A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM VISIT AS T1 JOIN MUSEUM AS T2 ON T1.Museum_ID   =   T2.Museum_ID WHERE T2.Num_of_Staff   =   ( SELECT max ( Num_of_Staff )  FROM MUSEUM )

    Assistant Response:
    Q: What are the names who have a membership level higher than 4?
    A: SELECT Name   FROM VISITOR AS T1 WHERE T1.Level_of_membership   >   4

Once we have the synthetic data, we need to convert it to match the format of the eval dataset.

```python
eval_data = []
input_prompt = "TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL.

    question = choice.message.content.split("Q: ")[1].split("\n")[0]  # Extracting the question
    answer = choice.message.content.split("\nA: ")[1].split("\n")[0]  # Extracting the answer
    eval_data.append({

```

Next we need to create the eval registry to run it in the framework.

The evals framework requires a `.yaml` file structured with the following properties:
* `id` - An identifier for your eval
* `description` - A short description of your eval
* `disclaimer` - An additional notes about your eval
* `metrics` - There are three types of eval metrics we can choose from: match, includes, fuzzyMatch

For our eval, we will configure the following:

```python
"""
spider-sql:
  id: spider-sql.dev.v0
  metrics: [accuracy]
  description: Eval that scores SQL code from 194 examples in the Spider Text-to-SQL test dataset. The problems are selected by taking the first 10 problems for each database that appears in the test set.

```

## Running an evaluation

We can run this eval using the `oaieval` CLI. To get setup, install the library: `pip install .` (if you are running the [OpenAI Evals library](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/evaluation/github.com/openai/evals) locally) or `pip install oaieval` if you are running an existing eval.

Then, run the eval using the CLI: `oaieval gpt-3.5-turbo spider-sql`

This command expects a model name and an eval set name. Note that we provide two command line interfaces (CLIs): `oaieval` for running a single eval and `oaievalset` for running a set of evals. The valid eval names are specified in the YAML files under `evals/registry/evals` and their corresponding implementations can be found in `evals/elsuite`.

```python
!pip install evals --quiet
```

The `oaieval` CLI can accept various flags to modify the default behavior. You can run `oaieval --help` to see a full list of CLI options. 

After running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.

`oaieval` will search for the `spider-sql` eval YAML file in the `evals/registry/evals` directory, following the format specified in cell 4 above. The path to the eval dataset is specified in the eval YAML file under the args: parameter as `samples_jsonl: sql/spider_sql.jsonl`, with the file content in JSONL format (as generated in step 3 above).

After running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.

```python
!oaieval gpt-3.5-turbo spider-sql --max_samples 25
```

_Matrix output omitted from the markdown export._

`oaievalset` expects a model name and an eval set name, for which the valid options are specified in the YAML files under `evals/registry/eval_sets`.

### Going through eval logs

The eval logs are located at `/tmp/evallogs` and different log files are created for each evaluation run. 

```python
log_name = '240327024443FACXGMKA_gpt-3.5-turbo_spider-sql.jsonl' # "EDIT THIS" - copy from above
events = f"/tmp/evallogs/{log_name}"
display(pd.read_json(events, lines=True).head(5))
```

# processing the log events generated by oaieval

with open(events, "r") as f:
    events_df = pd.read_json(f, lines=True)
```

This file will contain structured logs of the evaluation. The first entry provides a detailed specification of the evaluation, including the completion functions, evaluation name, run configuration, creator’s name, run ID, and creation timestamp.

```python
display(events_df.iloc[0].spec)
```

```text

 'created_at': '2024-03-27 02:44:43.626043'}
```

Let's also look at the entry which provides the final report of the evaluation.

```python
display(events_df.dropna(subset=['final_report']).iloc[0]['final_report'])
```

```text
{'counts/Correct': 20, 'counts/Incorrect': 5, 'score': 0.8}
```

We can also review individual evaluation events that provide specific samples (`sample_id`), results, event types, and metadata.

```python
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)  # None means no truncation
display(events_df.iloc[2][['run_id', 'event_id', 'sample_id', 'type', 'data', 'created_at']])
```

```text

Reviewing some of the failures we see the following:
* The second incorrect answer had an unnecessary join with the 'Templates' table. Our eval was able to accurately identify this and flag this as incorrect. 
* Few other answers have minor syntax differences that caused the answers to get flagged.
  * In situations like this, it would be worthwhile exploring whether we should continue iterating on the prompt to ensure certain stylistic choices, or if we should modify the evaluation suite to capture this variation.
  * This type of failure hints at the potential need for model-graded evals as a way to ensure accuracy in grading the results

# Conclusion

Building out effective evals is a core part of the development cycle of LLM-based applications. The OpenAI Evals framework provides the core structure of building evals out of the box, and allows you to quickly spin up new tests for your various use cases. In this guide, we demonstrated step-by-step how to create an eval, run it, and analyze the results.

The example shown in this guide represent a straightfoward use case for evals. As you continue to explore this framework, we recommend you explore creating more complex model-graded evals for actual production use cases. Happy evaluating!
