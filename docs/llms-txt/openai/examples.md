## Overview

The Pizzaz demo app bundles a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end. The following sections walk through the MCP server and the component implementations that power those tools.
You can find the "Pizzaz" demo app and other examples in our [examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples).

Use these examples as blueprints when you assemble your own app.
