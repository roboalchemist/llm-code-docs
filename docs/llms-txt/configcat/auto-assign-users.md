All new users who sign up with a [verified email domain](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/team-management/domain-verification.md) will be automatically added to your organization. Furthermore, you can also set which Organization roles / Product permissions they should get upon on-boarding.

## Steps to configure[​](#steps-to-configure "Direct link to Steps to configure")
