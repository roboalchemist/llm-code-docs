# Trello Power-Up - Manage feature flags from Trello

The [ConfigCat's Trello Power-Up](https://trello.com/power-ups/5e694b66d2511a3601ebd0fb) allows you to connect your Trello Cards and feature flags. Create or link existing flags to your Trello cards without leaving your Trello board.

Turn features On/Off right from a linked card on your Trello board. You can also easily modify the linked flags to edit or add new Targeting or Percentage Rules.
