[ConfigCat's Zoho Flow integration](https://www.zohoflow.com/apps/configcat/integrations/) helps you connect ConfigCat to 1000+ other web apps without any code. It helps you automate day-to-day tasks and build complex business workflows within minutes.

You can set **triggers**, add **actions**, use **Delays and Decisions** to create your entire workflow on an easy to use builder.

[ConfigCat's Zoho Flow integration](https://www.zohoflow.com/apps/configcat/integrations/) can notify you about Feature Flags or Settings changes in ConfigCat, so for example you can set it up with Slack to send a message about the feature flag changes in ConfigCat.
