# SSO (Single Sign-On)

Copy page

You can let your organization members sign in to ConfigCat using 3rd party SSO (Single Sign-On) providers.

Go to the [Authentication & Provisioning](https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication/) page to set up 3rd party SSO. You need to be an organization admin to do this.

Currently supported SSO providers:

* Google
* Entra ID (Azure AD)
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* Microsoft

Under the `Login / Sign up methods` section you can enable / disable SSO providers one by one. These are organization level preferences. Your selection will be applied to all members of your organization.
