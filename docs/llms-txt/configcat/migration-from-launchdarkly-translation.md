# Details of LaunchDarkly to ConfigCat Translation

Copy page

This document discusses the details of how [ConfigCat's "Import from LaunchDarkly" tool](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/migration-from-launchdarkly.md#migrate-launchdarkly-feature-flags-and-segments-to-configcat) translates LaunchDarkly projects to ConfigCat products (i.e., how, in practice, the import tool converts the project data fetched fromLaunchDarkly's REST API to ConfigCat's Export/Import JSON format).

You need this information if you want to understand

* why the import tool produces the result that it does,
* what issues can arise during translation, and how to solve them,
* what the limitations of translation are.

## Mapping between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat entities[​](#mapping-between-launchdarkly-and-configcat-entities "Direct link to Mapping between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat entities")

The table below shows how LaunchDarkly entities are mapped to ConfigCat entities.

| LaunchDarkly entity        | Corresponding ConfigCat entity                                                                                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Mapping between LaunchDarkly contexts and ConfigCat User Objects[​](#mapping-between-launchdarkly-contexts-and-configcat-user-objects "Direct link to Mapping between LaunchDarkly contexts and ConfigCat User Objects")

Both LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat support passing user and/or session-related contextual information to feature flag evaluation, which is essential for targeting: LaunchDarkly offers [contexts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/observability/contexts), while ConfigCat offers [User Objects](https://configcat.com/docs/targeting/user-object.md) for this purpose.

However, the data structure of these is different:

* In LaunchDarkly, in addition to the default user context, it is possible to define and use other, arbitrary contexts (e.g. device, application, etc.). [Multi-contexts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/flags/multi-contexts) and nested objects are also possible.
* On the contrary, ConfigCat's User Object is a simpler data structure, primarily designed for storing user-related information. However, via custom attributes it's still able to store arbitrary information.

On top of that, LaunchDarkly context attributes are identified by the combination of a context kind and a path expression, while ConfigCat uses simple attribute names. For this reason, it is necessary to define an unambiguous mapping between the two.

This is done as shown in the following table:

| LaunchDarkly context kind | LaunchDarkly context attribute path | Corresponding ConfigCat user attribute name |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| not specified or `user`   | empty string or `/`                 | `/`                                         |
| not specified or `user`   | `key` or `/key`                     | `Identifier`                                |
| not specified or `user`   | `email` or `/email`                 | `Email`                                     |
| not specified or `user`   | `country` or `/country`             | `Country`                                   |
| not specified or `user`   | `Identifier` or `/Identifier`       | `/Identifier`                               |
| not specified or `user`   | `Email` or `/Email`                 | `/Email`                                    |
| not specified or `user`   | `Country` or `/Country`             | `/Country`                                  |
| not specified or `user`   | `name` or `/name`                   | `name`                                      |
| not specified or `user`   | `/address/city`                     | `/address/city`                             |
| `device`                  | empty string or `/`                 | `device:/`                                  |
| `device`                  | `name` or `/name`                   | `device:name`                               |
| `organization`            | `name` or `/name`                   | `organization:name`                         |
| `organization`            | `/address/city`                     | `organization:/address/city`                |
| any                       | `kind` or `/kind`                   | `/kind`                                     |

Please note that:

* Both LaunchDarkly context attribute paths and ConfigCat user attribute names are case-sensitive.
* In ConfigCat, `Identifier`, `Email` and `Country` are predefined attributes. Everything else qualifies as custom attributes.
* One-component LaunchDarkly attribute path expressions are always normalized to their unescaped form if possible. E.g. `/~0~1x` → `~/x`, but `/~1~00` → `/~1~00` (as `/~0` would be an ambiguous mapping).
* Multi-component LaunchDarkly attribute path expressions are kept as is (unless they contain `:` characters - see below).
* Context kinds other than `user` are included as a prefix in the mapped ConfigCat user attribute name, with `:` as the separator. Because of this, LaunchDarkly context attribute paths containing `:` characters needs to be escaped to avoid ambiguity. E.g. `a:b` -> `/a~;b`, `/a:b` -> `/a~;b`.

## Translation issues[​](#translation-issues "Direct link to Translation issues")

There are technical differences between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat, therefore it's not always possible to translate all entities accurately, i.e. so that they are represented identically in ConfigCat, and provide equivalent behavior to the original. (By equivalent behaviour we primarily mean equivalent evaluation behaviour, i.e. that the evaluation of a feature flag or segment produces the same result for the same input parameters.)

Such problematic cases are called *translation issues*, and a *severity level* is assigned to them as follows.

🔴 HIGH - The imported entity cannot provide equivalent behavior to the original at all.<br />🟡 MEDIUM - The imported entity may not provide equivalent behavior to the original in every case.<br />🔵 LOW - The imported entity does not exactly reflect the original in some way, but it is expected to provide equivalent behavior to the original.

The tables below show the possible translation issues.

### Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

info

Usually these issues arise when you are on a lower plan, and hitting a subscription limit. If that's the case, feel free to [contact us](https://configcat.com/support/?prefilled=ld-import-limit), we are happy to raise your limits temporarily so you can fully explore the product and evaluate it at your pace.

| T002 | 🟡 MEDIUM | A feature flag was imported with a different key than the original.                                                                         | 1. Feature flag keys are unique in both systems, but they must be case sensitive in LaunchDarkly and case insensitive in ConfigCat.<br />2. As opposed to LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat feature flag keys are not allowed to start with a number or contain dots.<br />3. Depending on the Targeting Toggle Translation Mode option, the targeting toggle may be emulated using an extra prerequisite flag. The key for this is generated by adding the suffix `_tt` to the key of the main flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1. Conflicts are resolved by adding a number suffix.<br />2. Characters that are invalid in ConfigCat are replaced with `_`. If the first character is not a letter, the prefix `x_` is also added to the key. If this results in a conflicting key, it is made unique by adding a number suffix.<br />3. Conflicts are resolved by adding a number suffix.

This can be a problem in two cases:1. "is (not) one of" clauses with boolean comparison values cannot be translated accurately as ConfigCat offers no comparators that work with boolean values at the moment,<br />2. "is (not) one of" clauses with number comparison values may be translated accurately using the = (number) / != (number) comparators. These accept a single comparison value though, so clauses with multiple values must be expanded into multiple targeting rules or conditions, depending on negation. However, in the specific case the expansion is not possible because of subscription / technical limits. | An IS (NOT) ONE OF condition is created in ConfigCat and the non-string values are converted to string.<br />From the perspective of feature flag evaluation this means the following: the ConfigCat SDK will convert non-string user attributes to string, and do case-sensitive string comparisons when evaluating the feature flag. In the case of boolean and decimal number values this can lead to undesired behavior. E.g. on some platforms, the ConfigCat SDK may convert the false boolean value to the string `False`, which won't be matched by an IS ONE OF condition having a comparison value `false`. Similarly, there could be subtle differences in decimal number to string conversion across various platforms. |

| D001 | 🔴 HIGH   | The data model fetched from LaunchDarkly contains invalid, inconsistent or unexpected data.  | In theory, such a thing cannot happen, but in practice it cannot be excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Obviously, the import tool cannot produce a correct result from an inherently incorrect input. As a best effort, it generates a valid import model so that the import operation can go through, and you can review and fix the problematic entities. |
| D002 | 🟡 MEDIUM | The feature flag was modified in LaunchDarkly while the feature flag data was being fetched. | Due to the peculiarities of the LaunchDarkly REST API, the full data model of a feature flag can only be queried for a single environment per a single request. So, it may happen that some non-environment-related properties of the feature flag are modified while fetching the feature flag data (e.g. name, variations, etc.) In such cases, inconsistencies across environments are possible in the retrieved data. | The import tool can only detect inconsistencies, but cannot do anything about them. Please check whether the imported feature flag is set correctly in each environment. Alternatively, you may try to re-import the specific feature flag.          |

## Further technical differences[​](#further-technical-differences "Direct link to Further technical differences")

* As opposed to LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat distinguishes between integer and decimal number feature flags. Therefore, when translating number feature flags, the ConfigCat setting type is guessed based on the variation values specified at the time of the import.

* For percentage rollouts, LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat use different algorithms to split users into groups. That is, even if the percentage values are the same, the distribution of users will be different. In other words, [stickiness](https://configcat.com/docs/targeting/percentage-options.md#stickiness) of percentage rollouts cannot be transferred to ConfigCat.

* In the case of percentage rollouts within custom rules, evaluation behavior is different between the two services when the attribute used as the basis of the percentage rollout is not provided (i.e. not passed to the SDK on evaluation):

  <!-- -->

  * LaunchDarkly will serve the value of the first variation whose percentage value is not 0%.
  * ConfigCat will skip the targeting rule and continue evaluation with the next rule.

* In LaunchDarkly, all clause operators can work with context attribute value lists. In ConfigCat, most of the comparators (counterparts of operators) can work with a single user attribute only. The only exceptions is ARRAY IS (NOT) ONE OF.

* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to control whether or not specific feature flags are visible to mobile and/or client-side SDKs ([Client-side SDK availability](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/flags/new#make-flags-available-to-client-side-and-mobile-sdks)). There is no such feature in ConfigCat, so this preference is ignored. All the feature flags are imported into a single config which can be accessed by all kinds of ConfigCat SDKs.

* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to mark a feature flag as temporary or permanent. There is no such feature in ConfigCat. Yet translation preserves this piece of information by adding a tag to the feature flag.

* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to assign a name to the variations (possible outcomes of the feature flag). There is no such feature in ConfigCat at the moment, so these pieces of information are not transferred.
