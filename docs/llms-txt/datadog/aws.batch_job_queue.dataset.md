# Batch Job Queue

An AWS Batch Job Queue is a resource that manages how submitted batch jobs are prioritized and assigned to compute environments. It acts as a buffer where jobs wait until compute resources are available. Job queues can be associated with one or more compute environments, and their priority settings determine the order in which jobs are dispatched. This allows flexible control over workload scheduling and resource allocation.

| priority                     | core | int64      | The priority of the job queue. Job queue priority determines the order that job queues are evaluated when multiple queues dispatch jobs within a shared compute environment. A higher value for priority indicates a higher priority. Queues are evaluated in cycles, in descending order by priority. For example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is evaluated before a queue with a priority value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either Amazon EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT). Amazon EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed. Job queue priority doesn't guarantee that a particular job executes before a job in a lower priority queue. Jobs added to higher priority queues during the queue evaluation cycle might not be evaluated until the next cycle. A job is dispatched from a queue only if resources are available when the queue is evaluated. If there are insufficient resources available at that time, the cycle proceeds to the next queue. This means that jobs added to higher priority queues might have to wait for jobs in multiple lower priority queues to complete before they are dispatched. You can use job dependencies to control the order for jobs from queues with different priorities. For more information, see Job Dependencies in the Batch User Guide. |
