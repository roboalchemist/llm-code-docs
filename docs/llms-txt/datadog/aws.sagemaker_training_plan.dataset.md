# SageMaker Training Plan

SageMaker Training Plan in AWS represents a summary of a scheduled or defined training job configuration within Amazon SageMaker. It provides details about how machine learning models are trained, including the resources, algorithms, and parameters used. This helps manage and track training workflows efficiently.
