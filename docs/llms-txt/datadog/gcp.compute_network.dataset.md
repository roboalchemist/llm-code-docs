# Virtual Private Cloud Network

A Virtual Private Cloud Network in Google Cloud is a logically isolated, private network that provides secure communication between your cloud resources. It allows you to define IP ranges, create subnets, configure routing, and apply firewall rules. VPC networks are global, scalable, and flexible, enabling connectivity across regions and integration with on-premises environments through VPN or interconnect.
