# Auto-Upgrade for nodes should be enabled in GKE clusters

## Description{% #description %}

Auto-upgrade should be enabled for nodes. Auto-upgrade keeps nodes at the current version of Kubernetes and applies security related patches. To prevent outages, a [maintenance window](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions) should be set up as well.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Follow the steps in Google Cloud's [Auto-upgrade nodes guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-upgrades) to enable auto-upgrade nodes.
