# Proton Environment Account Connection

Proton Environment Account Connection in AWS Proton represents the link between a management account and an environment account. It allows Proton to provision and manage infrastructure resources in a separate account, enabling secure multi-account deployments. This connection helps organizations maintain clear separation of responsibilities while still using Proton to orchestrate and manage environments across accounts.
