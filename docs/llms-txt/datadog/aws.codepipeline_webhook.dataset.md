# CodePipeline Webhook

CodePipeline Webhook in AWS is a resource that allows external systems to trigger pipeline executions automatically. It listens for specific events, such as code changes pushed to a repository, and then starts the associated pipeline without manual intervention. This enables continuous integration and delivery workflows by connecting external sources directly to CodePipeline.

```
aws.codepipeline_webhook
```
