# Managed Instance Group

A Managed Instance Group in Google Cloud is a collection of identical virtual machine instances managed as a single entity. It provides automated instance provisioning, load balancing, health checking, and auto-scaling based on demand. This ensures high availability and consistent performance for applications while simplifying operations and maintenance.

| base_instance_name             | core | string        | The base instance name is a prefix that you want to attach to the names of all VMs in a MIG. The maximum character length is 58 and the name must comply with RFC1035 format. When a VM is created in the group, the MIG appends a hyphen and a random four-character string to the base instance name. If you want the MIG to assign sequential numbers instead of a random string, then end the base instance name with a hyphen followed by one or more hash symbols. The hash symbols indicate the number of digits. For example, a base instance name of "vm-###" results in "vm-001" as a VM name. @pattern [a-z](([-a-z0-9]{0,57})|([-a-z0-9]{0,51}-#{1,10}(\\[[0-9]{1,10}\\])?)) |

| target_size                    | core | int64         | The target number of running instances for this managed instance group. You can reduce this number by using the instanceGroupManager deleteInstances or abandonInstances methods. Resizing the group also changes this number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| target_stopped_size            | core | int64         | The target number of stopped instances for this managed instance group. This number changes when you: - Stop instance using the stopInstances method or start instances using the startInstances method. - Manually change the targetStoppedSize using the update method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| target_suspended_size          | core | int64         | The target number of suspended instances for this managed instance group. This number changes when you: - Suspend instance using the suspendInstances method or resume instances using the resumeInstances method. - Manually change the targetSuspendedSize using the update method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| versions                       | core | json          | Specifies the instance templates used by this managed instance group to create instances. Each version is defined by an instanceTemplate and aname. Every version can appear at most once per instance group. This field overrides the top-level instanceTemplate field. Read more about therelationships between these fields. Exactly one version must leave thetargetSize field unset. That version will be applied to all remaining instances.
