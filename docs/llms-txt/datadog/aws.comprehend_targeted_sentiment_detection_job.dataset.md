# Comprehend Targeted Sentiment Detection Job Properties

Comprehend Targeted Sentiment Detection Job Properties in AWS describe the details of a sentiment analysis job that identifies opinions and emotions directed at specific entities within text. It includes information such as job status, input and output data configuration, language code, job name, and timestamps. This resource helps track and manage targeted sentiment detection jobs, enabling users to analyze customer feedback, reviews, or documents with more granular insights than general sentiment analysis.
