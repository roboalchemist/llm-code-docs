# MQ Broker

MQ Broker in AWS is a managed message broker service based on Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ. It allows applications, microservices, and distributed systems to communicate by sending and receiving messages through queues and topics. AWS handles the setup, scaling, patching, and high availability of the broker, reducing operational overhead. It supports standard messaging protocols, making it easier to integrate with existing applications. This service is commonly used for decoupling application components, improving reliability, and enabling asynchronous communication in cloud architectures.
