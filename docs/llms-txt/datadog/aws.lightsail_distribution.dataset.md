# Lightsail Distribution

Lightsail Distribution in AWS is a content delivery network (CDN) resource that helps deliver web content, such as images, videos, and static files, to users with low latency and high transfer speeds. It is designed to work seamlessly with Amazon Lightsail instances and buckets, making it easy for developers to accelerate their applications without complex configurations. This service automatically caches content at edge locations worldwide, improving performance and reducing load on the origin server. It is a simplified alternative to Amazon CloudFront, tailored for Lightsail users.
