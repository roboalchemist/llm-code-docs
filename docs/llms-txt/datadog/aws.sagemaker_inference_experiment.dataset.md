# SageMaker Inference Experiment

SageMaker Inference Experiment is an AWS resource that allows you to compare the performance of different machine learning model variants in real-time. It helps you safely test new models against production traffic by routing a portion of requests to each variant and collecting metrics such as accuracy, latency, and cost. This enables data-driven decisions when promoting models to production.

The following are the possible statuses for an inference experiment: Creating - Amazon SageMaker is creating your experiment. Created - Amazon SageMaker has finished the creation of your experiment and will begin the experiment at the scheduled time. Updating - When you make changes to your experiment, your experiment shows as updating. Starting - Amazon SageMaker is beginning your experiment. Running - Your experiment is in progress. Stopping - Amazon SageMaker is stopping your experiment. Completed - Your experiment has completed. Cancelled - When you conclude your experiment early using the StopInferenceExperiment API, or if any operation fails with an unexpected error, it shows as cancelled. |
