## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Google Workspace user unenrolls from Google's [Advanced Protection](https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/).

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Google Workspace logs to detect when a user unenrolls from Google's Advanced Protection. An attacker who has already gained initial access may unenroll from Advanced Protection to degrade security controls.

1. Check for other signals and logs generated by the impacted user `{{@usr.email}}`, and look for deviations in the following properties:
   - Application
   - Device
   - Geolocation
   - IP address
1. Reach out to the user `{{@usr.email}}` to confirm if they recognize the activity.
