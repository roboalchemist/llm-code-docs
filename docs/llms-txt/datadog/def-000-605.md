# Verify ownership of Message of the Day Banner
 
## Description{% #description %}

To properly set the owner of `/etc/motd`, run the command:

```
$ sudo chown root /etc/motd 
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

Proper ownership will ensure that only root user can modify the banner.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

  echo "0 is not a defined user on the system"
  exit 1
fi
chown $newown /etc/motd
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}
