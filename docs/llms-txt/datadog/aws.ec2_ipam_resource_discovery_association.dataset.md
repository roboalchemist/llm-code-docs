# IPAM Resource Discovery Association

IPAM Resource Discovery Association in AWS links an IPAM (IP Address Manager) with a resource discovery. This association allows IPAM to use the discovery to find and manage IP address usage across accounts and regions. It helps centralize visibility of IP addresses, making it easier to track, allocate, and optimize IP address space within an organization.
