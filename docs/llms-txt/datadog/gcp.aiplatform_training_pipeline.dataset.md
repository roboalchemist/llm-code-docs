# Vertex AI Training Pipeline

Vertex AI Training Pipeline is a managed service in Google Cloud that automates the process of training machine learning models. It allows users to define and run end-to-end training workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The service supports custom training code, pre-built algorithms, and integration with other Vertex AI components for scalable and reproducible ML development.

| model_to_upload          | core | json          | Describes the Model that may be uploaded (via ModelService.UploadModel) by this TrainingPipeline. The TrainingPipeline's training_task_definition should make clear whether this Model description should be populated, and if there are any special requirements regarding how it should be filled. If nothing is mentioned in the training_task_definition, then it should be assumed that this field should not be filled and the training task either uploads the Model without a need of this information, or that training task does not support uploading a Model as part of the pipeline. When the Pipeline's state becomes `PIPELINE_STATE_SUCCEEDED` and the trained Model had been uploaded into Vertex AI, then the model_to_upload's resource name is populated. The Model is always uploaded into the Project and Location in which this pipeline is. |

| training_task_definition | core | string        | Required. A Google Cloud Storage path to the YAML file that defines the training task which is responsible for producing the model artifact, and may also include additional auxiliary work. The definition files that can be used here are found in gs://google-cloud-aiplatform/schema/trainingjob/definition/. Note: The URI given on output will be immutable and probably different, including the URI scheme, than the one given on input. The output URI will point to a location where the user only has a read access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
