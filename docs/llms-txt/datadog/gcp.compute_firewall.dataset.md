# Firewall Rules

Firewall Rules in Google Cloud Platform control network traffic to and from virtual machine instances. They define allow or deny policies based on parameters such as IP ranges, protocols, and ports. These rules are applied at the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network level, enabling centralized management of security policies. Firewall rules can be configured as ingress or egress, determining whether they filter incoming or outgoing traffic. They help secure workloads by restricting unauthorized access while allowing necessary communication between services.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last character must be a lowercase letter or digit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| network                 | core | string        | URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used: global/networks/default If you choose to specify this field, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network - projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network - global/networks/default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| priority                | core | int64         | Priority for this rule. This is an integer between `0` and `65535`, both inclusive. The default value is `1000`. Relative priorities determine which rule takes effect if multiple rules apply. Lower values indicate higher priority. For example, a rule with priority `0` has higher precedence than a rule with priority `1`. DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority. Note that VPC networks have implied rules with a priority of `65535`. To avoid conflicts with the implied rules, use a priority number less than `65535`.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| source_ranges           | core | array<string> | If source ranges are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed inCIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the rule applies to traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP from a resource with a matching tag listed in thesourceTags field. The connection does not need to match both fields for the rule to apply. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| source_service_accounts | core | array<string> | If source service accounts are specified, the firewall rules apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address.sourceRanges can be set at the same time assourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP that belongs to an instance with service account listed insourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time assourceTags or targetTags. |
| source_tags             | core | array<string> | If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP from a resource with a matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.     |

If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| target_tags             | core | array<string> | A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
