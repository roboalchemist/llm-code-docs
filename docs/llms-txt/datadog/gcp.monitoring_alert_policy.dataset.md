# Alerting Policy

An Alerting Policy in Google Cloud defines conditions that trigger notifications when monitored metrics meet specific thresholds or patterns. It helps detect issues in real time by monitoring resources such as compute, storage, or application performance. Policies can include multiple conditions, notification channels, and documentation to guide response actions.

If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six conditions. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, it must be the only condition. If condition_monitoring_query_language is present, it must be the only condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| documentation         | core | json          | Documentation that is included with notifications and incidents related to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation to include information to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the underlying problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels that have limited capacity might not show this documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The field should always be populated on List and Get operations, unless a field projection has been specified that strips it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| gcp_display_name      | core | string        | A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.The convention for the display_name of a PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition is "{rule group name}/{alert name}", where the {rule group name} and {alert name} should be taken from the corresponding Prometheus configuration file. This convention is not enforced. In any case the display_name is not a unique key of the AlertPolicy.                                                                                                                                |

The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID] [ALERT_POLICY_ID] is assigned by Cloud Monitoring when the policy is created. When calling the alertPolicies.create method, do not include the name field in the alerting policy passed as part of the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| notification_channels | core | array<string> | Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are returned from the ListNotificationChannels method. The format of the entries in this field is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| severity              | core | string        | Optional. The severity of an alerting policy indicates how important incidents generated by that policy are.

Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.Note that Prometheus {alert name} is a valid Prometheus label names (https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels), whereas Prometheus {rule group} is an unrestricted UTF-8 string. This means that they cannot be stored as-is in user labels, because they may contain characters that are not allowed in user-label values. |
