# Workstation Config

Workstation Config in Google Cloud defines the configuration for a Cloud Workstations environment. It specifies settings such as machine type, persistent disk size, network configuration, and environment variables used to create and manage developer workstations. This resource helps standardize and automate the setup of secure, cloud-based development environments.

| disable_tcp_connections                | core | bool          | Optional. Disables support for plain TCP connections in the workstation. By default the service supports TCP connections through a websocket relay. Setting this option to true disables that relay, which prevents the usage of services that require plain TCP connections, such as SSH. When enabled, all communication must occur over HTTPS or WSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| replica_zones                          | core | array<string> | Optional. Immutable. Specifies the zones used to replicate the VM and disk resources within the region. If set, exactly two zones within the workstation cluster's region must be specifiedâfor example, `['us-central1-a', 'us-central1-f']`. If this field is empty, two default zones within the region are used. Immutable after the workstation configuration is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| resource_name                          | core | string        |
| running_timeout                        | core | string        | Optional. Number of seconds that a workstation can run until it is automatically shut down. We recommend that workstations be shut down daily to reduce costs and so that security updates can be applied upon restart. The idle_timeout and running_timeout fields are independent of each other. Note that the running_timeout field shuts down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not the VMs are idle. Provide duration terminated by `s` for secondsâfor example, `"54000s"` (15 hours). Defaults to `"43200s"` (12 hours). A value of `"0s"` indicates that workstations using this configuration should never time out. If encryption_key is set, it must be greater than `"0s"` and less than `"86400s"` (24 hours). Warning: A value of `"0s"` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration have no maximum running time. This is strongly discouraged because you incur costs and will not pick up security updates. |
