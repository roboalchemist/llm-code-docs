# Pinpoint SMS and Voice V2 Registration

Pinpoint SMS and Voice V2 Registration in AWS represents the registration information required to use SMS and voice messaging services. It stores details about sender identities, compliance requirements, and registration status needed to send messages through Amazon Pinpoint. This resource ensures that messaging campaigns meet regulatory and carrier requirements before traffic is allowed.
