# Cost Changes

## Overview{% #overview %}

Cloud Cost Management can help you proactively detect and respond to unexpected cost changes before they become significant problems. Use these tools to automatically identify anomalies, set up custom alerts, and track costs in near real-time across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

## Key features{% #key-features %}

- [Anomalies: Automatically detect unusual cost patterns using machine learning. Get insights into what's driving changes with Watchdog Explains and share context with teams for faster resolution.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloud_cost_management/cost_changes/anomalies)
- [Monitors: Create custom alerts when costs exceed thresholds or change unexpectedly. Define specific conditions, filter by provider or tags, and integrate with notification channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloud_cost_management/cost_changes/monitors)
- [Real-Time Costs: Get near real-time estimates of Amazon EC2 costs updated every 5 minutes. React to cost changes within hours instead of days and track Kubernetes cluster costs in real time.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloud_cost_management/cost_changes/real_time_costs)
