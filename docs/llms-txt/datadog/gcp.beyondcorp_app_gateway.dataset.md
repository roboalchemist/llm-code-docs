# BeyondCorp AppGateway

BeyondCorp AppGateway is a managed Google Cloud resource that provides secure access to applications without requiring a traditional VPN. It acts as a gateway that brokers connections between end users and internal applications, enforcing identity and context-based access policies. This service is part of BeyondCorp Enterprise, enabling zero-trust access to private apps hosted on Google Cloud or on-premises environments.
