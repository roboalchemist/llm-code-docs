# Backup

Backup in Google Cloud is a managed service that allows you to create, manage, and restore backups of your data and workloads. It provides centralized backup management across multiple Google Cloud services, ensuring data protection, compliance, and disaster recovery. The service supports automated scheduling, retention policies, and secure storage of backup data.

| etag                     | core | string        | Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a backup from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform backup updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetBackup`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateBackup` or `DeleteBackup` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource. |
| labels                   | core | array<string> | Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| manual                   | core | bool          | Output only. This flag indicates whether this Backup resource was created manually by a user or via a schedule in the BackupPlan. A value of True means that the Backup was created manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
