# EKS clusters should run on a supported version of Kubernetes

## Description{% #description %}

This control checks whether an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster is operating on a supported version of Kubernetes. If your application doesn't require a specific Kubernetes version, it is recommended to use the latest supported version for EKS clusters to ensure optimal security and performance. You can find more information in the Amazon EKS User Guide under the [Amazon EKS Kubernetes release calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar) and [Amazon EKS version support and FAQ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#version-deprecation) sections.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on updating an EKS cluster's Kubernetes version, please refer to [Updating an Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
