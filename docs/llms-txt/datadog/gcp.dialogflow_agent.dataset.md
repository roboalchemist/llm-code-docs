# Dialogflow Agent

A Dialogflow Agent is a Google Cloud resource that enables the creation of conversational interfaces such as chatbots and voice assistants. It uses natural language understanding to interpret user input and manage conversation flow. The agent can be trained with intents, entities, and contexts to handle various user queries and integrate with multiple platforms like Google Assistant, websites, or messaging apps.

| api_version              | core | string        | Optional. API version displayed in Dialogflow console. If not specified, V2 API is assumed. Clients are free to query different service endpoints for different API versions. However, bots connectors and webhook calls will follow the specified API version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| avatar_uri               | core | string        | Optional. The URI of the agent's avatar. Avatars are used throughout the Dialogflow console and in the self-hosted [Web Demo](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/web-demo) integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| classification_threshold | core | float64       | Optional. To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used. |
| datadog_display_name     | core | string        |
| default_language_code    | core | string        | Required. The default language of the agent as a language tag.
