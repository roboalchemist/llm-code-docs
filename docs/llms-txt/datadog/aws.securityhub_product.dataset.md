# Security Hub Product

Security Hub Product in AWS represents an external or integrated security service that sends findings into AWS Security Hub. It defines the product metadata, such as the provider of the findings, and enables Security Hub to aggregate, organize, and prioritize security alerts from multiple sources. This allows users to centralize security visibility and streamline compliance checks across their AWS environment.
