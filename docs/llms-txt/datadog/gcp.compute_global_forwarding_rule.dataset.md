# Global Forwarding Rule

A Global Forwarding Rule in Google Cloud is a configuration that directs incoming traffic from a single global IP address to a specific target resource, such as a load balancer. It enables global load balancing by routing requests to the closest backend based on factors like latency and availability. This resource is commonly used for applications that need a single anycast IP to serve users worldwide.

Always empty if the current forwarding rule does not have sourceIPRanges specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ip_address                      | core | string        | IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy andvalidateForProxyless is set to true, theIPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as inhttps://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number. |

| metadata_filters                | core | json          | Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g.TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if itsfilterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of thefilterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. If multiplemetadataFilters are specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that thisForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set toINTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| subnetwork                      | core | string        | This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this forwarding rule, used with internal load balancers and external passthrough Network Load Balancers with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| target                          | core | string        | The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target" column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - vpc-sc - APIs that support VPC Service Controls. - all-apis - All supported Google APIs. - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment. The target is not mutable once set as a service attachment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
