# Lightsail Container Service

Lightsail Container Service is a managed container hosting option in Amazon Lightsail that allows you to easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications without needing to manage servers or complex infrastructure. It provides a simplified experience compared to Amazon ECS or EKS, making it ideal for small to medium workloads, prototypes, and developers who want to run containers with minimal setup.

| public_domain_names     | core | string     | The public domain name of the container service, such as example.com and www.example.com. You can specify up to four public domain names for a container service. The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service. If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service. You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service. See CreateContainerService or UpdateContainerService for information about how to specify public domain names for your Lightsail container service. |
| resource_type           | core | string     | The Lightsail resource type of the container service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
