# CloudFront Distribution

A CloudFront Distribution is a globally distributed content delivery network resource in AWS that delivers web content, videos, APIs, and other assets to users with low latency and high transfer speeds. It routes requests through a worldwide network of edge locations, caching content closer to end users. Distributions can be configured for web or RTMP delivery, support custom domains, HTTPS, and integrate with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda@Edge.
