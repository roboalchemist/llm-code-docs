# OpenSearch domains should have Error Logging enabled

## Description{% #description %}

This check determines if the `ES_APPLICATION_LOGS` feature is enabled for Amazon OpenSearch Service domains, and is configured to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Application logs provide valuable insights into the operational aspects and health of your OpenSearch clusters and allow you to monitor query performance, identify potential issues, and track user activity.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

To enable `ES_APPLICATION_LOGS` for an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, refer to the [Configuring Amazon OpenSearch Service to Send Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#cloudwatch-logs) section of the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.
