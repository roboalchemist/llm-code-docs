Datadog Continuous Delivery (CD) Visibility provides observability on your deployments. CD Visibility brings deployment metrics and data into Datadog so you can communicate the health of your deployments, and focus your efforts in improving your team's ability to deliver quality code every time.

With CD Visibility, you can monitor deployments across CD environments by tracking every deployment event. You can understand the changes being deployed and how they are affecting your services.
