# Slack anomaly event
Classification:attack 
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Slack audit [anomaly event](https://api.slack.com/admins/audit-logs-anomaly) is raised.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors Slack audit logs for when a Slack anomaly event is raised. Anomaly events are a special part of the Audit Logs API that help surface unexpected user behaviors. There will be a reason code published for any anomalous event. Anomalous events can include:

- Excessive number of file downloads.
- A Tor exit node was used.
- Anomalous behaviour from an administrator account.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the behaviour is expected by:
   - Contacting the user for more information.
   - Check for other signals and logs generated by the impacted user `{{@usr.email}}`, and look for deviations in the geolocation, ASN, or device properties.
1. If the activity is deemed malicious:
   - Begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
