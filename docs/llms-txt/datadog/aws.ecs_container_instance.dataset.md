# ECS Container Instance

An ECS Container Instance in AWS is an Amazon EC2 instance that is registered to an Amazon ECS cluster and used to run Docker containers. It hosts the ECS agent, which manages communication with the ECS service, and provides the compute capacity for tasks and services.

| status                 | core | string    | The status of the container instance. The valid values are REGISTERING, REGISTRATION_FAILED, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, DEREGISTERING, or DRAINING. If your account has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account setting, then any newly registered container instance will transition to a REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic network interface is provisioned for the instance. If the registration fails, the instance will transition to a REGISTRATION_FAILED status. You can describe the container instance and see the reason for failure in the statusReason parameter. Once the container instance is terminated, the instance transitions to a DEREGISTERING status while the trunk elastic network interface is deprovisioned. The instance then transitions to an INACTIVE status. The ACTIVE status indicates that the container instance can accept tasks. The DRAINING indicates that new tasks aren't placed on the container instance and any service tasks running on the container instance are removed if possible. For more information, see Container instance draining in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. |

| version                | core | int64     | The version counter for the container instance. Every time a container instance experiences a change that triggers a CloudWatch event, the version counter is incremented. If you're replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a container instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the version reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside the detail object) to verify that the version in your event stream is current.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
