This value determines which database network protocol the proxy recognizes when it interprets network traffic to and from the database. <code>MYSQL</code> supports Aurora MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and RDS for MySQL databases. <code>POSTGRESQL</code> supports Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS for PostgreSQL databases. <code>SQLSERVER</code> supports RDS for Microsoft SQL Server databases.                                                   |
| idle_client_timeout    | core | int64         | The number of seconds a connection to the proxy can have no activity before the proxy drops the client connection.
