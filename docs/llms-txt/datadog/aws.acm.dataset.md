A certificate enters status PENDING_VALIDATION upon being requested, unless it fails for any of the reasons given in the troubleshooting topic <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-failed.html">Certificate request fails</a>. ACM makes repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and then times out. If a certificate shows status FAILED or VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT, delete the request, correct the issue with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html">DNS validation</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-validation.html">Email validation</a>, and try again. If validation succeeds, the certificate enters status ISSUED. |
