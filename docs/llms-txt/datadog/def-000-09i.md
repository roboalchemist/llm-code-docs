## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Tailscale API access token has been created.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors Tailscale logs for when an API access token has been created. An attacker may create an API access token to maintain unauthorized access to the environment. This rule detects the creation of:

- [API keys](https://tailscale.com/kb/1101/api/)
- [Auth keys](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/)
- [OAuth client credentials](https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/oauth-clients/)

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Investigate the user `{{@usr.email}}` that created the API Key `{{@target.id}}`.
1. Investigate the `{{@new.capabilities}}` details to determine the scope of permissions that the created API Key has and if it should have those permissions.
1. If the activity is deemed malicious:
   - Begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
