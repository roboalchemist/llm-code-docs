# Cloud Tasks Queue

Cloud Tasks Queue in Google Cloud is a fully managed service that lets you manage the execution, dispatch, and delivery of large numbers of distributed tasks. It allows you to offload work from user-facing applications by queuing tasks for asynchronous processing. You can control task execution rate, retries, and routing to specific services, ensuring reliable and scalable background processing.

The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.                                                                                   |

A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| rate_limits                 | core | json          | Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue's state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes. |

Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK.
