# Managed Instance Group

A Managed Instance Group in Google Cloud is a collection of identical virtual machine instances that are managed as a single entity. It provides features like autoscaling, load balancing, and automated updates, ensuring high availability and consistent performance. This resource is ideal for running stateless applications and workloads that need to scale horizontally.
