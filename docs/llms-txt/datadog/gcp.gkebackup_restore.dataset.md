# Backup for GKE Restore Plan

A Backup for GKE Restore Plan in Google Cloud defines how and where to restore a previously created GKE backup. It specifies the target cluster, restore configuration, and policies for handling existing resources and namespaces. This resource helps automate and manage the recovery of Kubernetes workloads, ensuring consistent and reliable restoration of applications and data.

| etag                                 | core | string        | Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a restore from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetRestore`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateRestore` or `DeleteRestore` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource. |
| filter                               | core | json          | Optional. Immutable. Filters resources for `Restore`. If not specified, the scope of the restore will remain the same as defined in the `RestorePlan`. If this is specified and no resources are matched by the `inclusion_filters` or everything is excluded by the `exclusion_filters`, nothing will be restored. This filter can only be specified if the value of namespaced_resource_restore_mode is set to `MERGE_SKIP_ON_CONFLICT`, `MERGE_REPLACE_VOLUME_ON_CONFLICT` or `MERGE_REPLACE_ON_CONFLICT`.                                           |
