No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one NotebookRuntime (System labels are excluded). See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. Following system labels exist for NotebookRuntime: * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/notebook_runtime_gce_instance_id": output only, its value is the Compute Engine instance id. * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/colab_enterprise_entry_service": its value is either "bigquery" or "vertex"; if absent, it should be "vertex". This is to describe the entry service, either BigQuery or Vertex. |
