# Model Deployment Monitoring Job

A Model Deployment Monitoring Job in GCP is a managed process that continuously tracks the performance of deployed machine learning models. It monitors prediction data for issues such as data drift, feature skew, and model degradation. The job helps ensure model reliability by generating alerts and reports when anomalies are detected, allowing teams to maintain model accuracy and compliance over time.

If this field is empty, all the feature data types are inferred from predict_instance_schema_uri, meaning that TFDV will use the data in the exact format(data type) as prediction request/response. If there are any data type differences between predict instance and TFDV instance, this field can be used to override the schema. For models trained with Vertex AI, this field must be set as all the fields in predict instance formatted as string. |
