# Cloud Deploy Rollout

Cloud Deploy Rollout in Google Cloud represents a specific deployment instance within a delivery pipeline. It defines how a particular version of an application is released to one or more target environments. Each rollout includes configuration details such as deployment strategies, phases, and approval steps. It helps manage progressive delivery, track deployment status, and ensure controlled promotion of releases across environments.
