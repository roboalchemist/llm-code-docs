# Auto Scaling Group

An Auto Scaling Group in AWS is a resource that manages a collection of Amazon EC2 instances as a single unit. It automatically adjusts the number of instances based on defined scaling policies, health checks, and demand, ensuring applications remain available and cost-efficient. It also supports features like load balancing integration, scheduled scaling, and instance replacement for high availability.
