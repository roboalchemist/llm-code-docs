# Attached Cluster

An Attached Cluster in Google Cloud is a Kubernetes cluster that runs outside Google Cloud but is registered with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for centralized management. It allows you to view, monitor, and manage clusters running on other environments, such as on-premises or other clouds, through the GKE console and APIs.
