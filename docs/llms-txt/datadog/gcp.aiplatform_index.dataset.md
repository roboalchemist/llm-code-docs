# Vertex AI Index

Vertex AI Index in Google Cloud is a managed resource that stores and organizes vector embeddings for efficient similarity search and retrieval. It is commonly used in machine learning and AI applications to power semantic search, recommendation systems, and generative AI use cases. The index enables fast querying across large datasets by leveraging approximate nearest neighbor search, making it easier to integrate advanced search and retrieval capabilities into applications without managing complex infrastructure.

See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| metadata_schema_uri  | core | string        | Immutable. Points to a YAML file stored on Google Cloud Storage describing additional information about the Index, that is specific to it. Unset if the Index does not have any additional information. The schema is defined as an OpenAPI 3.0.2 [Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject). Note: The URI given on output will be immutable and probably different, including the URI scheme, than the one given on input. The output URI will point to a location where the user only has a read access. |

| update_time          | core | timestamp     | Output only. Timestamp when this Index was most recently updated. This also includes any update to the contents of the Index. Note that Operations working on this Index may have their Operations.metadata.generic_metadata.update_time a little after the value of this timestamp, yet that does not mean their results are not already reflected in the Index. Result of any successfully completed Operation on the Index is reflected in it.                                                                                                                       |
