Classification:attackTactic:[TA0005-defense-evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005)Technique:[T1562-impair-defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562) 
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when [Microsoft Intune Enterprise MDM](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/6495319642387-Set-up-Slack-for-Intune-mobile-apps) has been disabled for Slack.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors Slack audit logs for when Microsoft Intune Enterprise MDM has been disabled. With Microsoft Intune mobile app management without enrollment, organizations can add Slack to a set of trusted apps to ensure that sensitive business data stays secure on unmanaged personal devices. An attacker may try to disable this to degrade an organization's defenses.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the change taken by `{{@usr.email}}` is authorized.
1. If the change was not authorized or was unexpected, begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
