# CloudFormation Stack

An AWS CloudFormation Stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. It allows you to create, update, and delete groups of resources together using templates written in JSON or YAML. Stacks simplify infrastructure management by enabling consistent, repeatable deployments and reducing manual configuration.
