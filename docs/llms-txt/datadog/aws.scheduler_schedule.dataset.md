# EventBridge Scheduler Schedule

EventBridge Scheduler Schedule in AWS allows you to define and manage time-based schedules that trigger actions or workflows. It provides flexible scheduling options such as one-time, recurring, or cron-based expressions. With this resource, you can reliably initiate tasks like invoking Lambda functions, starting Step Functions, or publishing to EventBridge buses at specified times, without needing to manage custom scheduling infrastructure.

| schedule_expression          | core | string     | The expression that defines when the schedule runs. The following formats are supported. at expression - at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) rate expression - rate(value unit) cron expression - cron(fields) You can use at expressions to create one-time schedules that invoke a target once, at the time and in the time zone, that you specify. You can use rate and cron expressions to create recurring schedules. Rate-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target at regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes or every five days. Cron-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target periodically at a specific time, such as at 8:00 am (UTC+0) every 1st day of the month. A cron expression consists of six fields separated by white spaces: (minutes hours day_of_month month day_of_week year). A rate expression consists of a value as a positive integer, and a unit with the following options: minute | minutes | hour | hours | day | days For more information and examples, see Schedule types on EventBridge Scheduler in the EventBridge Scheduler User Guide. |
| schedule_expression_timezone | core | string     | The timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| start_date                   | core | timestamp  | The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might occur on, or after, the StartDate you specify. EventBridge Scheduler ignores StartDate for one-time schedules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
