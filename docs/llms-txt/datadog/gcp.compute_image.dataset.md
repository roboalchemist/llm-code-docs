# Compute Engine Image

A Compute Engine Image in Google Cloud is a bootable disk image used to create virtual machine instances. It contains an operating system and optional software configurations. Users can choose from public images provided by Google, import custom images, or create images from existing disks or snapshots. Images simplify instance deployment and ensure consistency across environments.
