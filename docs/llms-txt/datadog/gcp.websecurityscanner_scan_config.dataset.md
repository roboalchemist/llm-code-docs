# Web Security Scanner ScanConfig

Web Security Scanner ScanConfig in Google Cloud is a configuration resource that defines how web security scans are performed on your applications. It specifies scan targets, authentication settings, scheduling, and scan parameters to identify vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, mixed content, and outdated libraries. This resource helps automate and manage regular security assessments for web applications hosted on GCP.
