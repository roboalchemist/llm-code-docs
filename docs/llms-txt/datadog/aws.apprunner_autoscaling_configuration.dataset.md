| max_size                            | core | int64      | The maximum number of instances that a service scales up to. At most <code>MaxSize</code> instances actively serve traffic for your service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| min_size                            | core | int64      | The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for a service. The service always has at least <code>MinSize</code> provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset. App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code. |
| status                              | core | string     | The current state of the auto scaling configuration. If the status of a configuration revision is <code>INACTIVE</code>, it was deleted and can't be used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently removed some time after they are deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
