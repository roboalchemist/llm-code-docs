# App Engine Version

App Engine Version in Google Cloud represents a specific deployment of an application within an App Engine service. Each version contains its own code, configuration, and environment settings, allowing developers to manage traffic splitting, rollbacks, and testing of new releases independently. It enables flexible version control and smooth application updates.
