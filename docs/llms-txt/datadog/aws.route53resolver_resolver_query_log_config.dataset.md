# Route 53 Resolver Query Logging Configuration

Route 53 Resolver Query Logging Configuration in AWS allows you to capture and log DNS queries that originate from your VPCs. This helps with troubleshooting, security analysis, and compliance by sending query logs to destinations such as CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose.

FAILED: Resolver can't deliver logs to the location that is specified in the query logging configuration. Here are two common causes: The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket) was deleted. Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination. |
