# The web app should redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
 
## Description{% #description %}

Azure Web Apps allow sites to use both HTTP and HTTPS by default. Web apps can be accessed by anyone using non-secure HTTP links by default. Non-secure HTTP requests can be restricted and all HTTP requests redirected to the secure HTTPS port. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS-only traffic. Enabling HTTPS-only traffic redirects all non-secure HTTP request to HTTPS ports. HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated, so it is important to support HTTPS for the security benefits.
