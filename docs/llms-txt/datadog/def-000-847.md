# DMS replication instances should have automatic minor version upgrades enabled
 
## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies whether the automatic minor version upgrade feature is enabled for an AWS DMS replication instance.

AWS DMS offers automatic minor version upgrades for each supported replication engine to ensure your replication instance stays current. These minor version updates can include new features, bug fixes, security enhancements, and performance improvements.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on configuring automatic upgrades, please refer to the [Modifying a replication instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Modifying.html) section of the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
