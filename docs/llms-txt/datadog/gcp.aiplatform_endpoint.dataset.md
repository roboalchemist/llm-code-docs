# Vertex AI Endpoint

Vertex AI Endpoint in Google Cloud is a managed resource that provides a secure and scalable way to deploy and serve machine learning models. It allows you to host models trained in Vertex AI or imported from other frameworks, enabling real-time predictions through REST or gRPC APIs. Endpoints handle traffic management, versioning, and autoscaling, making it easier to integrate ML models into applications without managing infrastructure.
