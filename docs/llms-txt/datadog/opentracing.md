# OpenTracing Instrumentation Setup

If [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/otel_instrumentation/) or [`ddtrace`](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/custom_instrumentation/) custom instrumentation doesn't work for you, each of the supported languages also has support for sending [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/docs/) data to Datadog. OpenTracing is archived and the project is unsupported.
