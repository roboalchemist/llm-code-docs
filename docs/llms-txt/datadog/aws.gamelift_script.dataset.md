# GameLift Script

GameLift Script in AWS is a resource that defines custom server logic for multiplayer games hosted on Amazon GameLift. It allows developers to upload and manage server scripts that control game session behavior, matchmaking, and player interactions. Scripts are packaged and deployed to GameLift fleets, enabling flexible customization of game server processes without requiring a full server build.

| storage_location | core | json       | The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift Servers to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift Servers uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier version. |
