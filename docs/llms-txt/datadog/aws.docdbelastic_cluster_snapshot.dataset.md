# DocumentDB Elastic Cluster Snapshot

A DocumentDB Elastic Cluster Snapshot in AWS is a point-in-time backup of an Amazon DocumentDB elastic cluster. It captures the cluster's data and metadata, allowing you to restore the cluster to the state it was in when the snapshot was taken. Snapshots provide durability, support disaster recovery, and enable cloning or creating new clusters from existing data.
