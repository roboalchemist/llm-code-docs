# Personalize Batch Segment Job

Personalize Batch Segment Job in AWS is a resource that provides information about a batch segment job created in Amazon Personalize. A batch segment job generates personalized item recommendations for a large set of users at once, rather than in real time. This resource describes the job's details, including its status, input and output configuration, and metadata, helping you track and manage recommendation batch processing.
