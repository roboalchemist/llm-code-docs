# Elemental MediaLive Input Device

AWS Elemental MediaLive Input Device is a physical hardware appliance that connects live video sources, such as cameras or on-premises equipment, directly to AWS MediaLive in the cloud. It provides a reliable and secure way to ingest live video with low latency, reducing the need for complex on-premises encoding infrastructure. This device simplifies live video workflows by handling video transport and ensuring consistent, high-quality input for live channel processing in MediaLive.
