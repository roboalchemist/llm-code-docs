## Overview{% #overview %}

Event Correlation groups events based on their relationships or on user-defined configurations to reduce the number of notifications and issues identified from the environment. Use correlation and cases to:

- Reduce alert fatigue
- Reduce the number of tickets and notifications you receive
- Have all affected teams to be aware of a single issue instead of working in silos

- [Correlation- Get started with our two different kinds of correlation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/events/correlation/configuration)
- [Triage and Notify- View, triage, get notified or receive tickets about the correlations which have been created for you](https://docs.datadoghq.com/events/correlation/triage_and_notify/)
- [Analytics- Analyze, investigate, the metrics from correlations e.g the number of cases assigned, the number by service, etc](https://docs.datadoghq.com/events/correlation/analytics/)
