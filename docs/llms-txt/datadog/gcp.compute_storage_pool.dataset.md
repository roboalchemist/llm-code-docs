# Compute Storage Pool

A regional storage pool in Compute Engine for Hyperdisk. You pre-provision performance (IOPS/throughput) and capacity into a pool, then create Hyperdisk volumes from it that share the pool's resources. This lets you flexibly allocate and rebalance performance across disks, improving utilization and cost control. Supports Hyperdisk Balanced and Extreme, suitable for databases and latencyâsensitive workloads. Managed as a regional resource with monitoring and resizing to match changing performance needs.
