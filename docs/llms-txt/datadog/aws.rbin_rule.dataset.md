# RDS Resource Recycle Bin Rule

An RDS Resource Recycle Bin Rule in AWS defines retention policies for RDS resources that are deleted, allowing them to be recovered within a specified time frame. It helps protect against accidental deletions by retaining snapshots or instances in the recycle bin until the retention period expires.
