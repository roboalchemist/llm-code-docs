# Backup Framework

AWS Backup Framework is a resource that defines a set of compliance controls for backup policies within AWS Backup. It helps organizations ensure that their backup plans meet governance, compliance, and auditing requirements by grouping controls into a framework. This allows centralized management and monitoring of backup compliance across accounts and workloads.

| framework_status      | core | string    | A framework consists of one or more controls. Each control governs a resource, such as backup plans, backup selections, backup vaults, or recovery points. You can also turn Config recording on or off for each resource. The statuses are: ACTIVE when recording is turned on for all resources governed by the framework. PARTIALLY_ACTIVE when recording is turned off for at least one resource governed by the framework. INACTIVE when recording is turned off for all resources governed by the framework. UNAVAILABLE when Backup is unable to validate recording status at this time. |
| idempotency_token     | core | string    | A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical calls to DescribeFrameworkOutput.
