# Key Version

A Key Version in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure represents a specific cryptographic version of a master encryption key stored in the Vault service. Each version contains unique cryptographic material used for encryption and decryption operations. Key versions enable secure key rotation, allowing users to retire old keys while maintaining access to previously encrypted data.
