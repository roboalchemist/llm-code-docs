For a successful or stopped job, this is when the job's model artifacts have finished uploading. For a failed job, this is when Amazon SageMaker AI detected that the job failed.                                                                                                                                                       |

You are billed for the time between this timestamp and the timestamp in the <code>CompilationEndTime</code> field. In Amazon CloudWatch Logs, the start time might be later than this time. That's because it takes time to download the compilation job, which depends on the size of the compilation job container.     |
