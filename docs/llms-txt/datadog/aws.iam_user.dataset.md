# IAM User

An IAM User in AWS represents an individual identity within an AWS account that can be used to interact with AWS services. Each user has unique credentials such as a username, password, and access keys. IAM Users can be assigned permissions through policies, either directly or via groups, to control what actions they can perform. This resource is commonly used to provide secure, managed access for people or applications that need to work with AWS resources.

| password_last_used   | core | timestamp  | The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format, when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the Credential reports topic in the IAM User Guide. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because: The user never had a password. A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. A null value does not mean that the user never had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used. This value is returned only in the GetUser and ListUsers operations. |
