# Cloud Spanner Instance

A Cloud Spanner Instance in Google Cloud is a container for Spanner databases that defines the compute and storage resources allocated to them. It determines the performance, scalability, and availability of the databases it hosts. Instances can be regional or multi-regional, providing high availability and strong consistency across locations.

| datadog_display_name         | core | string        |
| default_backup_schedule_type | core | string        | Optional. Controls the default backup schedule behavior for new databases within the instance. By default, a backup schedule is created automatically when a new database is created in a new instance. Note that the `AUTOMATIC` value isn't permitted for free instances, as backups and backup schedules aren't supported for free instances. In the `GetInstance` or `ListInstances` response, if the value of `default_backup_schedule_type` isn't set, or set to `NONE`, Spanner doesn't create a default backup schedule for new databases in the instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| labels                       | core | array<string> | Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.). * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific characters being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release. |

| node_count                   | core | int64         | The number of nodes allocated to this instance. At most, one of either `node_count` or `processing_units` should be present in the message. Users can set the `node_count` field to specify the target number of nodes allocated to the instance. If autoscaling is enabled, `node_count` is treated as an `OUTPUT_ONLY` field and reflects the current number of nodes allocated to the instance. This might be zero in API responses for instances that are not yet in the `READY` state. If the instance has varying node count across replicas (achieved by setting `asymmetric_autoscaling_options` in the autoscaling configuration), the `node_count` set here is the maximum node count across all replicas.

Replicas identified by a ReplicaSelection are scaled with the same compute capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
