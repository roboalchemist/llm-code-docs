# Cloud Storage Bucket

A Cloud Storage Bucket in GCP is a scalable container for storing objects such as files, images, and backups. It provides durable, highly available storage with options for different storage classes to balance cost and performance. Buckets support fine-grained access control, lifecycle management, and integration with other Google Cloud services, making them suitable for both active data and long-term archival.

| default_event_based_hold | core | bool          | The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed. |

| storage_class            | core | string        | The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object.
