| status                            | core | string     | The provisioning status of the queue. The provisioning status doesn't indicate the overall health of the queue. The resource enters the SUSPENDING and SUSPENDED states when the scheduler is beyond end of life and we have suspended the cluster. When in these states, you can't use the cluster. The cluster controller is down and all compute instances are terminated. The resources still count toward your service quotas. You can delete a resource if its status is SUSPENDED.
