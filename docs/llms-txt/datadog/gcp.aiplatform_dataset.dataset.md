# Vertex AI Dataset

Vertex AI Dataset is a managed resource in Google Cloud used to store and organize data for machine learning workflows. It supports various data types such as tabular, image, text, and video, enabling users to prepare and manage training data for Vertex AI models. The dataset integrates with labeling, training, and evaluation services to streamline the ML lifecycle.
