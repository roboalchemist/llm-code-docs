# Proton Environment

An AWS Proton Environment is a managed resource that defines the shared infrastructure and resources where Proton service templates are deployed. It provides a consistent foundation for applications by standardizing networking, security, and operational settings. Environments help teams deploy services in a repeatable and governed way, ensuring compliance and reducing manual setup.
