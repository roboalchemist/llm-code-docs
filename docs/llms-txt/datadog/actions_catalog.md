# Action Catalog

The Datadog Action Catalog provides actions that can be performed against your infrastructure and integrations using either the Workflow Automation or App Builder products. You can orchestrate and automate your end-to-end processes by linking together actions that perform tasks in your cloud providers, SaaS tools, and Datadog accounts.

See below for a list of all available actions. Click an action to see its description, inputs, outputs, and parameters.
