# VMware Cluster (GKE On-Prem)

A VMware Cluster in GKE On-Prem is a group of VMware-based nodes managed by Google Kubernetes Engine running in an on-premises environment. It provides the infrastructure for deploying and managing Kubernetes workloads locally while maintaining compatibility with Google Cloud services. This setup allows organizations to run containerized applications with consistent tooling, security, and policy management across hybrid environments.

For new clusters, this field will match the user provided cluster name and be visible in the last component of the resource name. It is not modifiable. All users should use this name to access their cluster using gkectl or kubectl and should expect to see the local name when viewing admin cluster controller logs. |
