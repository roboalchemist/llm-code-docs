# Secret Manager Secret

Secret Manager Secret in Google Cloud is a secure resource used to store, manage, and access sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. It provides centralized secret management with fine-grained access control, automatic replication, and audit logging. This helps ensure that applications can safely retrieve secrets without embedding them in code or configuration files.
