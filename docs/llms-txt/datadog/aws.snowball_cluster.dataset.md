# Snowball Cluster

Snowball Cluster is an AWS resource that represents a group of Snowball Edge devices working together to transfer or process large amounts of data. It allows customers to scale out storage and compute capacity by linking multiple devices into a single cluster, making it suitable for edge computing, data migration, and temporary local workloads before transferring data back to AWS.

| shipping_option                 | core | string     | The shipping speed for each node in this cluster. This speed doesn't dictate how soon you'll get each device, rather it represents how quickly each device moves to its destination while in transit. Regional shipping speeds are as follows: In Australia, you have access to express shipping. Typically, devices shipped express are delivered in about a day. In the European Union (EU), you have access to express shipping. Typically, Snow devices shipped express are delivered in about a day. In addition, most countries in the EU have access to standard shipping, which typically takes less than a week, one way. In India, Snow devices are delivered in one to seven days. In the US, you have access to one-day shipping and two-day shipping. |
