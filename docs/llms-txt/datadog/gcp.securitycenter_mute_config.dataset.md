# Security Health Analytics Mute Configuration

A Security Health Analytics Mute Configuration in Google Cloud is used to suppress or mute specific security findings generated by Security Health Analytics. It allows administrators to define conditions under which certain findings are ignored, helping reduce noise and focus on high-priority issues. This configuration can be applied at various levels, such as organization, folder, or project, and supports flexible filtering based on finding attributes.
