# There should be at least one multi-region CloudTrail trail per AWS account

## Description{% #description %}

AWS CloudTrail records AWS API calls and delivers log files containing the identity, time, IP address, and details of API interactions. It captures calls made through the console, SDKs, and more. Enabling a multi-region trail detects unexpected activity across regions and ensures Global Service Logging for AWS global services, facilitating security analysis, change tracking, and compliance auditing.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For instructions on enabling multi-region CloudTrail logging, refer to the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html).
