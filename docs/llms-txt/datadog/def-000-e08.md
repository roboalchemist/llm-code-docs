# Verify Permissions on /etc/shells File
 
## Description{% #description %}

To properly set the permissions of `/etc/shells`, run the command:

```
$ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/shells
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

The `/etc/shells` file contains the list of full pathnames to shells on the system. Since this file is used by many system programs this file should be protected.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

chmod u-xs,g-xws,o-xwt /etc/shells
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.
