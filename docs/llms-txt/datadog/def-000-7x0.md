# RDS clusters should have deletion protection enabled
 
## Description{% #description %}

This control ensures that deletion protection is enabled for an RDS cluster. Enabling cluster deletion protection adds an extra layer of security against accidental or unauthorized deletion of a database. Deletion protection must be disabled before deletion requests can be accomplished.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

To enable deletion protection for an RDS cluster, see [Modifying the DB cluster by using the console, CLI, and API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Modifying.html#Aurora.Modifying.Cluster) in the Amazon RDS User Guide.
