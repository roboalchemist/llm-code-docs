## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a user logs in with a breached password.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Auth0 logs an event when a user logs in with a breached password. When this event is detected, Datadog generates a `MEDIUM` severity Security Signal.

You can see more information on how Auth0 detects breached passwords on their [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/anomaly-detection/brute-force-protection).

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Inspect the policy and user location to see if this was a login from approved location
1. See if 2FA was authenticated
1. If the user was compromised, rotate user credentials.
