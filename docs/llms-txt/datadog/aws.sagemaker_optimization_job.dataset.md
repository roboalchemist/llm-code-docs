# SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning Job

SageMaker Hyperparameter Tuning Job is an AWS resource that automatically searches for the best set of hyperparameters for machine learning models. It runs multiple training jobs with different parameter combinations, evaluates their performance, and selects the most optimal configuration. This helps improve model accuracy and efficiency without requiring manual trial and error.

| stopping_condition       | core | json       | Specifies a limit to how long a job can run. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the job. Use this API to cap costs. To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with CreateModel. The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete. |
