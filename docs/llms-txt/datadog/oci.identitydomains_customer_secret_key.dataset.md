# Customer Secret Key

A Customer Secret Key in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a long-term credential that allows programmatic access to Object Storage without using a console password. It works like an S3-compatible access key, consisting of an access key ID and a secret key. These keys are tied to a specific user and can be used with tools, SDKs, or APIs that require authentication for object storage operations.
