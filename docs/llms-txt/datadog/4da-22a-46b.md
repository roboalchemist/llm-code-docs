# Redshift clusters should have 'allow version upgrade' enabled

## Description{% #description %}

Confirm `AllowVersionUpgrade` is enabled so [Redshift clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) can automatically upgrade to the latest version.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Enablement allows the latest version to automatically install, deploying the most recent bug fixes and security patches.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### From the console{% #from-the-console %}

Follow the [Cluster maintenance][4] docs to permit automatic upgrade for your clusters.

### From the command line{% #from-the-command-line %}

1. Run `modify-cluster` to [set `allow-version-upgrade` for a cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-cluster-maintenance).

In the `allow-version-upgrade.sh` file:

   ```bash
       aws redshift modify-cluster
        --cluster-identifier cluster-id-name
        --allow-version-upgrade

```
