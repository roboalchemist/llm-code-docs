# Rekognition Stream Processor

Rekognition Stream Processor is an AWS resource that enables real-time video analysis by connecting a video stream from Kinesis Video Streams to Amazon Rekognition. It can detect and recognize faces, match them against a collection, and send results to Kinesis Data Streams or SNS for further processing. This allows applications to perform live monitoring, security checks, or user verification directly from streaming video.
