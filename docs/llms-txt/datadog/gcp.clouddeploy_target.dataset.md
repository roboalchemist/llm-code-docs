# Cloud Deploy Target

A Cloud Deploy Target in Google Cloud is a deployment destination that defines where application releases are delivered. It represents an environment such as development, staging, or production, and contains configuration details like cluster location, permissions, and delivery pipeline associations. It helps manage and automate continuous delivery workflows across multiple environments.
