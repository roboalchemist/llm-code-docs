# Redshift clusters should not be publicly accessible
 
## Description{% #description %}

Confirm Redshift clusters are not publicly available.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Publicly available Redshift clusters have a public IP address, which gives any machine the opportunity to attempt to connect to your clusters. Malicious activity, such as SQL injections or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, can occur if a connection is established.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### From the console{% #from-the-console %}

Follow the [Managing clusters in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/managing-clusters-console.html#modify-cluster) docs to learn how to modify public accessibility for your clusters.
