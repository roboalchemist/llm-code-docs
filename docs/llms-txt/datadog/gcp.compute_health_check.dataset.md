# Compute Engine health check

A Compute Engine health check in Google Cloud continuously monitors the status of virtual machine instances or backend services. It sends periodic probes to determine if instances are healthy and can handle traffic. If an instance fails the health check, it is automatically removed from load balancing until it recovers. This ensures high availability and reliable application performance.
