# Enable SSO with a Generic Identity Provider

Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) in Cloudcraft allows you to simplify authentication and login access to Cloudcraft.

This article helps you set up SSO if you do not have a specific guide for your identity provider. If your identity provider is Azure AD or Okta, see the following articles:

- [Enable SSO With Azure AD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudcraft/account-management/enable-sso-with-azure-ad/)
- [Enable SSO With Okta](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudcraft/account-management/enable-sso-with-okta/)

For more general information on using SSO with Cloudcraft, check out [Enable SSO in Your Account](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudcraft/account-management/enable-sso/).

Log in to your identity provider as an administrator.

Follow their documentation to create a new application for SAML integration.

Map their fields with Cloudcraft's fields. For reference, the fields are usually mapped as follows, with the first one being the label used by your identity provider and the second one being the label at Cloudcraft.

- **Single sign on URL**: Assertion Consumer Service URL
- **Audience URI**: Service Provider Entity ID
- **Name ID**: NameId Format

If the **Name ID** field is a dropdown, select **emailAddress** or similar.

You can also include an app logo to make it easier for users to see which application they are signing in to. We have one that fit most provider's restrictions over here.
