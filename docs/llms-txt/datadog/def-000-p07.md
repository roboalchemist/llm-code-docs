## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect and respond to unusual or unauthorized downloads of repository data in ZIP format by a GitHub user.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This detection triggers when a user downloads repository data as a ZIP file under circumstances that are inconsistent with normal behavior, suggesting possible data exfiltration.

## Triage & Response{% #triage--response %}

1. Identify the user and context of the download:

- Review GitHub audit logs for the user involved in the ZIP file download.
- Examine relevant fields such as:
- - `@actor` â Who performed the download.
- - `@repository` â Which repository's data was downloaded.
- - `@timestamp` â When the download occurred.
- Determine if this is consistent with the user's regular role or access to the repository.
Analyze for anomalies:
- Verify the location and device used:
- - Is the `@actor_location.country_code` or `@network.client.ip` from an unusual or unexpected location?
- - Does the `@http.useragent` match the user's typical device/browser?
Check access history:
- Review previous actions by the same user in the last 30-60 days. Have there been any prior similar downloads or other anomalies, such as increased access or changes in permissions?
Repository sensitivity:
- Assess the sensitivity or classification of the data within the repository. Does it contain proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information?
Incident investigation:
- Contact the user to verify if the download was legitimate. Use caution, as the account may be compromised. Ensure the communication method is secure.
- If the download appears unauthorized or cannot be verified, temporarily restrict the user's access to prevent further downloads or actions on GitHub. Instructions for managing access. Investigate further:
- Review other actions taken by the user to look for additional suspicious behavior, such as pull requests, branch cloning, or large file downloads.
- Check for potential compromise:
- - Look for signs of account takeover, such as changes to the user's profile, email, or login credentials.
- - Review access logs for any unusual or failed login attempts prior to the ZIP download.
- - Cross-reference with other detections: Check if there are related security events, such as anomalous login alerts or unauthorized repository access.
If unauthorized activity is confirmed:
- Revoke user access to the repository and reset credentials or tokens used by the user.
- Audit repository access to ensure no other unauthorized users or malicious activity is present.
- Begin incident response plan for further actions.
