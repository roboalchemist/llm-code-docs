| image_size_in_bytes         | core | int64         | The size, in bytes, of the image in the repository. If the image is a manifest list, this will be the max size of all manifests in the list. <note> Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the <code>docker images</code> command shows the uncompressed image size, so it may return a larger image size than the image sizes returned by <a>DescribeImages</a>. </note>                                                                                                                                |

| last_recorded_pull_time     | core | timestamp     | The date and time, expressed in standard JavaScript date format, when Amazon ECR recorded the last image pull. <note> Amazon ECR refreshes the last image pull timestamp at least once every 24 hours. For example, if you pull an image once a day then the <code>lastRecordedPullTime</code> timestamp will indicate the exact time that the image was last pulled. However, if you pull an image once an hour, because Amazon ECR refreshes the <code>lastRecordedPullTime</code> timestamp at least once every 24 hours, the result may not be the exact time that the image was last pulled. </note> |
| registry_id                 | core | string        | The Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the registry to which this image belongs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
