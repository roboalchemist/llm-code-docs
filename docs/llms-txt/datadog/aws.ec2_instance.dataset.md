# EC2 Instance

An EC2 Instance is a virtual server in Amazon Web Services that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to run applications on a wide range of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or networking. EC2 Instances can be quickly launched, scaled, and terminated as needed, offering flexibility and cost efficiency for workloads ranging from small applications to large-scale enterprise systems.
