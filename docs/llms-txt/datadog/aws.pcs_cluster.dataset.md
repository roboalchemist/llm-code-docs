# ParallelCluster Cluster

ParallelCluster Cluster in AWS is a managed high-performance computing (HPC) resource that allows you to create and manage clusters of compute nodes. It simplifies the deployment of tightly coupled workloads by automating the setup of compute, storage, and networking resources. This service is commonly used for scientific research, simulations, and large-scale data processing, providing scalability and integration with other AWS services.

| status              | core | string     | The provisioning status of the cluster. The provisioning status doesn't indicate the overall health of the cluster. The resource enters the SUSPENDING and SUSPENDED states when the scheduler is beyond end of life and we have suspended the cluster. When in these states, you can't use the cluster. The cluster controller is down and all compute instances are terminated. The resources still count toward your service quotas. You can delete a resource if its status is SUSPENDED.
