# Vertex AI Data Labeling Job

A Vertex AI Data Labeling Job in Google Cloud is a managed service that helps create high-quality labeled datasets for machine learning. It coordinates human labelers or automated labeling tools to annotate data such as images, text, or video according to defined instructions. The labeled output is stored in a dataset for training and evaluation of AI models.
