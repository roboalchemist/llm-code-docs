# Datadog Watchdogâ¢

## Overview{% #overview %}

Watchdog is Datadog's AI engine, providing you with automated alerts, insights, and root cause analyses that draw from observability data across the entire Datadog platform. Watchdog continuously monitors your infrastructure and calls attention to the signals that matter most, helping you to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve issues.

All Watchdog features come built-in, and do not require setup.

### Proactive alerts{% #proactive-alerts %}

Watchdog proactively computes a baseline of expected behavior for your systems, applications, and deployments. This baseline is then used to detect anomalous behavior.

- [Watchdog Alerts: How to view and interpret Watchdog Alerts: what information is provided by each alert, what alerts cover, and where to find Watchdog alerts throughout Datadog.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/alerts)
- [Faulty Deployment Detection: How Watchdog finds faulty code deployments.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/faulty_deployment_detection)

To customize Watchdog algorithms:

- [Forecast Algorithm](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/types/forecasts/?tab=linear#algorithms)
- [Outlier Algorithm](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/types/outlier/?tab=dbscan#algorithms)

### Investigation assistance{% #investigation-assistance %}

To help investigation, Watchdog shows context-based insights in all explorers, searches for root causes, and determines user impact.

- [Watchdog Insights: Watchdog Insights is a recommendation engine that helps you identify and resolve issues.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/insights)
- [Root Cause Analysis: How Watchdog Root Cause Analysis (RCA) finds the root cause of an anomaly, and how to use the information provided.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/rca)
- [Impact Analysis: How Watchdog identifies when an anomaly adversely impacts users.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/impact_analysis)
