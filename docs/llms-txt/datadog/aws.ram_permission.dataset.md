# Resource Share Permission

A Resource Share Permission in AWS RAM defines the set of actions and resources that can be shared with other AWS accounts or organizations. It controls what recipients of a resource share are allowed to do with the shared resources, ensuring secure and controlled access across accounts.

| feature_set              | core | string     | Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This parameter can have one of the following values: STANDARD â A resource share that supports all functionality. These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by RAM, or it might have been CREATED_FROM_POLICY and then promoted. CREATED_FROM_POLICY â The customer manually shared a resource by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM unless you promote it. For more information, see PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy. PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD â This resource share was originally CREATED_FROM_POLICY, but the customer ran the PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in progress. This value changes to STANDARD when complete. |
