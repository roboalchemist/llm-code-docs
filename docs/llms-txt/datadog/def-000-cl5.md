## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Google Workspace user edits account [recovery information](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3033063?hl=en&ref_topic=4388358&sjid=5874450613560815052-EU).

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Google Workspace logs to detect when a user edits account recovery information. An attacker who has already gained initial access may update the user's recovery information to maintain access to the account.

**Notes:**

- This rule triggers with a `Low` severity when this activity originates from an anonymizing proxy.
- This rule triggers with a `High` severity when this activity originates from a Tor client.

1. Reach out to the user `{{@usr.email}}` to confirm if they recognize the activity.
