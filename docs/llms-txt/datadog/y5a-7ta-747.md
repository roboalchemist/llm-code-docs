# The Azure PostgreSQL Database Server should use the current major version

## Description{% #description %}

Utilizing the most recent major version of PostgreSQL ensures that your systems leverage the latest security enhancements, features, and support available. PostgreSQL receives both minor and major updates, and staying current, especially with major versions, is crucial for maintaining robust security and feature benefits. The Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) facilitates seamless version upgrades with minimal downtime, ensuring your transition to newer versions of Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server is efficient and reliable.

Single Server is set for deprecation mid-2025, we recommend transitioning to flexible server as able.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on upgrading to the latest PostgreSQL version and minimizing downtime, please consult the [Azure Database Migration documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/)
