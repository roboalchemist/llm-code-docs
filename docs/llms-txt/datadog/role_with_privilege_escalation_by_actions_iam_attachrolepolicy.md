### Description{% #description %}

Granting an IAM role permission to perform `iam:AttachRolePolicy` with `Resource = "*"` allows the role to attach any policy to any role in the AWS environment, including itself. This enables privilege escalation, as a user or process with this permission can grant themselves full administrative privileges or access beyond what was originally intended. If left unaddressed, such a configuration could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or full compromise of the AWS account.

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
