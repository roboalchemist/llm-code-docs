# PCS Compute Node Group

PCS Compute Node Group in AWS represents a collection of compute nodes managed within the PCS (ParallelCluster Service). It defines the configuration, scaling, and lifecycle of compute resources used for high-performance computing workloads. This resource allows users to manage groups of instances that run tightly coupled workloads, ensuring efficient scaling and optimized performance for HPC clusters.

| status                   | core | string        | The provisioning status of the compute node group. The provisioning status doesn't indicate the overall health of the compute node group. The resource enters the SUSPENDING and SUSPENDED states when the scheduler is beyond end of life and we have suspended the cluster. When in these states, you can't use the cluster. The cluster controller is down and all compute instances are terminated. The resources still count toward your service quotas. You can delete a resource if its status is SUSPENDED.

| subnet_ids               | core | array<string> | The list of subnet IDs where instances are provisioned by the compute node group.
