# Can you disable 2FA on my account?

Yes, we can. If you no longer have access to your device or recovery code, [send an email to our support team](mailto:support@cloudcraft.co) to begin the reset process.

For privacy and security reasons, we require the following additional information:

- The last 4 digits of the credit card on file with us.
- The billing address for the credit card on account.
- The date and amount of the last charge from us.

{% alert level="info" %}
The email must be sent from the same email account used to register your account.
