# Cloud Firestore Database

Cloud Firestore Database is a fully managed NoSQL document database from Google Cloud. It stores data in collections of documents, supports real-time synchronization, and scales automatically to handle large workloads. Firestore is ideal for web, mobile, and serverless applications that need flexible data structures and low-latency access.

| earliest_version_time             | core | timestamp     | Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can be read from the database. See [version_retention_period] above; this field is populated with `now - version_retention_period`. This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is queried.

This key_prefix is used, in combination with the project ID ("~") to construct the application ID that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google App Engine first generation runtimes. This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys is the project_id (eg: foo instead of v~foo).                                                                                          |

| version_retention_period          | core | string        | Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in the database. Any read or query can specify a `read_time` within this window, and will read the state of the database at that time. If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise, the retention period is 1 hour.                                                                                                                                          |
