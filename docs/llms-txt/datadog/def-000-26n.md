# Ensure a Single Time Synchronization Service is in Use

## Description{% #description %}

The system must have exactly one active time synchronization service to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent time synchronization. Only one of the following services should be enabled and active at any time:

- chrony - A versatile NTP implementation
- systemd-timesyncd - A lightweight NTP client

Having zero active time synchronization services leaves the system without accurate time synchronization, while having multiple active services can lead to unexpected and unreliable results.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Running multiple time synchronization services simultaneously can lead to conflicts in time synchronization, unpredictable behavior, and unreliable results. A single service ensures consistent and accurate time synchronization. Having no active time synchronization service leaves the system without accurate time synchronization, which can affect security mechanisms, log consistency, and forensic investigations.

## Warning{% #warning %}

This rule does not come with a remediation. There are specific rules for enabling each time synchronization service, which should be used instead.
