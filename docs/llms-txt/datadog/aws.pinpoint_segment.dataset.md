# Pinpoint Segment

An Amazon Pinpoint Segment is a group of users defined by specific attributes, behaviors, or demographics. Segments allow you to target subsets of your audience for personalized messaging campaigns. They can be created dynamically based on real-time data or defined statically with imported user lists.
