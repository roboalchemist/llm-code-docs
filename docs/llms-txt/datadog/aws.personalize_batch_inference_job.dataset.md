# Personalize Batch Inference Job

Personalize Batch Inference Job in AWS is a resource that runs batch recommendation tasks using Amazon Personalize. It processes input data in bulk, such as a list of users or items, and generates personalized recommendations at scale. The results are stored in Amazon S3 for later use in applications or analytics. This is useful for scenarios where real-time recommendations are not required, such as sending personalized emails or generating offline reports.
