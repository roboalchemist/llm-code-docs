# Systems Manager Document

AWS Systems Manager Document (SSM Document) defines actions that Systems Manager can perform on managed instances or AWS resources. It uses JSON or YAML to specify automation workflows, run commands, or configuration policies. These documents enable consistent, repeatable operations such as patching, software installation, or compliance checks across environments.
