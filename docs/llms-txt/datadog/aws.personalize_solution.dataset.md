# Personalize Solution

Personalize Solution in AWS is a resource that represents a machine learning solution created with Amazon Personalize. A solution is the trained model that uses your datasets and recipes to generate personalized recommendations. It contains information about the training configuration, status, metrics, and versioning of the solution. This resource is central to deploying recommendation systems tailored to user behavior and item data.
