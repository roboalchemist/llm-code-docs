# Ensure iptables Firewall Rules Exist for All Open Ports

## Description{% #description %}

Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses need firewall rules to govern traffic.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default firewall policy will drop all packets to these ports.

## Warning{% #warning %}

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.
