# AppStream 2.0 Public Image

An AppStream 2.0 Public Image in AWS is a preconfigured, ready-to-use image that contains applications and settings for streaming to end users. These images are maintained by AWS and provide a starting point for creating custom images, enabling organizations to quickly deploy virtualized desktops and applications without building from scratch.
