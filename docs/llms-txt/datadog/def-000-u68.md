## Goal{% #goal %}

Forcepoint SSE detected multiple files quarantined due to single user behavior.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Forcepoint SSE logs for instances where multiple files have been quarantined due to actions performed by a single user

## Triage and Response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Review the log details to identify the user - `{{@usr.name}}` , involved in the quarantined file activity.
1. Examine the user's recent actions, such as file uploads, downloads, or email attachments. Check for anomalies in the user's account, including unusual login times or locations.
1. Update antivirus or security policies to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.
