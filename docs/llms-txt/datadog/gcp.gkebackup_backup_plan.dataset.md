# Backup Plan

A Backup Plan in Google Cloud is a configuration that defines how backups are created, scheduled, and retained for resources such as persistent disks or file systems. It specifies policies for backup frequency, retention duration, and lifecycle management, ensuring data protection and recovery options in case of failures or data loss.

Valid formats: - `projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*` - `projects/*/zones/*/clusters/*`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| create_time                 | core | timestamp     | Output only. The timestamp when this BackupPlan resource was created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| datadog_display_name        | core | string        |
| deactivated                 | core | bool          | Optional. This flag indicates whether this BackupPlan has been deactivated.

| description                 | core | string        | Optional. User specified descriptive string for this BackupPlan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| etag                        | core | string        | Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetBackupPlan`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateBackupPlan` or `DeleteBackupPlan` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource. |
| labels                      | core | array<string> | Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| last_successful_backup_time | core | timestamp     | Output only. Completion time of the last successful Backup. This is sourced from a successful Backup's complete_time field. This field is added to maintain consistency with BackupPlanBinding to display last successful backup time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
