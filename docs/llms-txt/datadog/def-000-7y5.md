# Remove autofs Package
 
## Description{% #description %}

autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives. The `autofs` package can be removed with the following command:

```

 $ apt-get remove autofs
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in the filesystem even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CAUTION: This remediation script will remove autofs
# from the system, and may remove any packages
# that depend on autofs. Execute this
# remediation AFTER testing on a non-production
# system!


DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get remove -y "autofs"
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```
- name: 'Remove autofs Package: Ensure autofs is removed'
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: autofs
    state: absent
  tags:
  - disable_strategy
  - low_complexity
