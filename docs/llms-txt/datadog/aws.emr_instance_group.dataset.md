# EMR Instance Group

An EMR Instance Group in AWS defines a set of Amazon EC2 instances within an Amazon EMR cluster that share the same configuration. It allows you to specify instance type, count, and purchasing option (On-Demand or Spot). Instance groups can be designated as master, core, or task nodes, each serving different roles in cluster operations. This resource helps manage compute capacity and cost for big data processing workloads.
