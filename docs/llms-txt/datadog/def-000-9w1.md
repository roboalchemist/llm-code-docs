## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when an unusually high number of failed authentication attempts by OTP are made from a single user.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor PingOne logs where a user generates a high number of requests within a short period. This detection rule aims to identify potential threats early, allowing for timely investigation and mitigation to protect server resources and maintain service availability.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Analyze the pattern and volume of requests to distinguish between legitimate traffic and potential attacks.
1. Investigate the source user `{{@resources.name}}` to determine if the activity is malicious.
1. Implement immediate measures to block or limit the impact of the suspicious activity if confirmed as a threat.
