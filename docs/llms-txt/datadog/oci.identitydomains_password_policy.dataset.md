# Password Policy

Password Policy in OCI defines the rules and requirements for user account passwords within an OCI tenancy. It allows administrators to enforce security standards such as minimum length, character complexity, expiration periods, and reuse restrictions. This helps ensure strong authentication practices and reduces the risk of compromised credentials.
