# Compute Engine Reservation

Compute Engine Reservation in Google Cloud lets you reserve a specific amount of Compute Engine VM capacity in a chosen zone. This ensures that the required resources are always available for your workloads, even during peak demand. Reservations can be tailored to specific machine types, GPUs, or local SSDs, providing predictable availability and cost management for critical applications.
