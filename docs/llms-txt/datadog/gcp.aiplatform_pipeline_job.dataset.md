# Vertex AI PipelineJob

Vertex AI PipelineJob in Google Cloud is a managed resource that defines and executes machine learning workflows. It allows you to orchestrate complex ML pipelines composed of multiple steps, such as data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment. PipelineJobs ensure reproducibility, scalability, and automation of ML processes, making it easier to manage end-to-end workflows.

| network               | core | string        | The full name of the Compute Engine [network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) to which the Pipeline Job's workload should be peered. For example, `projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC`. [Format](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/networks/insert) is of the form `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`. Where {project} is a project number, as in `12345`, and {network} is a network name. Private services access must already be configured for the network. Pipeline job will apply the network configuration to the Google Cloud resources being launched, if applied, such as Vertex AI Training or Dataflow job. If left unspecified, the workload is not peered with any network. |
