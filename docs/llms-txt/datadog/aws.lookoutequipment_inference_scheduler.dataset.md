# Lookout for Equipment Inference Scheduler

Lookout for Equipment Inference Scheduler in AWS manages the scheduling of inference jobs that use trained machine learning models to detect abnormal equipment behavior. It defines when and how often data from industrial equipment is analyzed, enabling continuous monitoring and early detection of potential failures.

| created_at                   | core | timestamp  | Specifies the time at which the inference scheduler was created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| data_delay_offset_in_minutes | core | int64      | A period of time (in minutes) by which inference on the data is delayed after the data starts. For instance, if you select an offset delay time of five minutes, inference will not begin on the data until the first data measurement after the five minute mark. For example, if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler will wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five minute delay time to check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload data at the same frequency and they don't need to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new data. |

| data_upload_frequency        | core | string     | Specifies how often data is uploaded to the source S3 bucket for the input data. This value is the length of time between data uploads.

In this example, it starts once every 5 minutes.                                                                                                                                     |
