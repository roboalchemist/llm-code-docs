# Transfer Family User

Transfer Family User in AWS represents an individual user account within AWS Transfer Family, a fully managed service for secure file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS. A user is associated with a specific server and can have unique credentials, roles, and access policies that define permissions and home directories. This allows fine-grained control over who can connect and what data they can access, making it easier to manage secure file transfer workflows for different teams or external partners.

| home_directory          | core | string     | The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A <code>HomeDirectory</code> example is <code>/bucket_name/home/mydirectory</code>. <note> The <code>HomeDirectory</code> parameter is only used if <code>HomeDirectoryType</code> is set to <code>PATH</code>. </note>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| home_directory_mappings | core | json       | Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the <code>Entry</code> and <code>Target</code> pair, where <code>Entry</code> shows how the path is made visible and <code>Target</code> is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in <code>Target</code>. This value can be set only when <code>HomeDirectoryType</code> is set to <i>LOGICAL</i>. In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("<code>chroot</code>"). To do this, you can set <code>Entry</code> to '/' and set <code>Target</code> to the HomeDirectory parameter value. |
| home_directory_type     | core | string     | The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to <code>PATH</code>, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to <code>LOGICAL</code>, you need to provide mappings in the <code>HomeDirectoryMappings</code> for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users. <note> If <code>HomeDirectoryType</code> is <code>LOGICAL</code>, you must provide mappings, using the <code>HomeDirectoryMappings</code> parameter. If, on the other hand, <code>HomeDirectoryType</code> is <code>PATH</code>, you provide an absolute path using the <code>HomeDirectory</code> parameter. You cannot have both <code>HomeDirectory</code> and <code>HomeDirectoryMappings</code> in your template. </note>           |
| policy                  | core | string     | A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include <code>${Transfer:UserName}</code>, <code>${Transfer:HomeDirectory}</code>, and <code>${Transfer:HomeBucket}</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| posix_profile           | core | json       | Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (<code>Uid</code>), group ID (<code>Gid</code>), and any secondary groups IDs (<code>SecondaryGids</code>), that controls your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| role                    | core | string     | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| server_id               | core | string     | A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this user assigned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
