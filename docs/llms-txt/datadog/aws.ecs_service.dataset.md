# ECS Service

ECS Service in AWS manages the long-running tasks of an application on Amazon Elastic Container Service. It ensures that the desired number of container instances are running and automatically replaces unhealthy tasks. ECS Service supports load balancing, service discovery, and scaling, making it easier to run containerized applications reliably and at scale.

| availability_zone_rebalancing     | core | string     | Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service. For more information, see Balancing an Amazon ECS service across Availability Zones in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide . The default behavior of AvailabilityZoneRebalancing differs between create and update requests: For create service requests, when no value is specified for AvailabilityZoneRebalancing, Amazon ECS defaults the value to ENABLED. For update service requests, when no value is specified for AvailabilityZoneRebalancing, Amazon ECS defaults to the existing service's AvailabilityZoneRebalancing value. If the service never had an AvailabilityZoneRebalancing value set, Amazon ECS treats this as DISABLED.                                                                                             |

| scheduling_strategy               | core | string     | The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see Services. There are two service scheduler strategies available. REPLICA-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance. This task meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks. It stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. Fargate tasks don't support the DAEMON scheduling strategy. |
| service_arn                       | core | string     | The ARN that identifies the service.
