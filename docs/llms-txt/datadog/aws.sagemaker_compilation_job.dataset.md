# SageMaker Compilation Job

An AWS SageMaker Compilation Job optimizes trained machine learning models for deployment on specific hardware targets such as CPUs, GPUs, or edge devices. It converts models into an efficient format that improves performance and reduces latency without changing accuracy. This helps accelerate inference and lower resource costs when running predictions.
