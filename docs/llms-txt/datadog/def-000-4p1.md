## Goal{% #goal %}

Detects execution of the NoFilter tool used for access token manipulation and privilege escalation.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors Windows filtering platform events, where `@evt.id` is `5447` for filter deletion or `@evt.id` is `5449` for provider context deletion when the filter name or provider context name contains `RonPolicy`. NoFilter is a security research tool that manipulates Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to disable security filters and bypass access controls. The tool creates distinctive WFP artifacts with `RonPolicy` naming conventions that can be reliably detected. Attackers use NoFilter to disable endpoint protection, bypass application controls, and manipulate access tokens for defense evasion and privilege escalation.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

- Examine the process that created or modified the WFP filter with the `RonPolicy` identifier on `{{host}}` to determine the source of the NoFilter execution.
- Check for signs of security software being disabled or bypassed following the NoFilter tool execution.
- Review system access controls and verify if any security policies or filters have been improperly modified or removed.
- Analyze the user context and privileges under which the NoFilter tool was executed to understand the scope of potential access token manipulation.
- Investigate any suspicious process execution or privilege escalation activities that may have occurred after the filtering platform modifications.
