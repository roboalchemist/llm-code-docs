## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect if an Azure snapshot is exported. Export URLs generated in Azure are accessible to anyone with the URL.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Azure logs where `@evt.name` is `"MICROSOFT.COMPUTE/SNAPSHOTS/BEGINGETACCESS/ACTION"` and `@evt.outcome` is `Success`.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Verify the snapshot (`@resourceId`) has a legitimate reason for being exported.
1. If the activity is not expected, investigate the activity around the IP (`{{@network.client.ip}}`) creating the export URL.
