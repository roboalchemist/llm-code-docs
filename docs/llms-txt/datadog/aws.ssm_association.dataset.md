# Systems Manager Association

Systems Manager Association in AWS defines a configuration that automatically applies Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) to managed instances. It allows you to schedule and enforce tasks such as installing applications, running scripts, or applying patches across your fleet. Associations ensure that desired state configurations are consistently applied and maintained without manual intervention.

| max_errors                       | core | string        | The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time. |

| sync_compliance                  | core | string        | The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
