# EC2 Image Builder Image Version

An EC2 Image Builder Image Version in AWS represents a specific, immutable version of a machine image created through the Image Builder service. It captures the configuration, components, and build details used to produce the image, ensuring consistency and repeatability. Each version can be used to launch EC2 instances or distribute across accounts and regions, making it easier to manage standardized, secure, and up-to-date images at scale.

| account_id   | core | string     |
| arn          | core | string     | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a specific version of an Image Builder image. Semantic versioning is included in each object's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), at the level that applies to that object as follows: Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific values in any of the nodes. The nodes are either left off entirely, or they are specified as wildcards, for example: x.x.x. Version ARNs have only the first three nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch> Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a specific build for a specific version of an object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| version      | core | string     | Details for a specific version of an Image Builder image. This version follows the semantic version syntax. The semantic version has four nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them. Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node. Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01. Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify the most recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards. |
