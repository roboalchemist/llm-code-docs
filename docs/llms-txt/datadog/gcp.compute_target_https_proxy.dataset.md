# Target HTTPS Proxy

A Target HTTPS Proxy in Google Cloud is a global resource that routes incoming HTTPS requests to backend services based on URL maps. It terminates SSL/TLS connections, manages certificates, and ensures secure communication between clients and Google Cloud load balancers.

| http_keep_alive_timeout_sec | core | int64         | Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a response, while there is no matching traffic (in seconds).

| proxy_bind                  | core | bool          | This field only applies when the forwarding rule that references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set toINTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| quic_override               | core | string        | Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource. This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, orDISABLE. - When quic-override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is used. - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses QUIC when possible. - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load balancer doesn't use QUIC. - If the quic-override flag is not specified,NONE is implied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Certificate Manager Certificates must include the certificatemanager API namespace. Using Certificate Manager Certificates in this field is not supported by Global external Application Load Balancer or Classic Application Load Balancer, use certificate_map instead. Currently, you may specify up to 15 Classic SSL Certificates or up to 100 Certificate Manager Certificates.

| ssl_policy                  | core | string        | URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource has no SSL policy configured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| tls_early_data              | core | string        | Specifies whether TLS 1.3 0-RTT Data ("Early Data") should be accepted for this service. Early Data allows a TLS resumption handshake to include the initial application payload (a HTTP request) alongside the handshake, reducing the effective round trips to "zero". This applies to TLS 1.3 connections over TCP (HTTP/2) as well as over UDP (QUIC/h3). This can improve application performance, especially on networks where interruptions may be common, such as on mobile. Requests with Early Data will have the "Early-Data" HTTP header set on the request, with a value of "1", to allow the backend to determine whether Early Data was included. Note: TLS Early Data may allow requests to be replayed, as the data is sent to the backend before the handshake has fully completed. Applications that allow idempotent HTTP methods to make non-idempotent changes, such as a GET request updating a database, should not accept Early Data on those requests, and reject requests with the "Early-Data: 1" HTTP header by returning a HTTP 425 (Too Early) status code, in order to remain RFC compliant. The default value is DISABLED. |
| url_map                     | core | string        | A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map: - https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map - projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map - global/urlMaps/url-map                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
