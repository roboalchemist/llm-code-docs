# AWS Cluster (GKE Multi-Cloud)

AWS Cluster (GKE Multi-Cloud) is a Google Cloud resource that allows you to create and manage Kubernetes clusters running on Amazon Web Services infrastructure. It provides a consistent GKE experience across clouds, enabling centralized management, monitoring, and policy enforcement from Google Cloud while leveraging AWS compute and networking resources.
