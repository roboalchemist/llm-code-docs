# Config Controller Preview

Config Controller Preview is a managed service in Google Cloud that provides a hosted instance of Config Connector and Anthos Config Management. It allows users to manage Google Cloud resources using Kubernetes-style configuration and GitOps workflows. The preview version offers early access to new features for testing and evaluation before general availability.
