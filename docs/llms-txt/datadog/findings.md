# Explore Misconfigurations

The Cloud Security Misconfigurations [Findings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/compliance?time=now) allows you to:

- Review the detailed configuration of a resource.
- Review the compliance rules applied to your resources by Cloud Security Misconfigurations.
- Review tags for more context about who owns the resource and where it resides in your environment.
- Read descriptions and guidelines based on industry resources for remediating a misconfigured resource.
- Use the time selector to explore your security configuration posture at any point in the past.

In addition to reviewing and responding to misconfigurations, you can set notifications for failed misconfigurations, and configure signals to correlate and triage misconfigurations in the same view as real-time threats generated by [Cloud SIEM](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/cloud_siem/) and [Workload Protection](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/workload_protection/). This enables you to accelerate investigations, as the root causes for many of today's cloud breaches are misconfigured services that have been exploited by attackers.

## Misconfigurations{% #misconfigurations %}

A misconfiguration is the primary primitive for a rule evaluation against a resource. Every time a resource is evaluated against a rule, a misconfiguration is generated with a **Pass** or **Fail** status. Resources are evaluated in increments between 15 minutes and four hours (depending on type). Datadog generates new misconfigurations as soon as a scan is completed, and stores a complete history of all misconfigurations for the past 15 months so they are available in case of an investigation or audit.

## Explore your cloud misconfigurations{% #explore-your-cloud-misconfigurations %}

Misconfigurations are displayed on the [Misconfigurations Findings page](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/compliance?time=now).

- Aggregate misconfigurations by rule using the **Group by** filters and query search bar. For example, filtering by `evaluation:fail` narrows the list to all compliance rules that have issues that need to be addressed.
  - Group misconfigurations by any facet, custom property, or tag (or **None** to view misconfigurations individually), so you can find patterns of failed misconfigurations and prioritize your remediation efforts accordingly.
- Hover over **Views**, then select an existing view to apply, or click **Save as new view** to use your explorer settings again in the future.
