# Azure AD sign in from AzureHound default user agent
Classification:attackTactic:[TA0007-discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007)Technique:[T1069-permission-groups-discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069)
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when the [AzureHound](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/azurehound.html) default user agent is seen in Azure AD sign-in logs.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors Azure AD sign-in logs for the default user agent `AzureHound` (this default user agent can be altered). AzureHound is a data collector for Bloodhound. Bloodhound is an Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance tool that can reveal hidden relationships and identify attack paths within an AD environment. It is listed in MITRE ATT&CK with id [S0521](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0521/) and has been associated with a number of threat groups.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if your organization has authorized the use of Bloodhound.
1. If the results of triage indicate that this tool is not used by your organization, begin your company's incident response process and an investigation.
   - If appropriate, disable the affected identity and revoke any sign-in sessions.
   - Investigate any actions taken by the identity `{{@usr.id}}` during the identified time frame.
