# AlloyDB Backup

AlloyDB Backup in Google Cloud is a managed backup resource for AlloyDB databases. It allows you to create consistent, point-in-time copies of your AlloyDB clusters, which can be used for data recovery or cloning environments. Backups are stored securely and can be restored to new or existing clusters, helping protect against data loss and enabling reliable disaster recovery.
