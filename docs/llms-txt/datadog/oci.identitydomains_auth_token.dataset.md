# Auth Token

An Auth Token in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a password alternative used for authenticating with services that do not support OCI's native authentication methods. It is commonly used for accessing the OCI CLI, SDKs, or third-party tools like Terraform and Docker. Auth Tokens are generated per user and can be managed through the OCI Console or API, providing a secure way to enable programmatic access without exposing the user's primary password.
