# Cloud Deploy Delivery Pipeline

Cloud Deploy Delivery Pipeline in Google Cloud is a resource that defines the sequence of stages and targets for releasing applications. It manages how software moves from development through testing and into production, ensuring consistent and automated delivery. This pipeline helps teams standardize deployment processes, enforce release policies, and track progress across environments.
