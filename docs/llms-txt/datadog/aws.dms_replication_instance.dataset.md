# DMS Replication Instance

An AWS DMS Replication Instance is a managed compute resource that runs the AWS Database Migration Service. It performs the actual data migration and replication tasks between source and target databases. The instance provides the processing power, memory, and network capacity needed to move data securely and efficiently, supporting both one-time migrations and ongoing replication with minimal downtime.
