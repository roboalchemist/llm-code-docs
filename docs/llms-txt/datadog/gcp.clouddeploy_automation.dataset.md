# Cloud Deploy Automation

Cloud Deploy Automation in Google Cloud is a managed service that automates the delivery of applications across multiple environments. It provides a consistent, secure, and auditable deployment process using pipelines that define stages, approvals, and targets. This helps teams streamline continuous delivery, reduce manual errors, and ensure reliable rollouts of containerized or other workloads to Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, or other supported targets.
