# WorkSpaces Directory

WorkSpaces Directory in AWS is a registered directory that enables the use of Amazon WorkSpaces. It acts as the authentication and management backbone, allowing users to log in with their existing credentials. The directory can be an AWS Managed Microsoft AD, Simple AD, or an AD Connector to an on-premises Active Directory. It manages user access, policies, and integration with corporate identity systems, ensuring secure and seamless access to virtual desktops.
