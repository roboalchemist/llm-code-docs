# Integration Instance

An Integration Instance in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a managed environment for running Oracle Integration, which connects applications, automates business processes, and provides real-time data flows. It offers prebuilt adapters, process automation, and visual design tools to simplify integration across cloud and on-premises systems.
