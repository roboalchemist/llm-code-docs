# Amplify Branch

An Amplify Branch in AWS represents a deployment branch within an Amplify App. It allows you to connect a specific Git branch to your Amplify environment, enabling continuous deployment of front-end web applications. Each branch can have its own build settings, environment variables, and custom domains, making it easy to manage multiple environments such as development, staging, and production.
