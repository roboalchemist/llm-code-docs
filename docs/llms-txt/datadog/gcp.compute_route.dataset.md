# Route

A Route in Google Cloud defines how network traffic is directed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It specifies a destination IP range and the next hop that traffic should take, such as an instance, VPN tunnel, or internet gateway. Routes enable communication between subnets, control egress to the internet, and manage custom traffic flows.
