| versioning                   | core | string     | The versioning status on the bucket. A bucket is created with versioning `Disabled` by default.For versioning `Enabled`, objects are protected from overwrites and deletes, by maintaining their version history. When versioning is `Suspended`, the previous versions will still remain but new versions will no longer be created when overwitten or deleted.                                                                                      |
