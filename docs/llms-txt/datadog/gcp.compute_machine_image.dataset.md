# Compute Engine Machine Image

A Compute Engine Machine Image in Google Cloud is a resource that stores all the configuration, metadata, and disk data needed to create new virtual machine instances. It captures the full state of a VM, including attached disks and instance properties, allowing consistent replication, backup, and deployment of identical environments across projects or regions.
