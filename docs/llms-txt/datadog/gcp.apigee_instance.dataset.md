# Apigee Instance

Apigee Instance is a managed runtime environment in Google Cloud used to host and manage API proxies. It provides the infrastructure for processing API traffic, applying security policies, and enforcing rate limits. Each instance runs within a specific region and can be associated with one or more Apigee environments to ensure low latency and high availability for API requests.
