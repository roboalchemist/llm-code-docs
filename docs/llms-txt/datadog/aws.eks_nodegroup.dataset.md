# EKS Node Group

An EKS Node Group is a managed group of Amazon EC2 instances that run as worker nodes in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It automates the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes, including scaling, updates, and replacement. This allows you to run Kubernetes workloads on EC2 with less operational overhead while maintaining flexibility in instance types and configurations.
