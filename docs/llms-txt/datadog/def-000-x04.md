# Verify Ownership on SSH Server Public *.pub Key Files
 
## Description{% #description %}

SSH server public keys, files that match the `/etc/ssh/*.pub` glob, must be owned by `root` user.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if [ ! -f /.dockerenv ] && [ ! -f /run/.containerenv ]; then

find /etc/ssh/ -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -uid 0 -regex '^.*\.pub$' -exec chown 0 {} \;

else
    >&2 echo 'Remediation is not applicable, nothing was done'
fi
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```
- name: Find /etc/ssh/ file(s) matching ^.*\.pub$
  command: find -H /etc/ssh/ -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -uid 0 -regex "^.*\.pub$"
  register: files_found
  changed_when: false
  failed_when: false
  check_mode: false
  when: ansible_virtualization_type not in ["docker", "lxc", "openvz", "podman", "container"]
