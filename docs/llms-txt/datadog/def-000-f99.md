# Remove tftp Daemon

## Description{% #description %}

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple file transfer protocol, typically used to automatically transfer configuration or boot files between systems. TFTP does not support authentication and can be easily hacked. The package `tftp` is a client program that allows for connections to a `tftp` server.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

It is recommended that TFTP be removed, unless there is a specific need for TFTP (such as a boot server). In that case, use extreme caution when configuring the services.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CAUTION: This remediation script will remove tftp
#      from the system, and may remove any packages
#      that depend on tftp. Execute this
#      remediation AFTER testing on a non-production
#      system!

if rpm -q --quiet "tftp" ; then

    yum remove -y "tftp"

fi
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```
- name: Ensure tftp is removed
  package:
    name: tftp
    state: absent
  tags:
  - CCE-80443-5
