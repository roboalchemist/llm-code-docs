## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a KMS (Key Management Service) key is deleted or scheduled for deletion.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule lets you monitor these CloudTrail API calls to detect if an attacker is deleting KMS keys:

- [DisableKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DisableKey.html)
- [ScheduleKeyDeletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduleKeyDeletion.html)

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if `user ARN:` {{@userIdentity.arn}} in your organization should be making this call.
1. If the user did not make the API call:
   - Rotate the credentials.
   - Use the `Cloud SIEM - User Investigation` OOTB dashboard to investigate other potential unauthorized API calls from this user.
