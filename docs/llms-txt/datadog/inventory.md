# Coverage and Posture Management

The [Workload Protection Inventory](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/workload-protection/inventory/hosts) tools give security teams a unified, real-time view of workload security posture across all compute environments: hosts, containers, and serverless functions. **Inventory** consolidates asset visibility, protection coverage, and actionable insights so you can identify and remediate gaps before they become exploitable risks.

Inventory is organized into the following tools:

- [Hosts & Containers](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/workload-protection/inventory/hosts):
  - List all physical and virtual hosts and container workloads.
  - Filter by environment, enabled features, agent version, and more
- [Serverless](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/workload-protection/inventory/serverless):
  - Track coverage for serverless functions
  - Filter by environment, enabled features, agent version, and more
- [Coverage Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/security/workload-protection/inventory/coverage):
  - View a map of Workload Protection status updated every 1-5 minutes
  - Find and prioritize workloads in a warning state
  - Filter by policy, rule, or MITRE ATT&CK tactic to locate gaps
  - Check for outdated or unhealthy agents
