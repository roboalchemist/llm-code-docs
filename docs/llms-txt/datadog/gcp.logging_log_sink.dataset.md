# Log Sink

A Log Sink in Google Cloud is a resource that exports log entries from Cloud Logging to a chosen destination such as Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub. It allows you to route and store logs outside of Cloud Logging for long-term retention, advanced analysis, or integration with other systems.

The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| include_children      | core | bool          | Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND resource.type=gce_instance                                                          |

| writer_identity       | core | string        | Output only. An IAM identityâa service account or groupâunder which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required. |
