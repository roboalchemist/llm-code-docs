## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when the Automatic Redaction setting is disabled.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Zendesk audit logs to look for events with an `@source_label` value of `"Security: Automatic redaction"` and `message:"Turned off"`. The Automatic Redaction feature redacts or removes digits from credit card numbers found in ticket comments or custom fields so that the numbers are no longer useful.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the user `{{@usr.name}}` intended to disable the Automatic Redaction feature.
1. If the Automatic Redaction is required for a legitimate business use case, enable the feature.
