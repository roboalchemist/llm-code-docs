## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect Keeper activity observed from a Tor exit node.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Keeper event logs and IP address associated with it to determine whether activity is observed from a Tor client. Datadog enriches all ingested logs with [expert-curated threat intelligence](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/cloud_siem/ingest_and_enrich/threat_intelligence) in real-time.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

- Determine if the user: `{{@usr.email}}` from IP address: `{{@network.client.ip}}` should have performed activity: `{{@evt.name}}`.
- Investigate the user's recent activity and login history to identify potential anomalies.
- If the activity is deemed suspicious, consider escalating the incident to the security team for further investigation and potential remediation.
