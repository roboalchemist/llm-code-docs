# Pinpoint Journey

Pinpoint Journey in AWS is a customer engagement resource that defines a series of steps or activities to guide users through personalized experiences. It allows you to create multi-step, event-driven campaigns that can send messages across channels like email, SMS, or push notifications. Journeys help automate customer interactions, track progress, and optimize engagement based on user behavior.
