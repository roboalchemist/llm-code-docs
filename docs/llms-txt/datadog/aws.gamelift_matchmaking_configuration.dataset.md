To require acceptance, set to TRUE. When this option is enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code> to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| acceptance_timeout_seconds | core | int64         | The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used when <code>FlexMatchMode</code> is set to <code>STANDALONE</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
