# EMR Cluster

An EMR Cluster in AWS is a managed big data framework that allows you to process and analyze large datasets using open-source tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Hive. It consists of a set of EC2 instances configured as master, core, and task nodes, which work together to run distributed data processing workloads. The service automatically handles provisioning, configuration, scaling, and cluster management, making it easier to run complex analytics and machine learning jobs without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure manually.

| normalized_instance_hours  | core | int64  | An approximation of the cost of the cluster, represented in m1.small/hours. This value is incremented one time for every hour an m1.small instance runs.

| scale_down_behavior        | core | string | The way that individual Amazon EC2 instances terminate when an automatic scale-in activity occurs or an instance group is resized. TERMINATE_AT_INSTANCE_HOUR indicates that Amazon EMR terminates nodes at the instance-hour boundary, regardless of when the request to terminate the instance was submitted. This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION indicates that Amazon EMR adds nodes to a deny list and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION is available only in Amazon EMR releases 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for versions of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0. |

| visible_to_all_users       | core | bool   | Indicates whether the cluster is visible to IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account associated with the cluster.
