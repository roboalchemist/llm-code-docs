# Cloud Spanner Instance Configuration

A Cloud Spanner Instance Configuration in Google Cloud defines the geographic placement and replication settings for Spanner instances. It determines where data is stored and how it is replicated across regions to balance latency, availability, and durability. Users choose between regional and multi-regional configurations based on performance and resilience needs.

| etag                              | core | string        | etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a instance configuration from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform instance configuration updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response which contains instance configurations, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to update instance configuration to ensure that their change is applied to the same version of the instance configuration. If no etag is provided in the call to update the instance configuration, then the existing instance configuration is overwritten blindly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| labels                            | core | array<string> | Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.). * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific characters being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release. |
