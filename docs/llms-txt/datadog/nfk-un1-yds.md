# AWS EBS Snapshot possible exfiltration
Classification:attackTactic:[TA0010-exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010)Technique:[T1537-transfer-data-to-cloud-account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect the possible exfiltration of an EBS snapshot.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule allows you to monitor CloudTrail and detect the following API calls within a 15 minute time window:

- [`CreateSnapshot`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSnapshot.html)
- [`ModifySnapshotAttribute`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifySnapshotAttribute.html)

An attacker can create a EBS snapshot from the EBS volume and modify the permissions of the snapshot to allow it to be shared [publicly](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/default_rules/cloudtrail-aws-ebs-snapshot-made-public/) or with another AWS account. Using an attacker-controlled account, a new EBS volume can be created from the snapshot and attached to an EC2 instance for analysis.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if `{{@userIdentity.arn}}` should have made the API calls.
1. If the API call was not made by the user:

- Rotate user credentials.
- Determine what other API calls were made by the user.
- Remove any snapshot attributes generated by the user with the `aws-cli` command [`modify-snapshot-attribute`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-snapshot-attribute.html).
- Begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
If the API calls were made by the user:
- Determine if the user should be performing these API calls.
- If **No**, see if other API calls were made by the user and determine if they warrant further investigation.
