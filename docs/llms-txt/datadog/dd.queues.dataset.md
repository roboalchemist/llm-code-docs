| Name                   | name                   | core | string        | The unique name assigned to the queue, used for identification and categorization. It's meant to be both human-recognizable and machines to use it as a reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Base Service Names     | base_service_names     | core | array<string> | In APM, the base service name is the original service name defined by the user or instrumentation (typically via DD_SERVICE). It's the canonical name for the service emitting spans. When a span is emitted with a different service nameâsuch as for outgoing requests to databases or external APIsâit creates a Service Override (or "fake service"). The base service is the service where the override was created. The base_service_names field lists all base services that have emitted spans using this service name as an override. It shows which canonical services reference the current service in their traces. |
| Display Name           | display_name           | core | string        | The preferred display name of entity, often used if the name field is overly technical or not descriptive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
