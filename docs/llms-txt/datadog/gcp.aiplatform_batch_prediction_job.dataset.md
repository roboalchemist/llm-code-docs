# Vertex AI Batch Prediction Job

Vertex AI Batch Prediction Job is a Google Cloud resource that runs machine learning model predictions on large datasets asynchronously. It allows users to input data from sources like Cloud Storage or BigQuery and outputs predictions to a specified destination. This resource is ideal for processing high volumes of data efficiently without requiring real-time inference.

Example: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@2` or `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@golden` if no version is specified, the default version will be deployed.
