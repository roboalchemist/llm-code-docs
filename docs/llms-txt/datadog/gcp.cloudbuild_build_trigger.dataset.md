# Cloud Build Trigger

Cloud Build Trigger in Google Cloud Platform automatically starts a build process when specific events occur in a source repository, such as a code commit or tag creation. It defines the conditions, source location, and build configuration to ensure continuous integration and delivery workflows run consistently and efficiently.
