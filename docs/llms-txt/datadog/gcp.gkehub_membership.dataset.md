# GKE Hub Membership

GKE Hub Membership represents a registered Kubernetes cluster within the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Hub. It allows a cluster, whether running on Google Cloud or externally, to be managed centrally through Anthos. This resource enables consistent policy enforcement, configuration management, and service mesh integration across multiple clusters from a single control plane.
