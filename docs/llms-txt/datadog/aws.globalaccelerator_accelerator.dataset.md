# Global Accelerator Accelerator

An AWS Global Accelerator Accelerator is a networking resource that improves the availability and performance of applications with global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as fixed entry points to your application endpoints across multiple AWS Regions. Traffic is routed through the AWS global network to the optimal endpoint based on health, geography, and routing policies, ensuring low latency and high availability.

| dns_name            | core | string     | The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that points to an accelerator's static IPv4 addresses.

For example: a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com. If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS name, DualStackDnsName, that points to both the A record and the AAAA record for all four static addresses for the accelerator: two IPv4 addresses and two IPv6 addresses. For more information about the default DNS name, see Support for DNS addressing in Global Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide. |
