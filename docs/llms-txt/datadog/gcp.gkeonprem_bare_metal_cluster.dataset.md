# Bare Metal Cluster

A Bare Metal Cluster in Google Cloud is a managed environment that allows you to run workloads directly on physical servers without a virtualization layer. It provides high performance, low latency, and full control over hardware resources while still integrating with Google Cloud services for networking, storage, and management.

| local_name               | core | string        | Output only. The object name of the bare metal user cluster custom resource on the associated admin cluster. This field is used to support conflicting names when enrolling existing clusters to the API. When used as a part of cluster enrollment, this field will differ from the name in the resource name. For new clusters, this field will match the user provided cluster name and be visible in the last component of the resource name. It is not modifiable. When the local name and cluster name differ, the local name is used in the admin cluster controller logs. You use the cluster name when accessing the cluster using bmctl and kubectl. |
