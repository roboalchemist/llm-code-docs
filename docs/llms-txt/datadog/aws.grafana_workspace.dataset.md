# Grafana Workspace

Grafana Workspace in AWS is a managed environment for running Grafana dashboards without needing to handle infrastructure setup or maintenance. It allows you to visualize and analyze metrics, logs, and traces from multiple data sources such as CloudWatch, Prometheus, and other observability tools. The service provides secure access controls, integration with AWS services, and scalability to support monitoring needs across teams and applications.

If this is CUSTOMER_MANAGED, you must manage those roles and permissions yourself. If you are working with a workspace in a member account of an organization and that account is not a delegated administrator account, and you want the workspace to access data sources in other Amazon Web Services accounts in the organization, this parameter must be set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED.
