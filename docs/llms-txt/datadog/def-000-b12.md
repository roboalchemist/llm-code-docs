## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect removal of Entra ID (Azure AD) users from restricted management Administrative Units (AUs). Restricted AUs prevent any user without a specific scoped role assignment from modifying target users who are members of a restricted management AU. Removal of a user intentionally placed in a restricted management AU can result in a protected user being modifiable by directory-level administrators.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Azure Active Directory logs for `@properties.category:AdministrativeUnit` and `@evt.name:"Remove member from restricted management administrative unit"` where the event includes a restricted administrative unit.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Review if restricted administrative units are used by the organization.
1. Review evidence of anomalous activity for the user being removed from the restricted administrative unit.
1. Determine if there is a legitimate reason for the user being removed from the restricted administrative unit.
