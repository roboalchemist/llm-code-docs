# Compute Engine Instant Snapshot

Compute Engine Instant Snapshot is a Google Cloud resource that allows you to capture a point-in-time copy of a persistent disk almost instantly. It provides a fast and efficient way to back up data or create new disks from existing ones without significant downtime. Instant Snapshots are optimized for quick creation and restoration, making them useful for disaster recovery, testing, and data protection scenarios.
