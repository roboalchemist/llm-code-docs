# CloudWatch Synthetics Canary

CloudWatch Synthetics Canary is an AWS resource that lets you create configurable scripts, called canaries, to monitor your endpoints and APIs. These canaries run on a schedule to simulate user behavior, check availability, measure performance, and detect issues before customers are impacted. They provide detailed logs, screenshots, and metrics that integrate with CloudWatch for alerting and analysis.
