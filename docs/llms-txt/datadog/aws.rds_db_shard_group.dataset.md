# RDS DB Shard Group

An RDS DB Shard Group in AWS is a resource that manages a collection of database shards for Amazon Aurora Limitless Database. It allows you to scale a database horizontally by distributing data across multiple shards while maintaining a single endpoint for applications. This helps handle very large datasets and high query throughput without requiring manual partitioning.

| publicly_accessible        | core | bool       | Indicates whether the DB shard group is publicly accessible. When the DB shard group is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB shard group's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB shard group's VPC. Access to the DB shard group is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB shard group doesn't permit it. When the DB shard group isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB shard group with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. For more information, see CreateDBShardGroup. This setting is only for Aurora Limitless Database. |
