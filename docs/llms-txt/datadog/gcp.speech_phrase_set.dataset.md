# PhraseSet

PhraseSet is a Google Cloud Speech-to-Text resource that defines a collection of phrases or words to help improve speech recognition accuracy. It allows you to provide context-specific hints so the transcription model can better recognize domain-specific terms, names, or commonly used expressions.

At most 100 annotations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| boost                | core | float64       | Hint Boost. Positive value will increase the probability that a specific phrase will be recognized over other similar sounding phrases. The higher the boost, the higher the chance of false positive recognition as well. Valid `boost` values are between 0 (exclusive) and 20. We recommend using a binary search approach to finding the optimal value for your use case as well as adding phrases both with and without boost to your requests. |
