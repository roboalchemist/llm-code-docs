# Lake Formation Data Lake Settings

Lake Formation Data Lake Settings in AWS define the administrative controls and permissions for managing a data lake. These settings specify which users and roles have data lake administrator privileges, allowing them to configure permissions, manage resources, and control access policies across the data lake.

| allow_external_data_filtering         | core | bool          | Whether to allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data managed by Lake Formation. If true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation. If false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to access data in Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation. For more information, see (Optional) Allow external data filtering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| authorized_session_tag_value_list     | core | array<string> | Lake Formation relies on a privileged process secured by Amazon EMR or the third party integrator to tag the user's role while assuming it. Lake Formation will publish the acceptable key-value pair, for example key = "LakeFormationTrustedCaller" and value = "TRUE" and the third party integrator must properly tag the temporary security credentials that will be used to call Lake Formation's administrative APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| create_database_default_permissions   | core | json          | Specifies whether access control on newly created database is managed by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permissions. A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permissions. A value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indicates access control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as the setting "Use only IAM access control," and is for backward compatibility with the Glue permission model implemented by IAM permissions. The only permitted values are an empty array or an array that contains a single JSON object that grants ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS.
