# WasmPlugin

WasmPlugin is a Google Cloud resource used to extend the functionality of Envoy-based service proxies with WebAssembly (Wasm) modules. It allows developers to dynamically load and run custom logic, such as authentication, telemetry, or traffic manipulation, without modifying the proxy code. This enables flexible and efficient customization of service behavior in GKE, Anthos, or other GCP-managed environments.
