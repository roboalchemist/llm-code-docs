# AWS IAM user can update the trust policy for a role with administrative privileges

## Description{% #description %}

In AWS environments, some IAM permissions can lead to privilege escalation, where an identity can gain access to another more privileged identity. This rule identifies when a given user can use `iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` to modify an existing trust policy for an IAM role with administrative privileges. By modifying the role trust policy, an adversary could assume that role and leverage their privileges.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

The identity which triggered this detection can update the trust policy for a role with administrative privileges, giving them access to the privileges of that role.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Datadog recommends reducing the permissions attached to an IAM user to the minimum required for the user to fulfill their function. To remediate the issue, either remove the `iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy` permission entirely, or modify the resource specified in the IAM policy.
