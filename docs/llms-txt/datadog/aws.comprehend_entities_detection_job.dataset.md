# Comprehend Entities Detection Job Properties

Comprehend Entities Detection Job Properties in AWS describe the details of an entity detection job run by Amazon Comprehend. It includes information such as the job ID, job status, input and output data configuration, language code, job name, and timestamps. This resource helps track and manage large-scale text analysis tasks where Comprehend identifies entities like people, places, organizations, and other categories within documents.
