# Warehouse Integrations

## Overview{% #overview %}

Datadog Data Observability connects directly to your cloud data warehouse to help monitor the health of your data. When connected, Datadog automatically syncs your warehouse's metadata and query history to detect data quality, cost, performance, and usage issues.

Use these integrations to:

- **Sync your data schema** to keep Datadog in sync with your warehouse structure
- **Create data quality monitors** to catch anomalies before they impact downstream dashboards and models
- **Analyze query and job history** to understand usage patterns, costs, and performance
- **Trace column-level lineage** to map dependencies and pinpoint root causes of data issues
