# Service Management Service

Service Management Service in Google Cloud Platform provides APIs and tools to create, configure, manage, and publish managed services. It allows developers to define service configurations, manage service versions, and control access and usage through service consumers. This service is commonly used to manage APIs and backend services that are integrated with Google Cloud's API Gateway and Service Infrastructure.

| apis                 | core | json          | A list of API interfaces exported by this service. Only the `name` field of the google.protobuf.Api needs to be provided by the configuration author, as the remaining fields will be derived from the IDL during the normalization process. It is an error to specify an API interface here which cannot be resolved against the associated IDL files.                   |
| aspects              | core | json          | Configuration aspects. This is a repeated field to allow multiple aspects to be configured. The kind field in each ConfigAspect specifies the type of aspect. The spec field contains the configuration for that aspect. The schema for the spec field is defined by the backend service owners.                                                                          |
