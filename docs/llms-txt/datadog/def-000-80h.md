Classification:attackTactic:[TA0005-defense-evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005)Technique:[T1222-file-and-directory-permissions-modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)
## What happened{% #what-happened %}

The file `{{ @file.path }}` was made executable by the process `{{ @process.comm }}`.

## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect malicious payloads that have been downloaded and then executed.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule generates a signal when the executable bit is added to a newly created file in a container.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if `{{@file.path}}` is part of a legitimate application.
1. If it is not expected, develop a timeline by reviewing related signals and any relevant logs.
1. Attempt to contain the compromise (possibly by terminating the workload, depending on the stage of attack). Follow your organization's internal processes for investigating and remediating compromised systems.
