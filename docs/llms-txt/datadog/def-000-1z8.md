## Description{% #description %}

Enable role-based access control (RBAC) for Azure Key Vault to provide more granular access control and better security management compared to traditional access policies.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Configure RBAC authorization for your Key Vault through the Azure portal, CLI, or ARM templates by setting the `enableRbacAuthorization` property to `true`. For detailed guidance, see the [Microsoft Azure Key Vault RBAC guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide) and [migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-migration).
