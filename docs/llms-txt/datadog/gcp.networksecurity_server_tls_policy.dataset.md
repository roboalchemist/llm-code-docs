# Server TLS Policy

A Server TLS Policy in Google Cloud defines the configuration for Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings used by a service. It specifies parameters such as supported TLS versions, allowed cipher suites, and certificate requirements to ensure secure communication between clients and servers. This policy helps enforce consistent security standards across services.

| _key                 | core | string        |
| allow_open           | core | bool          | This field applies only for Traffic Director policies. It is must be set to false for Application Load Balancer policies. Determines if server allows plaintext connections. If set to true, server allows plain text connections. By default, it is set to false. This setting is not exclusive of other encryption modes. For example, if `allow_open` and `mtls_policy` are set, server allows both plain text and mTLS connections. See documentation of other encryption modes to confirm compatibility. Consider using it if you wish to upgrade in place your deployment to TLS while having mixed TLS and non-TLS traffic reaching port :80. |
