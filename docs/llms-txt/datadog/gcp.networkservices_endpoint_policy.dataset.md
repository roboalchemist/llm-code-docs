# Endpoint Policy

An Endpoint Policy in Google Cloud defines access control and security rules for network endpoints. It allows administrators to specify which clients or services can connect to particular endpoints, enforcing conditions such as identity, device attributes, or location. This helps ensure secure and compliant communication across services.

This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that applies authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints. Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is disabled(no authz checks) for this endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This is typically used for sidecar model where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only when EndpointPolicyType is SIDECAR_PROXY. |
