# Verify Who Owns /etc/shells File

## Description{% #description %}

To properly set the owner of `/etc/shells`, run the command:

```
$ sudo chown root /etc/shells
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

The `/etc/shells` file contains the list of full pathnames to shells on the system. Since this file is used by many system programs this file should be protected.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if id "0" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  newown="0"
fi
if [[ -z ${newown} ]]; then
  echo "0 is not a defined user on the system"
  exit 1
fi
chown $newown /etc/shells
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.
