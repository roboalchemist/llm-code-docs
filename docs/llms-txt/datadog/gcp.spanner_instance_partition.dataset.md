# Cloud Spanner Instance Partition

A Cloud Spanner Instance Partition is a logical subdivision of a Cloud Spanner instance that allows you to isolate workloads and scale compute resources independently within the same instance. Each partition can handle its own set of databases and queries, enabling better performance management and cost optimization for large-scale or multi-tenant applications.

| etag                  | core | string        | Used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a instance partition from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform instance partition updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response which contains instance partitions, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to update instance partitions to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the instance partition. If no etag is provided in the call to update instance partition, then the existing instance partition is overwritten blindly. |

Must be unique per project and between 4 and 30 characters in length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
