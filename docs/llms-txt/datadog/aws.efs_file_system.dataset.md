# EFS File System

Amazon EFS File System is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic file storage service for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It provides a simple interface to create and configure file systems that can be accessed concurrently from multiple Amazon EC2 instances. EFS automatically grows and shrinks as files are added or removed, offering high availability and durability across multiple Availability Zones. It is ideal for workloads that require shared file storage with high throughput and low latency, such as content management, web serving, and data analytics.

| size_in_bytes                   | core | json      | The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its Value field, and the time at which that size was determined in its Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time. |
