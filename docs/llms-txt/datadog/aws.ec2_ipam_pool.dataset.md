# IPAM Pool

An IPAM Pool in AWS is a collection of CIDR blocks managed by Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). It provides a way to organize, allocate, and track IP address space across accounts and regions. Pools can be public or private, and administrators can delegate them to different organizational units or projects.

Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| allocation_resource_tags          | core | json   | Tags that are required for resources that use CIDRs from this IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these tags will not be allowed to allocate space from the pool. If the resources have their tags changed after they have allocated space or if the allocation tagging requirements are changed on the pool, the resource may be marked as noncompliant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| auto_import                       | core | bool   | If selected, IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only. A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work. |

"ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elastic IP addresses and VPCs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| ipam_scope_type                   | core | string | In IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP space for a single network. The private scope is intended for all private IP address space. The public scope is intended for all public IP address space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP addresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP address overlap or conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| locale                            | core | string | The locale of the IPAM pool. The locale for the pool should be one of the following: An Amazon Web Services Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. The network border group for an Amazon Web Services Local Zone where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations (supported Local Zones). This option is only available for IPAM IPv4 pools in the public scope. If you choose an Amazon Web Services Region for locale that has not been configured as an operating Region for the IPAM, you'll get an error.                                                                                                                                                         |
