| password_profile                         | core | json          | Specifies the password profile for the user. The profile contains the user's password. This property is required when a user is created. The password in the profile must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the passwordPolicies property. By default, a strong password is required. Returned only on $select. Supports $filter (eq, ne, not, in, and eq on null values). To update this property: User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All is the least privileged permission to update this property. In delegated scenarios, the User Administrator Microsoft Entra role is the least privileged admin role supported to update this property for nonadmin users. Privileged Authentication Administrator is the least privileged role that's allowed to update this property for all administrators in the tenant. In general, the signed-in user must have a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in Who can reset passwords. In app-only scenarios, the calling app must be assigned a supported permission and at least the User Administrator Microsoft Entra role. |
