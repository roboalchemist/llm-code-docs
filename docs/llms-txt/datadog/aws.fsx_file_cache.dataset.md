# File Cache

AWS File Cache is a fully managed, high-speed cache on AWS that accelerates access to file data stored in on-premises or cloud file systems and object stores. It provides a unified namespace and reduces latency by keeping frequently accessed data closer to compute resources, improving performance for workloads like media processing, machine learning, and big data analytics.
