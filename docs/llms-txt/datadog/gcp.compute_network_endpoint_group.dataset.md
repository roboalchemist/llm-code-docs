# Network Endpoint Group

A Network Endpoint Group (NEG) in Google Cloud is a collection of network endpoints, such as IP and port combinations, that represent backend services for load balancing. NEGs allow more granular traffic distribution by targeting specific instances, containers, or serverless services. They are commonly used with HTTP(S) load balancers to improve flexibility, scalability, and performance of applications.
