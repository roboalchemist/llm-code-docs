# Neptune DB clusters should have deletion protection enabled
 
## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies whether a Neptune DB cluster has deletion protection activated.

Enabling deletion protection adds an extra safeguard to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of the database. When deletion protection is active, the Neptune DB cluster cannot be deleted. To proceed with deletion, you must first disable deletion protection.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on enabling deletion protection, please refer to the [Deleting a DB Instance in Amazon Neptune](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/manage-console-instances-delete.html) section of the Neptune User Guide.
