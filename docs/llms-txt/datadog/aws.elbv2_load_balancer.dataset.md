# Elastic Load Balancing Load Balancer

An Elastic Load Balancing Load Balancer in AWS automatically distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It improves availability, fault tolerance, and scalability by routing traffic based on health checks and routing rules. Different types are available, including Application, Network, and Gateway Load Balancers, each optimized for specific use cases.

The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can route requests only from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer. |
