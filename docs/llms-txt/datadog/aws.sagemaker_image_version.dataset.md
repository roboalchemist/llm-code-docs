# SageMaker Image Version

SageMaker Image Version in AWS represents a specific version of a SageMaker Image, which is a container image used to run machine learning algorithms, training jobs, or inference endpoints. Each version is immutable and tied to a particular container image digest, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments. This allows data scientists and developers to manage updates, rollbacks, and compatibility of their ML workflows with precise control over the runtime environment.
