# Policy

A Policy in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a set of permissions that define what actions groups of users can perform on specific resources within a tenancy. Policies are written in a simple, human-readable language and are attached at the compartment or tenancy level. They enable fine-grained access control by allowing or denying operations across services, ensuring secure and controlled resource management.
