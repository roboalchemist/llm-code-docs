# AWS IAM user can assume multiple roles with administrative privileges cross-account
 
## Description{% #description %}

In AWS environments, some IAM permissions can lead to privilege escalation, where an identity can gain access to another, more privileged identity. This rule identifies when a given user can use `sts:AssumeRole` to assume multiple IAM roles with administrative privileges in different accounts in your AWS environment. By assuming these more privileged roles, an adversary can leverage their permissions for further access.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

The identity which triggered this detection can assume multiple IAM roles with administrative privileges in different accounts in your AWS environment, giving them access to the privileges of that role.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Datadog recommends reducing the permissions attached to an IAM user to the minimum required for the user to fulfill its function. To remediate the issue, either remove the `sts:AssumeRole` permission entirely, or modify the resources specified in the IAM policy.
