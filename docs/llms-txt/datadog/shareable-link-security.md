# How are shared blueprint links secured?

A shared link should be treated as a password or secret and handled accordingly, since anyone with access to the link can view your blueprint. The link itself contains a secret access key.

You can disable sharing for a blueprint by navigating to **Share & Export** > **Get shareable link**. By default, shared links are disabled.

To share a diagram with your team, Cloudcraft recommends using the team and organization sharing controls.
