# BigQuery Dataset

A BigQuery Dataset in Google Cloud is a logical container used to organize and manage tables, views, and other BigQuery resources. It provides a way to group related data, control access permissions, and manage data location within a specific region. Datasets serve as the top-level structure for storing and querying large-scale analytical data in BigQuery.

| access                           | core | json          | Optional. An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER; access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER; If you patch a dataset, then this field is overwritten by the patched dataset's access field. To add entities, you must supply the entire existing access array in addition to any new entities that you want to add.                   |

| dataset_reference                | core | json          | Required. A reference that identifies the dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| default_collation                | core | string        | Optional. Defines the default collation specification of future tables created in the dataset. If a table is created in this dataset without table-level default collation, then the table inherits the dataset default collation, which is applied to the string fields that do not have explicit collation specified. A change to this field affects only tables created afterwards, and does not alter the existing tables. The following values are supported: * 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive. * '': empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| default_encryption_configuration | core | json          | The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. After this property is set, the encryption key of all newly-created tables in the dataset is set to this value unless the table creation request or query explicitly overrides the key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| default_partition_expiration_ms  | core | int64         | This default partition expiration, expressed in milliseconds. When new time-partitioned tables are created in a dataset where this property is set, the table will inherit this value, propagated as the `TimePartitioning.expirationMs` property on the new table. If you set `TimePartitioning.expirationMs` explicitly when creating a table, the `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` of the containing dataset is ignored. When creating a partitioned table, if `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` is set, the `defaultTableExpirationMs` value is ignored and the table will not be inherit a table expiration deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| default_rounding_mode            | core | string        | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| default_table_expiration_ms      | core | int64         | Optional. The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum lifetime value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). To clear an existing default expiration with a PATCH request, set to 0. Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property. |
| description                      | core | string        | Optional. A user-friendly description of the dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| etag                             | core | string        | Output only. A hash of the resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| id                               | core | string        | Output only. The fully-qualified unique name of the dataset in the format projectId:datasetId. The dataset name without the project name is given in the datasetId field. When creating a new dataset, leave this field blank, and instead specify the datasetId field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| is_case_insensitive              | core | bool          | Optional. TRUE if the dataset and its table names are case-insensitive, otherwise FALSE.
