# WAF Classic rule groups should be migrated to WAFv2

## Description{% #description %}

All AWS WAF Classic resources should be migrated to WAFv2 as WAF Classic support ends on September 30, 2025. WAFv2 offers a more flexible rule structure, including reusable rule groups, and provides better visibility with detailed logging and metrics. It also supports advanced rate limiting, a wider range of conditions, and integration with AWS Firewall Manager for centralized policy management.

For guidance on migrating WAF Classic resources, refer to the [Migrating your AWS WAF Classic resources to AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-migrating-from-classic.html) section in the AWS WAF Developer Guide.
