# Application Instrumentation

## Overview{% #overview %}

Application instrumentation (Instrumentation is the process of adding code to your application to capture and report observability data to Datadog, such as traces, metrics, and logs.) with Datadog APM involves:

1. **SDK setup**: Adding a Datadog SDK to your application.

1. **Span creation**: Capturing observability data as span (A span is a logical unit of work in a distributed system for a given period.)s.

Spans are automatically generated by default as soon as the SDK is loaded. This is known as **auto-instrumentation** and provides sufficient visibility for most users. If you need more control, you can optionally add custom spans.

**Note**: These steps assume you have a [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) installed and configured to receive traces.

## Getting started{% #getting-started %}

{% alert level="info" %}
**Prefer vendor-neutral instrumentation?** See the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/) for using OpenTelemetry with Datadog.
{% /alert %}

### Single step instrumentation (recommended){% #single-step-instrumentation-recommended %}

[Single Step Instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/single-step-apm/) (SSI) automatically installs and configures Datadog SDKs with a single command. Auto-instrumentation then immediately begins capturing traces from your supported frameworks and libraries, with no code changes required.

- [Get started with Single Step Instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/single-step-apm/)

### Manual setup and custom spans{% #manual-setup-and-custom-spans %}

As your observability needs grow, you can add more control and customization:

**For full SDK configuration control:** Use [manually managed Datadog SDKs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dd_libraries/) if you need granular control over SDK behavior and configuration.

- [Use manually managed Datadog SDKs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dd_libraries/)

**For custom spans without code changes:** Use [Dynamic Instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dynamic_instrumentation/) to create custom spans from the Datadog UI without redeploying your application.

- [Add custom spans with Dynamic Instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/dynamic_instrumentation/)

**For custom spans in code:** Add [code-based custom instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/custom_instrumentation/) to instrument custom business logic or add application-specific metadata to spans.

- [Add custom spans with code-based instrumentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/custom_instrumentation/)

These options can be combined. For example, you can start with Single Step Instrumentation and add code-based custom instrumentation for specific spans, or use manually managed SDKs with Dynamic Instrumentation for no-deploy span additions.

### SDK setup{% #sdk-setup %}

Single Step Instrumentation is the recommended starting point for most users. If you need more control over SDK configuration, you can use manually managed SDKs instead:

### Span customization{% #span-customization %}

Auto-instrumentation automatically creates spans for supported frameworks and libraries, providing essential observability with no additional work. When you need visibility into custom code paths or want to enrich traces with application-specific data, you can add custom spans using either Dynamic Instrumentation or code-based custom instrumentation:
