# IoT FleetWise Campaign

An AWS IoT FleetWise Campaign is a resource that defines how vehicle data is collected, processed, and transferred to the cloud. It specifies which signals to gather from vehicles, the conditions for data collection, and the destination for the data. Campaigns help optimize data usage by controlling frequency, filtering, and event-based triggers, enabling efficient analysis and insights from connected vehicle fleets.
