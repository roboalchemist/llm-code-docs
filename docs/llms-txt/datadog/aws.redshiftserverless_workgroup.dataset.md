# Redshift Serverless Workgroup

Redshift Serverless Workgroup in AWS is a compute environment that runs serverless Amazon Redshift queries without needing to manage clusters. It provides isolated resources for running analytics workloads, automatically scaling capacity based on demand. Workgroups define the compute and networking configuration, including VPC, subnets, and security settings, making it easier to run data warehousing tasks with flexible performance and cost efficiency.
