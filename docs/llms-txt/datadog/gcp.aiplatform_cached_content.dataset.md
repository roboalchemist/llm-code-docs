# Vertex AI Cached Content

Vertex AI Cached Content is a Google Cloud resource that stores and manages cached data generated by Vertex AI models and pipelines. It helps improve performance and reduce costs by reusing previously computed results, such as model predictions or dataset transformations, instead of recalculating them. This resource supports efficient retrieval and sharing of cached artifacts across Vertex AI workflows.
