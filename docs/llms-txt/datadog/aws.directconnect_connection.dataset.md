# Direct Connect Connection

A Direct Connect Connection in AWS provides a dedicated network link between your on-premises data center and AWS. It offers a more consistent network experience compared to internet-based connections, with lower latency and higher bandwidth. This connection enables secure, private communication to AWS services, supporting workloads that require stable and predictable performance.
