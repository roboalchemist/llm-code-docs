# RDS DB Snapshot

An RDS DB Snapshot in AWS is a backup of a relational database instance at a specific point in time. It captures the entire database state, including schema, data, and configuration, allowing you to restore the database to that exact moment. Snapshots can be created manually or automatically and are stored in Amazon S3 for durability. They are useful for disaster recovery, cloning databases, or migrating data across regions and accounts.

| snapshot_database_time              | core | timestamp  | The timestamp of the most recent transaction applied to the database that you're backing up. Thus, if you restore a snapshot, SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in the restored DB instance. In contrast, originalSnapshotCreateTime specifies the system time that the snapshot completed. If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag by comparing SnapshotDatabaseTime with originalSnapshotCreateTime. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime is two hours later than SnapshotDatabaseTime, then the replica lag is two hours. |
