# Lambda Function

AWS Lambda Function is a serverless compute resource that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. It supports multiple runtimes, scales automatically, and charges only for execution time. Functions can be triggered by AWS services, HTTP requests, or custom events, making it ideal for event-driven applications, automation, and backend services.
