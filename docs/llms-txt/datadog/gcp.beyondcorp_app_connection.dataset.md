# BeyondCorp AppConnection

BeyondCorp AppConnection in Google Cloud is a resource that defines a secure connection between a user and a private application using BeyondCorp Enterprise. It enables zero-trust access by managing how users connect to internal apps without requiring a traditional VPN. The AppConnection specifies details such as the application endpoint, connectors, and routing configuration to ensure secure, identity-aware access.
