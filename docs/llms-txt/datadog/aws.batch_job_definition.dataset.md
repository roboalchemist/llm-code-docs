# Batch Job Definition

An AWS Batch Job Definition is a resource that specifies how batch jobs should be run in AWS Batch. It defines parameters such as the container image, vCPUs, memory requirements, environment variables, IAM roles, and retry strategies. Job definitions allow you to standardize job configurations and reuse them across multiple job submissions, ensuring consistency and easier management of workloads.
