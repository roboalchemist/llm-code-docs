# Group

A Group in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a collection of users that share the same permissions. Instead of assigning policies to individual users, administrators assign them to groups, making it easier to manage access control at scale. Groups are central to OCI's Identity and Access Management (IAM) framework, enabling consistent and secure governance of resources.
