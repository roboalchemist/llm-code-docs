# Verify pam_pwhistory module is activated

## Description{% #description %}

The `pam_pwhistory.so` module is part of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) framework designed to increase password security. It works by storing a history of previously used passwords for each user, ensuring users cannot alternate between the same passwords too frequently.

This module is incompatible with Kerberos. Furthermore, its usage with `NIS` or `LDAP` is generally impractical, as other machines can not access local password histories.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Enforcing strong passwords increases the difficulty and resources required for password compromise.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if dpkg-query --show --showformat='${db:Status-Status}' 'libpam-runtime' 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^installed$'; then

if [ -f /usr/bin/authselect ]; then
    if authselect list-features sssd | grep -q with-pwhistory; then
        if ! authselect check; then
        echo "
        authselect integrity check failed. Remediation aborted!
        This remediation could not be applied because an authselect profile was not selected or the selected profile is not intact.
        It is not recommended to manually edit the PAM files when authselect tool is available.
        In cases where the default authselect profile does not cover a specific demand, a custom authselect profile is recommended."
        exit 1
