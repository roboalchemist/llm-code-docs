# SageMaker Model Package

An AWS SageMaker Model Package is a container for machine learning models that includes model artifacts, inference code, and metadata. It enables versioning, sharing, and deployment of models across different environments. Model packages can be created, validated, and stored in the SageMaker Model Registry, making it easier to manage the lifecycle of ML models and ensure consistent deployment.
