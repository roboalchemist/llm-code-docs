# Dataproc Job

A Dataproc Job in Google Cloud is a workload submitted to a Dataproc cluster for processing big data tasks. It supports running jobs using open-source frameworks like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and Pig. Users can submit jobs directly without managing the underlying infrastructure, and Dataproc handles resource allocation, scaling, and monitoring. This allows efficient execution of data processing, analytics, and machine learning workloads on managed clusters.
