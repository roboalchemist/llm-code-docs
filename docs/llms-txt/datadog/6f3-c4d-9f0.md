## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when an AWS security group is opened to the world.

Monitor CloudTrail and detect when an AWS security group has been created or modified with one of the following API calls:

- [AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress.html)

This rule inspects the `@requestParameters.ipPermissions.items.ipRanges.items.cidrIp` array to determine if either of the strings are contained:

- `0.0.0.0/0`
- `::/0`

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}
