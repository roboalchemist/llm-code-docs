# Storage Insights Dataset Config

Storage Insights Dataset Config in GCP defines the configuration for datasets used by Storage Insights. It manages how data is collected, stored, and analyzed for insights into storage usage and performance. This resource helps automate dataset creation and configuration to support reporting and monitoring of storage metrics across Google Cloud Storage environments.
