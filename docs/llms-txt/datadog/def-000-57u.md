# All GIDs referenced in /etc/passwd must be defined in /etc/group

## Description{% #description %}

Add a group to the system for each GID referenced without a corresponding group.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

If a user is assigned the Group Identifier (GID) of a group not existing on the system, and a group with the Group Identifier (GID) is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to any files associated with the group.
