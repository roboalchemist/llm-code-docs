# Storage Transfer Service Transfer Job

A Storage Transfer Service Transfer Job in Google Cloud is a managed resource that automates data transfers between storage systems. It supports moving data from on-premises storage, other cloud providers, or Google Cloud Storage buckets. The job defines the source, destination, schedule, and transfer options, enabling efficient, secure, and repeatable data migration or synchronization workflows without manual intervention.

| name                   | core | string        | A unique name (within the transfer project) assigned when the job is created. If this field is empty in a CreateTransferJobRequest, Storage Transfer Service assigns a unique name. Otherwise, the specified name is used as the unique name for this job. If the specified name is in use by a job, the creation request fails with an ALREADY_EXISTS error. This name must start with `"transferJobs/"` prefix and end with a letter or a number, and should be no more than 128 characters. For transfers involving PosixFilesystem, this name must start with `transferJobs/OPI` specifically. For all other transfer types, this name must not start with `transferJobs/OPI`. Non-PosixFilesystem example: `"transferJobs/^(?!OPI)[A-Za-z0-9-._~]*[A-Za-z0-9]$"` PosixFilesystem example: `"transferJobs/OPI^[A-Za-z0-9-._~]*[A-Za-z0-9]$"` Applications must not rely on the enforcement of naming requirements involving OPI. Invalid job names fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. |
