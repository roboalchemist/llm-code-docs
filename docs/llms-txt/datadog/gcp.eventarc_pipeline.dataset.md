# Eventarc Pipeline

Eventarc Pipeline is a Google Cloud resource that enables the creation of event-driven workflows by connecting event sources to destinations through a managed pipeline. It allows users to route, filter, and transform events across Google Cloud services and external systems. This helps automate processes and integrate applications using standardized event formats.
