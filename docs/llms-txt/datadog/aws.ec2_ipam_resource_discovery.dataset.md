# IPAM Resource Discovery

IPAM Resource Discovery in AWS is a component of Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) that enables automatic detection and tracking of IP address usage across accounts and regions. It helps centralize visibility into IP address allocations by discovering resources such as VPCs, subnets, and Elastic IPs. This allows administrators to manage IP address space more efficiently, avoid conflicts, and ensure compliance with organizational policies.
