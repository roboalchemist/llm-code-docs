# BigQuery Data Transfer Config

BigQuery Data Transfer Config is a Google Cloud resource that automates data movement into BigQuery from various sources such as Google Ads, YouTube, Cloud Storage, or external SaaS applications. It defines the configuration for scheduled or on-demand data transfers, including source type, destination dataset, refresh frequency, and credentials. This resource helps streamline data ingestion, ensuring that BigQuery tables stay up to date without manual intervention.

| data_refresh_window_days  | core | int64         | The number of days to look back to automatically refresh the data. For example, if `data_refresh_window_days = 10`, then every day BigQuery reingests data for [today-10, today-1], rather than ingesting data for just [today-1]. Only valid if the data source supports the feature. Set the value to 0 to use the default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
