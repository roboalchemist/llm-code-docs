# Batch Job

Batch Job in Google Cloud is a managed service that allows you to run batch workloads at scale without managing infrastructure. It is designed for parallel, high-throughput, or long-running tasks such as data processing, simulations, or machine learning pipelines. Batch Jobs handle resource provisioning, scheduling, retries, and job monitoring, making it easier to focus on workload logic rather than cluster management.
