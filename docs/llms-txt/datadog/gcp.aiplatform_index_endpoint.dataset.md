# Vertex AI Index Endpoint

Vertex AI Index Endpoint is a managed service in Google Cloud that hosts vector indexes for similarity search and retrieval. It provides a scalable and low-latency endpoint where machine learning models or applications can query embeddings to find the most relevant matches. This resource is commonly used in recommendation systems, semantic search, and generative AI applications, enabling efficient deployment and serving of vector-based search workloads without managing infrastructure.
