# QuickSight User

An AWS QuickSight User represents an individual account within Amazon QuickSight, a business intelligence service. It defines user identity, role, and permissions for accessing dashboards, analyses, and datasets. This resource is used to manage who can log in to QuickSight and what level of access they have, such as reader, author, or admin.
