# Cloud Spanner Database

Cloud Spanner Database is a fully managed, horizontally scalable, and strongly consistent relational database service on Google Cloud. It combines the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of non-relational systems. Spanner automatically handles replication, sharding, and failover across regions, providing high availability and global consistency. It supports standard SQL queries and integrates with other GCP services for analytics and application development.

This value is continuously updated by Cloud Spanner and becomes stale the moment it is queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when you initiate the recovery.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| encryption_info          | core | json          | Output only. For databases that are using customer managed encryption, this field contains the encryption information for the database, such as all Cloud KMS key versions that are in use. The `encryption_status` field inside of each `EncryptionInfo` is not populated. For databases that are using Google default or other types of encryption, this field is empty. This field is propagated lazily from the backend. There might be a delay from when a key version is being used and when it appears in this field. |
