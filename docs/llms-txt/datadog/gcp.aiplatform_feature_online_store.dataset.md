# Vertex AI Feature Online Store

Vertex AI Feature Online Store is a managed service in Google Cloud that provides low-latency access to machine learning features for online prediction. It stores and serves feature values generated by feature engineering pipelines, ensuring consistency between training and serving data. This enables real-time inference with up-to-date feature data integrated into Vertex AI workflows.
