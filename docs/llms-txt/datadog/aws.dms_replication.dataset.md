# Database Migration Service Replication Instance

An AWS Database Migration Service Replication Instance is a managed compute resource that runs the replication tasks for migrating and continuously replicating data between databases. It provides the processing power, memory, and network capacity needed to perform schema conversion, data migration, and ongoing replication with minimal downtime.
