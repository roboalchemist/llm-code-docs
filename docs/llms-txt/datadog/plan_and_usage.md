# Plan and Usage Settings

[Administrators](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/users/default_roles/) can access the [organization settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing) by clicking Plan & Usage from the Account menu in the bottom of the left side navigation or by selecting Plan & Usage from the header dropdown at the top of the Personal Settings page.

## Usage reports{% #usage-reports %}

View hourly usage of your account across all billable parameters as well as the top 5000 custom metrics submitted. If your organization is the parent-organization in a [multi-org account](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/), you can also view the usage of child-organization accounts by toggling between "Overall" and "Individual Organizations" at the top of the page. Individual child-organization accounts are isolated. They are only able to view their own usage and custom metrics.

**Note**: Allow up to 72 hours for this section to update.

Further detailed usage reports can also be created [on request](mailto://success@datadoghq.com) by your account representative.

## Plan settings{% #plan-settings %}

Upgrade or downgrade your account from the **Plan** tab on the Plan & Usage section.

**Note**: Contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com) to add or remove paid features that are not part of standard plans.

## Billing history{% #billing-history %}

Your account billing history is available from the **Billing History** tab in the [Plan & Usage section](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/billing). For specific billing questions, contact your account representative or [success@datadoghq.com](mailto://success@datadoghq.com).
