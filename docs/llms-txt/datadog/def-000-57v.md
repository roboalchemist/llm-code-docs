# EC2 instances should be managed by SSM

## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies that running EC2 instances are managed by AWS Systems Manager (SSM). SSM is a service designed to monitor, manage and patch your AWS infrastructure.

EC2 instances should be managed by SSM to enhance security, ensure compliance, and streamline management. SSM enables centralized control, automated monitoring, and remediation of policy violations, while simplifying configuration and maintenance of instances.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on managing EC2 instances with SSM, refer to the [Amazon EC2 host management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/quick-setup-host-management.html) section of the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.
