# Secrets Manager Secret

An AWS Secrets Manager Secret is a secure resource used to store, manage, and retrieve sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. It helps eliminate the need to hardcode secrets in applications by providing controlled access through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Secrets can be automatically rotated, encrypted at rest, and accessed programmatically, ensuring better security and compliance.

| deleted_date          | core | timestamp  | The date the secret is scheduled for deletion. If it is not scheduled for deletion, this field is omitted. When you delete a secret, Secrets Manager requires a recovery window of at least 7 days before deleting the secret. Some time after the deleted date, Secrets Manager deletes the secret, including all of its versions. If a secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including the encrypted secret value, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled deletion and restore access to the secret, use RestoreSecret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| version_ids_to_stages | core | string     | A list of the versions of the secret that have staging labels attached. Versions that don't have staging labels are considered deprecated and Secrets Manager can delete them. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a secret version during rotation. The three staging labels for rotation are: AWSCURRENT, which indicates the current version of the secret. AWSPENDING, which indicates the version of the secret that contains new secret information that will become the next current version when rotation finishes. During rotation, Secrets Manager creates an AWSPENDING version ID before creating the new secret version. To check if a secret version exists, call GetSecretValue. AWSPREVIOUS, which indicates the previous current version of the secret. You can use this as the last known good version.
