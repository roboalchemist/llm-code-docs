# Lightsail Alarm

Lightsail Alarm is a monitoring resource in Amazon Lightsail that lets you track the health and performance of your instances, databases, and other resources. It allows you to set thresholds on metrics such as CPU utilization, memory, or network activity, and automatically notifies you when those thresholds are breached. This helps you maintain application availability and respond quickly to performance issues.

| statistic               | core | string        | The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. The following statistics are available: Minimum - The lowest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your application. Maximum - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application. Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric. Average - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources. SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation. |

| treat_missing_data      | core | string        | Specifies how the alarm handles missing data points. An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways: breaching - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold. Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold. notBreaching - Assume the missing data is within the threshold. Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold. ignore - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm state. missing - Missing data is treated as missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
