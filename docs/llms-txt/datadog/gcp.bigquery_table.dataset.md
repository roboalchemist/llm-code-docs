# BigQuery Table

A BigQuery Table in Google Cloud is a structured dataset container that stores rows and columns of data within a BigQuery dataset. It supports both structured and semi-structured data, enabling fast SQL-based queries at scale. Tables can be partitioned and clustered for performance optimization and cost efficiency.

| default_collation              | core | string        | Optional. Defines the default collation specification of new STRING fields in the table. During table creation or update, if a STRING field is added to this table without explicit collation specified, then the table inherits the table default collation. A change to this field affects only fields added afterwards, and does not alter the existing fields. The following values are supported: * 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive. * '': empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior.                                                                                          |
