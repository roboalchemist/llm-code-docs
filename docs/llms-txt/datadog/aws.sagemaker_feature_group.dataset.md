# SageMaker Feature Group

SageMaker Feature Group is a managed resource in Amazon SageMaker that stores and manages machine learning features for training and inference. It provides a centralized, consistent way to define, access, and update features, supporting both real-time and batch use cases. Feature Groups help ensure data consistency between training and production, simplify feature reuse, and integrate with other AWS services for scalable machine learning workflows.

| throughput_config              | core | json       | Active throughput configuration of the feature group. There are two modes: ON_DEMAND and PROVISIONED. With on-demand mode, you are charged for data reads and writes that your application performs on your feature group. You do not need to specify read and write throughput because Feature Store accommodates your workloads as they ramp up and down. You can switch a feature group to on-demand only once in a 24 hour period. With provisioned throughput mode, you specify the read and write capacity per second that you expect your application to require, and you are billed based on those limits. Exceeding provisioned throughput will result in your requests being throttled. Note: PROVISIONED throughput mode is supported only for feature groups that are offline-only, or use the Standard tier online store. |
