# BigQuery Model

A BigQuery Model in Google Cloud is a managed machine learning resource that allows users to train, store, and use ML models directly within BigQuery using SQL. It supports various model types such as linear regression, logistic regression, and boosted trees, enabling large-scale data analysis and prediction without moving data outside BigQuery.
