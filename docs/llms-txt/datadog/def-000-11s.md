# AWS IAM role has administrative privileges and is inactive

## Description{% #description %}

If an IAM role is highly privileged or has administrative privileges and is inactive, this may indicate the role is not regularly used and may be removed.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

IAM roles should be scoped down to have the fewest privileges needed to perform their function. In the event a role has not been used for an extended period of time, this may indicate that the role is no longer needed and can be removed.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Determine if the role is needed for a particular function and if not, remove it.
