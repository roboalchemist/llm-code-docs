## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect unusual logs from different geo locations made by a single user.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

The Impossible Travel detection type's algorithm compares the GeoIP data of the last log and the current log to determine if the user `{{@usr.name}}` traveled more than 500km at over 1,000km/h. This detection rule aims to identify potential threats early, allowing for timely investigation and mitigation to protect server resources and maintain service availability.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Investigate the source user `{{@usr.name}}` with requests from different geo-locations from `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.first_location.country}}` and `{{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.city}}, {{@impossible_travel.triggering_locations.second_location.country}}`.
1. Implement immediate measures to block or limit the impact of the suspicious activity if confirmed as a threat.
