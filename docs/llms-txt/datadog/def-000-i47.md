## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when Azure AI models are listed directly through API.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Azure activity logs for when someone lists models for Azure AI services. This may indicate an attacker listing models to enumerate resources and discover cloud services. Compromised keys may be used in attacks with knowledge of models such as LLM hijacking (LLMjacking).

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Verify if the user or service principal is expected to be working with specific models and Azure AI services, and if they are using these services outside of available web portals.
1. If the activity is not expected, investigate activity around the user and IP generating this event.
