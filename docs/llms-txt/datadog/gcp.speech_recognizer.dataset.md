# Speech-to-Text

Speech-to-Text is a Google Cloud service that converts spoken language into written text using machine learning models. It supports real-time and batch audio transcription, multiple languages, and domain-specific tuning. The service can process audio from various sources such as files or streaming input, making it useful for voice commands, call analytics, and caption generation.
