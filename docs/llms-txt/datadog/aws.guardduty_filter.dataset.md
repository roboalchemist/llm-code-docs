# GuardDuty Filter

GuardDuty Filter in AWS is a resource that lets you define and manage filtering criteria for findings generated by Amazon GuardDuty. Filters allow you to narrow down security findings based on attributes such as severity, type, or resource details, making it easier to focus on the most relevant threats.
