# SageMaker Model Card

SageMaker Model Card is a resource in AWS that provides a standardized way to document machine learning models. It captures key details such as model purpose, intended use, performance metrics, training data, and evaluation results. This helps improve transparency, governance, and compliance by centralizing model information for stakeholders.
