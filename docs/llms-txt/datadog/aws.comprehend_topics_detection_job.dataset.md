# Comprehend Topics Detection Job Properties

Comprehend Topics Detection Job Properties in AWS describe the details of a topic modeling job run by Amazon Comprehend. It includes information such as the job name, job status, input and output data configuration, number of topics detected, and timestamps for creation and completion. This resource helps track and manage topic detection jobs that analyze large text datasets to automatically group documents into coherent topics.
