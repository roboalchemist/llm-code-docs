# Comprehend Document Classifier Properties

Comprehend Document Classifier Properties in AWS describe the details of a custom document classifier created in Amazon Comprehend. It includes information such as the classifier's status, training start and end times, input data configuration, language code, and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This resource helps track and manage the lifecycle and performance of a document classifier used for categorizing text into user-defined labels.
