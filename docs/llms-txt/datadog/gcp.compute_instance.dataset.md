# Virtual Machine Instance

A Virtual Machine Instance in Google Cloud (GCP) is a compute resource that provides on-demand, scalable virtual servers running on Google's infrastructure. It allows you to choose machine types, operating systems, storage, and networking configurations to run applications or workloads. Instances can be customized for general-purpose, compute-optimized, or memory-optimized needs, and they integrate with other GCP services for security, monitoring, and automation.
