# Comprehend Sentiment Detection Job Properties

Comprehend Sentiment Detection Job Properties in AWS describe the details of a sentiment analysis job run by Amazon Comprehend. It includes information such as the job ID, job status, input and output data configuration, language code, and timestamps for job creation and completion. This resource helps track and manage sentiment detection tasks that analyze text to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.
