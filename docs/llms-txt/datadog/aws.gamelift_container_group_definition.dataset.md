# GameLift Container Group Definition

Defines a group of containers used in Amazon GameLift to run and manage multiplayer game server processes. A container group definition specifies the configuration for one or more containers, including resource requirements, networking, and runtime settings, enabling flexible deployment and scaling of game server workloads.

| status_reason                    | core | string     | Additional information about a container group definition that's in FAILED status. Possible reasons include: An internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift Servers from creating the container group definition resource. Delete the failed resource and call CreateContainerGroupDefinitionagain. An access-denied message means that you don't have permissions to access the container image on ECR. See IAM permission examples for help setting up required IAM permissions for Amazon GameLift Servers. The ImageUri value for at least one of the containers in the container group definition was invalid or not found in the current Amazon Web Services account. At least one of the container images referenced in the container group definition exceeds the allowed size. For size limits, see Amazon GameLift Servers endpoints and quotas. At least one of the container images referenced in the container group definition uses a different operating system than the one defined for the container group. |

If individual containers have limits, this total value must be greater than any individual container's memory limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| total_vcpu_limit                 | core | float64    | The amount of vCPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for the container group (1 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units). All containers in the group share these resources. You can set a limit for each container definition in the group. If individual containers have limits, this total value must be equal to or greater than the sum of the limits for each container in the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| version_number                   | core | int64      | Indicates the version of a particular container group definition. This number is incremented automatically when you update a container group definition.
