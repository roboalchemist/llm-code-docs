# Lookout for Equipment Model

Lookout for Equipment Model in AWS is a managed machine learning resource that analyzes sensor data from industrial equipment to detect abnormal behavior. The model is trained on historical time-series data to identify patterns that indicate potential equipment failures. Once deployed, it provides insights that help predict maintenance needs, reduce downtime, and improve operational efficiency.

For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute. When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore PT1S, the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M, and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H                                                                                                         |

| model_quality                                      | core | string     | Provides a quality assessment for a model that uses labels. If Lookout for Equipment determines that the model quality is poor based on training metrics, the value is POOR_QUALITY_DETECTED. Otherwise, the value is QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET. If the model is unlabeled, the model quality can't be assessed and the value of ModelQuality is CANNOT_DETERMINE_QUALITY. In this situation, you can get a model quality assessment by adding labels to the input dataset and retraining the model.
