# An AKS Cluster's Kubelet should be allowed to manage iptables
 
## Description{% #description %}

It is recommended that kubelets be allowed to manage changes to `iptables`. This ensures that the `iptables` configuration remains in sync with the networking configuration of your pods. Manually configuring `iptables` with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

Choose one of the following remediation methods. For both methods, a restart of the Kubelet service is required afterwards.

### Kubelet config file{% #kubelet-config-file %}

1. Add the following JSON to the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` file.

```json
"makeIPTablesUtilChains": true
```

### Executable arguments{% #executable-arguments %}

1. Edit the kubelet service file on each worker node and ensure the following parameters are part of the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string.

```bash
--make-iptables-util-chains:true
```
