# Dynamic Resource Group

A Dynamic Resource Group in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a logical group of resources that are defined by matching rules rather than static membership. Instead of manually adding resources, you create conditions based on resource attributes, and any resource that meets those conditions automatically becomes part of the group. This is commonly used with IAM policies to grant permissions to resources that match specific criteria, such as instances with certain tags or running in specific compartments, making access control more flexible and easier to manage at scale.
