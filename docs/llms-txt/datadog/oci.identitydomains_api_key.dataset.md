# API Key

An API Key in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a public key that you upload to your user account to enable secure authentication when using the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI), SDKs, or API calls. It works with a corresponding private key stored locally, allowing you to sign requests without using a password. This provides a secure and convenient way to automate and manage OCI resources programmatically.
