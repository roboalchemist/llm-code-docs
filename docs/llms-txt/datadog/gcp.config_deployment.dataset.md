# Cloud Deployment Manager Deployment

Cloud Deployment Manager Deployment is a Google Cloud resource used to automate the creation and management of GCP resources through configuration files. It allows users to define infrastructure as code using YAML or Jinja2 templates, enabling consistent, repeatable deployments. This resource manages the lifecycle of deployments, including creation, update, and deletion of associated resources.
