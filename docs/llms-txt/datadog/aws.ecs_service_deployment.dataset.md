# ECS Service Deployment

ECS Service Deployment in AWS represents the details of a deployment within an Amazon ECS service. It tracks information such as the deployment ID, status, desired and running task counts, launch type, and configuration details. This resource helps manage and monitor how new versions of a service are rolled out, ensuring controlled updates and maintaining availability during changes.
