# Managed Blockchain Node

An AWS Managed Blockchain Node is a fully managed blockchain node that allows you to join and interact with a blockchain network without having to set up or maintain the underlying infrastructure. It provides secure connectivity, automatic scaling, monitoring, and integration with other AWS services, making it easier to build and run blockchain applications.

| status                       | core | string     | The status of the node. CREATING - The Amazon Web Services account is in the process of creating a node. AVAILABLE - The node has been created and can participate in the network. UNHEALTHY - The node is impaired and might not function as expected. Amazon Managed Blockchain automatically finds nodes in this state and tries to recover them. If a node is recoverable, it returns to AVAILABLE. Otherwise, it moves to FAILED status. CREATE_FAILED - The Amazon Web Services account attempted to create a node and creation failed. UPDATING - The node is in the process of being updated. DELETING - The node is in the process of being deleted. DELETED - The node can no longer participate on the network. FAILED - The node is no longer functional, cannot be recovered, and must be deleted. INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY - The node is impaired and might not function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer managed key in KMS for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key or of revoking a grant isn't immediate. It might take some time for the node resource to discover that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and recreating the resource. |
