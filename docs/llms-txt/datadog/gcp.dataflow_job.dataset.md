# Dataflow Job

A Dataflow Job in Google Cloud is a managed service execution of a data processing pipeline built with Apache Beam. It allows you to process and transform large datasets in both batch and streaming modes without managing infrastructure. Dataflow automatically handles resource provisioning, scaling, and optimization, enabling efficient ETL, real-time analytics, and machine learning data preparation.

| _key                     | core | string        |
| ancestors                | core | array<string> |
| client_request_id        | core | string        | The client's unique identifier of the job, re-used across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. The request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client's ID and job name. The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.                    |
| create_time              | core | timestamp     | The timestamp when the job was initially created. Immutable and set by the Cloud Dataflow service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| current_state            | core | string        | The current state of the job. Jobs are created in the `JOB_STATE_STOPPED` state unless otherwise specified. A job in the `JOB_STATE_RUNNING` state may asynchronously enter a terminal state. After a job has reached a terminal state, no further state updates may be made. This field might be mutated by the Dataflow service; callers cannot mutate it.                                                                                                                                 |

| replace_job_id           | core | string        | If this job is an update of an existing job, this field is the job ID of the job it replaced. When sending a `CreateJobRequest`, you can update a job by specifying it here. The job named here is stopped, and its intermediate state is transferred to this job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| replaced_by_job_id       | core | string        | If another job is an update of this job (and thus, this job is in `JOB_STATE_UPDATED`), this field contains the ID of that job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| requested_state          | core | string        | The job's requested state. Applies to `UpdateJob` requests. Set `requested_state` with `UpdateJob` requests to switch between the states `JOB_STATE_STOPPED` and `JOB_STATE_RUNNING`. You can also use `UpdateJob` requests to change a job's state from `JOB_STATE_RUNNING` to `JOB_STATE_CANCELLED`, `JOB_STATE_DONE`, or `JOB_STATE_DRAINED`. These states irrevocably terminate the job if it hasn't already reached a terminal state. This field has no effect on `CreateJob` requests. |

| runtime_updatable_params | core | json          | This field may ONLY be modified at runtime using the projects.jobs.update method to adjust job behavior.
