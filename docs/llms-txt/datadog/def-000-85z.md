## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a GitHub Advanced Security setting has been disabled.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors GitHub audit logs for when an Advanced Security setting has been disabled. GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license, including:

- Code scanning
- Secret scanning
- Dependency review

Disabling these settings could lead to a degradation in the organization's security posture.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the change taken by `{{@github.actor}}` is authorized.
1. If the change was not authorized or was unexpected, begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
