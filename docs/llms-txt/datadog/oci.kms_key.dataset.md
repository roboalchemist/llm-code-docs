# Vault Key

A Vault Key in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a managed encryption key stored in the Vault service. It is used to protect sensitive data by enabling encryption and decryption operations for resources and applications. The key is backed by hardware security modules for strong security and can be rotated, disabled, or retired as needed.
