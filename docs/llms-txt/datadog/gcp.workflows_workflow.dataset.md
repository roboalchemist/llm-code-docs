# Workflows Workflow

Workflows Workflow in Google Cloud is a managed orchestration service that lets you connect and automate services, APIs, and functions into a defined sequence. It allows you to design workflows using a YAML or JSON syntax, enabling reliable execution of business processes and service integrations. Workflows handle retries, error handling, and long-running operations, making it easier to coordinate complex tasks across Google Cloud services and external APIs.

The `{account}` value can be the `email` address or the `unique_id` of the service account. If not provided, workflow will use the project's default service account. Modifying this field for an existing workflow results in a new workflow revision. |
