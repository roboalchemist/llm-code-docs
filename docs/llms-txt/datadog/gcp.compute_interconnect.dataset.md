# Cloud Interconnect

Cloud Interconnect on Google Cloud provides high-bandwidth, low-latency connections between your on-premises network and Google's network. It offers two main options: Dedicated Interconnect, which provides direct physical connections to Google, and Partner Interconnect, which uses a service provider to establish connectivity. This service is ideal for enterprises needing consistent, secure, and scalable network performance beyond what standard internet connections can deliver.
