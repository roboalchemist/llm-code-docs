# Palo Alto Networks Firewall - command and control traffic observed
Classification:attackTactic:[TA0011-command-and-control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011)Technique:[T1071-application-layer-protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when Palo Alto Networks (PAN) Firewall detects command and control activity.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

This rule monitors when PAN Firewall threat logs detect command and control activity. Threat logs display entries when traffic matches one of the [security profiles](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-1/pan-os-admin/policy/security-profiles#id6272be37-1ce2-4374-a431-bfb1db9da9e0) attached to a security rule on the firewall.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if this network traffic is expected for this host `{{ host }}`.
   - Look for consistent connections over time.
   - Work with the system owners to understand if it is normal.
   - Investigate if there are any relevant host based alerts.
1. If the network traffic is unexpected, begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
1. If it is a false positive, consider including the IP or host in a suppression list.
