# Incident Settings

## Overview{% #overview %}

Use [Incident Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/incidents/settings) to customize aspects of the Incident Management experience for your entire organization. These settings enable you to align your usage of Incident Management with your existing processes.

## Incident types{% #incident-types %}

Incident types allow you to apply different settings to different classes of incidents. The response for a security incident can be very different from the response for a service disruption. With incident types, you can customize each response.

To create an incident type:

1. Navigate to the [Incidents Settings](https://app.datadoghq.com/incidents/settings) page.
1. Click **Add Incident Type**.
1. Specify an Incident Type Name.
1. (Optional) Add a description.
