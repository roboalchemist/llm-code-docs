# AppSync GraphQL API

AppSync GraphQL API is a managed service in AWS that lets you build scalable GraphQL APIs by connecting to data sources like DynamoDB, Lambda, or HTTP endpoints. It handles real-time data synchronization, offline access, and security with fine-grained access control. This service simplifies API development by managing the heavy lifting of querying, caching, and data integration.

| query_depth_limit                   | core | int64  | The maximum depth a query can have in a single request. Depth refers to the amount of nested levels allowed in the body of query. The default value is 0 (or unspecified), which indicates there's no depth limit. If you set a limit, it can be between 1 and 75 nested levels. This field will produce a limit error if the operation falls out of bounds. Note that fields can still be set to nullable or non-nullable. If a non-nullable field produces an error, the error will be thrown upwards to the first nullable field available. |
| resolver_count_limit                | core | int64  | The maximum number of resolvers that can be invoked in a single request. The default value is 0 (or unspecified), which will set the limit to 10000. When specified, the limit value can be between 1 and 10000. This field will produce a limit error if the operation falls out of bounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
