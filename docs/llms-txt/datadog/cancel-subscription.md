# Cancel your Cloudcraft (Standalone) Subscription

Canceling your Cloudcraft (Standalone) subscription can be done from inside the Cloudcraft application.

Only the account owner can cancel a Cloudcraft subscription, which takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle. When you cancel your subscription, your account is downgraded to the free plan.

Upon cancellation, you can still access to the diagrams you created, but will lose access to a few features:

- *Infinite grid* blueprints switch to read-only mode.
- The *Live* feature is no longer be available.
- AWS and Azure resources no longer get updated.
- [The Bits menu](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudcraft/getting-started/using-bits-menu/) no longer works.

If you're canceling within the 30-day money-back guarantee period, and prefer a refund, reach out to Cloudcraft's support team instead.

1. Navigate to **User** > **Subscription Settings**.
1. Select **Cancel subscription**.
1. Optionally, provide feedback on what Cloudcraft can do to be a better fit for you in the future.
1. Select **Cancel my account**.

If you do not see the **Cancel subscription** option, you may have bought your subscription through the Datadog sales team or through the AWS Marketplace.

- If you bought your subscription through the Datadog sales team, it does not auto-renew and expires at the end of your billing cycle.
- If you bought your subscription through the AWS Marketplace, the cancellation process must be done through your AWS account. For more information, see [Cancel your product subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/cancel-subscription.html) in the AWS Marketplace documentation page.

{% alert level="warning" %}
Canceling a subscription does not remove your data from Cloudcraft's servers. Instead, it changes your account to the free plan. If you wish to delete your account and all data from Cloudcraft's servers, contact the Cloudcraft support team.
