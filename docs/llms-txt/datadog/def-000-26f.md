# RDS instances should be configured to copy tags to snapshots
 
## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies RDS DB instances are set to automatically copy all tags to snapshots upon creation. Proper identification and inventory management of IT assets are fundamental for robust governance and security. Full visibility into your RDS DB instances allows you to evaluate their security status and address vulnerabilities effectively. Snapshots should carry the same tags as their parent database instances to maintain consistency. Enabling tag inheritance ensures that snapshots adopt the tags of their parent instances, which aids in asset management and security tracking.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

To configure tags to automatically copy to snapshots for an RDS DB instance, refer to the [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html).
