## API and DogStatsD client libraries{% #api-and-dogstatsd-client-libraries %}

The following table lists Datadog-official and community contributed API and [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/custom_metrics/dogstatsd_metrics_submission/) client libraries. A few libraries support both the API and DogStatsD, but most focus on one or the other.
