# CloudWatch Alarm

CloudWatch Alarm is an AWS resource that monitors metrics and triggers actions when defined thresholds are met. It can watch a single metric or the result of a math expression, and when conditions are breached, it can send notifications, perform Auto Scaling actions, or stop, start, or terminate instances. This helps automate responses to changes in application performance or system health.
