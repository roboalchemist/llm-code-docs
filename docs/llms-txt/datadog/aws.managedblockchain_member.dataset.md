# Managed Blockchain Member

Managed Blockchain Member in AWS represents an individual member within a blockchain network created using Amazon Managed Blockchain. A member is an independent entity in the network with its own resources, policies, and access controls. It allows organizations to join and participate in a blockchain consortium, manage their nodes, and interact with the shared ledger while maintaining separation and governance between different members.

| status                       | core | string     | The status of a member. CREATING - The Amazon Web Services account is in the process of creating a member. AVAILABLE - The member has been created and can participate in the network. CREATE_FAILED - The Amazon Web Services account attempted to create a member and creation failed. UPDATING - The member is in the process of being updated. DELETING - The member and all associated resources are in the process of being deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED PROPOSAL to remove the member. DELETED - The member can no longer participate on the network and all associated resources are deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an APPROVED PROPOSAL to remove the member. INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY - The member is impaired and might not function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer managed key in KMS for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. The effect of disabling or deleting a key or of revoking a grant isn't immediate. It might take some time for the member resource to discover that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and recreating the resource. |
