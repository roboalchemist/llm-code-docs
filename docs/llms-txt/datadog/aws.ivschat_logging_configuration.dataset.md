# IVS Chat Logging Configuration

IVS Chat Logging Configuration in AWS defines how chat messages from Amazon IVS Chat are logged and stored. It allows you to configure destinations such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for capturing chat activity. This helps with monitoring, auditing, and analyzing chat interactions in real time or for later review.

| account_id                | core | string     |
| arn                       | core | string     | Logging-configuration ARN, from the request (if identifier was an ARN).                                                                                                                                |
| create_time               | core | timestamp  | Time when the logging configuration was created. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp; note that this is returned as a string.                                                                                |
| destination_configuration | core | json       | A complex type that contains a destination configuration for where chat content will be logged. There is only one type of destination (cloudWatchLogs, firehose, or s3) in a destinationConfiguration. |
| id                        | core | string     | Logging-configuration ID, generated by the system. This is a relative identifier, the part of the ARN that uniquely identifies the logging configuration.                                              |
