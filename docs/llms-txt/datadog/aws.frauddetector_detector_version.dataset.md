# Fraud Detector Detector Version

Fraud Detector Detector Version in AWS represents a specific version of a fraud detection model within Amazon Fraud Detector. It contains the rules, model configurations, and metadata used to evaluate events for potential fraudulent activity. Each version is immutable once created, ensuring consistent evaluation logic for fraud detection workflows.
