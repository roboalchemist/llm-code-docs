# API scan detected on service

### Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when your API endpoints are being probed by a third party. The goal of the attacker may be to find undocumented APIs or functionality.

### Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitors the HTTP errors produced by the application in API endpoints and triggers when an elevated rate is detected.

The signal is set to `LOW` severity, as the error produced by an API endpoint depends on the actual implementation of each application.

### Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Review the `4xx` errors to detect if your application is temporarily misbehaving.
1. Consider temporarily blocking the attacking IP(s) to prevent them from overloading your systems or identifying confidential resources.
