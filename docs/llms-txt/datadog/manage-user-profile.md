# Manage Your User Profile

Your user profile is where you can make updates to your personal information, such as your name and email address. You can also update your password or add a password to your account if you signed up to Cloudcraft using the **Sign in with Google** button.

## Update your name and email address{% #update-your-name-and-email-address %}

1. Navigate to **User** > **User Settings**.
1. Update your name and email address, then click **Update Name** or **Update Email**.

- If you are not using **Sign in with Google**, your login will change to reflect your new email address.
- If you are using **Sign in with Google**, the only thing that will change is the email shown in your invoices and where communications are sent to.

{% alert level="info" %}
For privacy and security purposes, your name and email address are checked against Cloudcraft's database when you submit a support request, so you will want to make sure they are correct and up-to-date.

1. Navigate to **User** > **User Settings**.
1. Click **Change Password**.

If you need to update your password â [choose a strong one](https://help.cloudcraft.co/article/59-create-strong-password) â, you can do so by clicking the blue **Change Password** button to the right of the **Login** section.

A window will open up and ask for your old and new password. Type both in and click the blue **Change Password** link at the bottom.

If you signed up for a Cloudcraft account using the **Sign in with Google** option, the **Change Password** button is replaced with an **Add Password** button. After you click the button, a password reset request will be sent to your email email address.
