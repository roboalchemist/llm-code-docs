# Install the systemd_timesyncd Service

## Description{% #description %}

The systemd_timesyncd service should be installed.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Time synchronization (using NTP) is required by almost all network and administrative tasks (syslog, cryptographic based services (authentication, etc.), etc.). systemd_timesyncd is a part of the systemd suite and acts as a NTP client.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if dpkg-query --show --showformat='${db:Status-Status}' 'linux-base' 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^installed$'; then

DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y "systemd-timesyncd"

else
    >&2 echo 'Remediation is not applicable, nothing was done'
fi
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```go
