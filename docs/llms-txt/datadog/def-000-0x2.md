# Uninstall mcstrans Package

## Description{% #description %}

The `mcstransd` daemon provides category label information to client processes requesting information. The label translations are defined in `/etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf`. The `mcstrans` package can be removed with the following command:

```

$ sudo yum erase mcstrans
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Since this service is not used very often, disable it to reduce the amount of potentially vulnerable code running on the system.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if [ ! -f /.dockerenv ] && [ ! -f /run/.containerenv ]; then

# CAUTION: This remediation script will remove mcstrans
#      from the system, and may remove any packages
#      that depend on mcstrans. Execute this
#      remediation AFTER testing on a non-production
#      system!

if rpm -q --quiet "mcstrans" ; then

    yum remove -y "mcstrans"

fi

else
    >&2 echo 'Remediation is not applicable, nothing was done'
fi
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```

  package:
    name: mcstrans
    state: absent
  when: ansible_virtualization_type not in ["docker", "lxc", "openvz", "podman", "container"]
