| instance_match_criteria        | core | string    | Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation Fleet accepts. All Capacity Reservations in the Fleet inherit this instance matching criteria. Currently, Capacity Reservation Fleets support <code>open</code> instance matching criteria only. This means that instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone) run in the Capacity Reservations automatically. Instances do not need to explicitly target a Capacity Reservation Fleet to use its reserved capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
