# SNS Topic

An SNS Topic in AWS is a communication channel that allows publishers to send messages to multiple subscribers at once. It is part of Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and supports various delivery protocols such as email, SMS, HTTP endpoints, and AWS Lambda. Topics simplify fan-out messaging patterns by decoupling message producers from consumers.
