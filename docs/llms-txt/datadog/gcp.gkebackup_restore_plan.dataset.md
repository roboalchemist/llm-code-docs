# Backup for GKE RestorePlan

Backup for GKE RestorePlan in Google Cloud is a configuration that defines how a backup of a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster should be restored. It specifies details such as the target cluster, restore scope, and policies for handling resources and namespaces. This allows users to recover workloads and cluster state from backups in a controlled and consistent way.

| datadog_display_name | core | string        |

User specified descriptive string for this RestorePlan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| etag                 | core | string        | Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a restore from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetRestorePlan`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateRestorePlan` or `DeleteRestorePlan` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource. |

A set of custom labels supplied by user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
