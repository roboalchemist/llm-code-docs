| reader_endpoint                             | core | string        | The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connection requests among the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Read Replicas in your DB cluster. If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Read Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint. |
