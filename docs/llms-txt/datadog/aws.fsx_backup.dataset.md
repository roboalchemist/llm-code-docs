# FSx Backup

FSx Backup in AWS represents a backup of an Amazon FSx file system. It provides a point-in-time copy of the file system's data, which can be used for data protection, recovery, or creating new file systems from existing data. Backups are stored in Amazon FSx and can be automated or created on demand.
