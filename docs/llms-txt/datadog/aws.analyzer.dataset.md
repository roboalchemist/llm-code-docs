| status                    | core | string     | The status of the analyzer. An <code>Active</code> analyzer successfully monitors supported resources and generates new findings. The analyzer is <code>Disabled</code> when a user action, such as removing trusted access for Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer from Organizations, causes the analyzer to stop generating new findings. The status is <code>Creating</code> when the analyzer creation is in progress and <code>Failed</code> when the analyzer creation has failed. |
| status_reason             | core | json       | The <code>statusReason</code> provides more details about the current status of the analyzer. For example, if the creation for the analyzer fails, a <code>Failed</code> status is returned. For an analyzer with organization as the type, this failure can be due to an issue with creating the service-linked roles required in the member accounts of the Amazon Web Services organization.                                                                                                      |

| type                      | core | string     | The type of analyzer, which corresponds to the zone of trust chosen for the analyzer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
