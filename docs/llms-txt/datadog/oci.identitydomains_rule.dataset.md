# Identity Domains Rule

An Identity Domains Rule in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) defines conditions and actions that automate identity management tasks within an identity domain. It allows administrators to create rules that trigger specific actions, such as assigning users to groups or updating attributes, based on defined criteria. This helps streamline user lifecycle management and enforce consistent access policies across the organization.
