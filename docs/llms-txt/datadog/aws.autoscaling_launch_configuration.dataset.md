# EC2 Auto Scaling Launch Configuration

An EC2 Auto Scaling Launch Configuration is a template that defines how Amazon EC2 instances should be launched within an Auto Scaling group. It specifies details such as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, key pair, security groups, and block storage settings. This configuration ensures that new instances launched by Auto Scaling are consistent and meet the defined requirements.
