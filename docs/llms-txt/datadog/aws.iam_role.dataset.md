# IAM Role

An IAM Role in AWS is a secure identity with specific permissions that define what actions are allowed or denied. Unlike users, roles are not tied to a single person; instead, they can be assumed by trusted entities such as AWS services, applications, or users. This makes roles useful for granting temporary access, enabling cross-account permissions, and following the principle of least privilege.
