# Vulnerability Assessment (VA) setting 'Also send email notifications to admins and subscription owners' should be set for SQL servers

## Description{% #description %}

Enabling the vulnerability assessment (VA) setting is recommended, along with the option to send email notifications to admins and subscription owners. By enabling this setting, scan reports and alerts are automatically sent to relevant individuals, reducing the time required to identify risks and take necessary corrective actions. This ensures timely response to security vulnerabilities and helps maintain a proactive approach to securing the system.
