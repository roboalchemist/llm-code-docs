# AppStream 2.0 Fleet

AppStream 2.0 Fleet is a group of streaming instances in AWS AppStream 2.0 that deliver virtualized applications or desktops to users. A fleet defines the instance type, capacity, scaling policies, and network settings used to stream applications. It provides the compute resources that run the applications, and can be configured for on-demand or always-on availability depending on performance and cost requirements.

If they try to reconnect to the streaming session after a disconnection or network interruption within this time interval, they are connected to their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance. Specify a value between 60 and 36000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| idle_disconnect_timeout_in_seconds | core | int64         | The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins. Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected. To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 36000. The default value is 0. If you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.          |
