# Remove ufw Package

## Description{% #description %}

The `ufw` package can be removed with the following command:

```

$ apt-get remove ufw
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Running `iptables.persistent` with `ufw` enabled may lead to conflict and unexpected results.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if dpkg-query --show --showformat='${db:Status-Status}' 'linux-base' 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^installed$'; then

# CAUTION: This remediation script will remove ufw
# from the system, and may remove any packages
# that depend on ufw. Execute this
# remediation AFTER testing on a non-production
# system!


DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get remove -y "ufw"

else
    >&2 echo 'Remediation is not applicable, nothing was done'
fi
```
