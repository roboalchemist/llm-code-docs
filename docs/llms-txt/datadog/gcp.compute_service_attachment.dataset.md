# Service Attachment

A Service Attachment in Google Cloud is a resource that allows a service producer to publish a service through Private Service Connect. It defines how consumer projects can connect privately to the producer's service using internal IP addresses, while controlling access, connection policies, and traffic routing.

| propagated_connection_limit | core | int64         | The number of consumer spokes that connected Private Service Connect endpoints can be propagated to through Network Connectivity Center. This limit lets the service producer limit how many propagated Private Service Connect connections can be established to this service attachment from a single consumer. If the connection preference of the service attachment is ACCEPT_MANUAL, the limit applies to each project or network that is listed in the consumer accept list. If the connection preference of the service attachment is ACCEPT_AUTOMATIC, the limit applies to each project that contains a connected endpoint. If unspecified, the default propagated connection limit is 250. |

| reconcile_connections       | core | bool          | This flag determines whether a consumer accept/reject list change can reconcile the statuses of existing ACCEPTED or REJECTED PSC endpoints. - If false, connection policy update will only affect existing PENDING PSC endpoints. Existing ACCEPTED/REJECTED endpoints will remain untouched regardless how the connection policy is modified . - If true, update will affect both PENDING and ACCEPTED/REJECTED PSC endpoints. For example, an ACCEPTED PSC endpoint will be moved to REJECTED if its project is added to the reject list. For newly created service attachment, this boolean defaults to false.                                                                                    |
