# Block Volume

Block Volume in OCI is a high-performance, durable storage resource that can be attached to compute instances. It provides persistent, resizable block storage that behaves like a physical hard drive, supporting both boot and data volumes. Block Volumes can be dynamically scaled, backed up, and cloned, offering flexibility for workloads that require reliable and consistent storage performance.
