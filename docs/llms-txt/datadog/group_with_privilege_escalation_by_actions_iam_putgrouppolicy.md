### Description{% #description %}

This check identifies IAM group policies that grant the action `iam:PutGroupPolicy` with a resource set to `"*"`, allowing anyone in the group to attach arbitrary inline policies to any IAM group. This presents a privilege escalation risk, as users with this permission could assign themselves broader or unauthorized permissions by updating policies on other groups. To mitigate this, restrict the `Action` and `Resource` fields in policies and avoid assigning sensitive permissions to groups broadly.

A secure Terraform configuration should limit permissions to only what is necessary. For example:

```
resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
```

## Compliant Code Examples{% #compliant-code-examples %}

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
```

## Non-Compliant Code Examples{% #non-compliant-code-examples %}

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_group" "cosmic" {
  name = "cosmic"
}

resource "aws_iam_group_policy" "test_inline_policy" {
  name = "test_inline_policy"
  group = aws_iam_group.cosmic.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "iam:PutGroupPolicy",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
