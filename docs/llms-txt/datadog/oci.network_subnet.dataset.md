# Subnet

A Subnet in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a logical subdivision of a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). It provides a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to resources such as compute instances. Subnets can be regional or tied to a specific availability domain, and they control network traffic through security lists and route tables.
