# Elemental MediaLive Input

AWS Elemental MediaLive Input is a resource that defines the source of video content for a MediaLive channel. It specifies how live video enters the service, such as through an IP stream, file, or AWS Elemental MediaConnect flow. Inputs can be shared across channels and configured with security settings, failover options, and input types to ensure reliable live video streaming.

SINGLE_PIPELINE - You can connect only one source to this input. If the ChannelClass is also SINGLE_PIPELINE, this value is valid. If the ChannelClass is STANDARD, this value is not valid because the channel requires two sources in the input. |
