# Where is my data stored?

Cloudcraft stores data in the AWS `us-east-1` (North Virginia) region for public cloud users, and in the AWS `us-gov-west-1` (US West) region for GovCloud customers.

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry best practices.

Cloudcraft also implements rigorous security processes. For more information, see the [Cloudcraft security page](https://www.cloudcraft.co/security) and [SOC 2 Type II report](https://docs.datadoghq.com/cloudcraft/faq/soc2-report/).

If you are interested in storing your data in Europe, contact [the sales team](mailto:cloudcraft-sales@datadoghq.com) for more information.
