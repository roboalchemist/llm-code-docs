# Comprehend Document Classification Job Properties

Comprehend Document Classification Job Properties in AWS describe the details of a document classification job run by Amazon Comprehend. It includes information such as the job ID, job name, job status, input and output data configuration, the classifier used, and timestamps for creation and completion. This resource helps track and manage classification jobs that automatically categorize documents based on custom or pre-trained models.
