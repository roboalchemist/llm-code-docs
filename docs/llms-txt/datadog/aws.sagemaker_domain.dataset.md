# SageMaker Domain

SageMaker Domain in AWS represents a centralized environment for managing machine learning development within Amazon SageMaker. It provides user profiles, shared storage, and security settings, enabling teams to collaborate on ML projects. A domain organizes resources like notebooks, datasets, and applications under a unified governance model, simplifying access control and administration.
