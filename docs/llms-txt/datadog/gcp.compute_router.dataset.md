# Cloud Router

Cloud Router in Google Cloud is a fully distributed and managed service that enables dynamic routing between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network and on-premises networks. It uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to automatically exchange routes, ensuring that changes in network topology are quickly reflected without manual updates. This makes hybrid and multi-cloud connectivity more scalable and resilient.
