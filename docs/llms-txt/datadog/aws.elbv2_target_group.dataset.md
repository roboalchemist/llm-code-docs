# Elastic Load Balancing Target Group

An Elastic Load Balancing Target Group in AWS is a logical grouping of targets, such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions, that receive traffic from a load balancer. It defines how requests are routed, including protocol, port, and health check settings. Target groups enable flexible traffic distribution and monitoring, allowing you to direct requests to specific application components and ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.
