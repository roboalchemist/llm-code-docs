# API Gateway Route

An API Gateway Route in AWS defines how incoming requests are directed to backend integrations within an API Gateway v2 API. It matches requests based on an HTTP method and a route key, such as a specific path or wildcard pattern. Routes determine which integration, like a Lambda function or HTTP endpoint, should handle the request. This allows you to control request flow, organize endpoints, and manage how clients interact with your API.

If you created an API using quick create, the $default route is managed by API Gateway. You can't modify the $default route key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| authorization_scopes                | core | array<string> | A list of authorization scopes configured on a route. The scopes are used with a JWT authorizer to authorize the method invocation. The authorization works by matching the route scopes against the scopes parsed from the access token in the incoming request. The method invocation is authorized if any route scope matches a claimed scope in the access token. Otherwise, the invocation is not authorized. When the route scope is configured, the client must provide an access token instead of an identity token for authorization purposes. |

For WebSocket APIs, valid values are NONE for open access, AWS_IAM for using AWS IAM permissions, and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer For HTTP APIs, valid values are NONE for open access, JWT for using JSON Web Tokens, AWS_IAM for using AWS IAM permissions, and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| authorizer_id                       | core | string        | The identifier of the Authorizer resource to be associated with this route.
