# Ensure that All Entries in The Path of Root Are Directories

## Description{% #description %}

For each element in root's path, run:

```
# ls -ld DIR

```

and ensure that the entry is a directory.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Locations in root's path that are not directories could cause unexpected behavior, such as executing scrips from unintended locations. Ensuring that all locations in root's path are directories helps maintain a secure environment for root.
