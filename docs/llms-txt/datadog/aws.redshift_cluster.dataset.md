# Redshift Cluster

An Amazon Redshift Cluster is a fully managed data warehouse that allows you to run complex analytical queries on large datasets. It consists of one or more compute nodes and a leader node that coordinates query execution and data distribution. Redshift clusters are designed for high performance, scalability, and integration with other AWS services, making them suitable for business intelligence, reporting, and big data analytics.
