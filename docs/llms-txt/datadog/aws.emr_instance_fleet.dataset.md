# EMR Instance Fleet

An EMR Instance Fleet in AWS is a flexible way to provision compute resources for Amazon EMR clusters. Instead of specifying fixed instance groups, you define target capacities and a mix of instance types and purchasing options (On-Demand and Spot). EMR automatically provisions the optimal combination to meet your requirements, improving cost efficiency and availability.

| target_on_demand_capacity      | core | int64  | The target capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On-Demand Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand Instances as specified by InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified WeightedCapacity. When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the WeightedCapacity units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a WeightedCapacity of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units. You can use InstanceFleet$ProvisionedOnDemandCapacity to determine the Spot capacity units that have been provisioned for the instance fleet. If not specified or set to 0, only Spot Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using TargetSpotCapacity. At least one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of TargetSpotCapacity and TargetOnDemandCapacity can be specified, and its value must be 1. |
