# Systems Manager Managed Instance

A Systems Manager Managed Instance in AWS represents an Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises server that has been configured for management using AWS Systems Manager. Once registered, the instance can be remotely managed, patched, configured, and monitored through Systems Manager features such as Run Command, Patch Manager, and State Manager. This resource provides metadata about the instance, including its status, platform, and agent version, enabling centralized visibility and control across hybrid environments.

| name                                       | core | string     | The name assigned to an on-premises server, edge device, or virtual machine (VM) when it is activated as a Systems Manager managed node. The name is specified as the DefaultInstanceName property using the CreateActivation command. It is applied to the managed node by specifying the Activation Code and Activation ID when you install SSM Agent on the node, as explained in How to install SSM Agent on hybrid Linux nodes and How to install SSM Agent on hybrid Windows Server nodes. To retrieve the Name tag of an EC2 instance, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For information, see DescribeInstances in the Amazon EC2 API Reference or describe-instances in the Amazon Web Services CLI Command Reference. |
