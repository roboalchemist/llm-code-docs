# API Gateway Domain Name

API Gateway Domain Name in AWS represents a custom domain that you can map to your API Gateway APIs. It allows you to use your own domain names instead of the default execute-api endpoint, providing a more user-friendly and branded URL. You can configure base path mappings to route traffic to specific APIs and stages, and integrate with AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificates to secure communication.
