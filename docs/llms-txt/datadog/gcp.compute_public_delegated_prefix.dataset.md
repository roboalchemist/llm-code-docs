# Public Delegated Prefix

A Public Delegated Prefix in Google Cloud is a reserved block of public IP addresses that a project can delegate to other projects within the same organization. It allows centralized management of public IP space while enabling controlled distribution to different teams or environments. This helps maintain consistent network policies and efficient IP utilization across multiple projects.
