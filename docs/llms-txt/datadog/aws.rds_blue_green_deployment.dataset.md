# RDS Blue/Green Deployment

RDS Blue/Green Deployment in AWS allows you to create a fully managed staging environment (green) that mirrors your production environment (blue). This enables safe testing of database changes, schema updates, or engine upgrades without impacting live workloads. Once validated, you can switch traffic from blue to green with minimal downtime, reducing risk during updates.
