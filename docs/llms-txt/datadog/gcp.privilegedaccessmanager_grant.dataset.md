# Privileged Access Manager Grant

Privileged Access Manager Grant in Google Cloud is a resource that defines temporary elevated access to sensitive resources. It allows administrators to grant just-in-time permissions to users or service accounts for a limited duration, reducing the risk of long-term privilege exposure. This resource helps enforce the principle of least privilege and supports approval workflows, access justification, and audit logging for compliance and security management.
