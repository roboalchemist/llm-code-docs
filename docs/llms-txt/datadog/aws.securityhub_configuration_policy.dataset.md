# Security Hub Configuration Policy

Security Hub Configuration Policy in AWS defines the settings and controls applied to an account or organization within AWS Security Hub. It allows centralized management of security standards, control enablement, and configuration across multiple accounts. This resource helps ensure consistent security posture, compliance enforcement, and streamlined governance by applying policies at scale.
