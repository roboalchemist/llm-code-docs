# Neptune DB clusters should have IAM database authentication enabled

## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies whether IAM database authentication is enabled for a Neptune DB cluster.

Enabling IAM database authentication for Amazon Neptune clusters eliminates the need to store user credentials within the database itself, as authentication is handled externally through IAM. When enabled, all requests must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on enabling IAM database authentication, please refer to the [Enabling IAM database authentication in Neptune](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/iam-auth-enable.html) section of the Neptune User Guide.
