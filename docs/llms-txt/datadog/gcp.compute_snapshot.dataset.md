# Compute Engine Snapshot

A Compute Engine Snapshot in Google Cloud is a point-in-time backup of a persistent disk. It captures the disk's data at the moment the snapshot is created, allowing you to restore or create new disks from it later. Snapshots are incremental, meaning only changes since the last snapshot are stored, which saves storage space and reduces costs.

| source_instant_snapshot             | core | string        | The source instant snapshot used to create this snapshot. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot - projects/project/zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot - zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot                                                             |
| source_instant_snapshot_id          | core | string        | Output only. [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant snapshot used to create this snapshot. This value identifies the exact instant snapshot that was used to create this snapshot. For example, if you created the snapshot from an instant snapshot that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source instant snapshot ID would identify the exact instant snapshot that was used.                                          |

| storage_bytes                       | core | int64         | Output only. [Output Only] A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot creation/deletion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[Output Only] An indicator whether storageBytes is in a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage reallocation. This status can either be UPDATING, meaning the size of the snapshot is being updated, or UP_TO_DATE, meaning the size of the snapshot is up-to-date.                                                                                                                                         |
