# Pinpoint SMS and Voice Pool

An Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice Pool is a collection of phone numbers and sender IDs that can be managed together for sending messages. It allows you to group resources for better control over message routing, compliance, and throughput. Pools help ensure consistent sender identities, manage opt-outs, and improve deliverability by distributing traffic across multiple numbers.
