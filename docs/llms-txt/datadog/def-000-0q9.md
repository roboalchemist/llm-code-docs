# Zendesk user's suspension status is changed
Classification:attackTactic:[TA0005-defense-evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005)Technique:[T1562-impair-defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Zendesk user's suspension status is changed.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Zendesk audit logs to look for events with an `@source_type` value of `user_setting"` and `message:"Suspended"` or `message:"unsuspended"`. Users can be suspended, which means that they can no longer sign in and any new support requests you receive from them are sent to the suspended tickets queue.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the user `{{@usr.name}}` intended to change the user's suspension status.
