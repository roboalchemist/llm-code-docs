# AppSync Source API Association

AppSync Source API Association in AWS links a source GraphQL API to a merged API, allowing multiple APIs to be combined into a single unified endpoint. This association manages how fields and resolvers from the source API are integrated, enabling schema federation and simplified access to distributed data sources. It helps streamline API management by consolidating multiple services into one GraphQL interface.
