# Route 53 Resolver Rule

A Route 53 Resolver Rule in AWS defines how DNS queries are handled for a VPC. It allows you to forward DNS queries for specific domains to custom DNS servers, or to resolve them using AWS's default DNS. This enables hybrid cloud DNS resolution, integration with on-premises environments, and fine-grained control over query routing.

| rule_type            | core | string     | When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to resolvers on your network, specify FORWARD or DELEGATE. If a query matches multiple Resolver rules (example.com and www.example.com), outbound DNS queries are routed using the Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name (www.example.com). When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain of that domain, specify SYSTEM. For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify FORWARD for RuleType. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify SYSTEM for RuleType. Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of RECURSIVE for RuleType. |
