| personalization_threshold_seconds      | core | int64      | Defines the maximum duration of underfilled ad time (in seconds) allowed in an ad break. If the duration of underfilled ad time exceeds the personalization threshold, then the personalization of the ad break is abandoned and the underlying content is shown. This feature applies to <i>ad replacement</i> in live and VOD streams, rather than ad insertion, because it relies on an underlying content stream. For more information about ad break behavior, including ad replacement and insertion, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/ad-behavior.html">Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor</a>. |

| slate_ad_url                           | core | string     | The URL for a video asset to transcode and use to fill in time that's not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows the slate to fill in gaps in media content. Configuring the slate is optional for non-VPAID playback configurations. For VPAID, the slate is required because MediaTailor provides it in the slots designated for dynamic ad content. The slate must be a high-quality asset that contains both audio and video.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| transcode_profile_name                 | core | string     | The name that is used to associate this playback configuration with a custom transcode profile. This overrides the dynamic transcoding defaults of MediaTailor. Use this only if you have already set up custom profiles with the help of AWS Support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
