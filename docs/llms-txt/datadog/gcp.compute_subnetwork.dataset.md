# Subnetworks

Subnetworks in Google Cloud are regional resources that define IP address ranges within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. They allow you to segment and organize resources, control IP allocation, and manage traffic flow. Each subnetwork is associated with a specific region and can host resources like virtual machine instances.

| ipv6_gce_endpoint          | core | string        | Output only. [Output Only] Possible endpoints of this subnetwork. It can be one of the following: - VM_ONLY: The subnetwork can be used for creating instances and IPv6 addresses with VM endpoint type. Such a subnetwork gets external IPv6 ranges from a public delegated prefix and cannot be used to create NetLb. - VM_AND_FR: The subnetwork can be used for creating both VM instances and Forwarding Rules. It can also be used to reserve IPv6 addresses with both VM and FR endpoint types. Such a subnetwork gets its IPv6 range from Google IP Pool directly.                                                   |
