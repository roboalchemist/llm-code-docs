# Shield Protection Group

A Shield Protection Group in AWS Shield Advanced is a logical grouping of protected resources, such as CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, or Elastic IPs. It allows you to manage and apply DDoS protection policies collectively instead of configuring each resource individually. This helps simplify administration, improve visibility, and ensure consistent protection across related resources.

| account_id           | core | string        |
| aggregation          | core | string        | Defines how Shield combines resource data for the group in order to detect, mitigate, and report events. Sum - Use the total traffic across the group. This is a good choice for most cases. Examples include Elastic IP addresses for EC2 instances that scale manually or automatically. Mean - Use the average of the traffic across the group. This is a good choice for resources that share traffic uniformly. Examples include accelerators and load balancers. Max - Use the highest traffic from each resource. This is useful for resources that don't share traffic and for resources that share that traffic in a non-uniform way. Examples include Amazon CloudFront distributions and origin resources for CloudFront distributions. |
