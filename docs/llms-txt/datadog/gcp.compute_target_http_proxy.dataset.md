# Target HTTP Proxy

A Target HTTP Proxy in Google Cloud is a forwarding resource that routes incoming HTTP requests to a specified URL map. The URL map defines how requests are directed to backend services based on rules such as hostnames and paths. It is commonly used in HTTP load balancing to manage traffic distribution across multiple backends.

| http_keep_alive_timeout_sec | core | int64         | Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a response, while there is no matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610 seconds) will be used. For global external Application Load Balancers, the minimum allowed value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds. For classic Application Load Balancers, this option is not supported.                                                                                                                                  |

| name                        | core | string        | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply withRFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.                                                                                                          |

| proxy_bind                  | core | bool          | This field only applies when the forwarding rule that references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set toINTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is false. |
