### Description{% #description %}

Granting the `iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion` action with a resource of `"*"` allows a user to set any version of any IAM policy as the default, including attaching more permissive versions to roles or users. This creates a serious privilege escalation risk, as an attacker with these permissions could assign themselves or others elevated privileges by setting a policy version that permits broader or unauthorized access. If left unaddressed, this vulnerability could lead to full account compromise or unapproved actions throughout the AWS environment.

## Compliant Code Examples{% #compliant-code-examples %}

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "cosmic2" {
  name = "cosmic2"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "inline_policy_run_instances2" {
  name = "inline_policy_run_instances"
  user = aws_iam_user.cosmic2.name

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
```

## Non-Compliant Code Examples{% #non-compliant-code-examples %}

```terraform

  name = "cosmic"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "test_inline_policy" {
  name = "test_inline_policy"

    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [

        Action = [
          "iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

  users      = [aws_iam_user.cosmic.name]
  roles      = [aws_iam_role.role.name]
  groups     = [aws_iam_group.group.name]
