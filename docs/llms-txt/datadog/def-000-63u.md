# Enable cron Daemon

## Description{% #description %}

The `crond` service is used to execute commands at preconfigured times. It is required by almost all systems to perform necessary maintenance tasks, such as notifying root of system activity. The `crond` service can be enabled with the following command:

```
$ sudo systemctl enable crond.service
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Due to its usage for maintenance and security-supporting tasks, enabling the cron daemon is essential.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if [ ! -f /.dockerenv ] && [ ! -f /run/.containerenv ]; then

SYSTEMCTL_EXEC='/usr/bin/systemctl'
"$SYSTEMCTL_EXEC" unmask 'crond.service'
"$SYSTEMCTL_EXEC" start 'crond.service'
"$SYSTEMCTL_EXEC" enable 'crond.service'

else
    >&2 echo 'Remediation is not applicable, nothing was done'
fi
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.

```go
- name: Enable service crond
  block:

  - name: Gather the package facts
    package_facts:
      manager: auto

  - name: Enable service crond
    systemd:
      name: crond
      enabled: 'yes'
      state: started
      masked: 'no'
    when:
    - '"cronie" in ansible_facts.packages'
  when: ansible_virtualization_type not in ["docker", "lxc", "openvz", "podman", "container"]
