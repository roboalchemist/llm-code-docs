# Directory Service Directory

AWS Directory Service Directory is a managed directory resource that enables you to set up and run Microsoft Active Directory or connect AWS resources with your existing on-premises directory. It provides centralized user management, authentication, and access control for AWS services and applications, reducing the need for manual identity administration.
