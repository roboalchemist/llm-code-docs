## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect creation of Entra ID (Azure AD) restricted management Administrative Units (AUs). Restricted AUs prevent any user without a specific scoped role assignment from modifying target users who are members of a restricted management AU. This can impact user containment during sensitive incidents if not intentionally configured by the IT team, and may indicate malicious activity.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Azure Active Directory logs for `@properties.category:AdministrativeUnit` and `@evt.name:"Add administrative unit"` where the event includes a restricted administrative unit.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Review if restricted administrative units are used by the organization.
1. Review evidence of anomalous activity for the user creating a restricted administrative unit.
1. Determine if there is a legitimate reason for the user creating a restricted administrative unit.
