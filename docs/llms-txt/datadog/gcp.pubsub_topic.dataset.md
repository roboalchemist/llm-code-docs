# Pub/Sub Topic

A Pub/Sub Topic in Google Cloud is a messaging resource that allows applications to send messages asynchronously. Publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive them from subscriptions linked to that topic. It enables decoupled communication between services, supporting scalable, reliable, and real-time event-driven architectures.

| message_retention_duration     | core | string        | Optional. Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published to the topic.

If this field is not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes. |
