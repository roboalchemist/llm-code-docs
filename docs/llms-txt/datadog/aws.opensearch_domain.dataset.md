# OpenSearch Service Domain

An OpenSearch Service Domain in AWS is a managed search and analytics cluster that hosts OpenSearch or legacy Elasticsearch engines. It provides scalable indexing, search, and visualization capabilities without the need to manage infrastructure. Domains can be configured with different instance types, storage options, and security settings, and they integrate with AWS services for monitoring, access control, and data ingestion.
