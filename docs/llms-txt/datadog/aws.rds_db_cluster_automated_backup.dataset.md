# RDS DB Cluster Automated Backup

An RDS DB Cluster Automated Backup in AWS is a managed backup of an Amazon Aurora or RDS cluster that is automatically created and retained by the service. It captures the cluster's data and transaction logs, enabling point-in-time recovery within the retention period. These backups are stored in Amazon S3 and managed without user intervention, providing durability and availability for disaster recovery and compliance needs.
