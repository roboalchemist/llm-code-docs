# SageMaker Notebook Instance

An AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance is a fully managed machine learning compute instance running Jupyter notebooks. It provides a pre-configured environment with popular data science and machine learning libraries, allowing you to build, train, and deploy models without managing infrastructure. You can choose instance types to match your workload, attach storage, and integrate with other AWS services for data access and model deployment.
