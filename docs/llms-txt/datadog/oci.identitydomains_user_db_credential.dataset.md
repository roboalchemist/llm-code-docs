# Identity Domains User Database Credential

A User Database Credential in OCI Identity Domains represents the credentials that allow a user to authenticate to Oracle databases using their identity domain account. It securely stores and manages database passwords associated with a user, enabling centralized identity and access management across databases. This resource helps enforce consistent security policies and simplifies credential lifecycle management.
