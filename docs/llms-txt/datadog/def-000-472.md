## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Google Cloud identity accesses a number of Google Cloud Storage objects that they do not usually access.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Monitor Google Cloud Audit logs to identify when a Google Cloud identity makes an anomalous number of `storage.objects.get` calls to a unique number of Google Cloud Storage buckets (`bucket_name`).

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Determine if the user: {{@usr.id}} should be accessing the storage buckets.
   - Here is a list of buckets that were accessed (up to 10): {{bucket_name}}
1. If the action is legitimate, consider including the user in a suppression list. See this article on [Best practices for creating detection rules with Datadog Cloud SIEM](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/writing-datadog-security-detection-rules/#customize-security-signal-messages-to-fit-your-environment) for more information.
1. Otherwise, use the Cloud SIEM - User Investigation dashboard to see if the User: {{@usr.id}} has taken other actions.
1. If the results of the triage indicate that an attacker has taken the action, begin your company's incident response process and investigate.
