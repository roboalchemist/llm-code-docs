# RDS clusters should have IAM authentication enabled

## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies IAM database authentication is enabled for an Amazon RDS cluster. IAM database authentication permits password-free access to database instances using an authentication token. This method ensures that network traffic to and from the database is encrypted using SSL. For more details, refer to the [IAM database authentication section in the Amazon Aurora User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html).

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

To enable IAM database authentication on RDS cluster, see [Enabling and disabling IAM database authentication in the Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Enabling.html).
