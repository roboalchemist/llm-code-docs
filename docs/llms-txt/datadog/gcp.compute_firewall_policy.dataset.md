# Firewall Policy

A Firewall Policy in Google Cloud is a centralized set of rules that control network traffic across multiple Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. It allows you to define and enforce security rules at scale, ensuring consistent traffic filtering and access control. Firewall Policies can be applied hierarchically at the organization, folder, or project level, making it easier to manage security across large environments.
