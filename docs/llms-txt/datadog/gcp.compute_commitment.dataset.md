# Compute Commitment

A Compute Commitment in Google Cloud is a contract that provides discounted pricing in exchange for committing to use a specific amount of compute resources for a set period, typically one or three years. It helps reduce costs for predictable workloads by applying sustained-use discounts automatically to eligible virtual machine usage within the committed region and resource type.

| auto_renew               | core | bool          | Specifies whether to automatically renew the commitment at the end of its current term. The default value is false. If you set the field to true, each time your commitment reaches the end of its term, Compute Engine automatically renews it for another term. You can update this field anytime before the commitment expires. For example, if the commitment is set to expire at 12 AM UTC-8 on January 3, 2027, you can update this field until 11:59 PM UTC-8 on January 2, 2027.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| type                     | core | string        | The type of commitment; specifies the machine series for which you want to commit to purchasing resources. The choice of machine series affects the discount rate and the eligible resource types. The type must be one of the following:ACCELERATOR_OPTIMIZED, ACCELERATOR_OPTIMIZED_A3,ACCELERATOR_OPTIMIZED_A3_MEGA,COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED, COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED_C2D, COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED_C3, COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED_C3D,COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED_H3, GENERAL_PURPOSE,GENERAL_PURPOSE_C4, GENERAL_PURPOSE_E2,GENERAL_PURPOSE_N2, GENERAL_PURPOSE_N2D,GENERAL_PURPOSE_N4, GENERAL_PURPOSE_T2D,GRAPHICS_OPTIMIZED, GRAPHICS_OPTIMIZED_G4,MEMORY_OPTIMIZED, MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_M3,MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_X4, STORAGE_OPTIMIZED_Z3. For example, type MEMORY_OPTIMIZED specifies a commitment that applies only to eligible resources of memory optimized M1 and M2 machine series. Type GENERAL_PURPOSE specifies a commitment that applies only to eligible resources of general purpose N1 machine series. |
