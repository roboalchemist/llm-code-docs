# Cluster should be created with Private Nodes
 
## Description{% #description %}

A cluster should have private nodes enabled. These settings ensure that the nodes are properly isolated from public access.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

**Note**: A cluster created without private nodes cannot be modified to enable private nodes. A new cluster must be created.

Follow the [Customize Network Isolation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/latest/network-isolation#gcloud) guide from Google Cloud to enable private nodes and disable public access to your cluster.
