# Cloud Deploy Release

Cloud Deploy Release in Google Cloud represents a specific version of an application or service that is ready to be deployed through a defined delivery pipeline. It contains configuration details, references to build artifacts, and deployment targets. Each release is immutable and serves as a snapshot of the application state at a given time, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments across environments.
