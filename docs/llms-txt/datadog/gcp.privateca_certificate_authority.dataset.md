# Certificate Authority

Certificate Authority in Google Cloud is a managed service that allows you to create, manage, and deploy private certificate authorities. It helps issue and manage SSL/TLS certificates for internal workloads, devices, and applications without relying on external certificate providers. This service simplifies certificate lifecycle management, improves security, and integrates with other Google Cloud services.
