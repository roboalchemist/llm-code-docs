# Network Peering

Network Peering in Google Cloud allows private connectivity between two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks. It enables resources in different VPCs to communicate using internal IP addresses without requiring public internet access or VPNs. This helps improve security, reduce latency, and simplify network design while maintaining separate administrative boundaries.

If a value of `0` is provided for this field, VMware Engine uses the default value instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The provided network can be a consumer VPC network or another standard VMware Engine network. If the `peer_network_type` is VMWARE_ENGINE_NETWORK, specify the name in the form: `projects/{project}/locations/global/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`. Otherwise specify the name in the form: `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network_id}`, where `{project}` can either be a project number or a project ID. |
