# EventBridge Rule

An EventBridge Rule in AWS defines a pattern to match incoming events and routes them to specified targets such as Lambda functions, Step Functions, or SNS topics. Rules allow you to filter events based on attributes and automate responses to system or application changes. They are central to building event-driven architectures by connecting event sources with processing or notification services.
