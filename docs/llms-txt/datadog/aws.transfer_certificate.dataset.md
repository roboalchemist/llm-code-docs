# Transfer Family Certificate

Transfer Family Certificate in AWS is a resource used with AWS Transfer Family to manage and validate SSL/TLS certificates for secure file transfer endpoints. It allows you to associate certificates with your Transfer Family servers, ensuring encrypted connections for protocols like SFTP, FTPS, and FTP. This helps maintain compliance and security by protecting data in transit.

| status            | core | string     | A certificate's status can be either ACTIVE or INACTIVE. You can set ActiveDate and InactiveDate in the UpdateCertificate call. If you set values for these parameters, those values are used to determine whether the certificate has a status of ACTIVE or INACTIVE. If you don't set values for ActiveDate and InactiveDate, we use the NotBefore and NotAfter date as specified on the X509 certificate to determine when a certificate is active and when it is inactive. |
