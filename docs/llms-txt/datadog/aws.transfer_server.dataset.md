# Transfer Family Server

AWS Transfer Family Server is a managed service that enables secure file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using protocols like SFTP, FTPS, and FTP. It eliminates the need to manage infrastructure for file transfer workloads, providing scalability, high availability, and integration with AWS security and monitoring services.

| identity_provider_type                  | core | string        | The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is SERVICE_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service. Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| protocol_details                        | core | json          | The protocol settings that are configured for your server. Avoid placing Network Load Balancers (NLBs) or NAT gateways in front of Transfer Family servers, as this increases costs and can cause performance issues, including reduced connection limits for FTPS. For more details, see Avoid placing NLBs and NATs in front of Transfer Family. To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer. To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the SETSTAT command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call. To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter. As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently, only HTTP is supported. |
| protocols                               | core | array<string> | Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are: SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data If you select FTPS, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS. If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated. If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types: SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY. If Protocol includes AS2, then the EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| s3_storage_options                      | core | json          | Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is optimized. If using the console, this is enabled by default. If using the API or CLI, this is disabled by default. By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE of DIRECTORY. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the HomeDirectoryMapEntry Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a file target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| workflow_details                        | core | json          | Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow. In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
