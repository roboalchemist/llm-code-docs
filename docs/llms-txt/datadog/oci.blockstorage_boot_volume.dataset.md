# Boot Volume

A Boot Volume in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a detachable block storage device that contains the operating system image used to boot up a compute instance. It is automatically created when you launch an instance but can also be created independently and attached to other instances as needed. Boot Volumes are durable, encrypted, and can be backed up or cloned for recovery and scaling purposes.
