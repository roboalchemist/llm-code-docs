# EC2 Spot Instance Request

An EC2 Spot Instance Request in AWS allows you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at discounted prices compared to On-Demand instances. You specify the instance type, availability zone, and maximum price you are willing to pay. If capacity is available and your bid meets the requirements, the instance runs until capacity is reclaimed or you terminate it. This is ideal for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads.

By default, the request is valid for 7 days from the date the request was created. |
