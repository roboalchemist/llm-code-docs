# Lambda Event Source Mapping

Lambda Event Source Mapping in AWS connects an event source, such as an SQS queue, DynamoDB stream, or Kinesis stream, to a Lambda function. It automatically polls the source and invokes the function with new data, handling scaling and batching behind the scenes. This allows developers to process events in near real time without managing infrastructure or custom polling logic.

| maximum_batching_window_in_seconds       | core | int64         | The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Lambda spends gathering records before invoking the function. You can configure MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to any value from 0 seconds to 300 seconds in increments of seconds. For streams and Amazon SQS event sources, the default batching window is 0 seconds. For Amazon MSK, Self-managed Apache Kafka, Amazon MQ, and DocumentDB event sources, the default batching window is 500 ms. Note that because you can only change MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds in increments of seconds, you cannot revert back to the 500 ms default batching window after you have changed it. To restore the default batching window, you must create a new event source mapping. Related setting: For streams and Amazon SQS event sources, when you set BatchSize to a value greater than 10, you must set MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to at least 1. |
| maximum_record_age_in_seconds            | core | int64         | (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, Amazon MSK, and self-managed Apache Kafka) Discard records older than the specified age.
