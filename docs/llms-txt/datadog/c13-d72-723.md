# Access denied for Google Cloud Service Account
Classification:attackTactic:[TA0004-privilege-escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)Technique:[T1078-valid-accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)
## Goal{% #goal %}

Detect when a Google Cloud service account (`@usr.id:*.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) exhibits access denied behavior that deviates from normal.

## Strategy{% #strategy %}

Inspect the Google Cloud service account (`@usr.id:*.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for errors (`@data.protoPayload.status.code:7`) caused by denied permissions (`@evt.outcome`). The anomaly detection will baseline each service account and then generate a security signal when a service account deviates from their baseline.

## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

Investigate the logs and determine whether or not the Google Cloud service account {{@usr.id}} is compromised.
