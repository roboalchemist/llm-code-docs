# External IP Address

An External IP Address in Google Cloud is a publicly accessible IP assigned to a resource, such as a virtual machine, load balancer, or VPN gateway. It allows communication between the resource and the internet or external networks. External IPs can be ephemeral, changing when a resource restarts, or static, reserved for long-term use.

| purpose              | core | string        | The purpose of this resource, which can be one of the following values: - GCE_ENDPOINT for addresses that are used by VM instances, alias IP ranges, load balancers, and similar resources. - DNS_RESOLVER for a DNS resolver address in a subnetwork for a Cloud DNS inbound forwarder IP addresses (regional internal IP address in a subnet of a VPC network) - VPC_PEERING for global internal IP addresses used for private services access allocated ranges. - NAT_AUTO for the regional external IP addresses used by Cloud NAT when allocating addresses using automatic NAT IP address allocation. - IPSEC_INTERCONNECT for addresses created from a private IP range that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an *HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect* configuration. These addresses are regional resources. - `SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP` for an internal IP address that is assigned to multiple internal forwarding rules. - `PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT` for a private network address that is used to configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses can use this purpose. |
