# Translate Parallel Data

Translate Parallel Data in AWS refers to a custom dataset used by Amazon Translate to improve translation quality for specific terminology and context. It allows you to upload and manage parallel data files containing source and target language pairs. The GetParallelDataResponse provides details about the dataset, such as its properties, status, and metadata, helping you monitor and manage custom translation resources.

| data_location                                 | core | json       | The Amazon S3 location of the most recent parallel data input file that was successfully imported into Amazon Translate. The location is returned as a presigned URL that has a 30-minute expiration. Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for the risk of CSV injection attacks. CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that a record contains malicious code. The record begins with a special character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record as a formula and run the code within it. Before you download an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that you recognize the file and trust its creator. |
