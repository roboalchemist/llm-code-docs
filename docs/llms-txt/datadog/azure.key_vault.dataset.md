| create_mode                     | core | string     | The vault's create mode to indicate whether the vault need to be recovered or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| diagnostic_settings             | core | json       |
| enable_purge_protection         | core | bool       | Property specifying whether protection against purge is enabled for this vault. Setting this property to true activates protection against purge for this vault and its content - only the Key Vault service may initiate a hard, irrecoverable deletion. The setting is effective only if soft delete is also enabled. Enabling this functionality is irreversible - that is, the property does not accept false as its value.                                                                                                           |
| enable_rbac_authorization       | core | bool       | Property that controls how data actions are authorized. When true, the key vault will use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization of data actions, and the access policies specified in vault properties will be ignored. When false, the key vault will use the access policies specified in vault properties, and any policy stored on Azure Resource Manager will be ignored. If null or not specified, the vault is created with the default value of false. Note that management actions are always authorized with RBAC. |
| enable_soft_delete              | core | bool       | Property to specify whether the 'soft delete' functionality is enabled for this key vault. If it's not set to any value(true or false) when creating new key vault, it will be set to true by default. Once set to true, it cannot be reverted to false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
