1. Investigate the anomaly generated from `{{@network.client.ip}}` by anomaly type - `{{@anomaly.type}}` and anomaly event name - `{{@anomaly.event}}`
1. Examine the reassembled traffic to understand the nature of the anomaly and determine if the anomaly is due to benign network issues or malicious activity.
1. If the anomalies are deemed malicious, take steps to block the offending traffic and strengthen network defences.
