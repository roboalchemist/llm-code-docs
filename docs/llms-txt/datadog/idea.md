## Overview{% #overview %}

The Datadog plugin for JetBrains IDEs helps improve software performance by providing code insights in the IDE based on real-time observability data. The plugin is for developers that use Datadog products including [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/), [Logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/ide_plugins/idea/logs/), [Live Debugger](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/live_debugger/) and [Code Security](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/ide_plugins/idea/code_security/) to monitor their services. It is available for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, PyCharm, WebStorm, and PhpStorm.

## Requirements{% #requirements %}

- **A Datadog account**: The plugin requires a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.

## Setup{% #setup %}

### Install the Datadog plugin{% #install-the-datadog-plugin %}

1. In the IDE **Settings** select **Plugins** and search for `Datadog` in the **Marketplace** tab.
1. Click **Install** to download and install the plugin in your IDE.
1. Click **Restart IDE**.

Alternatively, you can install the plugin from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19495-datadog).



### Log in to Datadog{% #log-in-to-datadog %}

After installing the Datadog plugin and restarting the IDE, log in to Datadog:

1. With a file or project open in the IDE, click the **Datadog** tool window.
1. Click **Log inâ¦**.
1. In the browser window that opens, select your site and organization, then authorize access to the platform.

**Note**: For most users, one login is all that is required. If you're using a multi-org setup, check to ensure that the correct account is active. To find out which login your IDE is using, click **Settings** -> **Tools** -> **Datadog**, and check which account is active.

### Link a service{% #link-a-service %}

To provide relevant data from the Datadog platform, add related services to your project:

1. With your project open in the IDE, open the **Datadog** tool window and select **Manage Linked Servicesâ¦** from the **Options** menu.
1. A settings dialog opens, click the plus icon (**+**).
1. Search for and select the services that you want to add to the current project.

To remove a service, select it in the **Services** table and click the minus icon (**-**).

{% alert level="info" %}
The names of linked services persist with the project when you close it.
{% /alert %}

## Core features{% #core-features %}

### Error Tracking{% #error-tracking %}

The [**Error Tracking**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/) integration helps you find and fix runtime errors from Error Tracking.

   alt="Error tracking in the source editor" /%}

Click the inlay to open the Datadog tool-window and inspect details of the runtime error.

### Logs{% #logs %}

The [**Logs**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/ide_plugins/idea/logs/) integration detects log lines in your source code, displays live event counts directly in the source editor, and provides links to the Datadog Log Explorer to view the logs generated by each log line.

{% image

### Live Debugger{% #live-debugger %}

The [**Live Debugger**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/ide_plugins/idea/live_debugger/) enables you to add logpointsâauto-expiring, non-breaking breakpointsâto your runtime code to collect information for debugging.

### Code Security{% #code-security %}

The [**Code Security**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/ide_plugins/idea/code_security/) integration promotes better security by flagging library vulnerabilities and runtime code vulnerabilities. The local code analyzer checks your code changes as you edit to detect quality and security issues prior to commit.

## Other features{% #other-features %}

### View in IDE{% #view-in-ide %}

The **View in IDE** feature provides a link from the Datadog platform directly to the source files in your IDE. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed on the platform (for example, in [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/)):

### Code Origin for Spans{% #code-origin-for-spans %}

The [**Code Origin for Spans**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/code_origin?tab=java) integration shows you metrics for entry spans at the corresponding location in your source code.

{% image

   alt="APM spans in the source editor" /%}

Click the inlay to open the Datadog tool window and inspect the span details.

### Flaky Tests{% #flaky-tests %}

The [**Flaky Tests**](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/flaky_tests) integration shows you flaky tests detected by [Test Optimization](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/).

   alt="APM spans in the source editor" /%}

Click the inlay to open the Datadog tool window and inspect the test details.

### CI Test Runs{% #ci-test-runs %}

You can view recent test runs in the [CI Visibility Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/explorer/?tab=testruns) by navigating directly from your source files. Look for the **CI Test Run** inlays above test method declarations in your source code:

{% image
   source="https://datadog-docs.imgix.net/images/developers/ide_plugins/idea/ci-test-in-editor.6e0b1481a9b9829d955edb89f8f3e8de.png?auto=format"
   alt="A source file showing a CI Test Run inlay." /%}

Clicking the link opens the **Test Runs** tab showing the recent history for one test case.
