## Triage and response{% #triage-and-response %}

1. Review the IAM Policy change and ensure it does not negatively impact your risk in relation to authentication or authorization controls.
1. If risk is increased, contact the individual that used the arn: `{{@userIdentity.arn}}` and determine if the `{{@evt.name}}` API calls were made by them.
