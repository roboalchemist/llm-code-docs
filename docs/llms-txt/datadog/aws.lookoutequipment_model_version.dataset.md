# Lookout for Equipment Model Version

Lookout for Equipment Model Version in AWS provides details about a specific version of a machine learning model used for equipment monitoring. It returns information such as the model's status, training data, performance metrics, and version identifiers. This helps users track model lifecycle, evaluate accuracy, and manage updates for predictive maintenance solutions.

| auto_promotion_result                  | core | string     | Indicates whether the model version was promoted to be the active version after retraining or if there was an error with or cancellation of the retraining.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| auto_promotion_result_reason           | core | string     | Indicates the reason for the AutoPromotionResult. For example, a model might not be promoted if its performance was worse than the active version, if there was an error during training, or if the retraining scheduler was using MANUAL promote mode. The model will be promoted in MANAGED promote mode if the performance is better than the previous model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| data_pre_processing_configuration      | core | json       | The configuration is the TargetSamplingRate, which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute. When providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore PT1S, the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M, and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H                                                                                                         |

| model_quality                          | core | string     | Provides a quality assessment for a model that uses labels. If Lookout for Equipment determines that the model quality is poor based on training metrics, the value is POOR_QUALITY_DETECTED. Otherwise, the value is QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MET. If the model is unlabeled, the model quality can't be assessed and the value of ModelQuality is CANNOT_DETERMINE_QUALITY. In this situation, you can get a model quality assessment by adding labels to the input dataset and retraining the model.
