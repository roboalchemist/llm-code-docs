# EKS Cluster

An EKS Cluster is a managed Kubernetes control plane provided by AWS. It handles the setup, scaling, and management of Kubernetes masters, including the API server and etcd, while you manage worker nodes separately. This service simplifies running containerized applications by integrating with AWS networking, security, and monitoring tools, allowing you to focus on deploying and operating workloads without managing the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.
