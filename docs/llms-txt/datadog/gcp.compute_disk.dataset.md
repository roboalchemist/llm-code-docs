# Persistent Disk

Persistent Disk in Google Cloud is a durable block storage option for virtual machine instances. It provides high-performance, reliable storage that can be attached to and detached from VM instances as needed. Persistent Disks are automatically encrypted, can be resized without downtime, and support both standard and SSD-backed options to balance cost and performance. They are designed for workloads requiring consistent availability and data durability.

For example, the following are valid values: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool - projects/project/zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool - zones/zone/storagePools/storagePool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
