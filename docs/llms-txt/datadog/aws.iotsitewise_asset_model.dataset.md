# IoT SiteWise Asset Model

AWS IoT SiteWise Asset Model defines the blueprint for industrial assets, describing their properties, measurements, metrics, and hierarchies. It allows you to standardize how equipment and processes are represented, making it easier to collect, organize, and analyze data consistently across multiple assets.
