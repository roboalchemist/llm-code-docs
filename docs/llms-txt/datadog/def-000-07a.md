# Uninstall Samba Package
 
## Description{% #description %}

The `samba` package can be removed with the following command:

```
 $ apt-get remove samba
```

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

If there is no need to make the Samba software available, removing it provides a safeguard against its activation.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CAUTION: This remediation script will remove samba
# from the system, and may remove any packages
# that depend on samba. Execute this
# remediation AFTER testing on a non-production
# system!


DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get remove -y "samba"
```

### Ansible playbook{% #ansible-playbook %}

The following playbook can be run with Ansible to remediate the issue.
