# S3 Bucket

An S3 Bucket is a storage container in Amazon Web Services used to store and organize objects such as files, backups, and data. It provides scalable, durable, and secure storage with features like versioning, lifecycle policies, and access controls. Buckets serve as the top-level namespace for S3 objects and can be configured for public or private access, encryption, and cross-region replication.

| transition_default_minimum_object_size | core | string     | Indicates which default minimum object size behavior is applied to the lifecycle configuration. This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It isn't supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations. all_storage_classes_128K - Objects smaller than 128 KB will not transition to any storage class by default. varies_by_storage_class - Objects smaller than 128 KB will transition to Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. By default, all other storage classes will prevent transitions smaller than 128 KB. To customize the minimum object size for any transition you can add a filter that specifies a custom ObjectSizeGreaterThan or ObjectSizeLessThan in the body of your transition rule. Custom filters always take precedence over the default transition behavior. |
