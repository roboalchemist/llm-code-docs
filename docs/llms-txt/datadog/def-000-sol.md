# Limit Password Reuse

## Description{% #description %}

Do not allow users to reuse recent passwords. This can be accomplished by using the `remember` option for the `pam_pwhistory` PAM modules.

In the file `/etc/pam.d/common-password`, make sure the parameters `remember` and `use_authtok` are present, and that the value for the `remember` parameter is 5 or greater. For example:

```
password requisite pam_pwhistory.so ...existing_options... remember=5 use_authtok
```

The DoD STIG requirement is 5 passwords.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Preventing re-use of previous passwords helps ensure that a compromised password is not re-used by a user.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

### Shell script{% #shell-script %}

The following script can be run on the host to remediate the issue.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remediation is applicable only in certain platforms
if dpkg-query --show --showformat='${db:Status-Status}' 'libpam-runtime' 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^installed$'; then

if [ -f /usr/bin/authselect ]; then
    if authselect list-features sssd | grep -q with-pwhistory; then
        if ! authselect check; then
        echo "
        authselect integrity check failed. Remediation aborted!
        This remediation could not be applied because an authselect profile was not selected or the selected profile is not intact.
        It is not recommended to manually edit the PAM files when authselect tool is available.
        In cases where the default authselect profile does not cover a specific demand, a custom authselect profile is recommended."
