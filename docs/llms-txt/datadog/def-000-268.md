# Verify All Account Password Hashes are Shadowed with SHA512
 
## Description{% #description %}

Verify the operating system requires the shadow password suite configuration be set to encrypt interactive user passwords using a strong cryptographic hash. Check that the interactive user account passwords are using a strong password hash with the following command:

```
$ sudo cut -d: -f2 /etc/shadow
$6$kcOnRq/5$NUEYPuyL.wghQwWssXRcLRFiiru7f5JPV6GaJhNC2aK5F3PZpE/BCCtwrxRc/AInKMNX3CdMw11m9STiql12f/
```

Password hashes `!` or `*` indicate inactive accounts not available for logon and are not evaluated. If any interactive user password hash does not begin with `$6`, this is a finding.

## Rationale{% #rationale %}

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.
