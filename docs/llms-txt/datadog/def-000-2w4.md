# IAM SSH public keys should be rotated at least every 90 days
 
## Description{% #description %}

This control verifies if an IAM user's SSH public keys are being rotated at least every 90 days.

Regular rotation of SSH public keys mitigates risks associated with key compromise, ensuring tighter access control and enhanced security. Implementing a key rotation policy helps in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your systems.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

To implement a regular SSH public key rotation policy for IAM users, refer to the relevant guidance in the [AWS IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) for best practices on credential management and rotation.
