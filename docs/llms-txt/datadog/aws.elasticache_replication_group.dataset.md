# ElastiCache Replication Group

An ElastiCache Replication Group in AWS is a collection of one or more Redis cache clusters that work together to provide high availability, automatic failover, and data replication. It allows you to scale read capacity with read replicas, improve fault tolerance, and maintain data consistency across nodes. This resource is commonly used for workloads requiring fast in-memory data access with resilience and scalability.

For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, this is a single-element list. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication groups, the list contains an entry for each node group (shard).                                                                                                                                              |
| pending_modified_values       | core | json          | A group of settings to be applied to the replication group, either immediately or during the next maintenance window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| replication_group_create_time | core | timestamp     | The date and time when the cluster was created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| replication_group_id          | core | string        | The identifier for the replication group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| snapshot_retention_limit      | core | int64         | The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted. If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.                                                                                                     |
| snapshot_window               | core | string        | The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard). Example: 05:00-09:00 If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range. This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis.                                                                                                                    |
| snapshotting_cluster_id       | core | string        | The cluster ID that is used as the daily snapshot source for the replication group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| transit_encryption_mode       | core | string        | A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
