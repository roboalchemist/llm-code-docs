# Elastic Beanstalk Environment

An Elastic Beanstalk Environment in AWS is a managed runtime environment where applications are deployed and run. It automatically handles provisioning of resources such as EC2 instances, load balancers, scaling, and monitoring. Each environment is tied to a specific application version and platform, allowing developers to focus on code while AWS manages the infrastructure.
