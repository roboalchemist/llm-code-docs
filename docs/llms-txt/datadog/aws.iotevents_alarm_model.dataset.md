# IoT Events Alarm Model

AWS IoT Events Alarm Model is a resource that defines and manages alarm conditions for IoT applications. It allows you to monitor data from devices or processes, evaluate it against defined rules, and trigger actions when thresholds are met. This helps automate responses to critical events, such as sending notifications, updating device states, or invoking other AWS services.
