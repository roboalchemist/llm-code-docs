# AWS Config should be enabled and recording in all active regions

## Description{% #description %}

This check ensures that AWS Config is enabled in all regions. AWS Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. By enabling AWS Config in all regions, you ensure comprehensive resource compliance and change management across your AWS environment.

## Remediation{% #remediation %}

For guidance on enabling AWS Config, refer to the [AWS Config Developer Guide on Setting Up AWS Config with the Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html). You can enable AWS Config in multiple regions through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

It is recommended to enable AWS Config in all regions to ensure complete visibility and compliance monitoring across your entire AWS infrastructure.
