# HTTPRoute

HTTPRoute in Google Cloud defines how HTTP requests are routed within a service mesh or gateway. It specifies routing rules such as hostnames, paths, header matching, and traffic splitting between backend services. This resource enables fine-grained control over request handling, load balancing, and traffic management for applications running on GKE or other environments using Google Cloud Gateway API.

| gateways             | core | array<string> | Optional. Gateways defines a list of gateways this HttpRoute is attached to, as one of the routing rules to route the requests served by the gateway.

| hostnames            | core | array<string> | Required. Hostnames define a set of hosts that should match against the HTTP host header to select a HttpRoute to process the request. Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 1123 with the exception that: - IPs are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. `foo.example.com`) or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames `*.foo.bar.com` and `*.bar.com` to be associated with the same Mesh (or Gateways under the same scope), it is not possible to associate two routes both with `*.bar.com` or both with `bar.com`. |
| labels               | core | array<string> | Optional. Set of label tags associated with the HttpRoute resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| meshes               | core | array<string> | Optional. Meshes defines a list of meshes this HttpRoute is attached to, as one of the routing rules to route the requests served by the mesh.
