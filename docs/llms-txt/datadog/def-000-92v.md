## Description{% #description %}

ElastiCache for Redis replication groups should be encrypted in transit

Encrypting data during transit helps prevent unauthorized users from intercepting network traffic. By enabling encryption in transit for an ElastiCache for Redis replication group, your data is secured whenever it is being transferred, whether it's between nodes within your cluster or between your cluster and your application.

Follow the [ElastiCache in-transit encryption (TLS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/in-transit-encryption.html) docs to learn how to enable in-transit encryption for your ElastiCache for Redis replication groups.
