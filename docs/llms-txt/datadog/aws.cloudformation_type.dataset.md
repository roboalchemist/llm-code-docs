# CloudFormation Type

CloudFormation Type in AWS represents a registered resource type, module, or hook that can be used within AWS CloudFormation templates. It provides metadata about the type, such as its name, version, and description, enabling users to extend CloudFormation with custom or third-party resource definitions. This allows for more flexible infrastructure as code by supporting both AWS-native and community-contributed resource types.

This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your account. For public extensions, both those provided by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation returns null. For more information, see RegisterType. To set the default version of an extension, use SetTypeDefaultVersion.                                                                                                  |

| is_activated          | core | bool       | Whether the extension is activated for this account and Region. This applies only to third-party public extensions. Extensions published by Amazon are activated by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| last_updated          | core | timestamp  | When the specified extension version was registered. This applies only to: Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more information, see RegisterType. Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update specified. For more information, see ActivateType. For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns null.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| latest_public_version | core | string     | For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the latest version of the public extension that is available. For any extensions other than activated third-party extensions, CloudFormation returns null. How you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this account and Region when a new version is released. For more information, see Automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide. |
| original_type_name    | core | string     | For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the type name of the public extension. If you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension in this account and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's type name within the account and Region, not the type name of the public extension. For more information, see Use aliases to refer to extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide.                                                                                     |
| public_version_number | core | string     | For public extensions that have been activated for this account and Region, the version of the public extension to be used for CloudFormation operations in this account and Region. How you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension affects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this account and Region when a new version is released. For more information, see Automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFormation User Guide.                                                   |
| publisher_id          | core | string     | The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension is published by a third party. Extensions published by Amazon don't return a publisher ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
