# SageMaker App

SageMaker App in AWS represents an interactive application instance within Amazon SageMaker, such as Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, or other integrated development environments. It allows users to run and manage machine learning development environments securely, with resources provisioned on demand. This resource provides details about the app's configuration, status, and associated user profiles.

| last_user_activity_timestamp  | core | timestamp  | The timestamp of the last user's activity. LastUserActivityTimestamp is also updated when SageMaker AI performs health checks without user activity. As a result, this value is set to the same value as LastHealthCheckTimestamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
