# ECS Cluster

An ECS Cluster in AWS is a logical grouping of container instances or serverless tasks where Amazon Elastic Container Service runs applications. It provides the environment to manage and scale containers, whether using EC2 instances or AWS Fargate for serverless compute. Clusters help organize workloads, control capacity, and manage networking and scaling policies for containerized applications.

| service_connect_defaults             | core | json          | Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace. After you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new services with Service Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added as client services in the namespace. This setting only applies to new services that set the enabled parameter to true in the ServiceConnectConfiguration. You can set the namespace of each service individually in the ServiceConnectConfiguration to override this default parameter. Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see Service Connect in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. |

| status                               | core | string        | The status of the cluster. The following are the possible states that are returned. ACTIVE The cluster is ready to accept tasks and if applicable you can register container instances with the cluster. PROVISIONING The cluster has capacity providers that are associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are being created. DEPROVISIONING The cluster has capacity providers that are associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider are being deleted. FAILED The cluster has capacity providers that are associated with it and the resources needed for the capacity provider have failed to create. INACTIVE The cluster has been deleted. Clusters with an INACTIVE status may remain discoverable in your account for a period of time. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future. We don't recommend that you rely on INACTIVE clusters persisting.                                        |
