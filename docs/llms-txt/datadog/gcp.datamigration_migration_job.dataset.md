# Database Migration Service MigrationJob

Database Migration Service MigrationJob in Google Cloud is a managed resource that defines and manages the process of migrating data from a source database to a target database. It handles configuration details such as connection profiles, migration type (one-time or continuous), and execution state. This resource simplifies moving databases into Google Cloud with minimal downtime and reduced manual effort.
