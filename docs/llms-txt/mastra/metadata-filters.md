# Metadata Filters

Mastra provides a unified metadata filtering syntax across all vector stores, based on MongoDB/Sift query syntax. Each vector store translates these filters into their native format.

## Basic Example

```typescript
import { PgVector } from '@mastra/pg'

const store = new PgVector({
  id: 'pg-vector',
  connectionString,
})

const results = await store.query({
  indexName: 'my_index',
  queryVector: queryVector,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    category: 'electronics', // Simple equality
    price: { $gt: 100 }, // Numeric comparison
    tags: { $in: ['sale', 'new'] }, // Array membership
  },
})
```

## Supported Operators

### Basic Comparison

`$eq`Matches values equal to specified value{ age: { $eq: 25 } }Supported by: All except Couchbase`$ne`Matches values not equal{ status: { $ne: 'inactive' } }Supported by: All except Couchbase`$gt`Greater than{ price: { $gt: 100 } }Supported by: All except Couchbase`$gte`Greater than or equal{ rating: { $gte: 4.5 } }Supported by: All except Couchbase`$lt`Less than{ stock: { $lt: 20 } }Supported by: All except Couchbase`$lte`Less than or equal{ priority: { $lte: 3 } }Supported by: All except Couchbase

## Common Rules and Restrictions

1. Field names can't:

   - Contain dots (.) unless referring to nested fields
   - Start with $ or contain null characters
   - Be empty strings

2. Values must be:

   - Valid JSON types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
   - Not undefined
   - Properly typed for the operator (e.g., numbers for numeric comparisons)

3. Logical operators:

   - Must contain valid conditions
   - Can't be empty
   - Must be properly nested
   - Can only be used at top level or nested within other logical operators
   - Can't be used at field level or nested inside a field
   - Can't be used inside an operator
   - Valid: `{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }`
   - Valid: `{ "$or": [{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }] }`
   - Invalid: `{ "field": { "$and": [{ "$gt": 100 }] } }`
   - Invalid: `{ "field": { "$gt": { "$and": [{...}] } } }`

4. $not operator:

   - Must be an object
   - Can't be empty
   - Can be used at field level or top level
   - Valid: `{ "$not": { "field": "value" } }`
   - Valid: `{ "field": { "$not": { "$eq": "value" } } }`

5. Operator nesting:

   - Logical operators must contain field conditions, not direct operators
   - Valid: `{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }`
   - Invalid: `{ "$and": [{ "$gt": 100 }] }`

## Store-Specific Notes

### Astra

- Nested field queries are supported using dot notation
- Array fields must be explicitly defined as arrays in the metadata
- Metadata values are case-sensitive

### ChromaDB

- Where filters only return results where the filtered field exists in metadata
- Empty metadata fields aren't included in filter results
- Metadata fields must be present for negative matches (e.g., $ne won't match documents missing the field)

### Cloudflare Vectorize

- Requires explicit metadata indexing before filtering can be used
- Use `createMetadataIndex()` to index fields you want to filter on
- Up to 10 metadata indexes per Vectorize index
- String values are indexed up to first 64 bytes (truncated on UTF-8 boundaries)
- Number values use float64 precision
- Filter JSON must be under 2048 bytes
- Field names can't contain dots (.) or start with $
- Field names limited to 512 characters
- Vectors must be re-upserted after creating new metadata indexes to be included in filtered results
- Range queries may have reduced accuracy with very large datasets (\~10M+ vectors)

### libSQL

- Supports nested object queries with dot notation
- Array fields are validated to ensure they contain valid JSON arrays
- Numeric comparisons maintain proper type handling
- Empty arrays in conditions are handled gracefully
- Metadata is stored in a JSONB column for efficient querying

### PgVector

- Full support for PostgreSQL's native JSON querying capabilities
- Efficient handling of array operations using native array functions
- Proper type handling for numbers, strings, and booleans
- Nested field queries use PostgreSQL's JSON path syntax internally
- Metadata is stored in a JSONB column for efficient indexing

### Pinecone

- Metadata field names are limited to 512 characters
- Numeric values must be within the range of ±1e38
- Arrays in metadata are limited to 64KB total size
- Nested objects are flattened with dot notation
- Metadata updates replace the entire metadata object

### Qdrant

- Supports advanced filtering with nested conditions
- Payload (metadata) fields must be explicitly indexed for filtering
- Use `createPayloadIndex()` to index fields you want to filter on:

```typescript
// Index a field before filtering on it
await store.createPayloadIndex({
  indexName: 'my_index',
  fieldName: 'source',
  fieldSchema: 'keyword', // 'keyword' | 'integer' | 'float' | 'geo' | 'text' | 'bool' | 'datetime' | 'uuid'
})

// Now filtering works
const results = await store.query({
  indexName: 'my_index',
  queryVector: queryVector,
  filter: { source: 'document-a' },
})
```

- Efficient handling of geo-spatial queries
- Special handling for null and empty values
- Vector-specific filtering capabilities
- Datetime values must be in RFC 3339 format

### Upstash

- 512-character limit for metadata field keys
- Query size is limited (avoid large IN clauses)
- No support for null/undefined values in filters
- Translates to SQL-like syntax internally
- Case-sensitive string comparisons
- Metadata updates are atomic

### MongoDB

- Full support for MongoDB/Sift query syntax for metadata filters
- Supports all standard comparison, array, logical, and element operators
- Supports nested fields and arrays in metadata
- Filtering can be applied to both `metadata` and the original document content using the `filter` and `documentFilter` options, respectively
- `filter` applies to the metadata object; `documentFilter` applies to the original document fields
- No artificial limits on filter size or complexity (subject to MongoDB query limits)
- Indexing metadata fields is recommended for optimal performance

### Couchbase

- Currently doesn't have support for metadata filters. Filtering must be done client-side after retrieving results or by using the Couchbase SDK's Search capabilities directly for more complex queries.

### Amazon S3 Vectors

- Equality values must be primitives (string/number/boolean). `null`/`undefined`, arrays, objects, and Date aren't allowed for equality. Range operators accept numbers or Date (Dates are normalized to epoch ms).
- `$in`/`$nin` require **non-empty arrays of primitives**; Date elements are allowed and normalized to epoch ms. **Array equality** isn't supported.
- Implicit AND is canonicalized (`{a:1,b:2}` → `{$and:[{a:1},{b:2}]}`). Logical operators must contain field conditions, use non-empty arrays, and appear only at the root or within other logical operators (not inside field values).
- Keys listed in `nonFilterableMetadataKeys` at index creation are stored but not filterable; this setting is immutable.
- $exists requires a boolean value.
- undefined/null/empty filters are treated as no filter.
- Each metadata key name limited to 63 characters.
- Total metadata per vector: Up to 40 KB (filterable + non-filterable)
- Total metadata keys per vector: Up to 10
- Filterable metadata per vector: Up to 2 KB
- Non-filterable metadata keys per vector index: Up to 10
