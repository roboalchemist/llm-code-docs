# Overview


## Browser Support

Learn about the browser support for Panda

Panda CSS is built with modern CSS features and uses [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to add support for older browsers.
Panda supports the latest, stable releases of major browsers that support the following features:

- [CSS Variables](https://caniuse.com/css-variables)
- [CSS Cascade Layers](https://caniuse.com/css-cascade-layers)
- Modern selectors, such as [`:where()`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where) and
  [`:is()`](https://caniuse.com/css-matches-pseudo)

## Browserlist

Based on the above criteria, the following browsers are supported:

```txt
>= 1%
last 1 major version
not dead
Chrome >= 99
Edge >= 99
Firefox >= 97
iOS >= 15.4
Safari >= 15.4
Android >= 115
Opera >= 73
```

## Polyfills

In event that you need to support older browsers, you can use the following polyfills in your PostCSS config:

- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer): Adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from
  [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/).
- [postcss-cascade-layers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers): Adds support for CSS Cascade
  Layers.

Here is an example of a `postcss.config.js` file that uses these polyfills:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@pandacss/dev/postcss', 'autoprefixer', '@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers']
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions and how to resolve common issues

## How does Panda manage style conflicts ?

When you combine shorthand and longhand properties, Panda will resolve the styles in a predictable way. The shorthand
property will take precedence over the longhand property.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  paddingTop: '20px',
  padding: '10px'
})
```

The styles generated at build time will look like this:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .p_10px {
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .pt_20px {
    padding-top: 20px;
  }
}
```

---

## Imported Image is not working in Vite App

This is a known limitation of Panda due to our static extraction approach.

> Think of it this way: there's no way for the compiler to know what the final asset URL will be since Vite controls it.

We recommend moving the imported `backgroundImage` to the `style` attribute.

```jsx
import myImageBackground from './my-image.png'

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <p
      className={css({ bg: 'red.300', backgroundRepeat: 'repeat' })}
      style={{ backgroundImage: `url("${myImageBackground}")` }}
    >
      Hello World
    </p>
  )
}
```

---

## How to get Panda to work with Jest?

If you run into error messages like `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` when running Jest tests. Here's what you
can:

In your tsconfig, add

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true
  }
}
```

In your Jest configuration, add the `ts-jest` transformer:

```ts
export default {
  // ...
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest',
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)?$': 'ts-jest'
  }
}
```

In your Panda config, set the `outExtension` to `js`:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  outExtension: 'js'
})
```

---

## HMR does not work when I use `tsconfig` paths?

Panda tries to automatically infer and read the custom paths defined in `tsconfig.json` file. However, there might be
scenarios where the hot module replacement doesn't work.

To fix this add the `importMap` option to your `panda.config.js` file, setting it's value to the specified `paths` in
your `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
// tsconfig.json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@my-path/*": ["./styled-system/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// panda.config.js

module.exports = {
  importMap: '@my-path'
}
```

This will ensure that the paths are resolved correctly, and HMR works as expected.

---

## HMR not triggered

If you are having issues with HMR not being triggered after a `panda.config.ts` change (or one of its
[dependencies](/docs/references/config#dependencies)), you can manually specify the files that should trigger a rebuild
by adding the following to your `panda.config.ts`:

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  dependencies: ['path/to/files/**.ts']
})
```

---

## Why are my styles not applied?

Check that the [`@layer` rules](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers#layer-css) are set and the corresponding `.css` file is
included. [If you're not using `postcss`](/docs/installation/cli), ensure that `styled-system/styles.css` is imported
and that the `panda` command has been run (or is running with `--watch`).

---

## How can I debug the styles?

You can use the `panda debug` to debug design token extraction & css generated from files.

If the issue persists, you can try looking for it in the [issues](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/issues) or in the
[discord](https://discord.gg/VQrkpsgSx7). If you can't find it, please create a minimal reproduction and submit
[a new github issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/issues/new/choose) so we can help you.

---

## Why is my IDE not showing `styled-system` imports?

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
tsconfig.json file.

---

## How do I get a type with each recipe properties?

You can get a [`config recipe`](/docs/concepts/recipes#config-recipe) properties types by using `XXXVariantProps`. Let's
say you have a `config recipe` named `button`, you can import its type like this:

```ts
import { button, type ButtonVariantProps } from '../styled-system/recipes'
```

---

You can get an [`atomic recipe`](/docs/concepts/recipes#atomic-recipe) properties types by using `RecipeVariantProps`.
Let's say you have a `atomic recipe` named `button`, you can get its type like this:

```ts
import { cva, type RecipeVariantProps } from '../styled-system/css'

export type ButtonVariantProps = RecipeVariantProps<typeof buttonStyle>
```

---

## How do I split recipe props from the rest?

You can split recipe props by using `xxx.splitVariantProps`. Let's say you have a `recipe` named `button`, you can split
its props like this:

```tsx Button.tsx {8}
import { css, cx } from '../styled-system/css'
import { ButtonVariantProps, button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

interface ButtonProps extends ButtonVariantProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const { children, ...rest } = props
  const [buttonProps, cssProps] = button.splitVariantProps(rest)
  return <button className={cx(button(buttonProps), css(cssProps))}>{children}</button>
}
```

The same `xxx.splitVariantProps` method is available for both `config recipes` and `atomic recipes`.

---

## How do I reference a token value or css var?

You can reference a token value or it's associated css variable using the
[`token` function](/docs/theming/usage#vanilla-js). This function allows you to access and use the values stored in your
theme tokens at runtime.

```tsx
import { token } from '../styled-system/tokens'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: token('colors.blue.200')
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

---

## Should I commit the styled-system folder?

Just like the `node_modules` folder, you most likely don't want to commit the `styled-system` folder. It contains code
that is auto-generated and can be re-generated at any time.

---

## How does Panda work?

When running `pnpm panda`, here's what's happening under the hood:

- **Load Panda context**:
  - Find and evaluate app config, merge result with presets.
  - Create panda context: prepare code generator from config, parse user's file as AST.
- **Generating artifacts**:
  - Write lightweight JS runtime and types to output directory
- **Extracting used styles in app code**:
  - Run parser on each user's file: identify and extract styles, compute CSS, write to styles.css.

---

## I'm seeing a "Could not resolve xxx" error with esbuild/tsup. What should I do?

In such a case, check the [`outExtension`](/docs/references/config#outextension) in your `panda.config` and set it to
"js". This will ensure your modules are resolved correctly.

---

## Why does importing `styled` not exist?

You should use [`config.jsxFramework`](/docs/concepts/style-props#configure-jsx) when you need to import styled
components. You can then use the [`jsxFactory`](/references/config#jsxfactory) option to set the name of the factory
component.

---

## Why is my preset overriding the base one, even after adding it to the array?

You might have forgotten to include the `extend` keyword in your config. Without `extend`, your preset will completely
replace the base one, instead of merging with it.

---

## Why is my base condition not working in this example?

```ts
css({ color: { _base: 'red.600', _dark: 'white' } })
```

You used `_base` instead of `base`, there is no underscore `_`.

---

## What's the difference between using `defineConfig()` vs `definePreset()`

`defineConfig` is intended to be used in your app config, and will show you all the config keys that are available.
`definePreset` will only show you the config keys that will be merged into an app's config, the rest will be ignored.

---

## How can I completely override the default tokens?.

If you want to **completely override all** of the default presets theme tokens, you can omit the `extends` keyword from
your `theme` config object.

If you want to **keep some of the defaults**, you can install the `@pandacss/preset-panda` package, import it, then
specifically pick what you need in there (or use the JS spread operator `...` and override the other keys).

---

## How do I make a design system / component library with Panda?

There is a detailed guide on how to do this [here](/docs/guides/component-library).

---

## Can I use dynamic styles with Panda?

Yes, you can use dynamic styles with Panda. More on that [here](/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#runtime-conditions).

---

## Should I use atomic or config recipes ?

[Config recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes#config-recipe) are generated just in time, meaning that only the recipes and
variants you use will exist in the generated CSS, regardless of the number of recipes in the config.

This contrasts with [Atomic recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes#atomic-recipe) (cva), which generates all of the variants
regardless of what was used in your code. The reason for this difference is that all `config.recipes` are known at the
start of the panda process when we evaluate your config. In contrast, the CVA recipes are scattered throughout your
code. To get all of them and find their usage across your code, we would need to scan your app code multiple times,
which would not be ideal performance-wise.

When dealing with simple use cases, or if you need code colocation, or even avoiding dynamic styling, atomic recipes
shine by providing all style variants. Config recipes are preferred for design system components, delivering leaner CSS
with only the styles used. Choose according to your component needs.

---

## Why does the panda codegen command fail ?

If you run into any error related to "Transforming const to the configured target environment ("es5") is not supported
yet", update your tsconfig to use es6 or higher:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6"
  }
}
```

---

## How can I generate all possible CSS variants at build time?

While it's possible to generate all variants, even unused ones, by using
[`config.staticCss`](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#using-static-css), it's generally **not
recommended** to use it for more than a few values. However, keep in mind this approach compromises one of Panda's
strengths: lean, usage-based CSS generation.

---

## Can I use one-off media query and other at rules?

Yes, you can! You can apply one-off media queries and other at rules (such as `@container`, `@supports`) in your CSS as
shown below:

```javascript
css({
  containerType: 'size',
  '@media (min-width: 10px)': {
    fontSize: 'xl',
    color: 'blue.300'
  },
  '@container (min-width: 10px)': {
    fontSize: '2xl',
    color: 'green.300'
  },
  '@supports (display: flex)': {
    fontSize: '3xl',
    color: 'red.300'
  }
})
```

---

## How can I prevent other libraries from overriding my styles?

You can use
[Layer Imports](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import#layer-name:~:text=%40import%20url%20layer(layer%2Dname)%3B>)
to prevent other libraries from overriding your styles.

First of all you cast the css from the other library(s) to a css layer:

```css
@import url('bootstrap.css') layer(bootstrap);

@import url('ionic.css') layer(ionic);
```

Then update the default layer list to deprioritize the styles from the other library(s):

```css
@layer bootstrap, reset, base, token, recipes, utilities;

@layer ionic, reset, base, token, recipes, utilities;
```

## Get started with Panda

The universal design system solution for the web

Panda is a styling engine that generates styling primitives to author atomic CSS and recipes in a type-safe and readable
manner.

Panda combines the developer experience of CSS-in-JS and the performance of atomic CSS. It leverages static analysis to
scan your JavaScript and TypeScript files for JSX style props and function calls, generating styles on-demand (aka
Just-in-Time)

> TLDR; Panda is a CSS-in-JS engine that generates atomic CSS at build time (via CLI or PostCSS)

## Installation

### General Guides

- [Panda CLI](/docs/installation/cli): The simplest way to use Panda is with the Panda CLI tool.

- [Using PostCSS](/docs/installation/postcss): (**Recommended**) Installing Panda as a PostCSS plugin is the recommended
  way to integrate it with your project.

## Why Panda

From the endless list of CSS-in-JS libraries, why should you choose Panda?

Runtime CSS-in-JS and style props are powerful features that allow developers to build dynamic UI components that are
composable, predictable, and easy to use. However, it comes at the cost of performance and runtime.

## Backstory

With the release of Server Components and the rise of server-first frameworks, most existing runtime CSS-in-JS styling
solutions (like emotion, styled-components) either can't work reliably, or can't work anymore. This new paradigm is a
huge win for performance, development, and user experience, however, it poses a new "Innovate or Die" challenge for
CSS-in-JS libraries.

> **Fun Fact:** Most CSS-in-JS libraries have a pinned issue on their GitHub repo about "Next app dir" or/and "Server
> Components" 😅, making the challenge even more obvious.

So, the question is, **is CSS-in-JS dead?** The answer is **no, but it needs to evolve!**

## The new era of CSS-in-JS

Panda is a new CSS-in-JS engine that aims to solve the challenges of CSS-in-JS in the server-first era. It provides
styling primitives to create, organize, and manage CSS styles in a type-safe and readable manner.

- **Static Analysis:** Panda uses static analysis to parse and analyze your styles at build time, and generate CSS files
  that can be used in any JavaScript framework.

- **PostCSS:** After static analysis, Panda uses a set of PostCSS plugins to convert the parsed data to atomic css at
  build time. **This makes Panda compatible with any framework that supports PostCSS.**

- **Codegen:** Panda generates a lightweight runtime JS code that is used to author styles. **Think of it as an
  optimized function that joins key-value pairs of an object**. It doesn't generate styles in the browser nor inject
  styles in the `<head>`.

- **Type-Safety:** Panda combines `csstype` and auto-generated typings to provide type-safety for css properties and
  design tokens.

- **Performance:** Panda uses a unique approach to generate atomic CSS files that are optimized for performance and
  readability.

- **Developer Experience:** Panda provides a great developer experience with a rich set of features like recipes,
  patterns, design tokens, JSX style props, and more.

- **Modern CSS**: Panda uses modern CSS features like cascade layers, css variables, modern selectors like `:where` and
  `:is` in generated styles.

## When to use Panda?

### Styling engine

If you're building a JavaScript application with a framework that supports PostCSS, Panda is a great choice for you.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { circle, stack } from '../styled-system/patterns'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      className={stack({
        direction: 'row',
        p: '4',
        rounded: 'md',
        shadow: 'lg',
        bg: 'white'
      })}
    >
      <div className={circle({ size: '5rem', overflow: 'hidden' })}>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="avatar" />
      </div>
      <div className={css({ mt: '4', fontSize: 'xl', fontWeight: 'semibold' })}>John Doe</div>
      <div className={css({ mt: '2', fontSize: 'sm', color: 'gray.600' })}>john@doe.com</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> If your framework doesn't support PostCSS, you can use the [Panda CLI](/docs/installation/cli)

### Token generator

Panda has first-class support for design tokens. It provides a way to express raw and semantic tokens for your project.
The generator can be used to create a set of CSS variables for your design tokens.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  emitTokensOnly: true,
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        gray50: { value: '#F9FAFB' },
        gray100: { value: '#F3F4F6' }
      }
    },
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        primary: { value: '{colors.gray50}' },
        success: {
          value: { _light: '{colors.green500}', _dark: '{colors.green200}' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Running the `panda codegen` will generate

```css filename="styled-system/tokens/index.css"
:root {
  --colors-gray50: #f9fafb;
  --colors-gray100: #f3f4f6;
  --colors-primary: var(--colors-gray50);
  --colors-success: var(--colors-green500);
}

[data-theme='dark'] {
  --colors-primary: var(--colors-gray50);
  --colors-success: var(--colors-green200);
}
```

Then you have a set of css variables that you can use in your project.

```css
@import '../styled-system/tokens/index.css';

.card {
  background-color: var(--colors-gray50);
}
```

## When not to use Panda?

Panda isn't the right fit for your project if:

- You're building with HTML and CSS.
- You're using a template-based framework like PHP.
- You're looking for an absolute zero JS solution.

In these scenarios, we recommend that you use vanilla CSS (which is getting awesome by the day), or other utility based
CSS libraries.

# Installation


## Using Angular

Easily use Panda with Angular with our dedicated integration.

This guide shows you how to set up Panda CSS in an Angular project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Vite project

To get started, we will need to create a new Angular project using the official
[scaffolding tool](https://angular.dev/tools/cli).

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Angular app.

```bash
ng new test-app
```

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

```bash
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
? Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? No
```

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Configure PostCSS

Create a `postcss.config.json` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```json filename="postcss.config.json"
{
  "plugins": {
    "@pandacss/dev/postcss": {}
  }
}
```

> You must use a JSON file for the PostCSS configuration, as the Angular CLI does not support JavaScript PostCSS
> configuration files.

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Angular components are included in the `include` section of the
`panda.config.ts` file.

```js {8,17} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `src/index.css` file and import it in the root component of your project.

```css filename="src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

## Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your
`src/app.component.ts` file.

```typescript filename="src/app.component.ts"
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  template: ` <div [class]="redBg"></div> `
})
export class App {
  redBg = css({ bg: 'red.400' })
}
```

</Steps>

## Using Astro

Easily use Panda with Astro with our dedicated integration.

This guide shows you how to set up Panda CSS in an Astro project using our dedicated integration.

## Setup

<Steps>

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3}
{
  "scripts": {
+   "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "start": "astro start",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview"
  }
}
```

    The `prepare` script that will run codegen after dependency installation. Read more about [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Add your panda config to your `panda.config.js` file, or wherever panda is configured in your project.

```js {6}
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  // define the content to scan 👇🏻
  include: ['./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,astro}', './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,astro}'],
  exclude: [],
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add the layer css code to the `src/index.css` file

```css filename="src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

Then, import the `src/index.css` file in your page or layout file

```md filename="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import '../index.css';
---
```

### Update the postcss config

Astro requires a little change for the `postcss.config.[c]js`:

```diff {3} filename="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
-  plugins: {
-   '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {}
-  }
+  plugins: [require('@pandacss/dev/postcss')()]
}
```

### Start your build process

Run your build process with `npm run dev` or whatever command is configured in your package.json file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Use the generated style utilities in your code, and panda will extract them to the generated CSS file.

```jsx
---
import { css } from '../../styled-system/css';
---
<div class={css({ fontSize: "2xl", fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello !</div>
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Panda CLI

An alternative way to use Panda is by running the Panda CLI tool.

This guide shows you how to use Panda as an alternative approach by running the Panda CLI tool.

<Steps>

### Install Panda

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Configure the content

Add the paths to all of your JavaScript or TypeScript code where you intend to use panda.

```js {5}
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  include: ['./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3}
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
  }
}
```

The `prepare` script that will run codegen after dependency installation. Read more about
[codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Import the generated CSS

For each Panda run, it emits the generated CSS at the `styled-system/styles.css` file path. Import this file at the root
component of your project.

```jsx {1}
import './styled-system/styles.css'

export function App() {
  return <div>Page</div>
}
```

### Start the Panda build process

Run the CLI tool to scan your JavaScript and TypeScript files for style properties and call expressions.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Run it once
    pnpm panda

    # Run it in watch mode
    pnpm panda --watch
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Run it once
    npx panda

    # Run it in watch mode
    npx panda --watch
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Run it once
    yarn panda

    # Run it in watch mode
    yarn panda --watch
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Run it once
    bun panda

    # Run it in watch mode
    bun panda --watch
    ```

  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Use the generated style utilities in your code and panda will extract them to the generated CSS file. Then run your
build process.

```jsx
import { css } from './styled-system/css'

export function App() {
  return <div className={css({ bg: 'red.400' })} />
}
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Ember

Easily use Panda with Ember with our dedicated integration.

This guide shows you how to set up Panda CSS in an Ember project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Ember project

To get started, we will need to create a new Ember project using the `embroider` build system. We will name our project
`test-app` but you can name it whatever you want.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']} variant="code">
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx ember-cli@latest new test-app --embroider --no-welcome --typescript --pnpm
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx ember-cli@latest new test-app --embroider --no-welcome --typescript
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dlx ember-cli@latest new test-app --embroider --no-welcome --typescript --yarn
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bunx ember-cli@latest new test-app --embroider --no-welcome --typescript --skip-install
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Enter the newly created directory:

```bash
cd test-app
```

### Install Panda

Install panda and its peer dependencies, as well as `postcss-loader`. Run the init command to generate the
`panda.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev postcss postcss-loader
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev postcss postcss-loader
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev postcss postcss-loader
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev postcss postcss-loader
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Enable PostCSS support

In your `ember-cli-build.js` file, configure PostCSS to process your CSS files.

```js {12-23} filename="ember-cli-build.js"
'use strict'

const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app')

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  const app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
  })

  const { Webpack } = require('@embroider/webpack')
  return require('@embroider/compat').compatBuild(app, Webpack, {
    packagerOptions: {
      webpackConfig: {
        module: {
          rules: [
            {
              test: /\.css$/i,
              use: ['postcss-loader']
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    // other options...
  })
}
```

### Configure the PostCSS plugin

Add the `.embroider` folder to the allow list so the Panda PostCSS plugin picks up your app CSS files.

```js {4} filename="postcss.config.cjs"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {
      allow: [/node_modules\/.embroider/]
    }
  }
}
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open the `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    // ...
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Ember components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file. Set the `outdir` to the app folder so the code can be imported in your Ember app. Adjust the `importMap`
accordingly to reflect your app name.

```js {8,19-22} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./app/**/*.{js,ts,gjs,gts}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // Useful for theme customization
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'app/styled-system',

  // Configure the import map to use your project name
  importMap: 'test-app/styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `app/index.css` file.

```css filename="app/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

Next, import the file in your `app/app.ts` file.

```ts {5} filename="app/app.ts"
import Application from '@ember/application'
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver'
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers'
import config from 'test-app/config/environment'
import 'test-app/index.css'

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix
  Resolver = Resolver
}

loadInitializers(App, config.modulePrefix)
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun start
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project.

```ts filename="app/components/hello-panda.ts"
import Component from '@glimmer/component'
import { css } from 'test-app/styled-system/css'

export default class HelloPanda extends Component {
  style = css({ fontSize: '5xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })
}
```

```hbs filename="app/components/hello-panda.hbs"
<div class={{this.style}}>Hello 🐼!</div>
```

```hbs {5} filename="app/templates/application.hbs"
{{page-title 'TestApp'}}

<h2 id='title'>Welcome to Ember</h2>

<HelloPanda />

{{outlet}}
```

> For the best developer experience, set up
> [template tag component authoring format](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-tag-format/) in
> Ember.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["app/styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Gatsby

Easily use Panda with Gatsby with our dedicated integration.

This guide shows you how to set up Panda CSS in a Gatsby project using PostCSS.

<Steps>

### Create Gatsby project

To get started, we will need to create a new Gatsby project. We will name our project `test-app` but you can name it
whatever you want.

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Gatsby app.

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

```
✔ What would you like to call your site? ... My Gatsby Site
✔ What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created? ... projects/ test-app
✔ Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript? ... TypeScript
✔ Will you be using a CMS? ... No (or I'll add it later)
✔ Would you like to install a styling system? ... No (or I'll add it later)
✔ Would you like to install additional features with other plugins? ... No items were selected
```

Enter the newly created directory:

```bash
cd test-app
```

### Install Panda CSS

Install Panda CSS and `gatsby-plugin-postcss` to your project. After that run the `panda init` command to setup Panda
CSS in your project.

```bash
npm install -D @pandacss/dev postcss gatsby-plugin-postcss
npx panda init --postcss
```

### Setup the Gatsby PostCSS plugin

Include the plugin in your `gatsby-config.ts` file. Check out the
[official documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-postcss/) for more information.

```ts {9} filename="gatsby-config.ts"
import type { GatsbyConfig } from 'gatsby'

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Gatsby Site`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.yourdomain.tld`
  },
  graphqlTypegen: true,
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`]
}

export default config
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "start": "gatsby develop",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your React components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

> If you use [GraphQL Typegen](/docs/how-to/local-development/graphql-typegen/), you'll need to update the `include` to
> avoid infinite loop due to generated `src/gatsby-types.d.ts`.

```js {6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/pages/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './src/components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Create `src/styles/index.css` file and add the following content:

```css filename="src/styles/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Import the entry CSS

Create a `gatsby-browser.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```ts filename="gatsby-browser.ts"
import './src/styles/index.css'
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

```bash
npm run develop
```

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your
`src/pages/index.tsx` file.

```tsx {3,7} filename="src/pages/index.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import type { HeadFC, PageProps } from 'gatsby'
import { css } from '../../styled-system/css'

const IndexPage: React.FC<PageProps> = () => {
  return <div className={css({ fontSize: '2xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello 🐼!</div>
}

export default IndexPage

export const Head: HeadFC = () => <title>Home Page</title>
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Next.js

Easily use Panda with Next.js with our dedicated integration.

Setting up Panda CSS with Next.js is straightforward. Follow the steps below to get started.

If you don't have Next.js app installed, you can follow the [Create a Next.js app](#create-a-nextjs-app) section to
create a new Next.js app, otherwise you can skip to the [Install Panda CSS](#install-panda-css) section.

<RouteSwitch values={["app-dir","pages-dir"]}>

## Start a new project

You can chose between these two options to start a new project:

<RouteSwitchTrigger values={['Using App Router', 'Using Pages Router']} />

  <Steps>
  ### Create a Next.js app

First, create a Next.js app using the official [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)
CLI. We will name our project `test-app` but you can name it whatever you want.

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Next.js app.

  </RouteSwitchContent>

Enter the newly created directory:

```bash
cd test-app
```

### Install Panda CSS

Install Panda CSS dependency using your favorite package manager.

  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
      pnpm panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npm install -D @pandacss/dev
      npx panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
      yarn panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      bun add -D @pandacss/dev
      bun panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
  </Tabs>

`panda init --postcss` command will automatically create a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project with the
following code:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {}
  }
}
```

For advanced configuration follow the Next.js PostCSS guide to set up a custom PostCSS configuration by referring to
this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/post-css#customizing-plugins).

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3}
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

The `prepare` script that will run codegen after dependency installation. Read more about
[codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your React components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

<RouteSwitchContent value="app-dir">

```ts {7} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,
  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', './src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],
  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],
  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

</RouteSwitchContent>

<RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">

```ts {7} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable}`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

</RouteSwitchContent>
<RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">

Make sure that you import the `globals.css` file in your `src/pages/_app.tsx` file as follows:

```tsx {1} filename="./src/pages/_app.tsx"
import '../styles/globals.css'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

### Start the development server

Run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

</Steps>
</RouteSwitch>

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see any styles

Sometimes Next.js caches PostCSS generated styles and when that happens you need to clear the cache. To do that, delete
the `.next` folder and restart your development server.

You can also update you `package.json` scripts to delete the `.next` folder before each build:

```diff {3,4}
{
"scripts": {
-    "dev": "next dev",
+    "dev": "rm -rf .next && next dev",
},
}
```

This is a known issue with Next.js and you can track the progress here:

- [vercel/next.js#39410](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/39410)
- [vercel/next.js#48748](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48748)
- [vercel/next.js#47533](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/47533)

### I don't see any import autocomplete in my IDE

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

### Codegen fails using es5

If you run into any error related to "Transforming const to the configured target environment ("es5") is not supported
yet", update your tsconfig to use es6 or higher:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6"
  }
}
```

## Using Nuxt

Easily use Panda with Nuxt with the vue integration.

Learn how to set up Panda CSS in a Nuxt project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Nuxt project

To get started, we will need to create a new Nuxt project using npx.

<Tabs items={['npx', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx nuxi@latest init test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bunx nuxi@latest init test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Enter the newly created directory and install the dependencies.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    yarn install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    bun install
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "dev": "nuxt dev",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "preview": "nuxt preview"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Vue components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

```js {8,17} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./app.vue', './components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}', './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `assets/css/global.css` file.

```css filename="assets/css/global.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Configure Nuxt

Add the following configuration to the `nuxt.config.ts` file

```js {1-2,5-17}  filename="nuxt.config.ts"
import { createResolver } from '@nuxt/kit'
const { resolve } = createResolver(import.meta.url)

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  alias: {
    'styled-system': resolve('./styled-system')
  },

  css: ['@/assets/css/global.css'],

  postcss: {
    plugins: {
      '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {}
    }
  }
})
```

With the above we've performed the following:

- imported the global css file '@/assets/css/global.css' at the root of the system.
- created an alias that points to the `styled-system` directory.
- added panda into the postcss plugins section.

## Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project.

As an example here is a snippet of code for a `components/Demo.vue` file.

```xml filename="components/Demo.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { css } from "styled-system/css";
</script>

<template>
  <div :class="css({ fontSize: '5xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })">Hello 🐼!</div>
</template>
```

</Steps>

## Using PostCSS

Installing Panda as a PostCSS plugin is the recommended way to integrate it with your project.

This guide shows you how to install Panda as a PostCSS plugin, which is the recommended way to integrate it with your
project.

<Steps>
### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev postcss
    pnpm panda init -p
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev postcss
    npx panda init -p
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev postcss
    yarn panda init -p
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev postcss
    bun panda init -p
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Add Panda to your PostCSS config

Add panda to your `postcss.config.cjs` file, or wherever PostCSS is configured in your project.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {}
  }
}
```

### Configure the content

Add your panda config to your `panda.config.js` file, or wherever panda is configured in your project.

```js {5}
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  include: ['./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3}
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
  }
}
```

The `prepare` script will run codegen after dependency installation. Read more about
[codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `index.css` file which is going to be the root css of your project.

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Start your build process

Run your build process by feeding the [root css](#configure-the-entry-css-with-layers) to PostCSS in your preferred way.

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'JS API']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    postcss -o output.css index.css
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```js
    const postcss = require("postcss");
    const fs = require("fs");

    fs.readFile("index.css", (err, css) => {
      postcss()
        .process(css, { from: "index.css", to: "output.css" })
        .then((result) => {
          console.log(result.css);
        });
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

> If you're using a framework, PostCSS is probably already integrated with your build process. Check our other guides or
> the documentation of your framework to see how to configure PostCSS.

### Start using Panda

Use the generated style utilities in your code and panda will extract them to the generated CSS file.

```jsx
import { css } from './styled-system/css'

export function App() {
  return <div className={css({ bg: 'red.400' })} />
}
```

  </Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

You will be asked a few questions, answer these as follows:

```sh
? Where should we create your new project? test-app
? Install dependencies? No
```

> **Note:** You should decline the dependency installation step as we will install dependencies together with Panda CSS.

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production react-router build",
    "dev": "react-router dev",
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js",
    "typecheck": "react-router typegen && tsc"
  },
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the Panda CSS output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your React Router components are included in the `include` section of the
`panda.config.ts` file.

```ts {5,8,11} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./app/**/{**,.client,.server}/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Replace TailwindCSS with PandaCSS

Update the `vite.config.ts` file to use PandaCSS instead of TailwindCSS.

```ts {3,10} filename="vite.config.ts"
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite'
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'
import pandacss from '@pandacss/dev/postcss'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  css: {
    postcss: {
      plugins: [pandacss, autoprefixer]
    }
  },
  plugins: [reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()]
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Create a new file `app/app.css` and add the following content:

```css filename="app/app.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Update the root component

Import the `app.css` file in your `app/root.tsx` file and add the `styles` variable to the `links` function.

Please note the `?url` query parameter in the `import` statement. This is required by Vite to generate the correct path
to the CSS file.

```tsx {4,8} filename="app/root.tsx"
import { isRouteErrorResponse, Links, Meta, Outlet, Scripts, ScrollRestoration } from 'react-router'

import type { Route } from './+types/root'
import stylesheet from './app.css?url'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  // ...
  { rel: 'stylesheet', href: stylesheet }
]

export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your
`app/routes/home.tsx` file.

```tsx filename="app/routes/home.tsx"
import type { Route } from './+types/home'
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

export function meta({}: Route.MetaArgs) {
  return [{ title: 'New React Router App' }, { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to React Router!' }]
}

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className={css({ fontSize: '2xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Welcome to the home page</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["app", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Redwood

Easily use Panda with Redwood.js with our dedicated integration.

This guide shows you how to set up Panda CSS in a Redwood project using PostCSS.

> Redwood uses `yarn` as its primary package manager.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Redwood project

To get started, we will need to create a new Redwood project using `typescript` template.

```bash
yarn create redwood-app app
```

Respond to the prompts as follows:

```bash
✔ Compatibility checks passed
✔ Select your preferred language · TypeScript
✔ Do you want to initialize a git repo? · no / Yes
✔ Enter a commit message · Initial commit
✔ Do you want to run yarn install? · no / Yes
✔ Project files created
✔ Initialized a git repo with commit message "Initial commit"
✔ Installed node modules
✔ Generated types
```

### Install Panda

Install panda and generate the `panda.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` file.

```bash
cd web
yarn add -D @pandacss/dev postcss postcss-loader
yarn panda init --postcss
```

### Move to config folder

Redwood uses a `config` folder for all of the configuration files. Move the `panda.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js`
files to the `config` folder.

```bash
mv panda.config.ts postcss.config.js config/
```

### Update configs

Update the postcss config file to use the `panda.config.ts` file.

```diff filename="web/config/postcss.config.js"
+ const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    "@pandacss/dev/postcss": {
+      configPath: path.resolve(__dirname, 'panda.config.ts'),
   },
  },
}
```

Update the tsconfig file to include the `styled-system` folder.

```json {6} filename="web/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      // ...
      "styled-system/*": ["./styled-system/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open the `web/package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Redwood components are included in the `include` section of the
`panda.config.ts` file.

```js {5} filename="web/config/panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true,
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `src/style/index.css` file imported in the root component of your project.

```css filename="web/src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

## Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

```bash
yarn rw dev
```

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project.

```tsx filename="web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.tsx"
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
import { stack } from 'styled-system/patterns'
import { Link, routes } from '@redwoodjs/router'
import { MetaTags } from '@redwoodjs/web'

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MetaTags title="Home" description="Home page" />

      <div
        className={stack({
          bg: { base: 'red.300', _hover: 'red.500' },
          py: '12',
          px: '8'
        })}
      >
        <h1 className={css({ fontSize: '4xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>HomePage</h1>
        <p>Hello World</p>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="web/tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Remix

How to use Panda with Remix with our dedicated integration.

This guide will show you how to set up Panda CSS in a Remix project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Remix project

To get started, we will need to create a new Remix project using the official
[Create Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/quickstart) CLI. In this guide, we will use TypeScript.

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Remix app.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx create-remix@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx create-remix@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash

  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix dev",
    "start": "remix-serve build",
    "typecheck": "tsc"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the Panda CSS output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Remix components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

```js {5, 11} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./app/routes/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}', './app/components/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Create a new file `app/index.css` and add the following content:

```css filename="app/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

Import the `index.css` file in your `app/root.tsx` file and add the `styles` variable to the `links` function.

Please note the `?url` query parameter in the `import` statement. This is required by Vite to generate the correct path
to the CSS file.

```tsx filename="app/root.tsx" {4,6}
import type { LinksFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { Links, LiveReload, Meta, Outlet, Scripts, ScrollRestoration } from '@remix-run/react'

import styles from './index.css?url'

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: styles }]

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your
`app/routes/_index.tsx` file.

```tsx filename="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import type { MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/node'
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [{ title: 'New Remix App' }, { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to Remix!' }]
}

export default function Index() {
  return <div className={css({ fontSize: '2xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello 🐼!</div>
}
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

If your app doesn't reload when making changes to the `panda.config.ts` file, consider adding `watchPaths` in your remix
config file.

```js filename="remix.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  watchPaths: ['panda.config.ts']
}
```

    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your `src/App.tsx`
file.

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import type { Component } from 'solid-js'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App: Component = () => {
  return <div class={css({ fontSize: '2xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello 🐼!</div>
}

export default App
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Storybook

Easily use Panda with Storybook with our dedicated integration.

Learn how to set up Panda CSS in a Storybook project using PostCSS.

## Setup

We are assuming that you already have a project set up with a framework like React, Vue or Svelte.

<Steps>

### Install Storybook

Storybook needs to be installed into a project that is already set up with a framework. It will not work on an empty
project.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx storybook@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx storybook@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dlx storybook@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bunx storybook@latest init
    ```
  </Tab>
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

If you are using Storybook with the Vite builder, you will have to update your PostCSS config file to use the array
syntax for the plugins instead of the object syntax. Simply change `postcss.config.[c]js`:

```diff filename="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
-  plugins: {
-   '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {}
-  }
+  plugins: [require('@pandacss/dev/postcss')()]
}
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Storybook components are included in the `include` section of the
`panda.config.ts` file.

```ts {7} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,
  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './stories/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],
  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Locate your main CSS file and add the following layers:

```css filename="src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Import the CSS in your Storybook config

Locate your `.storybook/preview.ts` file and import the CSS file.

In this example CSS file is located in the `src` folder.

```ts {1} filename=".storybook/preview.ts"
import '../src/index.css'

import type { Preview } from '@storybook/react'

const preview: Preview = {
  parameters: {
    actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
    controls: {
      matchers: {
        color: /(background|color)$/i,
        date: /Date$/
      }
    }
  }
}

export default preview
```

### Start the Storybook server

Run the following command to start your Storybook server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm storybook
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run storybook
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn storybook
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun storybook
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in Storybook.

Here is the example of a Button component and its corresponding Storybook story:

```tsx filename="src/stories/Button.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { css } from '../../styled-system/css'

export interface IButtonProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

export const Button = ({ children }: IButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={css({
        bg: 'red.300',
        fontFamily: 'Inter',
        px: '4',
        py: '3',
        borderRadius: 'md',
        _hover: { bg: 'red.400' }
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="src/stories/Button.stories.tsx"
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { css } from '../../styled-system/css'

import { Button } from './Button'

const meta = {
  title: 'Example/Button',
  component: Button,
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  decorators: [
    Story => (
      <div className={css({ m: 10 })}>
        <Story />
      </div>
    )
  ]
} satisfies Meta<typeof Button>

export default meta
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Hello 🐼!'
  }
}
```

</Steps>

## Configuring Dark Mode

To enable dark mode in Storybook, you can use the `@storybook/addon-themes` package.

```bash
pnpm add -D @storybook/addon-themes
```

Then, update your `.storybook/preview.ts` file to include the following:

```ts filename=".storybook/preview.ts"
import { withThemeByClassName } from '@storybook/addon-themes'
import type { Preview, ReactRenderer } from '@storybook/react'

const preview: Preview = {
  // ...
  decorators: [
    withThemeByClassName<ReactRenderer>({
      themes: {
        light: '',
        dark: 'dark'
      },
      defaultTheme: 'light'
    })
  ]
}

export default preview
```

With that in place, you should see the light/dark switcher in Storybook's toolbar.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot find postcss plugin

If you are having issues with the PostCSS plugin similar to `Cannot find module '@pandacss/dev/postcss'`, update the
PostCSS config as follows:

```js filename="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require('@pandacss/dev/postcss')]
}
```

### HMR not triggered

If you are having issues with HMR not being triggered after a `panda.config.ts` change (or one of its
[dependencies](/docs/references/config#dependencies), you can manually specify the files that should trigger a rebuild
by adding the following to your `panda.config.ts`:

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  dependencies: ['path/to/files/**.ts']
})
```

### Styles in `args` is not generated

If you are having issues with your `args` not generating the expected CSS, it's probably because of:

- you didn't add a file glob for the Storybook files in your [`config.include`](/docs/references/config#include) like
  `"./stories/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"`
- you didn't wrap your `args` object (or some part of it) with the
  [`.raw()` marker that helps Panda find style usage](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#alternative)

```tsx filename="stories/Button.stories.tsx"
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { button } from '../../styled-system/recipes'

export const Funky: Story = {
  // mark this as a button recipe usage
  args: button.raw({
    visual: 'funky',
    shape: 'circle',
    size: 'sm'
  })
}
```

### Some recipes styles are missing

If you are having issues with your config `recipes` or `slotRecipes` not generating the expected CSS, it's probably
because of:

- you didn't add a file glob for the Storybook files in your [`config.include`](/docs/references/config#include) like
  `"./stories/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"`
- you haven't used every recipes variants in your app, so you might want to pre-generate it (only for storybook usage)
  with [`staticCss`](/docs/guides/static)

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  staticCss: {
    recipes: '*'
  }
})
```

## Using Svelte

Easily use Panda with Svelte with our dedicated integration.

This guide will show you how to set up Panda CSS in a Svelte project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Svelte project

To get started, we will need to create a new Svelte project.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm create svelte@latest test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm create svelte@latest test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn create svelte@latest test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun create svelte@latest test-app
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

```sh
┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◇  Which Svelte app template?
│  Skeleton project
│
◇  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
│
◇  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
│  ◼ Add ESLint for code linting
│  ◼ Add Prettier for code formatting
│  ◻ Add Playwright for browser testing
│  ◻ Add Vitest for unit testing
│
└  Your project is ready!
```

Enter the newly created directory and install the dependencies.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    yarn
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    bun install
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Install Panda

To install Panda and corresponding dependencies run the following commands:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```json {3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "check": "svelte-kit sync && svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json",
    "check:watch": "svelte-kit sync && svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json --watch",
    "lint": "prettier --plugin-search-dir . --check . && eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --plugin-search-dir . --write ."
  }
}
```

This `"prepare"` script will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
[codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Svelte components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

```js {8} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,svelte}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Update Svelte config

To configure Svelte preprocess to use PostCSS and add Panda alias update the `svelte.config.js` file as follows:

```js {15} filename="svelte.config.js"
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto'
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // Consult https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/integrations#preprocessors
  // for more information about preprocessors
  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()],
  kit: {
    // adapter-auto only supports some environments, see https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto for a list.
    // If your environment is not supported or you settled on a specific environment, switch out the adapter.
    // See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters for more information about adapters.
    adapter: adapter(),
    alias: {
      'styled-system': './styled-system/*'
    }
  }
}

export default config
```

### Update Vite config

To be able to import `styled-system` files in your Svelte components you will need to update the `vite.config.js` file
as follows:

```js {6-10} filename="vite.config.js"
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit()],
  server: {
    fs: {
      allow: ['styled-system']
    }
  }
})
```

If you’re using Storybook for a SvelteKit project, you need to replicate the same Vite server config changes. In your
.storybook folder, you likely have a `main.js` (or `vite.config.js` in older Storybook versions). Update it as follows:

```js filename="main.js"
import { defineConfig, mergeConfig } from 'vite'

/** @type { import('@storybook/sveltekit').StorybookConfig } */

const config = {
  // other Storybook config...
  viteFinal: async config => {
    return mergeConfig(
      config,
      defineConfig({
        server: {
          fs: {
            allow: ['styled-system']
          }
        }
      })
    )
  }
}
export default config
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Create the `app.css` file in the `src` directory and add the following content:

```css filename="src/app.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Import styles in the layout file

Create the `src/routes/+layout.svelte` file and add the following content:

```svelte {2} filename="src/routes/+layout.svelte"
<script>
  import '../app.css'
</script>

<slot />
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your
`src/routes/+page.svelte` file.

```svelte filename="src/routes/+page.svelte"
<script>
	import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
</script>

<div class={css({ fontSize: '2xl',	fontWeight: 'bold' })}>
	Hello 🐼!
</div>
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Autocomplete not working

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
TypeScript config. However, in Svelte your main `tsconfig.json` file is extending the autogenerated one. To extend it
without overriding the defaults adjust your `svelte.config.js` to include following entry:

```js filename="svelte.config.js"
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto'
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // ...
  kit: {
    // ...
    typescript: {
      config: config => {
        config.include.push('../styled-system')
        return config
      }
    }
  }
}

export default config
```

## Using Vite

Easily use Panda with Vite, React and Typescript with our dedicated integration.

This guide will show you how to set up Panda CSS in a Vite project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Vite project

To get started, we will need to create a new Vite project using `react-ts` template.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm create vite test-app --template react-ts
    cd test-app
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest test-app -- --template react-ts
    cd test-app
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your React components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

```js {8} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // Generates JSX utilities with options of React, Preact, Qwik, Solid, Vue
  jsxFramework: 'react',

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `src/index.css` file imported in the root component of your project.

```css filename="src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

> **Note:** Feel free to remove `src/App.css` file as we don't need it anymore, and make sure to remove the import from
> the `src/App.tsx` file.

## Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return <div className={css({ fontSize: '2xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello 🐼!</div>
}

export default App
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
`tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src", "styled-system"]
}
```

## Using Vue

Easily use Panda with Vue with our dedicated integration.

Learn how to set up Panda CSS in a Vue project using PostCSS.

## Start a new project

<Steps>

### Create Vite project

To get started, we will need to create a new Vue project using the official
[scaffolding tool](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Vue app.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm create vue@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm create vue@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn create vue@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun create vue@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

```bash
Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

✔ Project name: … test-app
✔ Add TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Add JSX Support? … Yes
✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? … No / Yes
✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No / Yes
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? … No / Yes
✔ Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? › No
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No / Yes
✔ Add Prettier for code formatting? … No / Yes
```

Enter the newly created directory and install the dependencies.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    yarn
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    cd test-app
    bun install
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Install Panda

Install panda and create your `panda.config.ts` file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -D @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add -D @pandacss/dev
    bun panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "run-p type-check build-only",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "build-only": "vite build"
  }
}
```

- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about
  [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

> This step ensures that the panda output directory is regenerated after each dependency installation. So you can add
> the output directory to your `.gitignore` file and not worry about it.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your Vue components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts`
file.

```js {8, 17} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // Whether to use css reset
  preflight: true,

  // Where to look for your css declarations
  include: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue}'],

  // Files to exclude
  exclude: [],

  // The output directory for your css system
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Add this code to an `src/index.css` file and import it in the root component of your project.

```css filename="src/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

## Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project. Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your `src/App.vue`
file.

```vue-html filename="src/App.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { css } from "../styled-system/css";
</script>

<template>
  <div :class="css({ fontSize: '5xl', fontWeight: 'bold' })">Hello 🐼!</div>
</template>
```

# Concepts


## Cascade Layers

CSS cascade layers refer to the order in which CSS rules are applied to an HTML element.

When multiple CSS rules apply
to the same element, the browser uses the cascade to determine which rule should take precedence. See the
[MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) to learn more.

Panda takes advantage of the cascade to provide a more efficient and flexible way to organize styles. This allows you to
define styles in a modular way, using CSS rules that are scoped to specific components or elements.

## Layer Types

Panda supports five types of cascade layers out of the box:

- `@layer reset` - The reset layer is used to reset the default styles of HTML elements. This is used when
  `preflight: true` is set in the config. You can also use this layer to add your own reset styles.

The generated CSS for the reset layer looks like this:

```css
@layer reset {
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

- `@layer base` - The base layer contains global styles defined in the `globalStyles` key in the config. You can also
  use this layer to add your own global styles.

The generated CSS for the base layer looks like this:

```css
@layer base {
  a {
    color: #000;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

- `@layer recipes` - The recipes layer contains styles for recipes created within the config (aka config recipes). You
  can also use this layer to add your own component styles.

The generated CSS for the recipes layer looks like this:

```css
@layer recipes {
  .button {
    /* ... */
  }

  .button--variant-primary {
    /* ... */
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

- `@layer tokens` - The tokens layer contains css variables for tokens and semantic tokens. You can also use this layer
  to add your own design tokens.

The generated CSS for the tokens layer looks like this:

```css
@layer tokens {
  :root {
    --color-primary: #000;
    --color-secondary: #fff;
    --color-tertiary: #ccc;
    --shadow-sm: 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

- `@layer utilities` - Styles that are scoped to a specific utility class. These styles are only applied to elements
  that have the utility class applied.

## Layer Order

The cascade layers are applied in the following order:

- `@layer utilities` (Highest priority)
- `@layer recipes`
- `@layer tokens`
- `@layer base`
- `@layer reset` (Lowest priority)

This means that styles defined in the `@layer utilities` will take precedence over styles defined in the
`@layer recipes`. This is useful when you want to override the default styles of a component.

## Layer CSS

The generated CSS in Panda is organized into layers. This allows you to define styles in a modular way, using CSS rules
that are scoped to specific components or elements.

Here's what the first line of the generated CSS looks like:

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

Adding this line to the top of your CSS file will determine the order in which the layers are applied. This is the most
exciting feature of CSS cascade layers.

## Customize layers

Panda lets you customize the cascade layers, so your project can coexist with other solutions. Learn more about customizing layers [here](/docs/references/config#layers).

## Polyfills

In event that you need to support older browsers, you can use the following postcss plugin in your PostCSS config:

- [postcss-cascade-layers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers): Adds support for CSS Cascade Layers.

Here is an example of a `postcss.config.js` file that uses these polyfills:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@pandacss/dev/postcss', '@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers']
}
```

Since CSS `@layer`s have a lower priority than other CSS rules, this postcss plugin is also useful in cases where your styles are being overridden by some other stylesheets that you're not in total control of, since it will remove the `@layer` rules and still emulate their specificity.

## Color opacity modifier

How to dynamically set the opacity of a raw color or color token

Every utilities connected to the `colors` tokens in the `@pandacss/preset-base` (included by default) can use the
[`color-mix`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix) CSS function. This means for
example: `background`, `backgroundColor`, `color`, `border`, `borderColor`, etc.

This function allows you to mix two colors together, and we use it to change the opacity of a color using the
`{color}/{opacity}` syntax.

You can use it like this:

```ts
css({
  bg: 'red.300/40',
  color: 'white'
})
```

This will generate:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .bg_red\.300\/40 {
    --mix-background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--colors-red-300) 40%, transparent);
    background: var(--mix-background, var(--colors-red-300));
  }

  .text_white {
    color: var(--colors-white);
  }
}
```

- If you're not using any opacity, the utility will **not** use `color-mix`
- The utility will automatically fallback to the original color if the `color-mix` function is not supported by the
  browser.
- You can use any of the color tokens, and any of the opacity tokens.

---

The `utilities` transform function also receives a `utils` object that contains the `colorMix` function, so you can also
use it on your own utilities:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    background: {
      shorthand: 'bg',
      className: 'bg',
      values: 'colors',
      transform(value, args) {
        const mix = args.utils.colorMix(value)
        // This can happen if the value format is invalid (e.g. `bg: red.300/invalid` or `bg: red.300//10`)
        if (mix.invalid) return { background: value }

        return {
          background: mix.value
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

---

Here's a cool snippet (that we use internally !) that makes it easier to create a utility transform for a given
property:

```ts
import type { PropertyTransform } from '@pandacss/types'
export const createColorMixTransform =
  (prop: string): PropertyTransform =>
  (value, args) => {
    const mix = args.utils.colorMix(value)
    if (mix.invalid) return { [prop]: value }
    const cssVar = '--mix-' + prop
    return {
      [cssVar]: mix.value,
      [prop]: `var(${cssVar}, ${mix.color})`
    }
  }
```

then the same utility transform as above can be written like this:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    background: {
      shorthand: "bg",
      className: "bg",
      values: "colors",
      transform: createColorMixTransform("background"),
  },
});
```

## Conditional Styles

Learn how to use conditional and responsive styles in Panda.

When writing styles, you might need to apply specific changes depending on a specific condition, whether it's based on
breakpoint, css pseudo state, media query or custom data attributes.

Panda allows you to write conditional styles, and provides common condition shortcuts to make your life easier. Let's
say you want to change the background color of a button when it's hovered. You can do it like this:

```jsx
<button
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.500',
    _hover: { bg: 'red.700' }
  })}
>
  Hover me
</button>
```

## Overview

### Property based condition

This works great, but might be a bit verbose. You can apply the condition `_hover` directly to the `bg` property,
leading to a more concise syntax:

```diff
<button
  className={css({
-   bg: 'red.500',
-   _hover: { bg: 'red.700' }
+   bg: { base: 'red.500', _hover: 'red.700' }
  })}
>
  Hover me
</button>
```

> Note: The `base` key is used to define the default value of the property, without any condition.

### Nested condition

Conditions in Panda can be nested, which means you can apply multiple conditions to a single property or another
condition.

Let's say you want to change the background color of a button when it's focused and hovered. You can do it like this:

```jsx
<button
  className={css({
    bg: { base: 'red.500', _hover: { _focus: 'red.700' } }
  })}
>
  Hover me
</button>
```

### Built-in conditions

Panda includes a set of common pseudo states that you can use to style your components:

- Pseudo Class: `_hover`, `_active`, `_focus`, `_focusVisible`, `_focusWithin`, `_disabled`
- Pseudo Element: `_before`, `_after`
- Media Query: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`
- Data Attribute Selector: `_horizontal`, `_vertical`, `_portrait`, `_landscape`

## Arbitrary selectors

What if you need a one-off selector that is not defined in your config's conditions? You can use the `css` function to
generate classes for arbitrary selectors:

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        '&[data-state=closed]': { color: 'red.300' },
        '& > *': { margin: '2' }
      })}
    />
  )
}
```

This also works with the supported at-rules (`@media`, `@layer`, `@container`, `@supports`, and `@page`):

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className={css({ display: 'flex', containerType: 'size' })}>
      <div
        className={css({
          '@media (min-width: 768px)': {
            color: 'red.300'
          },
          '@container (min-width: 10px)': {
            color: 'green.300'
          },
          '@supports (display: flex)': {
            fontSize: '3xl',
            color: 'blue.300'
          }
        })}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Pseudo Classes

### Hover, Active, Focus, and Disabled

You can style the hover, active, focus, and disabled states of an element using their `_` modifier:

```jsx
<button
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.500',
    _hover: { bg: 'red.700' },
    _active: { bg: 'red.900' }
  })}
>
  Hover me
</button>
```

### First, Last, Odd, Even

You can style the first, last, odd, and even elements of a group using their `_` modifier:

```jsx
<ul>
  {items.map(item => (
    <li key={item} className={css({ _first: { color: 'red.500' } })}>
      {item}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

You can also style even and odd elements using the `_even` and `_odd` modifier:

```jsx
<table>
  <tbody>
    {items.map(item => (
      <tr
        key={item}
        className={css({
          _even: { bg: 'gray.100' },
          _odd: { bg: 'white' }
        })}
      >
        <td>{item}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Pseudo Elements

### Before and After

You can style the `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements of an element using their `_before` and `_after` modifier:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    _before: { content: '"👋"' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

#### Notes

- **Before and After**: Ensure you wrap the content value in double quotes.
- **Mixing with Conditions**: When using condition and pseudo elements, prefer to place the condition **before** the
  pseudo element.

```jsx
css({
  // This works ✅
  _dark: { _backdrop: { color: 'red' } }
  // This doesn't work ❌
  _backdrop: { _dark: { color: 'red' } }
})
```

The reason `_backdrop: { _dark: { color: 'red' } }` doesn't work is because it generated an invalid CSS structure that
looks like:

```css
&::backdrop {
  &.dark,
  .dark & {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

### Placeholder

Style the placeholder text of any input or textarea using the `_placeholder` modifier:

```jsx
<input
  placeholder="Enter your name"
  className={css({
    _placeholder: { color: 'gray.500' }
  })}
/>
```

### File Inputs

Style the file input button using the `_file` modifier:

```jsx
<input
  type="file"
  className={css({
    _file: { bg: 'gray.500', px: '4', py: '2', marginEnd: '3' }
  })}
/>
```

## Media Queries

### Reduced Motion

Use the `_motionReduce` and `_motionSafe` modifiers to style an element based on the user's motion preference:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    _motionReduce: { transition: 'none' },
    _motionSafe: { transition: 'all 0.3s' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

### Color Scheme

The `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark
color theme.

Use the `_osLight` and `_osDark` modifiers to style an element based on the user's color scheme preference:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'white',
    _osDark: { bg: 'black' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

Let's say your app is dark by default, but you want to allow users to switch to a light theme. You can do it like this:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'black',
    _osLight: { bg: 'white' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

### Color Contrast

The `prefers-contrast` media feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a high or low contrast
theme.

Use the `_highContrast` and `_lessContrast` modifiers to style an element based on the user's color contrast preference:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'white',
    _highContrast: { bg: 'black' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

### Orientation

The `orientation` media feature is used to detect if the user has a device in portrait or landscape mode.

Use the `_portrait` and `_landscape` modifiers to style an element based on the user's device orientation:

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    pb: '4',
    _portrait: { pb: '8' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

## Group Selectors

When you need to style an element based on its parent element's state or attribute, you can add the `group` class to the
parent element, and use any of the `_group*` modifiers on the child element.

```jsx
<div className="group">
  <p className={css({ _groupHover: { bg: 'red.500' } })}>Hover me</p>
</div>
```

This modifer for every pseudo class modifiers like `_groupHover`, `_groupActive`, `_groupFocus`, and `_groupDisabled`,
etc.

## Sibling Selectors

When you need to style an element based on its sibling element's state or attribute, you can add the `peer` class to the
sibling element, and use any of the `_peer*` modifiers on the target element.

```jsx
<div>
  <p className="peer">Hover me</p>
  <p className={css({ _peerHover: { bg: 'red.500' } })}>I'll change by bg</p>
</div>
```

> Note: This only works for when the element marked with `peer` is a previous siblings, that is, it comes before the
> element you want to start.

## Data Attribute

### LTR and RTL

You can style an element based on the direction of the text using the `_ltr` and `_rtl` modifiers:

```jsx
<div dir="ltr">
  <div
    className={css({
      _ltr: { ml: '3' },
      _rtl: { mr: '3' }
    })}
  >
    Hello
  </div>
</div>
```

For this to work, you need to set the `dir` attribute on the parent element. In most cases,you can set this on the
`html` element.

> **Note:** Consider using logical css properties like `marginInlineStart` and `marginInlineEnd` instead their physical
> counterparts like `marginLeft` and `marginRight`. This will reduce the need to use the `_ltr` and `_rtl` modifiers.

### State

You can style an element based on its `data-{state}` attribute using the corresponding `_{state}` modifier:

```jsx
<div
  data-loading
  className={css({
    _loading: { bg: 'gray.500' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

This also works for common states like `data-active`, `data-disabled`, `data-focus`, `data-hover`, `data-invalid`,
`data-required`, and `data-valid`.

```jsx
<div
  data-active
  className={css({
    _active: { bg: 'gray.500' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

> Most of the `data-{state}` attributes typically mirror the corresponding browser pseudo class. For example,
> `data-hover` is equivalent to `:hover`, `data-focus` is equivalent to `:focus`, and `data-active` is equivalent to
> `:active`.

### Orientation

You can style an element based on its `data-orientation` attribute using the `_horizontal` and `_vertical` modifiers:

```jsx
<div
  data-orientation="horizontal"
  className={css({
    _horizontal: { bg: 'red.500' },
    _vertical: { bg: 'blue.500' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

## ARIA Attribute

You can style an element based on its `aria-{state}=true` attribute using the corresponding `_{state}` modifier:

```jsx
<div
  aria-expanded="true"
  className={css({
    _expanded: { bg: 'gray.500' }
  })}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

> Most of the `aria-{state}` attributes typically mirror the support ARIA states in the browser pseudo class. For
> example, `aria-checked=true` is styled with `_checked`, `aria-disabled=true` is styled with `_disabled`.

## Container queries

You can define container names and sizes in your theme configuration and use them in your styles.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      containerNames: ['sidebar', 'content'],
      containerSizes: {
        xs: '40em',
        sm: '60em',
        md: '80em'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

The default container sizes in the `@pandacss/preset-panda` preset are shown below:

```ts
export const containerSizes = {
  xs: '320px',
  sm: '384px',
  md: '448px',
  lg: '512px',
  xl: '576px',
  '2xl': '672px',
  '3xl': '768px',
  '4xl': '896px',
  '5xl': '1024px',
  '6xl': '1152px',
  '7xl': '1280px',
  '8xl': '1440px'
}
```

Then use them in your styles by referencing using `@<container-name>/<container-size>` syntax:

> The default container syntax is `@/<container-size>`.

```ts
import { css } from '/styled-system/css'

function Demo() {
  return (
    <nav className={css({ containerType: 'inline-size' })}>
      <div
        className={css({
          fontSize: { '@/sm': 'md' }
        })}
      />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

This will generate the following CSS:

```css
.cq-type_inline-size {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 60em) {
  .\@\/sm:fs_md {
    container-type: inline-size;
  }
}
```

You can also named container queries:

```ts
import { cq } from 'styled-system/patterns'

function Demo() {
  return (
    <nav className={cq({ name: 'sidebar' })}>
      <div
        className={css({
          fontSize: { base: 'lg', '@sidebar/sm': 'md' }
        })}
      />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

## Reference

Here's a list of all the condition shortcuts you can use in Panda:

| Condition name         | Selector                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Custom conditions

Panda lets you create your own conditions, so you're not limited to the ones in the default preset. Learn more about
customizing conditions [here](/docs/customization/conditions).

---


## The extend keyword

What is and how to to use the extend keyword

The `extend` keyword allows you to extend the default Panda configuration. It is useful when you want to add your own
customizations to Panda, without erasing the default `presets` values (`conditions`, `tokens`, `utilities`, etc).

It will (deeply) merge your customizations with the default ones, instead of replacing them.

The `extend` keyword allows you to extend the following parts of Panda:

- [conditions](/docs/customization/conditions)
- [theme](/docs/customization/theme)
- [recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes) (included in theme)
- [patterns](/docs/customization/patterns)
- [utilities](/docs/customization/utilities)
- [globalCss](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#global-styles)
- [staticCss](/docs/guides/static)

> These keys are all allowed in [presets](/docs/customization/presets).

## Example

After running the `panda init` command you should see something similar to this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...

  // Useful for theme customization
  theme: {
    extend: {} // 👈 it's already there! perfect, now you just need to add your customizations in this object
  }

  // ...
})
```

Let's say you want to add a new color to the default theme. You can do it like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: { value: '#ff0000' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This will add a new color to the default theme, without erasing the other ones.

Now, let's say we want to create new property `br` that applies a border radius to an element.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      br: {
        className: 'rounded', // css({ br: "sm" }) => rounded-sm
        values: 'radii', // connect values to the radii tokens
        transform(value) {
          return { borderRadius: value }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

What if this utility was coming from a preset (`@acme/my-preset`) ? You can extend any specific part, as it will be
deeply merged with the existing one:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@acme/my-preset']
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      br: {
        className: 'br' // css({ br: "sm" }) => br-sm
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Removing something from a preset

Let's say you want to remove the `br` utility from the `@acme/my-preset` preset. You can do it like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import myPreset from '@acme/my-preset'

const { br, ...utilities } = myPreset.utilities

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@acme/my-preset']
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      ...utilities, // 👈 we still want the other utilities from this preset
      // your customizations here
    }
  }
})
```

## Removing something from the base presets

Let's say you want to remove the `stack` pattern from the `@pandacss/preset-base` preset (included by default).

You can pick only the parts that you need with and spread the rest, like this:

```ts
import pandaBasePreset from '@pandacss/preset-base'

// omitting stack here
const { stack, ...pandaBasePresetPatterns } = pandaBasePreset.patterns

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-panda'], // 👈 we still want the tokens, breakpoints and textStyles from this preset

  // ⚠️ we need to eject to prevent the `@pandacss/preset-base` from being resolved
  // https://panda-css.com/docs/customization/presets#which-panda-presets-will-be-included-
  eject: true,
  patterns: {
    extend: {
      ...pandaBasePresetPatterns
      // your customizations here
    }
  }
})
```

## Minimal setup

If you want to use Panda with the bare minimum, without any of the defaults, you can read more about it
[here](/docs/guides/minimal-setup)

## FAQ

### Why is my preset overriding the base one, even after adding it to the array?

You might have forgotten to include the `extend` keyword in your config. Without `extend`, your preset will completely
replace the base one, instead of merging with it.

## Global Styles

How to work with resets, global styles, and global CSS variables in Panda.

Panda groups global styles into reset and base layers so you can control defaults predictably and override them safely.

## Layers overview

- **@layer reset**: Preflight/reset styles, enabled with `preflight`.
- **@layer base**: Your additional global styles via `globalCss`.

> See also: [Cascade layers](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers)

## Reset (preflight)

Enable or scope the reset styles.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: true
})
```

Scope and level:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: { scope: '.extension', level: 'element' }
})
```

## Exposed global CSS variables

These variables are used by the reset and defaults. Set them in `globalCss`:

- `--global-font-body`
- `--global-font-mono`
- `--global-color-border`
- `--global-color-placeholder`
- `--global-color-selection`
- `--global-color-focus-ring`

## Setting global styles (base)

Use `globalCss` to define additional global styles and set variables.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  globalCss: {
    html: {
      '--global-font-body': 'Inter, sans-serif',
      '--global-font-mono': 'Mononoki Nerd Font, monospace',
      '--global-color-border': 'colors.gray.400',
      '--global-color-placeholder': 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
      '--global-color-selection': 'rgba(0,115,255,0.3)',
      '--global-color-focus-ring': 'colors.blue.400'
    }
  }
})
```

### Theming patterns

You can set variables on `:root`, a `.dark` class, or via media queries.

```css
:root {
  --global-color-border: oklch(0.8 0 0);
}
.dark {
  --global-color-border: oklch(0.72 0 0);
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --global-color-border: oklch(0.72 0 0);
  }
}
```

## Custom global variables (`globalVars`)

Define additional global CSS variables or `@property` entries.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  globalVars: {
    '--button-color': {
      syntax: '<color>',
      inherits: false,
      initialValue: 'blue'
    }
  }
})
```

> Keys from `globalVars` are suggestable in style objects and generated near your tokens at `cssVarRoot`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Global styles aren't applied:** Confirm `preflight` is enabled (if you expect reset), and ensure your selector
  (`html`, `:root`, `.dark`, etc.) matches the element where variables are set.

- **Global styles are overridden by utilities or component styles:** Verify layer order and specificity. Ensure
  `@layer reset` and `@layer base` are emitted before utilities. If you customize insertion or injection order (SSR,
  framework plugins), preserve `@layer` order so globals are not overridden.

## Panda Integration Hooks

Leveraging hooks in Panda to create custom functionality.

Panda hooks can be used to add new functionality or modify existing behavior during certian parts of the compiler
lifecycle.

Hooks are mostly callbacks that can be added to the panda config via the `hooks` property, or installed via `plugins`.

Here are some examples of what you can do with hooks:

- modify the resolved config (`config:resolved`), like strip out tokens or keyframes.
- modify presets after they are resolved (`preset:resolved`), like removing specific tokens or theme properties from a
  preset.
- tweak the design token or classname engine (`tokens:created`, `utility:created`), like prefixing token names, or
  customizing the hashing function
- transform a source file to a `tsx` friendly syntax before it's parsed (`parser:before`) so that Panda can
  automatically extract its styles usage
- create your own styles parser (`parser:before`, `parser:after`) using the file's content so that Panda could be used
  with any templating language
- alter the generated JS and DTS code (`codegen:prepare`)
- modify the generated CSS (`cssgen:done`), allowing all kinds of customizations like removing the unused CSS variables,
  etc.
- restrict `strictTokens` to a specific set of token categories, ex: only affect `colors` and `spacing` tokens and
  therefore allow any value for `fontSizes` and `lineHeights`

## Examples

### Prefixing token names

This is especially useful when migrating from other css-in-js libraries, [like Stitches.](/docs/migration/stitches)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        formatTokenName: path => '$' + path.join('-')
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Customizing the hash function

When using the [`hash: true`](/docs/concepts/writing-styles) config property, you can customize the function used to
hash the classnames.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hash: true,
  hooks: {
    'utility:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        toHash: (paths, toHash) => {
          const stringConds = paths.join(':')
          const splitConds = stringConds.split('_')
          const hashConds = splitConds.map(toHash)
          return hashConds.join('_')
        }
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Modifying the config

Here's an example of how to leveraging the provided `utils` functions in the `config:resolved` hook to remove the
`stack` pattern from the resolved config.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'config:resolved': ({ config, utils }) => {
      return utils.omit(config, ['patterns.stack'])
    }
  }
})
```

### Modifying presets

You can use the `preset:resolved` hook to modify presets after they are resolved. This is useful for customizing or
filtering out parts of a preset.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'preset:resolved': ({ utils, preset, name }) => {
      if (name === '@pandacss/preset-panda') {
        return utils.omit(preset, ['theme.tokens.colors', 'theme.semanticTokens.colors'])
      }
      return preset
    }
  }
})
```

### Configuring JSX extraction

Use the `matchTag` / `matchTagProp` functions to customize the way Panda extracts your JSX.

This can be especially useful when working with libraries that have properties that look like CSS properties but are not
and should be ignored.

Let's see a Radix UI example where the `Select.Content` component has a `position` property that should be ignored:

```js
// Here, the `position` property will be extracted because `position` is a valid CSS property, but we don't want that
<Select.Content position="popper" sideOffset={5}>
```

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'parser:before': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        // ignore the Select.Content entirely
        matchTag: tag => tag !== 'Select.Content',
        // ...or specifically ignore the `position` property
        matchTagProp: (tag, prop) => tag === 'Select.Content' && prop !== 'position'
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Remove unused variables from final css

Here's an example of how to transform the generated css in the `cssgen:done` hook.

```ts file="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { removeUnusedCssVars } from './remove-unused-css-vars'
import { removeUnusedKeyframes } from './remove-unused-keyframes'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'cssgen:done': ({ artifact, content }) => {
      if (artifact === 'styles.css') {
        return removeUnusedCssVars(removeUnusedKeyframes(content))
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Get the snippets for the removal logic from our Github Sandbox in the
[remove-unused-css-vars](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/blob/main/sandbox/vite-ts/remove-unused-css-vars.ts) and
[remove-unused-keyframes](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/blob/main/sandbox/vite-ts/remove-unused-keyframes.ts)
files.

> Note: Using this means you can't use the JS function [`token.var`](/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#using-tokenvar) (or
> [token(xxx)](/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#using-token) where `xxx` is the path to a
> [semanticToken](/docs/theming/tokens#semantic-tokens)) from `styled-system/tokens` as the CSS variables will be
> removed based on the usage found in the generated CSS

## Sharing hooks

Hooks can be shared as a snippet or as a `plugin`. Plugins are currently simple objects that contain a `name` associated
with a `hooks` object with the same structure as the `hooks` object in the config.

> Plugins differ from `presets` as they can't be extended, but they will be called in sequence in the order they are
> defined in the `plugins` array, with the user's config called last.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      name: 'token-format',
      hooks: {
        'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
          configure({
            formatTokenName: path => '$' + path.join('-')
          })
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

## JSX Style Context

JSX Style Context provides an ergonomic way to style compound components with slot recipes.

It uses a context-based approach to distribute recipe styles across multiple child components, making it easier to style
headless UI libraries like Ark UI, and Radix UI.

## Atomic Slot Recipe

- Create a slot recipe using the `sva` function
- Pass the slot recipe to the `createStyleContext` function
- Use the `withProvider` and `withContext` functions to create compound components

```tsx
// components/ui/card.tsx

import { sva } from 'styled-system/css'
import { createStyleContext } from 'styled-system/jsx'

const card = sva({
  slots: ['root', 'label'],
  base: {
    root: {},
    label: {}
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: { root: {} },
      md: { root: {} }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})

const { withProvider, withContext } = createStyleContext(card)

const Root = withProvider('div', 'root')
const Label = withContext('label', 'label')

export const Card = {
  Root,
  Label
}
```

Then you can use the `Root` and `Label` components to create a card.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

import { Card } from './components/ui/card'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Card.Root>
      <Card.Label>Hello</Card.Label>
    </Card.Root>
  )
}
```

## Config Slot Recipe

The `createStyleContext` function can also be used with slot recipes defined in the `panda.config.ts` file.

- Pass the config recipe to the `createStyleContext` function
- Use the `withProvider` and `withContext` functions to create compound components

```tsx
// components/ui/card.tsx

import { card } from '../styled-system/recipes'
import { createStyleContext } from 'styled-system/jsx'

const { withProvider, withContext } = createStyleContext(card)

const Root = withProvider('div', 'root')
const Label = withContext('label', 'label')

export const Card = {
  Root,
  Label
}
```

Then you can use the `Root` and `Label` components to create a card.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

import { Card } from './components/ui/card'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Card.Root>
      <Card.Label>Hello</Card.Label>
    </Card.Root>
  )
}
```

## createStyleContext

This function is a factory function that returns three functions: `withRootProvider`, `withProvider`, and `withContext`.

### withRootProvider

Creates the root component that provides the style context. Use this when the root component **does not render an
underlying DOM element**.

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@ark-ui/react'

//...

const DialogRoot = withRootProvider(Dialog.Root)
```

### withProvider

Creates a component that both provides context and applies the root slot styles. Use this when the root component
**renders an underlying DOM element**.

> **Note:** It requires the root `slot` parameter to be passed.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react'

//...

const AvatarRoot = withProvider(Avatar.Root, 'root')
```

### withContext

Creates a component that consumes the style context and applies slot styles. It does not accept variant props directly,
but gets them from context.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@ark-ui/react'

//...

const AvatarImage = withContext(Avatar.Image, 'image')
const AvatarFallback = withContext(Avatar.Fallback, 'fallback')
```

### unstyled prop

Every component created with `createStyleContext` supports the `unstyled` prop to disable styling. It is useful when you
want to opt-out of the recipe styles.

- When applied the root component, will disable all styles
- When applied to a child component, will disable the styles for that specific slot

```tsx
// Removes all styles
<AvatarRoot unstyled>
  <AvatarImage />
  <AvatarFallback />
</AvatarRoot>

// Removes only the styles for the image slot
<AvatarRoot>
  <AvatarImage unstyled css={{ bg: 'red' }} />
  <AvatarFallback />
</AvatarRoot>
```

## Guides

### Config Recipes

The rules of config recipes still applies when using `createStyleContext`. Ensure the name of the final component
matches the name of the recipe.

> If you want to use a custom name, you can configure the recipe's `jsx` property in the `panda.config.ts` file.

```tsx
// recipe name is "card"
import { card } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const { withRootProvider, withContext } = createStyleContext(card)

const Root = withRootProvider('div')
const Header = withContext('header', 'header')
const Body = withContext('body', 'body')

// The final component name must be "Card"
export const Card = {
  Root,
  Header,
  Body
}
```

### Default Props

Use `defaultProps` option to provide default props to the component.

```tsx
const { withContext } = createStyleContext(card)

export const CardHeader = withContext('header', 'header', {
  defaultProps: {
    role: 'banner'
  }
})
```

## Merging Styles

Learn how to merge multiple styles without conflicts.

## Merging `css` objects

You can merge multiple style objects together using the `css` function.

```js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

const style1 = {
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
}

const style2 = {
  bg: 'blue'
}

const className = css(style1, style2) // => 'bg_blue text_white'
```

In some cases though, the style object might not be colocated in the same file as the component. In this case, you can
use the `css.raw` function to preserve the original style object.

> All `.raw(...)` signatures are identity functions that return the same value as the input, but serve as a hint to the
> compiler that the value is a style object.

```js
// style.js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

export const style1 = css.raw({
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
})

// component.js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
import { style1 } from './style.js'

const style2 = css.raw({
  bg: 'blue'
})

const className = css(style1, style2) // => 'bg_blue text_white'
```

## Spreading `css.raw` objects

> **Added in v1.6.1**

You can also spread `css.raw` objects within style declarations. This is particularly useful for reusing styles in
nested selectors, conditions, and complex compositions:

### Child selectors

```js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

const baseStyles = css.raw({ margin: 0, padding: 0 })

const component = css({
  '& p': { ...baseStyles, fontSize: '1rem' },
  '& h1': { ...baseStyles, fontSize: '2rem' }
})
```

### Nested conditions

```js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

const interactive = css.raw({ cursor: 'pointer', transition: 'all 0.2s' })

const card = css({
  _hover: {
    ...interactive,
    _dark: { ...interactive, color: 'white' }
  }
})
```

## Merging `cva` + `css` styles

The same technique can be used to merge an atomic `cva` recipe and a style object.

```js
import { css, cx, cva } from 'styled-system/css'

const overrideStyles = css.raw({
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
})

const buttonStyles = cva({
  base: {
    bg: 'blue',
    border: '1px solid black'
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: { fontSize: '12px' }
    }
  }
})

const className = css(
  // returns the resolved style object
  buttonStyles.raw({ size: 'small' }),
  // add the override styles
  overrideStyles
)

// => 'bg_red border_1px_solid_black color_white font-size_12px'
```

## Merging `sva` + `css` styles

The same technique can be used to merge an atomic `sva` recipe and a style object.

```js
import { css, sva } from 'styled-system/css'

const overrideStyles = css.raw({
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
})

const buttonStyles = sva({
  slots: ['root']
  base: {
    root: {
      bg: 'blue',
      border: '1px solid black'
    }
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      root: {
        small: { fontSize: '12px' }
      }
    }
  }
})

// returns the resolved style object for all slots
const { root } = buttonStyles.raw({ size: 'small' })

const className = css(
  root,
  // add the override styles
  overrideStyles
)

// => 'bg_red border_1px_solid_black color_white font-size_12px'
```

## Merging config recipe and style object

Due to the fact that the generated styles of a config recipe are saved in the `@layer recipe` cascade layer, they can be
overridden with any atomic styles. Use the `cx` function to achieve that.

> The `utilties` layer has more precedence than the `recipe` layer.

```js
import { css, cx } from 'styled-system/css'
import { button } from 'styled-system/recipes'

const className = cx(
  // returns the resolved class name: `button button--size-small`
  button({ size: 'small' }),
  // add the override styles
  css({ bg: 'red' }) // => 'bg_red'
)

// => 'button button--size-small bg_red'
```

## Merging within JSX component

Using these techniques, you can apply them to a component by exposing a `css` prop and merge with local styles.

> **Note:** For this to work, Panda requires that you set `jsxFramework` config option to `react`

```jsx
const cardStyles = css.raw({
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
})

function Card({ title, description, css: cssProp }) {
  return (
    // merge the `cardStyles` with the `cssProp` passed in
    <div className={css(cardStyles, cssProp)}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

// usage
function Demo() {
  return <Card title="Hello World" description="This is a card component" css={{ bg: 'blue' }} />
}
```

If you use any other prop name other than `css`, then you must use the `css.raw(...)` function to ensure Panda extracts
the style object.

```jsx
const cardStyles = css.raw({
  bg: 'red',
  color: 'white'
})

function Card({ title, description, style }) {
  return (
    // merge the `cardStyles` with the `style` passed in
    <div className={css(cardStyles, style)}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

// usage
function Demo() {
  return (
    <Card
      title="Hello World"
      description="This is a card component"
      // use `css.raw(...)` to ensure Panda extracts the style object
      style={css.raw({ bg: 'blue' })}
    />
  )
}
```

## Patterns

Patterns are layout primitives that can be used to create robust and responsive layouts with ease. Panda comes with predefined patterns like stack, hstack, vstack, wrap, etc. These patterns can be used as functions or JSX elements.

Think of patterns as a set of predefined styles to reduce repetition and improve readability. You can override the
properties as needed, just like in the `css` function.

## Creating Patterns

To learn how to create patterns, check out the [customization](/docs/customization/patterns) section.

## Predefined Patterns

### Box

The Box pattern does not contain any additional styles. With its function form it's the equivalent of the `css`
function. It can be useful with its JSX form and is the equivalent of a `styled.div` component, serving mostly to get
style props available in JSX.

```tsx
import { Box } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <Box color="blue.300">
      <div>Cool !</div>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

### Container

The Container pattern is used to create a container with a max-width and center the content.

By default, the container sets the following properties:

- `maxWidth: 8xl`
- `marginX: auto`
- `position: relative`
- `paddingX: { base: 4, md: 6, lg: 8 }`

<Tabs items={['Function', 'JSX']}>
<Tab>

```tsx
import { container } from '../styled-system/patterns'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={container()}>
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```tsx
import { Container } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </Container>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Stack

The Stack pattern is a layout primitive that can be used to create a vertical or horizontal stack of elements.

The `stack` function accepts the following properties:

- `direction`: An alias for the css `flex-direction` property. Default is `column`.
- `gap`: The gap between the elements in the stack.
- `align`: An alias for the css `align-items` property.
- `justify`: An alias for the css `justify-content` property.

<Tabs items={['Function', 'JSX']}>
<Tab>

```tsx
import { stack } from '../styled-system/patterns'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={stack({ gap: '6', padding: '4' })}>
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```tsx
import { Stack } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack gap="6" padding="4">
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### HStack

The HStack pattern is a wrapper around the `stack` pattern that sets the `direction` property to `horizontal`, and
centers the elements vertically.

<Tabs items={['Function', 'JSX']}>
<Tab>

```tsx
import { hstack } from '../styled-system/patterns'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={hstack({ gap: '6' })}>
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```tsx
import { HStack } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <HStack gap="6">
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </HStack>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### VStack

The VStack pattern is a wrapper around the `stack` pattern that sets the `direction` property to `vertical`, and centers
the elements horizontally.

<Tab>

```tsx
import { vstack } from '../styled-system/patterns'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={vstack({ gap: '6' })}>

      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
    </VStack>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Wrap

The Wrap pattern is used to add space between elements and wraps automatically if there isn't enough space.

The `wrap` function accepts the following properties:

- `gap`: The gap between the elements in the stack.
- `columnGap`: The gap between the elements in the stack horizontally.
- `rowGap`: The gap between the elements in the stack vertically.
- `align`: An alias for the css `align-items` property.
- `justify`: An alias for the css `justify-content` property.

<Tabs items={['Function', 'JSX']}>

      <div>Third</div>
    </Wrap>
  )
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Aspect Ratio

The Aspect Ratio pattern is used to create a container with a fixed aspect ratio. It is used when displaying images,
maps, videos and other media.

> **Note:** In most cases, we recommend using the `aspectRatio` property instead of the pattern.

The `aspectRatio` function accepts the following properties:

- `ratio`: The aspect ratio of the container. Can be a number or a string.

<Tabs items={['Function', 'JSX']}>
<Tab>

### cq (Container Query)

To make it easier to use container queries, we've added a new `cq` pattern to `@pandacss/preset-base`. It is used to
apply styles based on the width of the container.

The `cq` function accepts the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the container query, Maps to the
  [`containerName` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/container-name).
- `type`: The type of the container query. Maps to the
  [`containerType` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/container-type). Defaults to
  `inline-size`.

```ts
import { cq } from 'styled-system/patterns'

function Demo() {
  return (
    <nav className={cq()}>
      <div
        className={css({
          fontSize: { base: 'lg', '@/sm': 'md' },
        })}
      />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

You can also named container queries:

```tsx
// 1 - Define container conditions

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    containerNames: ['sidebar', 'content'],
    containerSizes: {
      xs: '40em',
      sm: '60em',
      md: '80em'
    }
  }
})
```

```tsx
// 2 - Automatically generate container query pattern

import { cq } from 'styled-system/patterns'

function Demo() {
  return (
    <nav className={cq({ name: 'sidebar' })}>
      <div
        className={css({
          // When the sidebar container reaches the `sm` size
          // change font size to `md`
          fontSize: { base: 'lg', '@sidebar/sm': 'md' }
        })}
      />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

Read more about container queries [here](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles#container-queries).

## Usage with JSX

To use the pattern in JSX, you need to set the `jsxFramework` property in the config. When this is set, Panda will emit
files for JSX elements based on the framework.

Every pattern can be used as a JSX element and imported from the `/jsx` entrypoint. By default, the pattern name is the
function name in PascalCase. You can override both the component name (with the `jsx` config property) and the element
rendered (with the `jsxElement` config property).

Learn more about pattern customization [here](/docs/customization/patterns).

```tsx
import { VStack, Center } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return (
    <VStack gap="6" mt="4">
      <div>First</div>
      <div>Second</div>
      <div>Third</div>
      <Center>4</Center>
    </VStack>
  )
}
```

### Advanced JSX Tracking

We recommend that you use the pattern functions in most cases, in design systems there might be a need to compose
existing components to create new components.

To track the usage of the patterns in these cases, you'll need to add the `jsx` hint for the pattern config

```js {12} filename="button.pattern.ts"
import { definePattern } from '@pandacss/dev'

const scrollable = definePattern({
  // ...
  // Add the jsx hint to track the usage of the pattern in JSX, you can also use a regex to match multiple components
  jsx: ['Scrollable', 'PageScrollable']
})
```

Then you can create a new component that uses the `PageScrollable` component and Panda will track the usage of the
`scrollable` pattern as well.

```tsx
const PageScrollable = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  const { children, size } = props
  return (
    <Scrollable {...props} size={size}>
      {children}
    </Scrollable>
  )
}
```

## Recipes

Panda provides a way to write CSS-in-JS with better performance, developer experience, and composability.

Recipes are a way to create multi-variant styles with a type-safe runtime API.

A recipe consists of four properties:

- `base`: The base styles for the component
- `variants`: The different visual styles for the component
- `compoundVariants`: The different combinations of variants for the component
- `defaultVariants`: The default variant values for the component

> **Credit:** This API was inspired by [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/),
> [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), and [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/).

[Comparison table between the different types of recipes here: "Should I use atomic or config recipes ?"](/docs/concepts/recipes#should-i-use-atomic-or-config-recipes-)

## Atomic Recipe (or cva)

Atomic recipes are a way to create multi-variant atomic styles with a type-safe runtime API.

They are defined using the `cva` function which was inspired by [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/). The
`cva` function which takes an object as its argument.

> **Note:** `cva` is not the same as [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/). The `cva` from Panda is a
> purpose-built function for creating atomic recipes that are connected to your design tokens and utilities.

### Defining the recipe

```jsx
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = cva({
  base: {
    display: 'flex'
  },
  variants: {
    visual: {
      solid: { bg: 'red.200', color: 'white' },
      outline: { borderWidth: '1px', borderColor: 'red.200' }
    },
    size: {
      sm: { padding: '4', fontSize: '12px' },
      lg: { padding: '8', fontSize: '24px' }
    }
  }
})
```

### Using the recipe

The returned value from the `cva` function is a function that can be used to apply the recipe to a component. Here's an
example of how to use the `button` recipe:

```jsx
import { button } from './button'

const Button = () => {
  return <button className={button({ visual: 'solid', size: 'lg' })}>Click Me</button>
}
```

When a recipe is created, Panda will extract and generate CSS for every variant and compoundVariant `css` ahead of time,
as atomic classes.

```css
@layer utilities {
  .d_flex {
    display: flex;
  }

  .bg_red_200 {
    background-color: #fed7d7;
  }

  .color_white {
    color: #fff;
  }

  .border_width_1px {
    border-width: 1px;
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

### Setting the default variants

The `defaultVariants` property is used to set the default variant values for the recipe. This is useful when you want to
apply a variant by default. Here's an example of how to use `defaultVariants`:

```jsx
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = cva({
  base: {
    display: 'flex'
  },
  variants: {
    visual: {
      solid: { bg: 'red.200', color: 'white' },
      outline: { borderWidth: '1px', borderColor: 'red.200' }
    },
    size: {
      sm: { padding: '4', fontSize: '12px' },
      lg: { padding: '8', fontSize: '24px' }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    visual: 'solid',
    size: 'lg'
  }
})
```

### Compound Variants

Compound variants are a way to combine multiple variants together to create more complex sets of styles. They are
defined using the `compoundVariants` property , which takes an array of objects as its argument. Each object in the
array represents a set of conditions that must be met in order for the corresponding styles to be applied.

Here's an example of how to use `compoundVariants` in Panda:

```js
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = cva({
  base: {
    padding: '8px 16px',
    borderRadius: '4px',
    fontSize: '16px',
    fontWeight: 'bold'
  },

  variants: {
    size: {
      small: {
        fontSize: '14px',
        padding: '4px 8px'
      },
      medium: {
        fontSize: '16px',
        padding: '8px 16px'
      },
      large: {
        fontSize: '18px',
        padding: '12px 24px'
      }
    },
    color: {
      primary: {
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        color: 'white'
      },
      secondary: {
        backgroundColor: 'gray',
        color: 'black'
      }
    },
    disabled: {
      true: {
        opacity: 0.5,
        cursor: 'not-allowed'
      }
    }
  },

  // compound variants
  compoundVariants: [
    // apply when both small size and primary color are selected
    {
      size: 'small',
      color: 'primary',
      css: {
        border: '2px solid blue'
      }
    },
    // apply when both large size and secondary color are selected and the button is disabled
    {
      size: 'large',
      color: 'secondary',
      disabled: true,
      css: {
        backgroundColor: 'lightgray',
        color: 'darkgray',
        border: 'none'
      }
    },
    // apply when both small or medium size, and secondary color variants are applied
    {
      size: ['small', 'medium'],
      color: 'secondary',
      css: {
        fontWeight: 'extrabold'
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

Here's an example usage of the `button` recipe:

```jsx
import { button } from './button'

const Button = () => {
  // will apply size: small, color: primary, css: { border: '2px solid blue' }
  return <button className={button({ size: 'small', color: 'primary' })}>Click Me</button>
}
```

Overall, using compound variants allows you to create more complex sets of styles that can be applied to your components
based on multiple conditions.

By combining simple variants together in this way, you can create a wide range of visual styles without cluttering up
your code with lots of conditional logic.

### TypeScript Guide

Panda provides a `RecipeVariantProps` type utility that can be used to infer the variant properties of a recipe.

This is useful when you want to use the recipe in JSX and want to get type safety for the variants.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { cva, type RecipeVariantProps } from '../styled-system/css'

const buttonStyle = cva({
  base: {
    color: 'red',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: {
        fontSize: '1rem'
      },
      large: {
        fontSize: '2rem'
      }
    }
  }
})

export type ButtonVariants = RecipeVariantProps<typeof buttonStyle> // { size?: 'small' | 'large' }

export const Button = styled('button', buttonStyle)
```

### Usage in JSX

You can create a JSX component from any existing atomic recipe by using the `styled` function from the `/jsx`
entrypoint.

The `styled` function takes the element type as its first argument, and the recipe as its second argument.

> Make sure to add the `jsxFramework` option to your `panda.config` file, and run `panda codegen` to generate the JSX
> entrypoint.

```js
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const buttonStyle = cva({
  base: {
    color: 'red',
    textAlign: 'center'
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: {
        fontSize: '1rem'
      },
      large: {
        fontSize: '2rem'
      }
    }
  }
})

const Button = styled('button', buttonStyle)
```

Then you can use the component in JSX

```jsx
<Button size="large">Click me</Button>
```

## Config Recipe

Config recipes are extracted and generated just in time, this means regardless of the number of recipes in the config,
only the recipes and variants you use will exist in the generated CSS.

The config recipe takes the following additional properties:

- `className`: The name of the recipe. Used in the generated class name
- `jsx`: An array of JSX components that use the recipe. Defaults to the uppercase version of the recipe name
- `description`: An optional description of the recipe (used in the js-doc comments)

> As of v0.9, the `name` property is removed in favor of `className`

### Defining the recipe

To define a config recipe, import the `defineRecipe` helper function

```jsx filename="button.recipe.ts"
import { defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const buttonRecipe = defineRecipe({
  className: 'button',
  description: 'The styles for the Button component',
  base: {
    display: 'flex'
  },
  variants: {
    visual: {
      funky: { bg: 'red.200', color: 'white' },
      edgy: { border: '1px solid {colors.red.500}' }
    },
    size: {
      sm: { padding: '4', fontSize: '12px' },
      lg: { padding: '8', fontSize: '40px' }
    },
    shape: {
      square: { borderRadius: '0' },
      circle: { borderRadius: 'full' }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    visual: 'funky',
    size: 'sm',
    shape: 'circle'
  }
})
```

### Adding recipe to config

To add the recipe to the config, you’d need to add it to the `theme.recipes` object.

```jsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { buttonRecipe } from './button.recipe'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      recipes: {
        button: buttonRecipe
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Generate JS code

This generates a recipes folder the specified `outdir` which is `styled-system` by default. If Panda doesn’t
automatically generate your CSS file, you can run the `panda codegen` command.

You only need to import the recipes into the component files where you need to use them.

### Using the recipe

To use the recipe, you can import the recipe from the `<outdir>/recipes` entrypoint and use it in your component. Panda
tracks the usage of the recipe and only generates CSS of the variants used in your application.

```js
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button className={button()}>Click me</button>
      <button className={button({ shape: 'circle' })}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The generated css is registered under the `recipe` [cascade layer](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers.mdx) with the class
name that matches the recipe-variant name pattern `<recipe-className>--<variant-name>`.

> **Technical Notes 📝:** Only the recipe and variants used in your application are generated. Not more!

```css
@layer recipes {
  @layer base {
    .button {
      font-size: var(--font-sizes-lg);
    }
  }

  .button--visual-funky {
    background-color: var(--colors-red-200);
    color: var(--colors-white);
  }

  .button--size-lg {
    padding: var(--space-8);
    font-size: var(--font-sizes-40px);
  }
}
```

### Responsive and Conditional variants

Recipes created in the config have a **special** feature; they can be applied based on a specific breakpoints or
conditions.

Here's how to tweak the size variant of the button recipe based on breakpoints.

```jsx
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button className={button({ size: { base: 'sm', md: 'lg' } })}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> In most cases, we don't recommend applying conditional variants inline. Ideally, you might want to render different
> views for your responsive breakpoints.

### TypeScript Guide

Every recipe ships a type interface for its accepted variants. You can import them from the `styled-system/recipes`
entrypoint.

For the button recipe, we can import the `ButtonVariants` type like so:

```ts
import React from 'react'
import type { ButtonVariants } from '../styled-system/recipes'

type ButtonProps = ButtonVariants & {
  children: React.ReactNode
}
```

### Usage in JSX

Layer recipes can be consumed directly in your custom JSX components. Panda will automatically track the usage of the
recipe if the component name matches the recipe name.

For example, if your recipe is called `button` and you create a `Button` component from it, Panda will automatically
track the usage of the variant properties.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { button, type ButtonVariants } from '../styled-system/recipes'

type ButtonProps = ButtonVariants & {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  const { children, size } = props
  return (
    <button {...props} className={button({ size })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button size="lg">Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Advanced JSX Tracking

We recommend that you use the recipe functions in most cases, in design systems there might be a need to compose
existing components (like Button) to create new components.

To track the usage of the recipes in these cases, you'll need to add the `jsx` hint for the recipe config

```js {12} filename="button.recipe.ts"
import { defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const button = defineRecipe({
  base: {
    color: 'red',
    fontSize: '1.5rem'
  },
  variants: {
    // ...
  },
  // Add the jsx hint to track the usage of the recipe in JSX, you can use regex to match multiple components
  jsx: ['Button', 'PageButton']
})
```

Then you can create a new component that uses the `Button` component and Panda will track the usage of the `button`
recipe as well.

```tsx
const PageButton = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  const { children, size } = props
  return (
    <Button {...props} size={size}>
      {children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```

#### Extending a preset recipe

If you're using a recipe from a preset, you can still extend it in your config.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      recipes: {
        button: {
          className: 'something-else', // 👈 override the className
          base: {
            color: 'red', // 👈 replace some part of the recipe
            fontSize: '1.5rem' // or add new styles
          },
          variants: {
            // ... // 👈 add or extend new variants
          },
          jsx: ['Button', 'PageButton'] // 👈 extend the jsx tracking hint
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Learn more about the [extend](/docs/concepts/extend.md) keyword.

## Methods and Properties

Both atomic and config recipe ships a helper methods and properties that can be used to get information about the
recipe.

- `variantKeys`: An array of the recipe variant keys
- `variantMap`: An object of the recipe variant keys and their values
- `splitVariantProps`: A function that takes an object as its argument and returns an array containing the recipe
  variant props and the rest of the props

```js
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'

const buttonRecipe = cva({
  base: {
    color: 'red',
    fontSize: '1.5rem'
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        fontSize: '1rem'
      },
      md: {
        fontSize: '2rem'
      }
    }
  }
})

buttonRecipe.variantKeys
// => ['size']

buttonRecipe.variantMap
// => { size: ['sm', 'md'] }

buttonRecipe.splitVariantProps({ size: 'sm', onClick() {} })
// => [{ size: 'sm'}, { onClick() {} }]
```

These methods and properties are useful when creating custom components or writing Storybook stories for your recipes.

Here's a Storybook example.

```tsx filename="button.stories.tsx"
import { Button, buttonRecipe } from './components/button'

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    size: {
      control: {
        type: 'select',
        options: buttonRecipe.variantMap.size
      }
    }
  }
}

export const Demo = {
  render: args => <Button {...args}>Click me</Button>
}
```

## Best Practices

- Leverage css variables in the base styles as much as possible. Makes it easier to theme the component with JS
- Don't mix styles by writing complex selectors. Separate concerns and group them in logical variants
- Use the `compoundVariants` property to create more complex sets of styles

## Limitations

- Recipes created from `cva` cannot have responsive or conditional values. Only layer recipes can have responsive or
  conditional values.

- Due to static nature of Panda, it's not possible to track the usage of the recipes in all cases. Here are some of use
  cases that Panda won't be able to track the usage of the recipe variants:

  **When you change the name of the variant prop in the JSX component**

  In below example, the `size` prop is renamed to `buttonSize`

  ```tsx
  const Button = ({ buttonSize, children }) => {
    return (
      <button {...props} className={button({ size: buttonSize })}>
        {children}
      </button>
    )
  }
  ```

  **When you use the recipe in a custom component that is not named as per the recipe name, Panda won't be able to track
  the usage of the recipe variants.**

  In below example, the component name `Button` is renamed to `Random` and we are using `button` recipe.

  ```tsx
  const Random = ({ size, children }) => {
    return (
      <button {...props} className={button({ size })}>
        {children}
      </button>
    )
  }
  ```

- When using `compoundVariants` in the recipe, you're not able to use responsive values in the variants.

```tsx
const button = defineRecipe({
  base: {
    color: 'red',
    fontSize: '1.5rem'
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        fontSize: '1rem'
      },
      md: {
        fontSize: '2rem'
      }
    }
  },
  // this  will disable responsive values for the variants
  compoundVariants: [
    {
      size: 'sm',
      visual: 'funky',
      css: {
        color: 'blue'
      }
    },
    {
      size: 'md',
      visual: 'funky',
      css: {
        color: 'green'
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

## Static CSS

Panda provides a way to generate `static CSS` for your recipes. This is useful when you want to generate CSS for a
recipe without using the recipe in your code or if you use dynamic styling that Panda can't keep track of.

More information about static CSS can be found [here](/docs/guides/static.md#generating-recipes).

## Should I use atomic or config recipes ?

[Config recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes#config-recipe) are generated just in time, meaning that only the recipes and
variants you use will exist in the generated CSS, regardless of the number of recipes in the config.

This contrasts with [Atomic recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes#atomic-recipe-or-cva) (cva), which generates all of the
variants regardless of what was used in your code. The reason for this difference is that all `config.recipes` are known
at the start of the panda process when we evaluate your config.

In contrast, the CVA recipes are scattered throughout your code. To get all of them and find their usage across your
code, we would need to scan your app code multiple times, which would not be ideal performance-wise.

When dealing with simple use cases, or if you need code colocation, or even avoiding dynamic styling, atomic recipes
shine by providing all style variants. Config recipes are preferred for design system components, delivering leaner CSS
with only the styles used. Choose according to your component needs.

## Responsive Design

How to write mobile responsive designs in your CSS in Panda

Responsive design is a fundamental aspect of modern web development, allowing websites and applications to adapt
seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Panda provides a comprehensive set of responsive utilities and features to facilitate the creation of responsive
layouts. It lets you do this through conditional styles for different breakpoints.

Let's say you want to change the font weight of a text on large screens, you can do it like this:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: 'medium',
    lg: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

> Panda uses a mobile-first breakpoint system and leverages min-width media queries `@media(min-width)` when you write
> responsive styles.

Panda provides five breakpoints by default:

```ts
const breakpoints = {
  sm: '640px',
  md: '768px',
  lg: '1024px',
  xl: '1280px',
  '2xl': '1536px'
}
```

## Overview

### Property based modifier

Panda allows you apply the responsive condition directly to a style property, resulting in a more concise syntax:

```diff
<span
  className={css({
-   fontWeight: 'medium',
-   lg: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
+   fontWeight: { base: 'medium', lg: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

### The Array syntax

Panda also accepts arrays as values for responsive styles. Pass the corresponding value for each breakpoint in the
array. Using our previous code as an example:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: ['medium', undefined, undefined, 'bold']
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

> We're leaving the corresponding values of the unused breakpoints `md` and `lg` as undefined.

### Targeting a breakpoint range

By default, styles assigned to a specific breakpoint will be effective at that breakpoint and will persist as applied
styles at larger breakpoints.

If you wish to apply a utility exclusively when a particular range of breakpoints is active, Panda offers properties
that restrict the style to that specific range. To construct the property, combine the minimum and maximum breakpoints
using the "To" notation in camelCase format.

Let's say we want to apply styles between the `md` and `xl` breakpoints, we use the `mdToXl` property:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: { mdToXl: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

> This text will only be bold in `md`, `lg` and `xl` breakpoints.

### Targeting a single breakpoint

To target a single breakpoint, you can easily achieve this by simply adding the suffix "Only" to the breakpoint name in
camelCase format.

Let's say we want to apply styles only in the `lg` breakpoint, we use the `lgOnly` property:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: { lgOnly: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

### Customizing Breakpoints

When encountering certain scenarios, it may become necessary to establish custom breakpoints tailored to your
application's needs. It is advisable to utilize commonly used aliases such as `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` for this
purpose.

In order to define custom breakpoints, you can easily accomplish this by passing them as an object within your Panda
config.

> Note: Make sure that the CSS units of your breakpoints are consistent. Use either all pixels (`px`) or all `em`, but
> do not mix them.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      breakpoints: {
        sm: '640px',
        md: '768px',
        lg: '1024px',
        xl: '1280px',
        '2xl': '1536px'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Hiding elements by breakpoint

If you need to limit the visibility of an element to any breakpoint, Panda provides
[display utilities](/docs/utilities/display) to help you achieve this.

## Slot Recipes

Learn how to style multiple parts components with slot recipes.

When using `cva` or `defineRecipe` might be enough for simple cases, slot recipes are a better fit for more complex
cases.

A slot recipe consists of these properties:

- `slots`: An array of component parts to style
- `base`: The base styles per slot
- `variants`: The different visual styles for each slot
- `defaultVariants`: The default variant for the component
- `compoundVariants`: The compound variant combination and style overrides for each slot.

> **Credit:** This API was inspired by multipart components in
> [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/component-style) and slot variants in
> [Tailwind Variants](https://tailwind-variants.org)

[See the comparison table between atomic recipes (`cva`) and `config recipes` here.](/docs/concepts/recipes#should-i-use-atomic-or-config-recipes-)
The same comparison applies to `sva` and `slot recipes`.

## Atomic Slot Recipe (or sva)

The `sva` function is a shorthand for creating a slot recipe with atomic variants. It takes the same arguments as `cva`
but returns a slot recipe instead.

### Defining the Recipe

```jsx filename="checkbox.recipe.ts"
import { sva } from '../styled-system/css'

const checkbox = sva({
  slots: ['root', 'control', 'label'],
  base: {
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      },
      md: {
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

### Using the recipe

The returned value from `sva` is a function that can be used to apply the recipe for each component part. Here's an
example of how to use the `checkbox` recipe:

```jsx filename="Checkbox.tsx"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { checkbox } from './checkbox.recipe'

const Checkbox = () => {
  const classes = checkbox({ size: 'sm' })
  return (
    <label className={classes.root}>
      <input type="checkbox" className={css({ srOnly: true })} />
      <div className={classes.control} />
      <span className={classes.label}>Checkbox Label</span>
    </label>
  )
}
```

When a slot recipe is created, Panda will pre-generate the css of all the possible combinations of variants and compound
variants as atomic classes.

```css
@layer utilities {
  .border_width_1px {
    border-width: 1px;
  }

  .rounded_sm {
    border-radius: var(--radii-sm);
  }

  .margin_start_2 {
    margin-inline-start: var(--spacing-2);
  }

  .w_8 {
    width: var(--sizing-8);
  }

  .h_8 {
    height: var(--sizing-8);
  }

  .font_size_sm {
    font-size: var(--fontSizes-sm);
  }

  .w_10 {
    width: var(--sizing-10);
  }

  .h_10 {
    height: var(--sizing-10);
  }

  .font_size_md {
    font-size: var(--fontSizes-md);
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

### Compound Variants

Compound variants are a way to apply style overrides to a slot based on the combination of variants.

Let's say you want to apply a different border color to the checkbox control based on its `size` and the `isChecked`
variant, here's how to do it:

```jsx filename="checkbox.recipe.ts" {14-22}
import { sva } from '../styled-system/css'
const checkbox = sva({
  slots: ['root', 'control', 'label'],
  base: {...},
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {...},
      md: {...}
    },
    isChecked: {
      true: { control: {}, label: {} }
    }
  },
  compoundVariants: [
    {
      size: 'sm',
      isChecked: true,
      css: {
        control: { borderColor: 'green.500' }
      }
    }
  ],
  defaultVariants: {...}
})
```

### Targeting slots

You can set an optional `className` property in the `sva` config which can be used to target slots in the DOM.

> Each slot will contain a `${className}__${slotName}` class in addition to the atomic styles.

Let's say you want to apply a different border color to the button text directly from the `root` slot. Here's how you
would do it:

```tsx
import { sva } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = sva({
  className: 'btn',
  slots: ['root', 'text'],
  base: {
    root: {
      bg: 'blue.500',
      _hover: {
        // v--- 🎯 this will target the `text` slot
        '& .btn__text': {
          color: 'white'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> Note: This doesn't work when you have the `hash: true` option in your panda config. We recommend using `data-x`
> selectors to target slots.

### TypeScript Guide

Panda provides a `RecipeVariantProps` type utility that can be used to infer the variant properties of a slot recipe.

This is useful when you want to use the recipe in JSX and want to get type safety for the variants.

```tsx
import { sva, type RecipeVariantProps } from '../styled-system/css'

const checkbox = sva({...})

export type CheckboxVariants = RecipeVariantProps<typeof checkbox>
//  => { size?: 'sm' | 'md', isChecked?: boolean }
```

### Usage in JSX

Unlike the atomic recipe or `cva`, slot recipes are not meant to be used directly in the `styled` factory since it
returns an object of classes instead of a single class.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { checkbox, type CheckboxVariants } from './checkbox.recipe'

// ❌ Won't work
const Checkbox = styled('label', checkbox)

// ✅ Works
const Checkbox = (props: CheckboxVariants) => {
  const classes = checkbox(props)
  return (
    <label className={classes.root}>
      <input type="checkbox" className={css({ srOnly: true })} />
      <div className={classes.control} />
      <span className={classes.label}>Checkbox Label</span>
    </label>
  )
}
```

### Styling JSX Compound Components

Compound components are a great way to create reusable components for better composition. Slot recipes play nicely with
this pattern and requires a context provider for the component.

> **Note:** This is an advanced topic and you don't need to understand it to use slot recipes. If you use React, be
> aware that context require adding 'use client' to the top of the file.

Let's say you want to design a Checkbox component that can be used like this:

```jsx
<Checkbox size="sm|md" isChecked>
  <Checkbox.Control />
  <Checkbox.Label>Checkbox Label</Checkbox.Label>
</Checkbox>
```

First, create a shared context for ths styles

```jsx filename="style-context.tsx"
'use client'
import { createContext, forwardRef, useContext } from 'react'

export const createStyleContext = recipe => {
  const StyleContext = createContext(null)

  const withProvider = (Component, part) => {
    const Comp = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
      const [variantProps, rest] = recipe.splitVariantProps(props)
      const styles = recipe(variantProps)
      return (
        <StyleContext.Provider value={styles}>
          <Component ref={ref} className={styles?.[part ?? '']} {...rest} />
        </StyleContext.Provider>
      )
    })
    Comp.displayName = Component.displayName || Component.name
    return Comp
  }

  const withContext = (Component, part) => {
    if (!part) return Component

    const Comp = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
      const styles = useContext(StyleContext)
      return <Component ref={ref} className={styles?.[part ?? '']} {...props} />
    })
    Comp.displayName = Component.displayName || Component.name
    return Comp
  }

  return { withProvider, withContext }
}
```

> Note: For the TypeScript version of this file, refer to
> [create-style-context.tsx](https://github.com/cschroeter/park-ui/blob/main/website/src/lib/create-style-context.tsx)
> in Park UI

Then, use the context to create compound components connected to the recipe

```jsx filename="Checkbox.tsx"
import { createStyleContext } from './style-context'
import { checkbox } from './checkbox.recipe'

const { withProvider, withContext } = createStyleContext(checkbox)

//                                  👇🏻 points to the root slot
const Root = withProvider('label', 'root')
//                                    👇🏻 points to the control slot
const Control = withContext('div', 'control')
//                                  👇🏻 points to the label slot
const Label = withContext('span', 'label')

const Checkbox = { Root, Control, Label }
```

## Config Slot Recipe

Config slot recipes are very similar atomic recipes except that they use well-defined classNames and store the styles in
the `recipes` cascade layer.

The config slot recipe takes the following additional properties:

- `className`: The name of the recipe. Used in the generated class name
- `jsx`: An array of JSX components that use the recipe. Defaults to the uppercase version of the recipe name
- `description`: An optional description of the recipe (used in the js-doc comments)

### Defining the recipe

To define a config slot recipe, import the `defineSlotRecipe` function

```jsx filename="checkbox.recipe.ts"
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const checkboxRecipe = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'checkbox',
  description: 'The styles for the Checkbox component',
  slots: ['root', 'control', 'label'],
  base: {
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      },
      md: {
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

### Adding recipe to config

To add the recipe to the config, you’d need to add it to the `slotRecipes` property of the `theme`

```jsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { checkboxRecipe } from './checkbox.recipe'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  jsxFramework: 'react',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      slotRecipes: {
        checkbox: checkboxRecipe
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Generate JS code

This generates a recipes folder the specified `outdir` which is `styled-system` by default. If Panda doesn’t
automatically generate your CSS file, you can run the `panda codegen` command.

You only need to import the recipes into the component files where you need to use them.

### Using the recipe

To use the recipe, you can import the recipe from the `<outdir>/recipes` entrypoint and use it in your component. Panda
tracks the usage of the recipe and only generates CSS of the variants used in your application.

```js
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { checkbox } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const Checkbox = () => {
  const classes = checkbox({ size: 'sm' })
  return (
    <label className={classes.root}>
      <input type="checkbox" className={css({ srOnly: true })} />
      <div className={classes.control} />
      <span className={classes.label}>Checkbox Label</span>
    </label>
  )
}
```

The generated css is registered under the `recipe` [cascade layer](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers.mdx) with the class
name that matches the recipe-slot-variant name pattern `<recipe-className>__<slot-name>--<variant-name>`.

```css
@layer recipes {
  @layer base {
    .checkbox__root {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      gap: var(--space-2);
    }

    .checkbox__control {
      border-width: var(--border-widths-1px);
      border-radius: var(--radii-sm);
    }

    .checkbox__label {
      margin-start: var(--space-2);
    }
  }

  .checkbox__control--size-sm {
    width: var(--space-8);
    height: var(--space-8);
  }

  .checkbox__label--size-sm {
    font-size: var(--font-sizes-sm);
  }

  .checkbox__control--size-md {
    width: var(--space-10);
    height: var(--space-10);
  }

  .checkbox__label--size-md {
    font-size: var(--font-sizes-md);
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Guide

Every slot recipe ships a type interface for its accepted variants. You can import them from the `styled-system/recipes`
entrypoint.

For the checkbox recipe, we can import the `CheckboxVariants` type like so:

```ts
import React from 'react'
import type { CheckboxVariants } from '../styled-system/recipes'

type CheckboxProps = CheckboxVariants & {
  children: React.ReactNode
  value?: string
  onChange?: (value: string) => void
}
```

### `defineParts`

It can be useful when you want to have the equivalent of a slot recipe without needing to split the class names bindings
and instead just having a className that handles children on 1 DOM element.

It pairs well with [ZagJs](https://zagjs.com/) and [Ark-UI](https://ark-ui.com/)

Let's refactor the previous example to use parts instead of slots:

```ts
import { defineParts, definetRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const parts = defineParts({
  root: { selector: '& [data-part="root"]' },
  control: { selector: '& [data-part="control"]' },
  label: { selector: '& [data-part="label"]' }
})

export const checkboxRecipe = defineRecipe({
  className: 'checkbox',
  description: 'A checkbox style',
  base: parts({
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  }),
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: parts({
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      }),
      md: parts({
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      })
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

## Style props

Build UIs quickly by passing css properties as "props" to your components.

While you can get very far by using the `className` prop and function from Panda, style props provide a more ergonomic
way of expressing styles.

Panda will extract the style props through static analysis and generate the CSS at build time.

> If you use Chakra UI, Styled System, or Theme UI, you'll feel right at home right away 😊

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

// The className approach
const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button
    className={css({
      bg: 'blue.500',
      color: 'white',
      py: '2',
      px: '4',
      rounded: 'md'
    })}
  >
    {children}
  </button>
)

// The style props approach
const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <styled.button bg="blue.500" color="white" py="2" px="4" rounded="md">
    {children}
  </styled.button>
)
```

## Configure JSX

Using JSX style props is turned off by default in Panda, but you can opt-in to this feature by using the `jsxFramework`
property in the panda config.

> ⚠️ Panda will not extract style props from JSX elements if you don't set the `jsxFramework` property. This is to avoid
> unnecessary work for projects that don't use JSX.

### Choose Framework

JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript code and is
supported by most popular frameworks. Panda supports JSX style props in React, Preact, Vue 3, Qwik and Solid.js.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  jsxFramework: 'react'
})
```

### Generate JSX runtime

Next, you need to run `panda codegen` to generate the JSX runtime for your framework.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  pnpm panda codegen --clean
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  npm panda codegen --clean
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  yarn panda codegen --clean
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```bash
  bun panda codegen --clean
  ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

That's it! You can now use JSX style props in your components.

## Using Style Props

### JSX Element

Style props are just CSS properties that you can pass to your components as props. With the JSX runtime, you can use
`styled.<element>` syntax to create supercharged JSX elements that support style props.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <styled.button bg="blue.500" color="white" py="2" px="4" rounded="md">
    {children}
  </styled.button>
)
```

### Property Renaming

<Callout type="warning">Due to the static nature of Panda, you can't rename properties at runtime.</Callout>

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { Circle, CircleProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'

type Props = {
  circleSize?: CircleProps['size']
}

const CustomCircle = (props: Props) => {
  const { circleSize = '3' } = props
  return (
    <Circle
      // ❌ Avoid: Panda can't know that you're mapping `circleSize` to `size`
      size={circleSize}
    />
  )
}

// ...

const App = () => {
  return (
    // In this case, you should keep the `size` naming
    <CustomCircle circleSize="4" />
  )
}
```

The same principles apply to all style props, recipe variants, and pattern props.

<Callout type="info">
  If you still need to rename properties at runtime, you can use `config.staticCss` as an escape-hatch to pre-generate
  the CSS anyway for the properties you need.
</Callout>

### Recipe

You can use recipe variants as JSX props to quickly change the styles of your components, as long as
[you're tracking those components in your recipe config](/docs/concepts/recipes#advanced-jsx-tracking).

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { button, type ButtonVariantProps } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const Button = (props: ButtonVariantProps) => <button className={button(props)}>Button</button>

const App = () => <Button variant="secondary">Button</Button>
```

## Factory Function

You can also use the `styled` function to create a styled component from any component or JSX intrinsic element (like
"a", "button").

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { Button } from 'component-library'

const StyledButton = styled(Button)

const App = () => (
  <StyledButton bg="blue.500" color="white" py="2" px="4" rounded="md">
    Button
  </StyledButton>
)
```

> You can configure the `styled` function name using the [`config.jsxFactory`](/docs/references/config#jsxfactory)
> option.

### Factory Recipe

You can define a recipe for your component using the `styled` function. This is useful when you want to create a
component that has a specific set of style props.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: {
    py: '2',
    px: '4',
    rounded: 'md'
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: {
        bg: 'blue.500',
        color: 'white'
      },
      secondary: {
        bg: 'gray.500',
        color: 'white'
      }
    }
  }
})

const App = () => (
  <Button variant="secondary" mt="10px">
    Button
  </Button>
)
```

### Factory Options

There's a few options you can pass to the `styled` function to customize the behavior of the generated component.

```ts
interface FactoryOptions<TProps extends Dict> {
  dataAttr?: boolean
  defaultProps?: TProps
  shouldForwardProp?(prop: string, variantKeys: string[]): boolean
}
```

#### `dataAttr`

Setting `dataAttr` to true will add a `data-recipe="{recipeName}"` attribute to the element with the recipe name. This
is useful for testing and debugging.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const Button = styled('button', button, { dataAttr: true })

const App = () => <Button variant="secondary">Button</Button>
// => <button data-recipe="button" class="btn btn--variant_purple">Button</button>
```

#### `defaultProps`

allows you to skip writing wrapper components just to set a few props. It also allows you to locall override the default
variants or base styles of a recipe.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const Button = styled('button', button, {
  defaultProps: {
    variant: 'secondary',
    px: '10px'
  }
})

const App = () => <Button>Button</Button>
// => <button class="btn btn--variant_secondary px_10px">Button</button>
```

#### `shouldForwardProp`

Used to customize which props are forwarded to the underlying element. By default, all props except recipe variants and
style props are forwarded.

For example, you could use it to integrate with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'
import { motion, isValidMotionProp } from 'framer-motion'

const StyledMotion = styled(
  motion.div,
  {},
  {
    shouldForwardProp: (prop, variantKeys) =>
      isValidMotionProp(prop) || (!variantKeys.includes(prop) && !isCssProperty(prop))
  }
)
```

### Unstyled prop

All styled components accept an `unstyled` prop that allows you to disable the recipe styles. This is useful when you
want to use a component's structure but apply completely custom styling.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { button } from '../styled-system/recipes'

const Button = styled('button', button)

const App = () => (
  <>
    {/* With recipe styles */}
    <Button>Styled Button</Button>

    {/* Without recipe styles, but inline styles still work */}
    <Button unstyled bg="red.500" color="white">
      Unstyled Button
    </Button>
  </>
)
```

### Reducing the allowed style props

You can reduce the allowed JSX properties on the factory using
[`config.jsxStyleProps`](/docs/references/config#jsxstyleprops):

- When set to 'all', all style props are allowed.
- When set to 'minimal', only the `css` prop is allowed.
- When set to 'none', no style props are allowed and therefore the `jsxFactory` will not be usable as a component:
  - `<styled.div />` and `styled("div")` aren't valid
  - but the recipe usage is still valid `styled("div", { base: { color: "red.300" }, variants: { ...} })`

> Removing style props (from `all` to either `minimal` or `none`) will reduce the size of the generated code due to not
> having to check which props are style props at runtime.

## JSX Patterns

Patterns are common layout patterns like `stack`, `grid`, `circle` that can be used to speed up your css. Think of them
as a way to avoid repetitive layout styles.

All the patterns provided by Panda are available as JSX components.

> Learn more about the [patterns](/docs/customization/patterns) we provide.

```jsx
import { Stack, Circle } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="4" align="flex-start">
    <button>Button</button>
    <Circle size="4" bg="red.300">
      4
    </Circle>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Making your own styled components

To make a custom JSX component that accepts style props, Use the `splitCssProps` function to split style props from
other component props.

> For this to work correctly, set the `jsxFramework` to the framework you're using in your panda config.

```tsx
import { splitCssProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import type { HTMLStyledProps } from '../styled-system/types'

export function Component(props: HTMLStyledProps<'div'>) {
  const [cssProps, restProps] = splitCssProps(props)
  const { css: cssProp, ...styleProps } = cssProps

  const className = css({ display: 'flex', height: '20', width: '20' }, styleProps, cssProp)

  return <div {...restProps} className={className} />
}

// Usage
function App() {
  return <Component w="2">Click me</Component>
}
```

## TypeScript

Panda provides type definitions for all the style props that are supported by the JSX runtime.

You can use these types to get type safety in your components.

### Style Object

Use the `JsxStyleProps` to get the types of the style object that is compatible with JSX elements.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import type { JsxStyleProps } from '../styled-system/types'

interface ButtonProps {
  color?: JsxStyleProps['color']
}

const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  return <styled.button {...props}>
}
```

### Style Props

Use the `HTMLStyledProps` type to get the types of an element in addition to the style props.

```tsx {2}
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import type { HTMLStyledProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'

type ButtonProps = HTMLStyledProps<'button'>

const Button = (props: ButtonProps) => {
  return <styled.button {...props}>
}
```

### Variant Props

Use the `StyledVariantProps` type to extract the variants from a styled component.

```tsx {2}
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import type { StyledVariantProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: { color: 'black' },
  variants: {
    state: {
      error: { color: 'red' },
      success: { color: 'green' }
    }
  }
})

type ButtonVariantProps = StyledVariantProps<typeof Button>
//   ^ { state?: 'error' | 'success' | undefined }
```

### Patterns

Every pattern provided by Panda has a corresponding type that you can use to get type safety in your components.

```tsx {2}
import { Stack } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import type { StackProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'
```

## Styled System

What is the styled-system folder and how does it work?

While Panda generates your CSS at **build-time** using static extraction, we still need a lightweight runtime to
transform the CSS-in-JS syntax (either [`object`](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#atomic-styles) or
[`template-literal`](/docs/concepts/template-literals)) to class names strings. This is where the `styled-system` folder
comes in.

When running the `panda` or `panda codegen` commands, the [`config.outdir`](/docs/references/config#outdir) will be used
as output path to generate the `styled-system` in.

This is the core of what the `styled-system` does:

```ts
css({ color: 'blue.300' }) // => "text_blue_300"
```

Since Panda doesn't rely on any bundler's (`vite`, `webpack`, etc) plugin, there is no code transformation happening to
convert the CSS-in-JS syntax to class names at compile-time. This is why we need a lightweight runtime to do that.

The same principles applies to `patterns`, `recipes` and even `jsx` components, as they all use the `css` function under
the hood.

If you look inside your `styled-system` folder, you should see the main entrypoints for the runtime:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="styled-system" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="css" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="jsx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="recipes" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="patterns" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tokens" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="types" />
    <FileTree.File name="styles.css" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Feel free to explore the files inside the `styled-system` folder to get a better understanding of how it works in
details!

> Note: The `styled-system` folder is not meant to be edited manually. It is generated by Panda and should be treated as
> a build artifact. This also means you don't need to commit it to your repository.

## How does it work?

When running the `panda` command or with the postcss plugin, here's what's happening under the hood:

1. **Load Panda context**:

- Find and evaluate app config, merge result with presets.
- Create panda context: prepare code generator from config, parse user's file as AST.

2. **Generating artifacts**:

- Write lightweight JS runtime and types to output directory

3. **Extracting used styles in app code**:

- Run parser on each user's file: identify and extract styles, compute CSS, write to styles.css.

That `2. Generating artifacts` step is where the `styled-system` folder is generated, using the resolved config that
contains all your tokens, patterns, recipes, utilities etc. We generate a tailored runtime for your app, so that it only
contains enough code (and types!) to support the styles you're using.

## Pre-rendering

If you use some way to pre-render your components to static HTML, for example using Astro or RSC, the `styled-system`
functions like `css` and others will be removed at build-time and replaced by the generated class names, so that you
don't have to ship the runtime to your users.

---


## Template Literals

Panda allows you to write styles using template literals.

Writing styles using template literals provides a similar experience to
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), except that Panda generates
atomic class names instead of a single unique class name.

> Emitting atomic class names allows Panda to generate smaller CSS bundles.

Panda provides two functions to write template literal styles: `css` and `styled`.

## Getting started

To use template literals, you need to set the `syntax` option in your `panda.config.ts` file to `templateLiteral`:

```ts
// panda.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  syntax: 'template-literal', // required
  jsxFramework: 'react' // required for JSX utilities, e.g. `styled`
})
```

Then run the codegen command to generate the functions:

```sh
panda codegen --clean
```

## The `css` function

This the basic way of writing template styles. It converts the template literal into a set of atomic class name which
you can pass to the `className` prop of an element.

```js
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const className = css`
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
`

function Heading() {
  return <h1 className={className}>This is a title</h1>
}

// => <h1 className='font-size_16px font-weight_bold'></h1>
```

Here's what the emitted atomic CSS looks like:

```css
.font-size_16px {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.font-weight_bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## The `styled` tag

The `styled` tag allows you to create a component with encapsulated styles. It's similar to the `styled-components` or
`emotion` library.

```js
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

// Create a styled component
const Heading = styled.h1`
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
`

function Demo() {
  // Use the styled component
  return <Heading>This is a title</Heading>
}

// => <h1 class='font-size_16px font-weight_bold'>This is a title</h1>
```

Here's what the emitted atomic CSS looks like:

```css
.font-size_16px {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.font-weight_bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Nested styles

You can nest selectors, pseudo-elements and pseudo-selectors.

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  color: black;

  &:hover {
    color: blue;
  }
`
```

Using css nesting syntax, pseudo-elements, pseudo-selectors and combinators are also supported:

```js
const Demo = styled.div`
  color: black;

  &::after {
    content: '🐼';
  }

  & + & {
    background: yellow;
  }

  &.bordered {
    border: 1px solid black;
  }

  .parent & {
    color: red;
  }
`
```

Nested media and container queries are also supported:

```js
const Demo = styled.div`
  color: black;

  @media (min-width: 200px) {
    color: blue;
  }

  @container (min-width: 200px) {
    color: red;
  }
`
```

## Hashing class names

In some cases, it might be useful to shorten the class names by hashing them. Set the `hash: true` option in your
`panda.config.ts` file to enable this. This will generate shorter class names but will make it harder to debug.

To achieve this, set the `hash` option in your `panda.config.ts` file to `true`:

```ts
// panda.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hash: true // optional
})
```

> Run the `codegen` command to regenerate the functions with hashing enabled.

When hashing is enabled, the class names will go from this:

```css
.font-size_16px {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.font-weight_bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

To a unique six character hash regardless of the length of the selector or the number of declarations:

```css
.adfg5r {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.bsdf35 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Using tokens

Use the `token()` function or `{}` syntax in your template literals to reference design tokens in your styles. Panda
will automatically generate the corresponding CSS variables.

```js
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const className = css`
  font-size: {fontSizes.md};
  font-weight: token(fontWeights.bold, 700);
`
```

## Caveats

The object literal syntax is the recommended way of writing styles. But, if you stick with the template literal syntax,
there are some caveats to be aware of:

- Patterns and recipes are not generated
- Dynamic interpolation or component targeting is not supported
- Lack of autocompletion for tokens within the template literal Our
  [Eslint plugin](https://github.com/chakra-ui/eslint-plugin-panda/blob/main/docs/rules/no-invalid-token-paths.md) can
  help you overcome this by detecting invalid tokens
- JSX Style props are not supported

---


## Virtual Color

Panda allows you to create a virtual color or color placeholder in your project.

The `colorPalette` property is how you create virtual colors.

```js
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const className = css({
  colorPalette: 'blue',
  bg: 'colorPalette.100',
  _hover: {
    bg: 'colorPalette.200'
  }
})
```

This will translate to the `blue.100` background color and `blue.200` background color on hover.

Virtual colors are useful when creating easily customizable components.

## Using with recipes

You can also use virtual colors with recipes.

```js
import { css, cva, cx } from '../styled-system/css'

const button = cva({
  base: {
    padding: 4
    // you can also specify a default colorPalette in the `base` recipe key
    // colorPalette: 'blue',
    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: { color: 'colorPalette.500' }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: { variant: 'primary' }
})
```

## Using with different color modes

You can also use virtual colors with different conditions, such as color modes.

```js
import { css, cva, cx } from '../styled-system/css'

const someButton = cva({
  base: { padding: 4 },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: {
        bg: { base: 'colorPalette.500', _dark: 'colorPalette.200' },
        color: { base: 'white', _dark: 'gray.900' }
      }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: { variant: 'primary' }
})

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="light">
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'blue' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'green' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'red' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
      </div>
      <div className="dark">
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'blue' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'green' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
        <button className={cx(css({ colorPalette: 'red' }), someButton())}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Semantic Virtual Colors

Semantic virtual colors gives you an ability to create a virtual color organized by category, variant and state.
Hierarchically organized virtual colors are useful when creating easily customizable components.

```js
const theme = {
  extend: {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        button: {
          dark: {
            value: 'navy'
          },
          light: {
            DEFAULT: {
              value: 'skyblue'
            },
            accent: {
              DEFAULT: {
                value: 'cyan'
              },
              secondary: {
                value: 'blue'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can now use the root `button` color palette and its values directly:

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <button
      className={css({
        colorPalette: 'button',
        color: 'colorPalette.light',
        backgroundColor: 'colorPalette.dark',
        _hover: {
          color: 'colorPalette.light.accent',
          background: 'colorPalette.light.accent.secondary'
        }
      })}
    >
      Root color palette
    </button>
  )
}
```

Or you can use any deeply nested property (e.g. `button.light.accent`) as a root color palette:

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <button
      className={css({
        colorPalette: 'button.light.accent',
        color: 'colorPalette.secondary'
      })}
    >
      Nested color palette leaf
    </button>
  )
}
```

> **Note**: Nested tokens require glob patterns in the `colorPalette` config (e.g., `'button.*'`) to generate proper CSS
> variables.

## Pregenerated Virtual Colors

Use the `staticCss` option in the config to pre-generate values for the `colorPalette` property.

This is useful when you want to use a color palette that can be changed at runtime (e.g. in Storybook knobs).

> Learn more about [static css generation](/docs/guides/static).

```tsx
export default defineConfig({
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        properties: { colorPalette: ['red', 'blue'] }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then in your code, you can design components that use the `colorPalette` property:

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function ButtonShowcase() {
  const [colorPalette, setColorPalette] = useState('red')
  return (
    <div>
      <select value={colorPalette} onChange={e => setColorPalette(e.currentTarget.value)}>
        <option value="red">Red</option>
        <option value="blue">Blue</option>
      </select>

      <button
        className={css({
          bg: 'colorPalette.50',
          color: 'colorPalette.500',
          colorPalette
        })}
      >
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Configuration

By default, color palette generation is enabled and includes all colors defined in your theme.

You can control which colors are used to generate color palettes by configuring the `colorPalette` property in your
theme.

### Disable Color Palette

To completely disable color palette generation, set `enabled` to `false`:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    colorPalette: {
      enabled: false
    }
  }
})
```

### Include Specific Colors

To generate color palettes for only specific colors, use the `include` option:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    colorPalette: {
      include: ['gray', 'blue', 'red']
    }
  }
})
```

This will only generate color palettes for `gray`, `blue`, and `red` colors, even if you have other colors defined in
your theme.

**Glob patterns** are supported for nested tokens:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
colorPalette: {
  include: ['gray.*', 'blue.*'] // Includes all nested tokens
}
```

### Exclude Specific Colors

To exclude certain colors from color palette generation, use the `exclude` option:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    colorPalette: {
      exclude: ['yellow', 'orange']
    }
  }
})
```

This will generate color palettes for all colors except `yellow` and `orange`.

### Combination of Options

You can combine the `enabled`, `include`, and `exclude` options as needed:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    colorPalette: {
      enabled: true,
      include: ['gray', 'blue', 'red', 'green'],
      exclude: ['red'] // This will override the include for 'red'
    }
  }
})
```

In this example, color palettes will be generated for `gray`, `blue`, and `green`, but not for `red` (since it's
excluded).

## Nested Semantic Tokens

If nested tokens show as raw paths (e.g., `colors.base.accent`) instead of CSS variables, use glob patterns:

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
semanticTokens: {
  colors: {
    button: {
      primary: {
        DEFAULT: { value: '{colors.blue.500}' },
        hover: { value: '{colors.blue.600}' }
      }
    }
  }
},
colorPalette: {
  include: ['button.*']  // Include all nested paths
}
```

Usage:

```tsx
className={css({
  colorPalette: 'button.primary',
  bg: 'colorPalette',
  _hover: { bg: 'colorPalette.hover' }
})}
```

## Writing Styles

Panda generates the utilities you need to style your components with confidence.

Using the object syntax is a fundamental approach to writing styles in Panda. It not only provides a type-safe style
authoring experience, but also improves readability and ensures a consistent experience with style overrides.

## Atomic Styles

When you write styles in Panda, it generates a modern atomic stylesheet that is automatically scoped to the
`@layer utilities` cascade layer.

The atomic stylesheets approach offers several advantages, such as improved code maintainability and reusability, as
well as a smaller overall CSS footprint.

Panda exposes a `css` function that can be used to author styles. It accepts a style object and returns a className
string.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
  borderRadius: '9999px',
  fontSize: '13px',
  padding: '10px 15px'
})

// Generated className:
// --> bg_gainsboro rounded_9999px fs_13px p_10px_15px

<div className={styles}>
  <p>Hello World</p>
</div>
```

The styles generated at build time end up like this:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .bg_gainsboro {
    background-color: gainsboro;
  }

  .rounded_9999px {
    border-radius: 9999px;
  }

  .fs_13px {
    font-size: 13px;
  }

  .p_10px_15px {
    padding: 10px 15px;
  }
}
```

### Shorthand Properties

Panda provides shorthands for common css properties to help improve the speed of development and reduce the visual
density of your style declarations.

Properties like `borderRadius`, `backgroundColor`, and `padding` can be swapped to their shorthand equivalent `rounded`,
`bg`, and `p`.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

// BEFORE - Good
const styles = css({
  backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
  borderRadius: '9999px',
  fontSize: '13px',
  padding: '10px 15px'
})

// AFTER - Better
const styles = css({
  bg: 'gainsboro',
  rounded: '9999px',
  fontSize: '13px',
  p: '10px 15px'
})
```

> Shorthands are documented alongside their respective properties in the [utilities](/docs/utilities/background)
> section.

### Type safety

Panda is built with TypeScript and provides type safety for all style properties and shorthands. Most of the style
properties are connected to either the native CSS properties or their respective token value defined as defined in the
`theme` object.

```ts
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

//                       ⤵ you'll get autocomplete for colors
const styles = css({ bg: '|' })
```

> You can also enable the `strictTokens: true` setting in the Panda configuration. This allows only token values and
> prevents the use of custom or raw CSS values.

- `config.strictTokens` will only affect properties that have config tokens, such as `color`, `bg`, `borderColor`, etc.
- `config.strictPropertyValues` will throw for properties that do not have config tokens, such as `display`, `content`,
  `willChange`, etc. when the value is not a predefined CSS value.

> In both cases, you can use the `[xxx]` escape-hatch syntax to use custom or raw CSS values without TypeScript errors.

#### strictTokens

With `config.strictTokens` enabled, you can only use token values in your styles. This prevents the use of custom or raw
CSS values.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

css({ bg: 'red' }) // ❌ Error: "red" is not a valid token value
css({ fontSize: '123px' }) // ❌ Error: "123px" is not a valid token value

css({ bg: 'red.400' }) // ✅ Valid
css({ fontSize: '[123px]' }) // ✅ Valid, since `[123px]` is using the escape-hatch syntax
css({ content: 'abc' }) // ✅ Valid, since `content` isn't bound to a config token
```

For one-off styles, you can always use the escape-hatch syntax `[xxx]` to use custom or raw CSS values without
TypeScript errors.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

css({ bg: '[red]' }) // ✅ Valid, since `[red]` is using the escape-hatch syntax
css({ fontSize: '[123px]' }) // ✅ Valid, since `[123px]` is using the escape-hatch syntax
```

#### strictPropertyValues

With `config.strictPropertyValues` enabled, you can only use valid CSS values for properties that do have a predefined
list of values in your styles. This prevents the use of custom or raw CSS values.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
css({ display: 'flex' }) // ✅ Valid
css({ display: 'block' }) // ✅ Valid

css({ display: 'abc' }) // ❌ will throw since 'abc' is not part of predefined values of 'display'
css({ pos: 'absolute123' }) // ❌ will throw since 'absolute123' is not part of predefined values of 'position'
css({ display: '[var(--btn-display)]' }) // ✅ Valid, since `[var(--btn-display)]` is using the escape-hatch syntax

css({ content: '""' }) // ✅ Valid, since `content` does not have a predefined list of values
css({ flex: '0 1' }) // ✅ Valid, since `flex` does not have a predefined list of values
```

The `config.strictPropertyValues` option will only be applied to this exhaustive list of properties:

```ts
type StrictableProps =
  | 'alignContent'
  | 'alignItems'
  | 'alignSelf'
  | 'all'
  | 'animationComposition'
  | 'animationDirection'
  | 'animationFillMode'
  | 'appearance'
  | 'backfaceVisibility'
  | 'backgroundAttachment'
  | 'backgroundClip'
  | 'borderCollapse'
  | 'border'
  | 'borderBlock'
  | 'borderBlockEnd'
  | 'borderBlockStart'
  | 'borderBottom'
  | 'borderInline'
  | 'borderInlineEnd'
  | 'borderInlineStart'
  | 'borderLeft'
  | 'borderRight'
  | 'borderTop'
  | 'borderBlockEndStyle'
  | 'borderBlockStartStyle'
  | 'borderBlockStyle'
  | 'borderBottomStyle'
  | 'borderInlineEndStyle'
  | 'borderInlineStartStyle'
  | 'borderInlineStyle'
  | 'borderLeftStyle'
  | 'borderRightStyle'
  | 'borderTopStyle'
  | 'boxDecorationBreak'
  | 'boxSizing'
  | 'breakAfter'
  | 'breakBefore'
  | 'breakInside'
  | 'captionSide'
  | 'clear'
  | 'columnFill'
  | 'columnRuleStyle'
  | 'contentVisibility'
  | 'direction'
  | 'display'
  | 'emptyCells'
  | 'flexDirection'
  | 'flexWrap'
  | 'float'
  | 'fontKerning'
  | 'forcedColorAdjust'
  | 'isolation'
  | 'lineBreak'
  | 'mixBlendMode'
  | 'objectFit'
  | 'outlineStyle'
  | 'overflow'
  | 'overflowX'
  | 'overflowY'
  | 'overflowBlock'
  | 'overflowInline'
  | 'overflowWrap'
  | 'pointerEvents'
  | 'position'
  | 'resize'
  | 'scrollBehavior'
  | 'touchAction'
  | 'transformBox'
  | 'transformStyle'
  | 'userSelect'
  | 'visibility'
  | 'wordBreak'
  | 'writingMode'
```

## Nested Styles

Panda provides different ways of nesting style declarations. You can use the native css nesting syntax, or the built-in
pseudo props like `_hover` and `_focus`. Pseudo props are covered more in-depth in the next section.

### Native CSS Nesting

Panda supports the native css nesting syntax. You can use the `&` selector to create nested styles.

> **Important:** It is required to use the "&" character when nesting styles.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    '&:hover': {
      bg: 'orange.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```

You can also target children and siblings using the `&` syntax.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    '& span': {
      color: 'pink.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```

We recommend not using descendant selectors as they can lead to specificity issues when managing style overrides.
Colocating styles directly on the element is the preferred way of writing styles in Panda.

### Using Pseudo Props

Panda provides a set of pseudo props that can be used to create nested styles. The pseudo props are prefixed with an
underscore `_` to avoid conflicts with the native pseudo selectors.

For example, to create a hover style, you can use the `_hover` pseudo prop.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    _hover: {
      bg: 'orange.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```

> See the [pseudo props](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles#reference) section for a list of all available pseudo props.

## Global styles

Global styles are useful for applying additional global resets or font faces. Use the `globalCss` property in the
`panda.config.ts` file to define global styles.

Global styles are inserted at the top of the stylesheet and are scoped to the `@layer base` cascade layer.

> For resets, global variables, theming patterns, and more examples, see [Global styles](/docs/concepts/global-styles).

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, defineGlobalStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const globalCss = defineGlobalStyles({
  'html, body': {
    color: 'gray.900',
    lineHeight: '1.5'
  }
})

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  globalCss
})
```

The styles generated at build time will look like this:

```css
@layer base {
  html,
  body {
    color: var(--colors-gray-900);
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
}
```

## Style Composition

### Merging styles

Passing multiple styles to the `css` function will deeply merge the styles, allowing you to override styles in a
predictable way.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const result = css({ mx: '3', paddingTop: '4' }, { mx: '10', pt: '6' })
//    ^? result = "mx_10 pt_6"
```

To design a component that supports style overrides, you can provide the `css` prop as a style object, and it'll be
merged correctly.

```tsx filename="src/components/Button.tsx"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export const Button = ({ css: cssProp = {}, children }) => {
  const className = css({ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', color: 'black' }, cssProp)
  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>
}
```

Then you can use the `Button` component like this:

```tsx filename="src/app/page.tsx"
import { Button } from './Button'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Button css={{ color: 'pink', _hover: { color: 'red' } }}>
      will result in `class="d_flex items_center text_pink hover:text_red"`
    </Button>
  )
}
```

---

You can use this approach as well with the `{cvaFn}.raw`, `{svaFn.raw}` and `{patternFn}.raw` functions, allowing style
objects to be merged as expected in any situation.

**Pattern Example:**

```tsx filename="src/components/Button.tsx"
import { hstack } from '../styled-system/patterns'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export const Button = ({ css: cssProp = {}, children }) => {
  // using the flex pattern
  const hstackProps = hstack.raw({
    border: '1px solid',
    _hover: { color: 'blue.400' }
  })

  // merging the styles
  const className = css(hstackProps, cssProp)

  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>
}
```

**CVA Example:**

```tsx filename="src/components/Button.tsx"
import { css, cva } from '../styled-system/css'

const buttonRecipe = cva({
  base: { display: 'flex', fontSize: 'lg' },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: { color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'blue.500' }
    }
  }
})

export const Button = ({ css: cssProp = {}, children }) => {
  const className = css(
    // using the button recipe
    buttonRecipe.raw({ variant: 'primary' }),

    // adding style overrides (internal)
    { _hover: { color: 'blue.400' } },

    // adding style overrides (external)
    cssProp
  )

  return <button className={className}>{children}</button>
}
```

**SVA Example:**

```tsx filename="src/components/Button.tsx"
import { css, sva } from '../styled-system/css'

const checkbox = sva({
  slots: ['root', 'control', 'label'],
  base: {
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      },
      md: {
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})

export const Checkbox = ({ rootProps, controlProps, labelProps }) => {
  // using the checkbox recipe
  const slotStyles = checkbox.raw({ size: 'md' })

  return (
    <label className={css(slotStyles.root, rootProps)}>
      <input type="checkbox" className={css({ srOnly: true })} />
      <div className={css(slotStyles.control, controlProps)} />
      <span className={css(slotStyles.label, labelProps)}>Checkbox Label</span>
    </label>
  )
}

// Usage

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Checkbox
      rootProps={css.raw({ gap: 4 })}
      controlProps={css.raw({ borderColor: 'yellow.400' })}
      labelProps={css.raw({ fontSize: 'lg' })}
    />
  )
}
```

### Classname concatenation

Panda provides a simple `cx` function to join classnames. It accepts a list of classnames and returns a string.

```jsx
import { css, cx } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  borderWidth: '1px',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  paddingX: '12px',
  paddingY: '24px'
})

const Card = ({ className, ...props }) => {
  const rootClassName = cx('group', styles, className)
  return <div className={rootClassName} {...props} />
}
```

### Hashing

When debugging or previewing DOM elements in the browser, the length of the generated atomic `className` can get quite
long, and a bit annoying. If you prefer to have terser classnames, use the `hash` option to enable className and css
variable name hashing.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hash: true
})
```

> You might need to generate a new code artifact by running `panda codegen --clean`

When you write a style like this:

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  _hover: {
    bg: 'red.50'
  }
})
```

The hash generated css will look like:

```css
.fPSBzf {
  display: flex;
}

.ksWBqx {
  flex-direction: row;
}

.btpEVp:is(:hover, [data-hover]) {
  background: var(--bINrJX);
}
```

> We recommend that you use this in production builds only, as it can make debugging a bit harder.

## Important styles

Applying important styles works just like CSS

```js
css({
  color: 'red !important'
})
```

You can also apply important using just the exclamation syntax `!`

```js
css({
  color: 'red!'
})
```

## TypeScript

Use the `SystemStyleObject` type if you want to type your styles.

```ts {2}
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import type { SystemStyleObject } from '../styled-system/types'

const styles: SystemStyleObject = {
  color: 'red'
}
```

## Property conflicts

When you combine shorthand and longhand properties, Panda will resolve the styles in a predictable way. The shorthand
property will take precedence over the longhand property.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  paddingTop: '20px'
  padding: "10px",
})
```

The styles generated at build time will look like this:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .p_10px {
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .pt_20px {
    padding-top: 20px;
  }
}
```

## Global vars

You can use the `globalVars` property to define global
[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) or custom CSS
[`@property`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property) definitions.

Panda will automatically generate the corresponding CSS variables and suggest them in your style objects.

> They will be generated in the [`cssVarRoot`](/docs/references/config#cssvarroot) near your tokens.

This can be especially useful when using a 3rd party library that provides custom CSS variables, like a popper library
that exposes a `--popper-reference-width`.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  globalVars: {
    '--popper-reference-width': '4px',
    // you can also generate a CSS @property
    '--button-color': {
      syntax: '<color>',
      inherits: false,
      initialValue: 'blue'
    }
  }
})
```

> Note: Keys defined in `globalVars` will be available as a value for _every_ utilities, as they're not bound to token
> categories.

```ts
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const className = css({
  '--button-color': 'colors.red.300',
  // ^^^^^^^^^^^^  will be suggested

  backgroundColor: 'var(--button-color)'
  //                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  will be suggested
})
```

# Theming


## Animation Styles

Define reusable animation css properties.

Animation styles focus solely on animations, allowing you to orchestrate animation properties.

## Defining Animation Styles

Animation styles are defined in the `animationStyles` property of the theme.

Here's an example of an animation style:

```js filename="animation-styles.ts"
import { defineAnimationStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const animationStyles = defineAnimationStyles({
  'slide-fade-in': {
    value: {
      transformOrigin: 'var(--transform-origin)',
      animationDuration: 'fast',
      '&[data-placement^=top]': {
        animationName: 'slide-from-top, fade-in'
      },
      '&[data-placement^=bottom]': {
        animationName: 'slide-from-bottom, fade-in'
      },
      '&[data-placement^=left]': {
        animationName: 'slide-from-left, fade-in'
      },
      '&[data-placement^=right]': {
        animationName: 'slide-from-right, fade-in'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> **Good to know:** The `value` property maps to style objects that will be applied to the element.

## Update the Config

To use the animation styles, we need to update the `config` object in the `panda.config.ts` file.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { animationStyles } from './animation-styles'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animationStyles
    }
  }
})
```

This should automatically update the generated theme with the specified `animationStyles`. If this doesn't happen, you
can run the `panda codegen` command.

## Using Animation Styles

Now we can use the `animationStyle` property in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className={css({ animationStyle: 'slide-fade-in' })}>
      This is an element with slide-fade-in animation style.
    </div>
  )
}
```

Take advantage of it in your conditions:

```ts
export const popoverSlotRecipe = defineSlotRecipe({
  slots: anatomy.keys(),
  base: {
    content: {
      _open: {
        animationStyle: 'scale-fade-in'
      },
      _closed: {
        animationStyle: 'scale-fade-out'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Nesting animation styles

Animation styles support nested structures with a special `DEFAULT` key. This allows you to create variants of an
animation style while having a default fallback.

When you define a `DEFAULT` key within a nested animation style, you can reference the parent key directly to use the
default value.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animationStyles: {
        fade: {
          DEFAULT: {
            value: {
              animationName: 'fade-in',
              animationDuration: '300ms',
              animationTimingFunction: 'ease-in-out'
            }
          },
          slow: {
            value: {
              animationName: 'fade-in',
              animationDuration: '600ms',
              animationTimingFunction: 'ease-in-out'
            }
          },
          fast: {
            value: {
              animationName: 'fade-in',
              animationDuration: '150ms',
              animationTimingFunction: 'ease-in-out'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now you can use the default fade animation or specific speed variants:

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className={css({ animationStyle: 'fade' })}>Default fade speed</div>
      <div className={css({ animationStyle: 'fade.slow' })}>Slow fade</div>
      <div className={css({ animationStyle: 'fade.fast' })}>Fast fade</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

### Avoid Overuse

To ensure the performance and readability of your design system, avoid overusing animations. Use them sparingly to
enhance user experience without overwhelming the user.

### Consistent Naming Conventions

We recommend using consistent naming conventions for animation styles. Here are common ideas on how to name animation
styles:

- Based on the type of animation (`slide`, `fade`, `bounce`)
- Based on the direction or trigger (`slide-from-top`, `fade-in`, `bounce-on-click`)
- Descriptive or functional names that explain the style's intended use (`modal-open`, `button-hover`, `alert-show`)

By following these guidelines, you can create a clear and maintainable animation system in your design.

## Layer Styles

Define reusable container styles properties.

Layer styles provide a way to create consistent and visually appealing elements.

- Color or text color
- Background color
- Border width and border color
- Box shadow
- Opacity

## Defining layer styles

Layer styles are defined in the `layerStyles` property of the theme.

Here's an example of a layer style:

```js filename="layer-styles.ts"
import { defineLayerStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const layerStyles = defineLayerStyles({
  container: {
    description: 'container styles',
    value: {
      background: 'gray.50',
      border: '2px solid',
      borderColor: 'gray.500'
    }
  }
})
```

> **Good to know:** The `value` property maps to style objects that will be applied to the element.

## Update the config

To use the layer styles, we need to update the `config` object in the `panda.config.ts` file.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { layerStyles } from './layer-styles'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      layerStyles
    }
  }
})
```

This should automatically update the generated theme the specified `layerStyles`. If this doesn't happen, you can run
the `panda codegen` command.

## Using layer styles

Now we can use `layerStyle` property in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return <div className={css({ layerStyle: 'container' })}>This is inside a container style</div>
}
```

## Nesting layer styles

Layer styles support nested structures with a special `DEFAULT` key. This allows you to create variants of a layer style
while having a default fallback.

When you define a `DEFAULT` key within a nested layer style, you can reference the parent key directly to use the
default value.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      layerStyles: {
        card: {
          DEFAULT: {
            value: {
              background: 'white',
              border: '1px solid',
              borderColor: 'gray.200',
              borderRadius: 'md',
              boxShadow: 'sm'
            }
          },
          elevated: {
            value: {
              background: 'white',
              border: 'none',
              borderRadius: 'lg',
              boxShadow: 'lg'
            }
          },
          outlined: {
            value: {
              background: 'transparent',
              border: '2px solid',
              borderColor: 'gray.300',
              borderRadius: 'md',
              boxShadow: 'none'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now you can use the default card style or specific variants:

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className={css({ layerStyle: 'card' })}>Default card style</div>
      <div className={css({ layerStyle: 'card.elevated' })}>Elevated card</div>
      <div className={css({ layerStyle: 'card.outlined' })}>Outlined card</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Spec

Document your design system in Panda.

A spec is a readable JSON representation of the theme structure in your panda config. They're designed to be used for
**documentation purposes** in your own docs websites and Storybook. Some common use cases:

- Document tokens in your theme (colors, spacing, fonts, etc.)
- Showcase the recipes and slot recipes (include their variants and default variants)
- Document the typography styles and layer styles

## Spec Command

To create the spec files, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm panda spec
```

Learn more about the spec CLI flags [here](/docs/references/cli#spec)

## Spec Output

The spec command generates a set of JSON files that represent your entire design system. Here's an example of the output
structure:

```sh
styled-system/
└── specs/                        # Generated documentation-ready spec files
    ├── animation-styles.json     # Animation style presets (empty if none defined)
    ├── color-palette.json        # List of palette names (blue, teal, etc.)
    ├── conditions.json           # Condition selectors (_hover, _focus, ...)
    ├── keyframes.json            # Keyframe definitions (spin, ping, ...)
    ├── layer-styles.json         # Layer style definitions (card, overlay, ...)
    ├── patterns.json             # Pattern definitions + their properties
    ├── recipes.json              # Component recipes + variants + defaults
    ├── semantic-tokens.json      # Semantic tokens with conditions (base, dark, etc.)
    ├── text-styles.json          # Text style definitions (xs, sm, md, ...)
    └── tokens.json               # Raw design tokens grouped by category
```

Below is a breakdown of what each file contains and how it can be used.

  return (
    <div className={grid({ padding: '40px', columns: 3, gap: '4' })}>
      {colors?.values.map(color => (
        <div key={color.name}>
          <p>{color.name}</p>
          <p>{color.value}</p>
          <div
            style={{

- `value` — the CSS selector or media query that the condition maps to
- Optional examples: `functionExamples` and `jsxExamples`

## FAQs

### Can I edit the spec files directly?

**No.** The spec files are **generated** files—you should **not** edit your design tokens, recipes, or theme directly in
these files. All configuration changes must be made in your `panda.config.ts` file. The spec files exist purely for
documentation and visualization purposes.

## Using Panda Studio

Document your design system visually using Panda Studio.

### Panda Studio

Panda Studio is a visual interface for exploring and understanding your entire design system. It provides a read-only
view of your tokens, semantic tokens, recipes, patterns, conditions, and more.

![Panda Studio UI](/panda-studio.png)

If you don't want to manually generate spec files or build a documentation website, Panda Studio is the easiest option.

- Studio does not require you to run pnpm panda spec.

- Studio generates and visualizes your design system automatically.

- Studio acts as a fully-featured documentation tool without writing any documentation code.

> Spec files are primarily for custom documentation setups and Storybook integrations. Panda Studio is for teams who
> want instant documentation.

## Panda Studio Setup

To use panda studio, first install it:

```bash
pnpm i @pandacss/studio
```

Next, launch it locally using:

```bash
pnpm panda studio
```

This starts a local server and launches an interactive dashboard showing all your design system elements. Since Studio
reads your theme configuration directly, any changes to your `panda.config.ts` will appear automatically the next time
you run it.

You can also deploy the studio as a standalone design system portal for your team.

## Text Styles

Define reusable typography css properties.

Text styles allows you to define textual css properties. The common properties are:

- The font family, weight, size
- Line height
- Letter spacing
- Text Decoration (strikethrough and underline)
- Text Transform (uppercase, lowercase, and capitalization)

## Defining text styles

Text styles are defined in the `textStyles` property of the theme.

Here's an example of a text style:

```js filename="text-styles.ts"
import { defineTextStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const textStyles = defineTextStyles({
  body: {
    description: 'The body text style - used in paragraphs',
    value: {
      fontFamily: 'Inter',
      fontWeight: '500',
      fontSize: '16px',
      lineHeight: '24px',
      letterSpacing: '0',
      textDecoration: 'None',
      textTransform: 'None'
    }
  }
})
```

> **Good to know:** The `value` property maps to style objects that will be applied to the text.

## Update the config

To use the text styles, we need to update the `config` object in the `panda.config.ts` file.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import { textStyles } from './text-styles'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      textStyles
    }
  }
})
```

This should automatically update the generated theme the specified `textStyles`. If this doesn't happen, you can run the
`panda codegen` command.

## Using text styles

Now we can use `textStyle` property in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return <p className={css({ textStyle: 'body' })}>This is a paragraph from Panda with the body text style.</p>
}
```

## Nesting text styles

Text styles support nested structures with a special `DEFAULT` key. This allows you to create variants of a text style
while having a default fallback.

When you define a `DEFAULT` key within a nested text style, you can reference the parent key directly to use the default
value.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      textStyles: {
        heading: {
          DEFAULT: {
            value: {
              fontFamily: 'Inter',
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              fontSize: '1.5rem',
              lineHeight: '1.2'
            }
          },
          h1: {
            value: {
              fontFamily: 'Inter',
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              fontSize: '2.5rem',
              lineHeight: '1.1'
            }
          },
          h2: {
            value: {
              fontFamily: 'Inter',
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              fontSize: '2rem',
              lineHeight: '1.15'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now you can use the default heading style or specific variants:

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className={css({ textStyle: 'heading.h1' })}>Main Title</h1>
      <h2 className={css({ textStyle: 'heading.h2' })}>Subtitle</h2>
      <h3 className={css({ textStyle: 'heading' })}>Uses DEFAULT variant</h3>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

### Avoid layout properties

To ensure the consistency of your design system, avoid applying layout properties (like margin, padding, etc.) or color
properties (background, colors, etc.) to the text styles.

### Naming conventions

We recommend using the same text style names used by designers on your team. Here are common ideas on how to name text
styles:

- Sized-based naming system (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)
- Semantic naming system that corresponds to respective html tags in production (`caption`, `paragraph`, `h1`, `h2`)
- Descriptive or functional naming system that explains the style's intended use (`alert`, `modal-header`,
  `button-label`)

## Tokens

Design tokens are the platform-agnostic way to manage design decisions in your application or website.

Design tokens provide a platform-agnostic way to manage design decisions through key-value pairs that describe
fundamental visual styles.

> Design tokens in Panda are largely influenced by the [W3C Token Format](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/).

A design token consists of the following properties:

- `value`: The value of the token. This can be any valid CSS value.
- `description`: An optional description of what the token can be used for.

## Core Tokens

Tokens are defined in the `panda.config` file under the `theme` key

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    // 👇🏻 Define your tokens here
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          primary: { value: '#0FEE0F' },
          secondary: { value: '#EE0F0F' }
        },
        fonts: {
          body: { value: 'system-ui, sans-serif' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> ⚠️ Token values need to be nested in an object with a `value` key. This is to allow for additional properties like
> `description` and more in the future.

After defining tokens, you can use them in authoring components and styles.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <p
      className={css({
        color: 'primary',
        fontFamily: 'body'
      })}
    >
      Hello World
    </p>
  )
}
```

You can also add an optional description to your tokens. This will be used in the autogenerate token documentation.

```js {8}
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        danger: {
          value: '#EE0F0F',
          description: 'Color for errors'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Semantic Tokens

Semantic tokens are tokens that are designed to be used in a specific context. In most cases, the value of a semantic
token references to an existing token.

> To reference a value in a semantic token, use the `{}` syntax.

For example, assuming we've defined the following tokens:

- `red` and `green` are raw tokens that define the color red and green.
- `danger` and `success` are semantic tokens that reference the `red` and `green` tokens.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        red: { value: '#EE0F0F' },
        green: { value: '#0FEE0F' }
      }
    },
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        danger: { value: '{colors.red}' },
        success: { value: '{colors.green}' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> ⚠️ Semantic Token values need to be nested in an object with a `value` key. This is to allow for additional properties
> like `description` and more in the future.

Semantic tokens can also be changed based on the [conditions](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles) like light and dark
modes.

For example, if you want a color to change automatically based on light or dark mode.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        danger: {
          value: { base: '{colors.red}', _dark: '{colors.darkred}' }
        },
        success: {
          value: { base: '{colors.green}', _dark: '{colors.darkgreen}' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> NOTE 🚨: The conditions used in semantic tokens must be an at-rule or parent selector
> [condition](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles#reference).

## Token Nesting

Tokens can be nested to create a hierarchy of tokens. This is useful when you want to group tokens together.

> Tip: You can use the `DEFAULT` key to define the default value of a nested token.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        bg: {
          DEFAULT: { value: '{colors.gray.100}' },
          muted: { value: '{colors.gray.100}' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This allows the use of the `bg` token in the following ways:

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        // 👇🏻 This will use the `DEFAULT` value
        bg: 'bg',
        // 👇🏻 This will use the `muted` value
        color: 'bg.muted'
      })}
    >
      Hello World
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Token Types

Panda supports the following token types:

### Colors

Colors have meaning and support the purpose of the content, communicating things like hierarchy of information, and
states. It is mostly defined as a string value or reference to other tokens.

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      red: { 100: { value: '#fff1f0' } }
    }
  }
}
```

### Gradients

Gradient tokens represent a smooth transition between two or more colors. Its value can be defined as a string or a
composite value.

```ts
type Gradient =
  | string
  | {
      type: 'linear' | 'radial'
      placement: string | number
      stops:
        | Array<{
            color: string
            position: number
          }>
        | Array<string>
    }
```

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    gradients: {
      // string value
      simple: { value: 'linear-gradient(to right, red, blue)' },
      // composite value
      primary: {
        value: {
          type: 'linear',
          placement: 'to right',
          stops: ['red', 'blue']
        }
      }
    }
  }

Easing tokens represent the easing function of an animation or transition. Its value is defined as a string or an array
of values representing the cubic bezier.

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    easings: {
      // string value
      easeIn: { value: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)' },
      // array value
      easeOut: { value: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] }
    }
  }
}
```

> Ease tokens are typically used in `transition-timing-function` property.

### Opacity

Opacity tokens help you set the opacity of an element.

```js
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    opacity: {
      50: { value: 0.5 }
    }
  }
}
```

> Opacity tokens are typically used in `opacity` property.

### Z-Index

This token type represents the depth of an element's position on the z-axis.

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    zIndex: {
      modal: { value: 1000 }
    }
  }
}
```

> Z-index tokens are typically used in `z-index` property.

### Assets

Asset tokens represent a url or svg string. Its value is defined as a string or a composite value.

```ts
type CompositeAsset = { type: 'url' | 'svg'; value: string }
type Asset = string | CompositeAsset
```

```js
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    assets: {
      logo: {
        value: { type: 'url', value: '/static/logo.png' }
      },
      checkmark: {
        value: { type: 'svg', value: '<svg>...</svg>' }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Asset tokens are typically used in `background-image` property.

### Durations

Duration tokens represent the length of time in milliseconds an animation or animation cycle takes to complete. Its
value is defined as a string.

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    durations: {
      fast: { value: '100ms' }
    }
  }
}
```

> Duration tokens are typically used in `transition-duration` and `animation-duration` properties.

### Animations

Animation tokens represent a keyframe animation. Its value is defined as a string value.

```jsx
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    animations: {
      spin: {
        value: 'spin 1s linear infinite'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Animation tokens are typically used in `animation` property.

### Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratio tokens represent the aspect ratio of an element. Its value is defined as a string.

```js
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    aspectRatios: {
      '1:1': { value: '1 / 1' },
      '16:9': { value: '16 / 9' }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Cursor tokens define the style of the mouse pointer when it hovers over a specific element or area. These tokens
represent the visual behavior of interactions, indicating actions such as clickable areas, draggable elements, or
loading states. Their value is defined as a string.

```js
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    cursor: {
      click: { value: 'pointer' },
      disabled: { value: 'not-allowed' },
      // custom value
      custom: { value: 'url(cursor.svg), auto' }
    }
  }
}
```

## Token Helpers

To help defining tokens in a type-safe way, you can use the tokens
[Config Functions](/docs/customization/config-functions#token-creators).

## CSS variables

The generated CSS variables will be scoped using the `cssVarRoot` selector defined in the config.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  cssVarRoot: ':where(:root, :host)'
  // ...
})
```

This will generate a CSS file similar to the following:

```css
:where(:root, :host) {
  --colors-primary: #0fee0f;
  --colors-secondary: #ee0f0f;
  /* ... */
}
```

You can also define type-safe CSS variables using [globalVars](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#property-conflicts).

## Using Tokens

There are various ways to consume Panda tokens depending on your need at that point in time.

Learn the various ways to consume Panda tokens in your project.

## Style Properties

The recommended way to consume your tokens is in the `css` function or style props.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => (
  <div
    className={css({
      color: 'green.400',
      background: 'gray.200'
    })}
  />
)
```

## Composite values

Some CSS properties like `border`, `box-shadow` allow you to specify multiple properties in its value. Panda allows you
to reference tokens in these composite values by using either the `token()` string function (similar to the JS
equivalent) or the token reference syntax `{path.to.token}` (similar to the semantic tokens equivalent).

The `token()` function is useful when you need to provide a fallback value. The token reference syntax is useful when
you don't need a fallback value or prefer using a more concise syntax.

<Tabs items={['token', 'reference syntax']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```js
    import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    const className = css({ border: '1px solid token(colors.red.400)' })
    ```

    You can also provide a fallback value.

    ```js
    import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    const className = css({ border: '1px solid token(colors.red.400, red)' })
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```js
    import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    const className = css({ border: '1px solid {colors.red.400}' })
    ```

  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

You can also use it in media queries or any other CSS at-rule.

<Tabs items={['token', 'reference syntax']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```js
    import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    const className = css({
      '@media screen and (min-width: token(sizes.4xl))': {
        color: 'green.400'
      }
    })
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```js
    import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

    const className = css({
      '@media screen and (min-width: {sizes.4xl})': {
        color: 'green.400'
      }
    })
    ```

  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

## Vanilla JS

Use the generated `token` function to query design tokens in your project. This is useful if you need direct access to
your design tokens in the `style` attribute or when using CSS-in-JS libraries like `styled-components` or
`@emotion/styled`

> This approach is useful for incrementally adopting Panda in existing projects or
> [dynamic styling](/docs/guides/dynamic-styling#using-token)

### Style Attribute

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import { token } from '../styled-system/tokens'

function App() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        background: token('colors.blue.200')
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

Each of your design tokens will be available in the generated `/tokens` folder. It looks like this:

```js filename="styled-system/tokens.ts"
const tokens = {
  // ...
  'colors.blue.200': {
    value: '#bfdbfe',
    variable: 'var(--colors-blue-200)'
  }
  // ...
}
```

- The `token()` function returns the raw value of the token.
- The `token.var()` function returns the CSS custom property used to reference the token.

Both functions are typesafe and expect a known dot-separated token path, they also accept a fallback value as a second
argument.

Using the example above, `token('colors.blue.200')` would return `#bfdbfe` and `token.var('colors.blue.200')` would
return `var(--colors-blue-200)`.

### Styled Components

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${token('colors.blue.200')};
`
```

### Emotion

```tsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${token('colors.blue.200')};
`
```

Panda provides the following utilities or style properties for styling background colors, gradients, and images.

Use these utilities to style background colors, gradients, and images.

## Background Colors

```jsx
<div className={css({ bg: 'red.200' })} />
<div className={css({ bg: 'blue.200/30' })} /> // with alpha
```

| Prop                         | CSS Property       | Token Category |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `bg`, `background`           | `background`       | `colors`       |
| `bgColor`, `backgroundColor` | `background-color` | `colors`       |
| `bgGradient`                 | `background-image` | `gradients`    |

## Background Gradients

Properties to create a background gradient based on color stops.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bgGradient: 'to-r',
    gradientFrom: 'red.200',
    gradientTo: 'blue.200'
  })}
/>
```

Background and text gradients can be connected to design tokens. Here's how to define a gradient token in your theme.

```ts
const theme = {
  tokens: {
    gradients: {
      // string value
      simple: { value: 'linear-gradient(to right, red, blue)' },
      // composite value
      primary: {
        value: {
          type: 'linear',
          placement: 'to right',
          stops: ['red', 'blue']
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These tokens can be used in the `bgGradient` or `textGradient` properties.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bgGradient: "simple",
  })}
/>

<div
  className={css({
    bgGradient: "primary",
  })}
/>
```

| Prop           | CSS Property       | Token Category |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `bgGradient`   | `background-image` | `gradients`    |
| `textGradient` | `background-image` | `gradients`    |
| `gradientFrom` | `--gradient-from`  | `colors`       |
| `gradientTo`   | `--gradient-to`    | `colors`       |
| `gradientVia`  | `--gradient-via`   | `colors`       |

## Background Position

Properties for controlling the src and position of a background image.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bgImage: 'url(/images/bg.jpg)',
    bgPosition: 'center'
  })}

```

| Prop                                   | CSS Property        | Token Category |

| `bgPositionY`, `backgroundPositionY`   | `background-image`  | none           |
| `bgAttachment` ,`backgroundAttachment` | `background-size`   | none           |
| `bgClip`, `backgroundClip`             | `background-size`   | none           |
| `bgOrigin`, `backgroundOrigin`         | `background-size`   | none           |
| `bgImage`, `backgroundImage`           | `background-size`   | assets         |
| `bgRepeat`, `backgroundRepeat`         | `background-repeat` | none           |
| `bgBlendMode`, `backgroundBlendMode`   | `background-size`   | none           |

## Focus Ring

Style focus states with accessibility-first focus ring utilities.

Focus rings are essential for accessibility, helping users identify which element currently has keyboard focus. Panda
provides comprehensive focus ring utilities that work with both regular focus and focus-visible states.

## Focus Ring Variants

The `focusRing` utility applies focus styles using the `&:is(:focus, [data-focus])` selector and supports four variants:

```jsx
// Outside focus ring (default 2px offset)
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'outside' })}>
  Click me
</button>

// Inside focus ring (no offset, with border)
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'inside' })}>
  Click me
</button>

// Mixed focus ring (semi-transparent with border)
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'mixed' })}>
  Click me
</button>

// No focus ring
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'none' })}>
  Click me
</button>
```

## Focus Visible Ring

The `focusVisibleRing` utility only applies focus styles during keyboard navigation using the
`&:is(:focus-visible, [data-focus-visible])` selector:

```jsx
<button className={css({ focusVisibleRing: 'outside' })}>Only shows focus ring on keyboard navigation</button>
```

### Focus Ring vs. Focus Visible Ring

The Focus Visible Ring functions similarly to the Focus Ring, but with a key difference: it only applies focus indicator
styles when an element receives keyboard focus.

This ensures that the focus ring is visible only when navigating via keyboard, improving accessibility without affecting
mouse interactions.

## Customization

You can customize focus ring appearance with additional utilities:

```jsx
<button
  className={css({
    focusRing: 'outside',
    focusRingColor: 'blue.500',
    focusRingWidth: '3px',
    focusRingStyle: 'dashed',
    focusRingOffset: '4px'
  })}
>
  Custom focus ring
</button>
```

| Prop               | CSS Property     | Token Category | Description              |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `focusRing`        | Multiple         | Enum           | Focus ring variant       |
| `focusVisibleRing` | Multiple         | Enum           | Keyboard-only focus ring |
| `focusRingColor`   | `outline-color`  | `colors`       | Focus ring color         |
| `focusRingWidth`   | `outline-width`  | `borderWidths` | Focus ring thickness     |
| `focusRingStyle`   | `outline-style`  | `borderStyles` | Focus ring style         |
| `focusRingOffset`  | `outline-offset` | `spacing`      | Distance from element    |

### Ring Color

To change the focus ring color for a specific component, use the `focusRingColor` prop:

```jsx
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'outside', focusRingColor: 'red.500' })}>Red focus ring</button>
```

## Global Ring Color

You can set a global focus ring color by defining the CSS custom property:

```ts
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  globalCss: {
    html: {
      '--global-color-focus-ring': '#3b82f6'
    }
  }
})
```

### Ring Width

To change the focus ring width for a specific component, use the `focusRingWidth` prop:

```jsx
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'outside', focusRingWidth: '4px' })}>Thick focus ring</button>
```

### Ring Style

To change the focus ring style for a specific component, use the `focusRingStyle` prop:

```jsx
<button className={css({ focusRing: 'outside', focusRingStyle: 'dashed' })}>Dashed focus ring</button>
```

This color will be used as the default for all focus rings unless overridden by the `focusRingColor` prop.

## Examples

### Basic Focus Ring

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={css({
        px: '4',
        py: '2',
        bg: 'blue.500',
        color: 'white',
        rounded: 'md',
        focusRing: 'outside'
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Keyboard-Only Focus Ring

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function Input({ ...props }) {
  return (
    <input
      className={css({
        px: '3',
        py: '2',
        borderWidth: '1px',
        borderColor: 'gray.300',
        rounded: 'md',
        focusVisibleRing: 'outside',
        focusRingColor: 'blue.500'
      })}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

### Custom Focus Ring

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function CustomButton({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={css({
        px: '6',
        py: '3',
        bg: 'purple.600',
        color: 'white',
        rounded: 'lg',
        focusRing: 'mixed',
        focusRingColor: 'purple.400',
        focusRingWidth: '3px',
        focusRingOffset: '3px'
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Examples

### Linear gradients

Use the `bgLinear` utility to create a linear gradient with a direction.

```tsx
css({ bgLinear: 'to-r', gradientFrom: 'cyan.500', gradientTo: 'blue.500' })
css({ bgLinear: 'to-t', gradientFrom: 'sky.500', gradientTo: 'indigo.500' })
css({
  bgLinear: 'to-bl',
  gradientFrom: 'violet.500',
  gradientTo: 'fuchsia.500'
})
css({ bgLinear: '65deg', gradientFrom: 'purple.500', gradientTo: 'pink.500' })
```

### Radial gradients

Build circular color transitions that radiate outward from a center point:

```tsx
css({
  bgRadial: 'in srgb',
  gradientFrom: 'pink.400',
  gradientFromPosition: '40%',
  gradientTo: 'fuchsia.700'
})
css({
  bgRadial: 'at 50% 75%',
  gradientFrom: 'sky.200',
  gradientVia: 'blue.400',
  gradientTo: 'indigo.900',
  gradientToPosition: '90%'
})
css({
  bgRadial: 'at 25% 25%',
  gradientFrom: 'white',
  gradientTo: 'zinc.900',
  gradientToPosition: '75%'
})
```

### Conic gradients

Create sweeping color transitions that rotate around a central point:

```jsx
css({
  boxSize: '24',
  rounded: 'full',
  bgConic: 'in srgb',
  gradientFrom: 'blue.600',
  gradientTo: 'sky.400',
  gradientToPosition: '50%'
})
css({
  boxSize: '24',
  rounded: 'full',
  bgConic: 'from 180deg',
  gradientFrom: 'blue.600',
  gradientVia: 'blue.50',
  gradientTo: 'blue.600'
})
css({
  boxSize: '24',
  rounded: 'full',
  bgConic: 'in oklch decreasing hue',
  gradientFrom: 'violet.700',
  gradientVia: 'lime.300',
  gradientTo: 'violet.700'
})
```

### Controlling color stops

Define which colors appear in your gradient using `gradientFrom`, `gradientVia`, and `gradientTo`:

```jsx
css({
  bgLinear: 'to-r',
  gradientFrom: 'indigo.500',
  gradientVia: 'purple.500',
  gradientTo: 'pink.500'
})
```

### Positioning color stops

Control exactly where each color appears along the gradient using position utilities:

```jsx
css({
  bgLinear: 'to-r',
  gradientFrom: 'indigo.500',
  gradientFromPosition: '10%',
  gradientVia: 'sky.500',
  gradientViaPosition: '30%',
  gradientTo: 'emerald.500',
  gradientToPosition: '90%'
})
```

### Text gradients

Apply colorful gradient effects to typography using `textGradient`:

```jsx
css({
  textGradient: 'to-r',
  gradientFrom: 'purple.400',
  gradientTo: 'pink.400',
  fontSize: '4xl',
  fontWeight: 'bold'
})
```

### Custom gradient values

Use bracket notation to create gradients with arbitrary values:

```jsx
css({
  bgLinear: '25deg',
  gradientFrom: 'red.50%',
  gradientVia: 'yellow.60%',
  gradientTo: 'lime.90%',
  gradientToPosition: 'teal.100%'
})
```

### Responsive gradients

Apply different gradient styles at different breakpoints using responsive objects:

```jsx
css({
  gradientFrom: { base: 'purple.400', md: 'yellow.500' }
})
```

# Customization


## Conditions

Learn how to customize conditions in your Panda config

Conditions allow you to apply different styles and behaviors based on specific conditions or states. They provide a way
to target specific elements or apply styles in response to certain events or conditions.

## Creating a condition

To create a condition, you can use the conditions property in the config. Let's say we want to create a `groupHover`
pseudo condition that applies styles to an element when a parent container with the `group` role is hovered.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  conditions: {
    extend: {
      groupHover: '[role=group]:where(:hover, [data-hover]) &'
    }
  }
})
```

> ⚠️ The `&` character is mandatory, it is a placeholder for the current selector. It will be replaced with the actual
> selector when the condition is used. It has to be used either at the beginning or at the end of the condition.

Then you can run the following command to generate the conditions JS code:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Now, we can use the `groupHover` condition in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div role="group">
      <span
        className={css({
          color: { base: 'blue.400', _groupHover: 'blue.600' }
        })}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Customizing Built-in Conditions

You can extend the [default conditions](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles#reference) by using the `conditions.extend`
property in the config.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  conditions: {
    extend: {
      // Extend the default `dark` condition
      dark: '.dark &, [data-theme="dark"] &'
    }
  }
})
```

Then you can run the following command to update the conditions JS code:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

## Using tokens

You can also use tokens in your conditions, and they will be resolved to their actual values:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  conditions: {
    extend: {
      mq: '@media (min-width: token(sizes.4xl))',
      size2: '&[data-size=token(spacing.2)]'
    }
  }
})
```

## Mixed conditions

You can also use mixed conditions (nested at-rules/selectors) under a single condition name:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  conditions: {
    extend: {
      supportHover: ['@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)', '&:hover']
    }
  }
})
```

```ts
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

css({
  _supportHover: {
    color: 'red'
  }
})
```

will generate the following CSS:

```css
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  &:hover {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

## Config Functions

Functions to expose types for your config.

Config functions help define and provide type information for your configuration. These utilities enhance code
readability, enforce consistency, and ensure robust type checking.

## Config Creators

To help defining config in a type-safe way, you can use the following helpers:

### `defineConfig`

Function for [config](/docs/references/config) definitions.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {},
  include: ['src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}']
})
```

### `defineRecipe`

Function for [recipe](/docs/concepts/recipes#config-recipe) definitions.

```ts
import { defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const buttonRecipe = defineRecipe({
  className: 'button',
  description: 'The styles for the Button component',
  base: {
    display: 'flex'
  },
  variants: {
    visual: {
      funky: { bg: 'red.200', color: 'white' },
      edgy: { border: '1px solid {colors.red.500}' }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    visual: 'funky',
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

### `defineSlotRecipe`

Function for [slot recipe](/docs/concepts/slot-recipes#config-slot-recipe) definitions.

```ts
import { defineSlotRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const checkboxRecipe = defineSlotRecipe({
  className: 'checkbox',
  description: 'The styles for the Checkbox component',
  slots: ['root', 'control', 'label'],
  base: {
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      },
      md: {
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      }
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

### `defineParts`

It can be useful when you want to have the equivalent of a slot recipe without needing to split the class names bindings
and instead just having a className that handles children on 1 DOM element.

It pairs well with [ZagJs](https://zagjs.com/) and [Ark-UI](https://ark-ui.com/)

Let's refactor the previous example to use parts instead of slots:

```ts
import { defineParts, definetRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const parts = defineParts({
  root: { selector: '& [data-part="root"]' },
  control: { selector: '& [data-part="control"]' },
  label: { selector: '& [data-part="label"]' }
})

export const checkboxRecipe = defineRecipe({
  className: 'checkbox',
  description: 'A checkbox style',
  base: parts({
    root: { display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '2' },
    control: { borderWidth: '1px', borderRadius: 'sm' },
    label: { marginStart: '2' }
  }),
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: parts({
        control: { width: '8', height: '8' },
        label: { fontSize: 'sm' }
      }),
      md: parts({
        control: { width: '10', height: '10' },
        label: { fontSize: 'md' }
      })
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'sm'
  }
})
```

### `definePattern`

Function for [pattern](/docs/customization/patterns) definitions.

```ts
import { definePattern } from '@pandacss/dev'

const visuallyHidden = definePattern({
  transform(props) {
    return {
      srOnly: true,
      ...props
    }
  }
})
```

### `definePreset`

Function for [preset](/docs/customization/presets#creating-a-preset) definitions.

```ts
import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const pandaPreset = definePreset({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: { value: 'blue.500' } }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### `definePlugin`

Function for [plugin](/docs/references/config#plugins) definitions.

```ts
import { definePlugin } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const plugin = definePlugin({
  name: 'token-format',
  hooks: {
    'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        formatTokenName: path => '$' + path.join('-')
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### `defineKeyframes`

Function for [keyframes](/docs/customization/theme#keyframes) definitions.

```ts
import { defineKeyframes } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const keyframes = defineKeyframes({
  fadeIn: {
    '0%': { opacity: '0' },
    '100%': { opacity: '1' }
  }
})
```

### `defineGlobalStyles`

Function for [global styles](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#global-styles) definitions.

```ts
import { defineGlobalStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const globalCss = defineGlobalStyles({
  'html, body': {
    color: 'gray.900',
    lineHeight: '1.5'
  }
})
```

### `defineUtility`

Function for [utility](/docs/customization/utilities) definitions.

```ts
import { defineUtility } from '@pandacss/dev'

  transform(value) {
    return { borderRadius: value }
  }
})
```

### `defineTextStyles`

Function for [text styles](/docs/theming/text-styles) definitions.

```ts
import { defineTextStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const textStyles = defineTextStyles({
  body: {
    description: 'The body text style - used in paragraphs',
    value: {
      fontFamily: 'Inter',
      fontWeight: '500',
      fontSize: '16px',
      lineHeight: '24',
      letterSpacing: '0',
      textDecoration: 'None',
      textTransform: 'None'
    }
  }
})
```

### `defineLayerStyles`

Function for [layer styles](/docs/theming/layer-styles) definitions.

```ts
import { defineLayerStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const layerStyles = defineLayerStyles({
  container: {
    description: 'container styles',
    value: {
      background: 'gray.50',
      border: '2px solid',
      borderColor: 'gray.500'
    }
  }
})
```

### `defineStyles`

Function for style definitions.

This comes in handy when you want to define reusable styles in the config.

E.g. a set of styles to be used in multiple variants within a [recipe](/docs/concepts/recipes#config-recipe).

```ts {3, 14, 18} filename="recipes/button.ts"
import { defineRecipe, defineStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const buttonVisualStyles = defineStyles({
  borderRadius: 'lg',
  boxShadow: 'sm'
})

export const buttonRecipe = defineRecipe({
  // ...
  variants: {
    visual: {
      funky: {
        bg: 'red.200',
        color: 'white',
        ...buttonVisualStyles
      },
      edgy: {
        border: '1px solid {colors.red.500}',
        ...buttonVisualStyles
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Token Creators

To help defining tokens in a type-safe way, you can use the following helpers:

### `defineTokens`

```ts
import { defineTokens } from '@pandacss/dev'

const theme = {
  tokens: defineTokens({
    colors: {
      primary: { value: '#ff0000' }
    }
  })
}
```

You can also use this function to define tokens in a separate file:

```ts filename="tokens/colors.ts"
import { defineTokens } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const colors = defineTokens.colors({
  primary: { value: '#ff0000' }
})
```

### `defineSemanticTokens`

```ts
import { defineSemanticTokens } from '@pandacss/dev'

const theme = {
  semanticTokens: defineSemanticTokens({
    colors: {
      primary: {
        value: { _light: '{colors.blue.400}', _dark: '{colors.blue.200}' }
      }
    }
  })
}
```

You can also use this function to define tokens in a separate file:

```ts filename="tokens/colors.semantic.ts"
import { defineSemanticTokens } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const colors = defineSemanticTokens.colors({
  primary: {
    value: { _light: '{colors.blue.400}', _dark: '{colors.blue.200}' }
  }
})
```

## Deprecations

Deprecating tokens, utilities, patterns and config recipes.

Deprecations are mostly relevant for large teams that want to deprecate certain utilities, patterns, recipes, or tokens
before removing them from the codebase.

## Deprecating a Utility

To deprecate a utility, set the `deprecated` property to `true` in the `utility` object.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    ta: {
      deprecated: true,
      transform(value) {
        return { textAlign: value }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Deprecating a Token

To deprecate a token, set the `deprecated` property to `true` in the `token` object.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      spacing: {
        lg: { value: '8px', deprecated: true }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Deprecating a Pattern

To deprecate a pattern, set the `deprecated` property to true in the `pattern` definition.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  patterns: {
    customStack: {
      deprecated: true
    }
  }
})
```

## Deprecating a Recipe

To deprecate a recipe, set the `deprecated` property to true in the `recipe` definition.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    recipes: {
      btn: {
        deprecated: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Custom Deprecation Messages

You can also provide a custom deprecation message by setting the `deprecated` property to a string. i.e. the migration
message.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        primary: { value: 'blue.500', deprecated: 'use `blue.600` instead' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    recipes: {
      btn: {
        deprecated: 'will be removed in v2.0'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

---


## Customizing Patterns

Panda provides the ability to customize the built-in patterns, as well as creating your own custom patterns. This is useful to create your own layout pattern abstractions that can be used in your application.

Panda allows you to customize built-in patterns and create custom patterns for reusable layout abstractions.

A pattern accepts the following parameters:

- `description` - The description of the pattern.
- `properties` - The list of properties that the pattern accepts.
- `defaultValues` - The default values for the properties. This is useful when you want to provide a default value for a
  property.
- `transform` - The function that accepts the properties and returns a css object.
- `jsx` - The name of the JSX component that will be generated (when `jsxFramework` is set). Defaults to the pascal-case
  version of the pattern name.
- `jsxElement` - The actual JSX element that will be rendered (when `jsxFramework` is set). Defaults to `div`.
- `blocklist` - The list of properties that are not allowed to be used in the pattern. Can be used to ensure strict
  typings when using the pattern.
- `strict` - Whether to only generate types for the specified properties. This will disallow css properties.

## Creating a Pattern

To create a pattern, you can use the `patterns` property in the config. Let's say we want to create a "Scrollable"
pattern that applies preset styles to a container that allows for scrolling.

```js
const config = {
  patterns: {
    extend: {
      scrollable: {
        description: 'A container that allows for scrolling',
        defaultValues: {
          direction: 'vertical',
          hideScrollbar: true
        },
        properties: {
          // The direction of the scroll
          direction: { type: 'enum', value: ['horizontal', 'vertical'] },
          // Whether to hide the scrollbar
          hideScrollbar: { type: 'boolean' }
        },
        // disallow the `overflow` property (in TypeScript)
        blocklist: ['overflow'],
        transform(props) {
          const { direction, hideScrollbar, ...rest } = props
          return {
            overflow: 'auto',
            height: direction === 'horizontal' ? '100%' : 'auto',
            width: direction === 'vertical' ? '100%' : 'auto',
            scrollbarWidth: hideScrollbar ? 'none' : 'auto',
            WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch',
            '&::-webkit-scrollbar': {
              display: hideScrollbar ? 'none' : 'auto'
            },
            ...rest
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can run the following command to generate the pattern JS code:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Now you can import the pattern and use it in your application:

```js
import { scrollable } from '../styled-system/patterns'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className={scrollable({ direction: 'vertical', hideScrollbar: true })}>
      <div>Scrollable content</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Customizing Built-in Patterns

You can extend the [default patterns](/docs/concepts/patterns#predefined-patterns) by using the `patterns.extend`
property in the config.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  patterns: {
    extend: {
      // Extend the default `flex` pattern
      flex: {
        properties: {
          // only allow row and column
          direction: { type: 'enum', value: ['row', 'column'] },
          jsx: ['Flex', 'CustomFlex'] // 👈 match the `CustomFlex` component to this pattern
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Then you can run the following command to update the pattern JS code:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda codegen
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

## Minimal setup

If you want to use Panda with the bare minimum, without any of the defaults, you can read more about it
[here](/docs/guides/minimal-setup)

---


## Presets

Creating your own reusable preset for utilities and theme

By default, any configuration you add in your own `panda.config.js` file is smartly merged with the
[default configuration](#), allowing you to override or extend specific parts of the configuration.

You can specify a preset in your `panda.config.js` file by using the `presets` option:

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: ['@acmecorp/panda-preset']
})
```

## Creating a preset

Presets are also valid Panda configuration objects, taking a similar shape to the configuration you would add in your
`panda.config.ts` file.

> **Note:** Every preset must have a unique name.

```js
// my-preset.js
import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default definePreset({
  name: 'my-preset',
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        rose: {
          50: { value: '#fff1f2' },
          // ...
          800: { value: '#9f2233' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

You can then use this preset in your `panda.config.ts` file:

```js
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import myPreset from './my-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [myPreset]
})
```

The available keys for a preset are:

- [`conditions`](/docs/concepts/conditional-styles)
- [`globalCss`](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#global-styles)
- [`globalFontface`](/docs/guides/fonts#global-font-face)
- [`patterns`](/docs/concepts/patterns)
- [`staticCss`](/docs/guides/static)
- [`theme`](/docs/customization/theme)
- [`utilities`](/docs/customization/utilities)

### Asynchronous presets

There are cases where you need to perform logic to determine the content of your preset, you'd call functions to do
this. In cases where they're asynchronous; panda allows promises, given that they resolve to a valid preset object.

```js
// my-preset.js
export default async function myPreset() {
  const roseColors = await getRoseColors()

  return definePreset({
    name: 'my-preset',
    theme: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          rose: roseColors
        }
      }
    }
  })
}
```

You can then use this preset in your `panda.config.ts` file:

```js
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import myPreset from './my-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [myPreset()]
})
```

## Which panda presets will be included ?

![Visual helper](/stately-presets-merging.png)

- `@pandacss/preset-base`: ALWAYS included if NOT using `eject: true`

- `@pandacss/preset-panda`: only included by default if you haven't specified the `presets` config option, otherwise
  you'll have to include that preset by yourself like so:

```ts
import pandaPreset from '@pandacss/preset-panda'
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  presets: [pandaPreset, myCustomPreset]
})
```

## Minimal setup

If you want to use Panda with the bare minimum, without any of the defaults, you can read more about it
[here](/docs/guides/minimal-setup)

---


## Theme

Customizing the default theme

Panda comes with a default theme that is used to generate the utilities for your project. You can customize this theme
to match your design requirements.

## Breakpoints

Use the `breakpoints` key in the `theme` section of your Panda config file to customize the default breakpoints.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      breakpoints: {
        '3xl': '1800px'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following breakpoints by default:

<TokenDocs type="breakpoints" />

## Tokens

### Colors

Use the `colors` key in the `token` section of your Panda config file to customize the default color values.

> We recommend using numeric ranges from `50` to `900`

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          brand: { value: '#EA8433' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda comes with a handful of colors picked from the amazing Tailwind color palette

<TokenDocs type="colors" />

### Spacing

Use the `spacing` key in the theme section of your Panda config file to customize the default spacing values.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        spacing: {
          gutter: { value: '32px' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following spacing tokens by default:

<TokenDocs type="spacing" />

### Border Radius

Use the `radii` key in the theme section of your Panda config file to customize the default border radius values.

<TokenDocs type="radii" />

### Shadows

Use the `shadows` key in the theme section of your Panda config file to customize the default box shadows values.

Panda ships with the following shadows by default:

<TokenDocs type="shadows" />

### Sizing

Use the `sizes` key in the theme section of your Panda config file to customize the default sizing values.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        sizes: {
          icon: { value: '24px' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following sizing tokens by default, in addition with the values from the default Panda
[spacing](#spacing) tokens:

<TokenDocs type="sizing" />

### Fonts

Use the `fonts` key in the theme object to customize the default font families.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        fonts: {
          marketing: { value: 'Inter Variable' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following font families tokens by default:

<TokenDocs type="fonts" />

### Font Sizes

Use the `fontSizes` key in the theme object to customize the default font sizes.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        fontSizes: {
          big: { value: '80px' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following font size tokens by default:

<TokenDocs type="fontSizes" />

## Keyframes

Use the `keyframes` key in the `theme` section of your Panda config file to customize the default keyframes.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        fadein: {
          '0%': { opacity: '0' },
          '100%': { opacity: '1' }
        },
        fadeout: {
          '0%': { opacity: '1' },
          '100%': { opacity: '0' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Panda ships with the following keyframes by default:

<TokenDocs type="keyframes" />

## Minimal setup

[here](/docs/guides/minimal-setup)

---


## Utilities

The utility API is a way to create your own CSS properties, map existing properties to a set of values or tokens.

The utility API enables you to create custom CSS properties and map existing properties to specific values or tokens.
It's like building your own type-safe version of Chakra UI, Tailwind (in JS), or Styled System.

Panda comes with a set of utilities out of the box. You can customize them, or add your own.

Here are the properties you need to define or customize a utility:

- `className` : The className the property maps to
- `shorthand`: The shorthand or alias version of the property
- `values`: The possible values the property can have. Could be a token category, or an enum of values, string, number,
  or boolean.
- `transform`: A function that converts the value to a valid css object

## Creating a custom utility

Let's say we want to create new property `br` that applies a border radius to an element.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      br: {
        className: 'rounded', // css({ br: "sm" }) => rounded-sm
        values: 'radii', // connect values to the radii tokens
        transform(value) {
          return { borderRadius: value }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Then you can run the following command to generate the pattern JS code:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm panda codegen
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npm panda codegen
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn panda codegen
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      bun panda codegen
      ```
    </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

Now, we can use the `br` property in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return <div className={css({ br: 'sm' })} />
}
```

or use in JSX style props

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

function App() {
  return <styled.div br="sm" />
}
```

### Using enum values

Let's say we want to create a new property `borderX` that applies a limited set of inline border to an element and
automatically applies the border color.

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      borderX: {
        values: ['1px', '2px', '4px'],
        shorthand: 'bx', // `bx` or `borderX` can be used
        transform(value, { token }) {
          return {
            borderInlineWidth: value,
            borderColor: token('colors.red.200') // read the css variable for red.200
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Now, we can use the `borderX` or `bx` property in our components.

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function App() {
  return <div className={css({ borderX: '2px' })} />
}
```

### Using mapped values

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      borderX: {
        values: { small: '2px', medium: '5px' },
        shorthand: 'bx',
        transform(value, { token }) {
          return {
            borderTopWidth: value,
            borderTopColor: token('colors.gray.400')
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Using boolean values

```ts filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      truncate: {
        className: 'truncate',
        values: { type: 'boolean' },
        transform(value) {
          if (!value) return {}
          return {
            overflow: 'hidden',
            textOverflow: 'ellipsis',
            whiteSpace: 'nowrap'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Using Panda in a Component Library

How to set up Panda in a component library

When creating a component library that uses Panda which can be used in a variety of different projects, you have four
options:

1. Ship a Panda [preset](/docs/customization/presets)
2. Ship a static CSS file
3. Use Panda as external package, and ship the src files
4. Use Panda as external package, and ship the build info file

> In the examples below, we use `tsup` as the build tool. You can use any other build tool.

## Recommendations

- If your library code shouldn't be published on npm and App code uses Panda, use
  [ship build info](#ship-the-build-info-file) approach
- If your app code doesn't use Panda, use the [static css](#ship-a-static-css-file) file approach
- If your app code lives in a monorepo, use the [include src files](#include-the-src-files) approach
- If your library code doesn't ship components but only ships tokens, patterns or recipes, use the
  [ship preset](#ship-a-panda-preset) approach

> ⚠️ If you use the `include src files` or `ship build info` approach, you might also need to ship a `preset` if your
> library code has any custom tokens, patterns or recipes.

## Ship a Panda Preset

This is the simplest approach. You can include the token, semantic tokens, text styles, etc. within a preset and consume
them in your projects.

**Library code**

```tsx filename="src/index.ts"
import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const acmePreset = definePreset({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: { value: 'blue.500' } }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Build the preset code

```bash
pnpm tsup src/index.ts
```

**App code**

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { acmePreset } from '@acme-org/panda-preset'
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  presets: ['@pandacss/dev/presets', acmePreset]
})
```

> Adding a preset will remove the default theme from Panda. To add it back, you need to include the
> `@pandacss/dev/presets` preset.

## Ship a Static CSS File

This approach involves extracting the static css of your library at build time. Then you can import the CSS file in your
app code.

**Library code**

```tsx filename="src/index.tsx"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Then you can build the library code and generate the static CSS file:

```bash
# build the library code
tsup src/index.tsx

# generate the static CSS file
panda cssgen --outfile dist/styles.css
```

Finally, don't forget to include the [cascade layers](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers) as well in your app code:

**App code**

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import { Button } from '@acme-org/design-system'
import './main.css'

export function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>
}
```

**main.css**

```css filename="src/main.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
@import url('@acme-org/design-system/dist/styles.css');

/* Your own styles here */
```

This approach comes with a few downsides:

- You can't customize the styles since the css is already generated
- You might need add the [prefix](/docs/references/config#prefix) option to avoid className conflicts

  ```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
  import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

  export default defineConfig({
    //...
    prefix: 'acme'
  })
  ```

- You might have duplicate CSS classes when using multiple atomic css libraries

## Use Panda as external package

### Summary

- create a Panda [preset](/docs/customization/presets) so that you (and your users) can share the same design system
  tokens
- create a workspace package for your outdir (`@acme-org/styled-system`) and use that package name as the `importMap` in
  your app code
- have your component library (`@acme-org/components`) use the `@acme-org/styled-system` package as external

---

Let's make a dedicated workspace package for your `outdir`:

1. Create a new directory `packages/styled-system` (or any other name)
2. Install `@pandacss/dev` as a dev dependency
3. Run the `panda init` command in there to generate a `panda.config.ts` file, don't forget to set the `jsxFramework` if
   needed
4. [optional] you might want to install and import your [preset](/docs/customization/presets) in this `panda.config.ts`
   file as well
5. Run the [`panda emit-pkg`](/docs/references/cli#emit-pkg) command to set the entrypoints in
   [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports)

This should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "name": "@acme-org/styled-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exports": {
    "./css": {
      "types": "./css/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./css/index.mjs",
      "import": "./css/index.mjs"
    },
    "./tokens": {
      "types": "./tokens/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./tokens/index.mjs",
      "import": "./tokens/index.mjs"
    },
    "./types": {
      "types": "./types/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./types/index.mjs",
      "import": "./types/index.mjs"
    },
    "./patterns": {
      "types": "./patterns/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./patterns/index.mjs",
      "import": "./patterns/index.mjs"
    },
    "./recipes": {
      "types": "./recipes/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./recipes/index.mjs",
      "import": "./recipes/index.mjs"
    },
    "./jsx": {
      "types": "./jsx/index.d.ts",
      "require": "./jsx/index.mjs",
      "import": "./jsx/index.mjs"
    },
    "./styles.css": "./styles.css"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@pandacss/dev": "^1.4.2",
    "@types/react": "19.2.2",
    "react": "^19.2.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": ">=19"
  }
}
```

> Notice that we've included the `react` and its corresponding `@types/react` in the `devDependencies` and
> `peerDependencies`. This is to ensure the types are correctly set up in the `styled-system` package.

Going forward, you'll now import the functions from the `@acme-org/styled-system` monorepo package.

```tsx
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

**App code**

Install the newly created `@acme-org/styled-system` package in your app code.

```bash
pnpm add @acme-org/styled-system
```

Configure the `importMap` in your `panda.config.ts` to match the `name` field of your outdir `package.json`. This will
inform Panda which imports belong to the `styled-system`.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  importMap: '@acme-org/styled-system',
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

Mark the `@acme-org/styled-system` as an external package in your library build tool. This ensures that the generated JS
runtime code is imported only once, avoiding duplication.

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --external @acme-org/styled-system
```

### Include the src files

Include the `src` directory from the library code in the panda config.

```tsx {6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  include: ['../@acme-org/design-system/src/**/*.tsx', './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  importMap: '@acme-org/styled-system',
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

### Ship the build info file

This approach is similar to the previous one, but instead of shipping the source code, you ship the Panda build info
file. This will have **the exact same end-result** as adding the sources files in the `include`, but it will allow you
not to ship the source code.

The build info file is a JSON file that **only** contains the information about the static extraction result, you still
need to ship your app build/dist by yourself. It can be used by Panda to generate CSS classes without the need for
parsing the source code.

Generate the build info file:

```bash
panda ship --outfile dist/panda.buildinfo.json
```

**App code**

Install the newly created `@acme-org/styled-system` package in your app code.

```bash
pnpm add @acme-org/styled-system
```

Configure the `importMap` in your `panda.config.ts` to match the `name` field of your outdir `package.json`. This will
inform Panda which imports belong to the `styled-system`.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  importMap: '@acme-org/styled-system',
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

Will allow imports like:

```tsx
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'
import { button } from '@acme-org/styled-system/recipes'
```

Next, you need to include the build info file from the library code in the panda config.

```tsx {6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  include: ['./node_modules/@acme-org/design-system/dist/panda.buildinfo.json', './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  importMap: '@acme-org/styled-system',
  outdir: 'styled-system'
})
```

## FAQ

### Why should my component library use an external package `styled-system`?

By de-coupling the component library from the `styled-system`, your users can share the same runtime code between your
library and their app code.

```tsx filename="component-lib/src/button.tsx"
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children, css: cssProp }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' }, cssProp)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/src/App.tsx"
import { Button } from '@acme-org/design-system'
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function App() {
  return <Button css={{ color: 'white' }}>Click me</Button>
}
```

Marking the `styled-system` as an external package in your build tool means that the generated JS runtime code (the
`css` function is the example above) is imported only once, avoiding duplication.

### How do I use the `@acme-org/styled-system` package ?

You can use your monorepo workspace package `@acme-org/styled-system` just like any other dependency in your app or
component library code.

```bash
pnpm add @acme-org/styled-system
```

Set the `importMap` in your `panda.config.ts` to that same package name. This will inform Panda which imports belong to
the `styled-system`.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  importMap: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

Then you can import the functions from the `@acme-org/styled-system` monorepo package.

```tsx
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### How to override tokens used by the `@acme-org/styled-system` package?

You can override the tokens used by the `@acme-org/styled-system` package by extending the `theme` in your
`panda.config.ts` file.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  presets: ['@acme-org/preset']
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: { value: 'blue.500' } }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Troubleshooting

- When using `tsup` or any other build tool for your component library, if you run into a module resolution error that
  looks similar to `ERROR: Could not resolve "../styled-system/xxx"`. Consider setting the `outExtension`in the panda
  config to`js`

- If you use Yarn PnP, you might need to set the `nodeLinker: node-modules` in the `.yarnrc.yml` file.

## Debugging

How can I debug my styles or profile the extraction process?

## panda debug

Panda's built-in debug command helps you see which files are processed, what styles are generated, and your final
config.

By default it will scan and output debug files for the entire project depending on your `include` and `exclude` options
from your config file.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda debug
    # You can also debug a specific file or folder
    # using the optional glob argument
    pnpm panda debug src/components/Button.tsx
    pnpm panda debug "./src/components/**"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx panda debug
    # # You can also debug a specific file or folder
    # using the optional glob argument
    npx panda debug src/components/Button.tsx
    npx panda debug "./src/components/**"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda debug
    # # You can also debug a specific file or folder
    # using the optional glob argument
    yarn panda debug src/components/Button.tsx
    yarn panda debug "./src/components/**"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda debug
    # # You can also debug a specific file or folder
    # using the optional glob argument
    bun panda debug src/components/Button.tsx
    bun panda debug "./src/components/**"
    ```
  </Tab>
  {/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
</Tabs>

This would generate a `debug` folder in your `config.outdir` folder with the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="styled-system" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="debug" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="config.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="src__components__Button.ast.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="src__components__Button.css" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The `config.json` file will contain the resolved config result, meaning the output after merging config presets in your
own specific options.

It can be useful to check if your config contains everything you expect for your app to be working, such as tokens or
recipes.

`*.ast.json` files will look like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "css",
    "type": "object",
    "data": [
      {
        "transitionProperty": "all",
        "opacity": "0.5",
        "border": "1px solid",
        "borderColor": "black",
        "color": "gray.600",
        "_hover": {
          "color": "gray.900"
        },
        "rounded": "md",
        "p": "1.5",
        "_dark": {
          "borderColor": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)",
          "color": "gray.400",
          "_hover": {
            "color": "gray.50"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "kind": "CallExpression",
    "line": 13,
    "column": 9
  }
]
```

And the `.css` file associated would just contain the styles generated from the extraction process on that file only.

## PANDA_DEBUG env variable

You can prefix any of the Panda CLI command with the `PANDA_DEBUG` environment variable to show debug logs.

```bash
PANDA_DEBUG=* pnpm panda
```

This can be useful to check if a specific file is being processed or not, or if a specific function/component has been
extracted.

```

```

## Performance profiling

If Panda is taking too long to process your files, you can use the `--cpu-prof` with the `panda`, `panda cssgen`,
`panda codegen` and `panda debug` commands to generate a flamegraph of the whole process, which will allow you (or us as
maintainers) to see which part of the process is taking the most time.

This will generate a `panda-{command}-{timestamp}.cpuprofile` file in the current working directory, which can be opened
in tools like [Speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/)

```bash
pnpm panda --cpu-prof
```

## FAQ

### Why are my styles not applied?

Check that the [`@layer` rules](/docs/concepts/cascade-layers#layer-css) are set and the corresponding `.css` file is
included. [If you're not using `postcss`](/docs/installation/cli), ensure that `styled-system/styles.css` is imported
and that the `panda` command has been run (or is running with `--watch`).

### Some CSS is missing when using absolute imports

This can happen when `tsconfig` (with `paths` or `baseUrl`) or with package.json
[`#imports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports). Panda tries to automatically infer and read the
custom paths defined in `tsconfig.json` file. However, there might be scenarios that won't work.

To fix this add the `importMap` option to your `panda.config.js` file, setting it's value to match the way you import
the `outdir` modules.

```app.tsx
// app.tsx

import { css } from "~/styled-system/css"
// tsconfig.json paths
// -> importMap: "~/styled-system"

import { css } from "styled-system/css"
// tsconfig.json baseUrl
// -> importMap: "styled-system"

import { css } from "@my-monorepo/ui-kit/css"
// monorepo workspace package
// -> importMap: "@my-monorepo/ui-kit"

import { css } from "#styled-system/css"
// package.json#imports
// -> importMap: "#styled-system

```

```js
// panda.config.js

export default defineConfig({
  importMap: '~/styled-system'
})
```

This will ensure that the paths are resolved correctly, and HMR works as expected.

### How can I debug the styles?

You can use the `panda debug` to debug design token extraction & css generated from files.

If the issue persists, you can try looking for it in the [issues](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/issues) or in the
[discord](https://discord.gg/VQrkpsgSx7). If you can't find it, please create a minimal reproduction and submit
[a new github issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/issues/new/choose) so we can help you.

### Why is my IDE not showing `styled-system` imports?

If you're not getting import autocomplete in your IDE, you may need to include the `styled-system` directory in your
tsconfig.json file.

### HMR does not work when I use `tsconfig` paths?

Panda tries to automatically infer and read the custom paths defined in `tsconfig.json` file. However, there might be
scenarios where the hot module replacement doesn't work.

To fix this add the `importMap` option to your `panda.config.js` file, setting it's value to the specified `paths` in
your `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
// tsconfig.json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@my-path/*": ["./styled-system/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// panda.config.js

module.exports = {
  importMap: '@my-path'
}
```

This will ensure that the paths are resolved correctly, and HMR works as expected.

## The postcss plugin sometimes seems slow or runs too frequently

This is mostly specific to the host bundler (`vite`, `webpack` etc) you're using, it is up to them to decide when to run
the postcss plugin again, and sometimes it can be more than needed for your usage. We do our best to cache the results
of the postcss plugin by checking if the filesystem or your config have actually changed, but sometimes it might not be
enough.

In those rare cases, you might want to swap to using the [CLI](/docs/installation/cli) instead, as it will always be
more performant than the postcss alternative since we directly watch for filesystem changes and only run the
extract/codegen steps when needed.

If you want to keep the convenience of having just one command to run, you can use something like `concurrently` for
that:

```json file="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"next dev\" \"panda --watch\""
  }
}
```

## Dynamic styling

How to manage dynamic styling in Panda

While Panda is mainly focused on the statically analyzable styles, you might need to handle dynamic styles in your
project.

> We recommend that you **avoid relying on runtime values for your styles** . Consider using recipes, css variables or
> `data-*` attributes instead.

Here are some ways you can handle dynamic styles in Panda:

## Runtime values

Using a value that is not statically analyzable at build-time will not work in Panda due to the inability to determine
the style values.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red.300')

  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        // ❌ Avoid: Panda can't determine the value of color at build-time
        color
      })}
    />
  )
}
```

The example above will not work because Panda can't determine the value of `color` at build-time. Here are some ways to
fix this:

### Using Static CSS

Panda supports a [`staticCss`](/docs/guides/static) option in the config you can use to pre-generate some styles ahead
of time.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        properties: {
          // ✅ Good: Pre-generate the styles for the color
          color: ['red.300']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

```tsx filename="Button.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

export const Button = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red.300')

  // ✅ Good: This will work because `red.300` is pre-generated using `staticCss` config
  return <styled.button color={color} />
}
```

### Using `token()`

The `token()` function is generated by Panda and contains an object of all tokens by dot-path, allowing you to query for
token's raw value at runtime.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { token } from '../styled-system/tokens'

const Component = props => {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        // ✅ Good: Store the value in a CSS custom property
        color: 'var(--color)'
      })}
      style={{
        // ✅ Good: Handle the runtime value in the style attribute
        '--color': token(`colors.${props.color}`)
      }}
    >
      Dynamic color with runtime value
    </div>
  )
}

// App.tsx
const App = () => {
  const [runtimeColor, setRuntimeColor] = useState('pink.300')

  return <Component color={runtimeColor} />
}
```

### Using `token.var()`

You could also directly use the `token.var()` function to get a reference to the underlying CSS custom property for a
given token:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { token } from '../styled-system/tokens'

const Component = props => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        // ✅ Good: Dynamically generate CSS custom property from the token
        color: token.var(`colors.${props.color}`)
      }}
    >
      Dynamic color with runtime value
    </div>
  )
}

const App = () => {
  const [runtimeColor, setRuntimeColor] = useState('yellow.300')

  return <Component color={runtimeColor} />
}
```

## JSX Style Props

Panda supports forwarding JSX style properties to any element in your codebase.

For example, let's say we create a Card component that accepts a `color` prop:

```tsx filename="Card.tsx"
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Card = props => {
  return <styled.div px="4" py="3" {...props} />
}
```

Then you add more style props to the Card component in a different file:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Card color="blue.300">
      <p>Some content</p>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

As long as all prop-value pairs are statically extractable, Panda will automatically generate the CSS, so avoid using
runtime values:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('blue.300')

  // ❌ Avoid: Panda can't determine the value of color at build-time
  return (
    <Card color={color}>
      <p>Some content</p>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Property Renaming

Due to the static nature of Panda, you can't rename properties at runtime.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { Circle, CircleProps } from '../styled-system/jsx'

type Props = {
  circleSize?: CircleProps['size']
}

const CustomCircle = (props: Props) => {
  const { circleSize = '3' } = props
  return (
    <Circle
      // ❌ Avoid: Panda can't determine the value of circleSize at build-time
      size={circleSize}
    />
  )
}
```

In this case, you need to use the `size` prop.

### Alternative

As of v0.8, we added a new `{fn}.raw()` method to css, patterns and recipes. This function is an identity function and
only serves as a hint for the compiler to extract the css.

It can be useful, for example, in Storybook args or custom react props.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
// mark the object as valid css for the extractor
<Button rootProps={css.raw({ bg: 'red.400' })} />
```

```tsx
export const Funky: Story = {
  // mark this as a button recipe usage
  args: button.raw({
    visual: 'funky',
    shape: 'circle',
    size: 'sm'
  })
}
```

### Enhanced `css.raw` spreading

> **Added in v1.6.1**

You can also spread `css.raw` objects within nested selectors and conditions for better style composition:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const baseStyles = css.raw({ margin: 0, padding: 0 })
const interactive = css.raw({ cursor: 'pointer', transition: 'all 0.2s' })

const component = css({
  // Spreading in child selectors
  '& p': { ...baseStyles, fontSize: '1rem' },

  // Spreading in nested conditions
  _hover: {
    ...interactive,
    _dark: { ...interactive, color: 'white' }
  }
})
```

## Static expressions

Panda supports static expressions in your styles, as long as they are statically analyzable.

### Static Composition

You can compose different style objects together using the `css.raw()` function.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

const paragraphSpacingStyle = css.raw({
  '& p': { marginBlockEnd: '1em' }
})

export const proseCss = css.raw({
  '& h1': paragraphSpacingStyle
})
```

This will result in the following CSS:

```css
/* ... */
@layer utilities {
  .\[\&_p\]\:mb_1em p,
  .\[\&_h1\]\:\[\&_p\]\:mb_1em h1 p {
    margin-block-end: 1em;
  }
}
```

### Static Expressions

Panda supports the use of functions to generate the style objects as long they are statically analyzable.

You can only use functions that are defined in the ECMAScript spec such as `Math`, `Object`, `Array`, etc, to support
the evaluation of basic expressions like this:

```ts
import { cva } from '.panda/css'

const getVariants = () => {
  const spacingTokens = Object.entries({
    sm: 'token(spacing.1)',
    md: 'token(spacing.2)'
  })

  // Generate variants programmatically
  const variants = spacingTokens.map(([variant, token]) => [variant, { paddingX: token }])
  return Object.fromEntries(variants)
}

const baseStyle = cva({
  variants: {
    variant: getVariants()
  }
})
```

This will generate the following variants object:

```json
{
  "sm": { "paddingX": "token(spacing.1)" },
  "md": { "paddingX": "token(spacing.2)" }
}
```

And the following CSS

```css
@layer utilities {
  .px_token\(spacing\.1\) {
    padding-inline: var(--spacing-1);
  }

  .px_token\(spacing\.2\) {
    padding-inline: var(--spacing-2);
  }
}
```

## Runtime conditions

Even though we recommend that you first look for better alternatives (such as using
[recipe variants](/docs/concepts/recipes)), you may still occasionally need runtime conditions.

When encountering a runtime condition, Panda will first try to resolve it statically. If it can't, it will fallback to
the generating the corresponding CSS for each possible branches.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'
import { Stack } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const App = () => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)

  return (
    <Stack
      color={isHovered ? { _hover: 'red.100' } : 'red.200'}
      _hover={{
        color: { base: 'red.300', md: isHovered ? 'red.400' : undefined }
      }}
    >
      <div className={css({ color: isHovered ? 'red.500' : 'red.600' })} />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

Since none of the conditions above are statically extractable, Panda will generate css for all possible code path,
resulting in a css that looks like this:

```css
/* ... */
@layer utilities {
  .hover\:text_red\.100:where(:hover, [data-hover]) {
    color: var(--colors-red-100);
  }

  .text_red\.200 {
    color: var(--colors-red-200);
  }

  .hover\:text_red\.300:where(:hover, [data-hover]) {
    color: var(--colors-red-300);
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .hover\:md\:text_red\.400:where(:hover, [data-hover]) {
      color: var(--colors-red-400);
    }
  }

  .text_red\.500 {
    color: var(--colors-red-500);
  }

  .text_red\.600 {
    color: var(--colors-red-600);
  }
}
/* ... */
```

## Referenced values

Although you should have your styles inlined most of the time, maybe you want to store a value in a variable and re-use
in multiple places. This should be fine as long as you keep it statically analyzable.

Here's a short list of things to avoid:

- Variables that are not defined in the same file
- Variables resulting from a function call (e.g. `const color = getColor()`)

> If you don't know what value a variable holds with a quick glance, Panda won't be able to either.

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

// ✅ Good: All values are statically extractable
const mainColor = 'red.300'
const sizes = { sm: '12px', md: '16px', '2xl': '42px' }

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div
      className={css({
        color: mainColor,
        fontSize: sizes.md,
        width: sizes['2xl']
      })}
    />
  )
}
```

### Runtime reference on known objects

Using a more complex but still common example :

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const colorByType = {
  primary: 'red.300',
  secondary: 'blue.300',
  tertiary: 'green.300'
}

const Section = () => {
  const [type, setType] = useState('primary')

  // ❌ Avoid: since only "gray.100" is statically extractable here
  // This will not work as expected, the color CSS won't be generated
  return <section className={css({ color: colorByType[type] ?? 'gray.100' })}>❌ Will not be extracted</section>
}
```

Even though `colorByType` is statically analyzable, Panda does not _yet_ support this kind of automatic extraction
fallback. This is the perfect opportunity to use the [recipes](/docs/concepts/recipes).

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { cva } from '../styled-system/cva'

const sectionRecipe = cva({
  base: { color: 'gray.100' },
  variants: {
    type: {
      primary: { color: 'red.300' },
      secondary: { color: 'blue.300' },
      tertiary: { color: 'green.300' }
    }
  }
})

const Section = () => {
  const [type, setType] = useState('primary')

  // ✅ Good: This will work as expected
  return <section className={sectionRecipe({ type })}>✅ With a recipe</section>
}
```

Not only did you get the same end result, but you also got a more readable and maintainable code !

You can now :

- add more variants to your recipe
- add more properties
- use a shorthand or a condition

All of this with complete type-safety and without having to make drastic changes to the component.

> Note that you can also [integrate this recipe directly into your theme](/docs/concepts/recipes) if you want to only
> generate the CSS that you use, among other things

## Summary

### What you can do

```tsx
// ✅ Good: Conditional styles
<styled.div color={{ base: "red.100", md: "red.200" }} />

// ✅ Good: Arbitrary value
<styled.div color="#121qsd" />

// ✅ Good: Arbitrary selector
<styled.div css={{ "&[data-thing] > span": { color: "red.100" } }} />

// ✅ Good: Runtime value (with config.`staticCss`)
const Button = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red.300')
  return <styled.button color={color} />
}

// ✅ Good: Runtime condition
<styled.div color={{ base: "red.100", md: isHovered ? "red.200" : "red.300" }} />

// ✅ Good: Referenced value
<styled.div color={mainColor} />

```

### What you can't do

```tsx
// ❌ Avoid: Runtime value (without config.`staticCss`)
const Button = () => {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('red.300')
  return <styled.button color={color} />
}

// ❌ Avoid: Referenced value (not statically analyzable or from another file)
<styled.div color={getColor()} />
<styled.div color={colors[getColorName()]} />
<styled.div color={colors[colorFromAnotherFile]} />

const CustomCircle = (props) => {
  const { circleSize = '3' } = props
  return (
    <Circle
      // ❌ Avoid: Panda can't determine the value of circleSize at build-time
      size={circleSize}
    />
  )
}
```

## Custom Font

How to use custom fonts in your project.

Adding custom fonts to your application or website is a typical requirement for projects. Panda recommends using custom
fonts through CSS variables for consistency.

## Setup

### Next.js

Next.js provides a built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file by using the `next/font` module. It allows you to
conveniently use all Google Fonts and any local font with performance and privacy in mind.

Here's an example of how to load a local "Mona Sans" font and a Google Font "Fira Code" in your Next.js project.

```js filename="styles/font.ts"
import { Fira_Code } from 'next/font/google'
import localFont from 'next/font/local'

export const MonaSans = localFont({
  src: '../fonts/Mona-Sans.woff2',
  display: 'swap',
  variable: '--font-mona-sans'
})

export const FiraCode = Fira_Code({
  weight: ['400', '500', '700'],
  display: 'swap',
  subsets: ['latin'],
  variable: '--font-fira-code'
})
```

> Ideally, you should load the font in the layout file.

Next, you need to add the font variables to your HTML document. You can do this using either the App Router or the Pages
Router.

#### App Router

```jsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { FiraCode, MonaSans } from '../styles/font'

export default function Layout(props) {
  const { children } = props
  return (
    <html className={`${MonaSans.variable} ${FiraCode.variable}`}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> **Note 🚨:** By default, Next.js attaches the className for the fonts to the `<body>` element, for panda to
> appropriately load fonts, update the code to attach the `className` to the `<html>` element.

#### Pages Router

```jsx filename="pages/_app.tsx"
import { FiraCode, MonaSans } from '../styles/font'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <style jsx global>
        {`
          :root {
            --font-mona-sans: ${MonaSans.style.fontFamily};
            --font-fira-code: ${FiraCode.style.fontFamily};
          }
        `}
      </style>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Fontsource

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) streamlines the process of integrating fonts into your web application.

To begin, install your desired font package:

```bash
pnpm add @fontsource-variable/fira-code
```

Next, import the font into your project:

```jsx
import '@fontsource-variable/fira-code'
```

Lastly, create a variable to use it as a token in the panda config

```css filename="styles/font.css"
:root {
  --font-fira-code: 'Fira Code Variable', monospace;
}
```

### Vanilla CSS

You can leverage the native font-face CSS property to load custom fonts in your project.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Mona Sans';
  src: url('../fonts/Mona-Sans.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Then alias the font names to css variables.

```css
:root {
  --font-mona-sans: 'Mona Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

### Global Font Face

You can also define global font face in your panda config.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  globalFontface: {
    Fira: {
      src: 'url(/fonts/fira.woff2) format("woff2")',
      fontWeight: 400,
      fontStyle: 'normal',
      fontDisplay: 'swap'
    }
  }
})
```

You can also define multiple font sources for the same weight.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  globalFontface: {
    Fira: {
      src: ['url(/fonts/fira.woff2) format("woff2")', 'url(/fonts/fira.woff) format("woff")'],
      fontWeight: 400,
      fontStyle: 'normal',
      fontDisplay: 'swap'
    }
  }
})
```

You can also define multiple font weights.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  globalFontface: {
    Fira: [
      {
        src: 'url(/fonts/fira.woff2) format("woff2")',
        fontWeight: 400,
        fontStyle: 'normal',
        fontDisplay: 'swap'
      },
      {
        src: 'url(/fonts/fira-bold.woff2) format("woff2")',
        fontWeight: 700,
        fontStyle: 'normal',
        fontDisplay: 'swap'
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

Then expose the font names to css variables.

```css
:root {
  --font-fira-code: 'Fira Code Variable', monospace;
}
```

You can also use [globalVars](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#global-vars) in your panda config to define the variables.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  globalVars: {
    '--font-fira-code': 'Fira Code Variable, monospace'
  }
})
```

## Update Panda Config

```js
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        fonts: {
          fira: { value: 'var(--font-fira-code), Menlo, monospace' },
          mona: { value: 'var(--font-mona-sans), sans-serif' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Use the custom fonts

```jsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className={css({ fontFamily: 'mona' })}>Mona Sans</h1>
      <code className={css({ fontFamily: 'fira' })}>Fira Code</code>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Minimal Setup

How to set up Panda with the bare minimum.

The default Panda setup includes utilities and design tokens by default. In this guide, you'll see how to strip out the
defaults and start from scratch.

## Removing default tokens

To remove the default design tokens injected by Panda, set the `presets` key to an empty array:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  presets: []
})
```

This allows you to define your own tokens, without having to use the `extend` key in the theme.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        primary: { value: '#ff0000' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Removing default utilities

Use the `eject: true` property to remove all the default utilities.

Panda doesn't automatically know which tokens are valid for which CSS properties, so it is necessary to tell Panda that
my tokens from the "colors" category are valid for the CSS property "color".

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  eject: true,
  utilities: {
    color: {
      values: 'colors'
    }
  },
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        primary: { value: '#ff0000' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This makes `<p className={css({ color: 'primary' })}> Text </p>` work as expected.

## Re-using Panda presets

Panda offers 2 presets:

- `@pandacss/preset-base`: This is a relatively unopinionated set of utilities for mapping CSS properties to values
  (almost everyone will want these)

You can use these presets by installing them via npm and adding them to your `presets` key:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-base']
})
```

- `@pandacss/preset-panda` as an opinionated set of tokens if you don't want to define your own colors/spacing/fonts
  etc.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  presets: ['@pandacss/preset-panda']
})
```

> Note: You don't need to install `@pandacss/preset-base` or `@pandacss/preset-panda`. Panda will automatically resolve
> them for you.

---


## Multi-Theme Tokens

Panda supports advance token definition beyond just light/dark mode; theming beyond just dark mode. You can define multi-theme tokens using nested conditions.

## Multi-Theme Tokens

Panda supports advance token definition beyond just light/dark mode; theming beyond just dark mode. You can define
multi-theme tokens using nested conditions.

Let's say your application supports a pink and blue theme, and each theme can have a light and dark mode. Let's see how
to model this in Panda.

We'll start by defining the following conditions for these theme and color modes:

```js
// panda.config.ts
const config = {
  conditions: {
    light: '[data-color-mode=light] &',
    dark: '[data-color-mode=dark] &',
    pinkTheme: '[data-theme=pink] &',
    blueTheme: '[data-theme=blue] &'
  }
}
```

> Conditions are a way to provide preset css selectors or media queries for use in your Panda project

Next, we'll define a `colors.text` semantic token for the pink and blue theme.

```js
// panda.config.ts
const theme = {
  // ...
  semanticTokens: {
    colors: {
      text: {
        value: {
          _pinkTheme: '{colors.pink.500}',
          _blueTheme: '{colors.blue.500}'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, we'll modify `colors.text` to support light and dark color modes for each theme.

```js
// panda.config.ts
const theme = {
  // ...
  semanticTokens: {
    colors: {
      text: {
        value: {
          _pinkTheme: { base: '{colors.pink.500}', _dark: '{colors.pink.300}' },
          _blueTheme: { base: '{colors.blue.500}', _dark: '{colors.blue.300}' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now, you can use the `text` token in your styles, and it will automatically change based on the theme and the color
scheme.

```jsx
// use pink and dark mode theme
<html data-theme="pink" data-color-mode="dark">
  <body>
    <h1 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>

// use pink and light mode theme
<html data-theme="pink">
  <body>
    <h1 className={css({ color: 'text' })}>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Multi-Themes

The above example shows you how to define multi-theme tokens using nested conditions but you can also define clearly separated themes using the `themes` property in the config.

This allows you to apply a `theme` on multiple tokens at once, using data attributes and CSS variables.

> Theme variants can be applied using the `data-panda-theme` attribute with the theme key as the value.

```ts
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  // main theme
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          text: { value: 'green' }
        }
      },
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          body: {
            value: {
              base: '{colors.green.600}',
              _osDark: '{colors.green.400}'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  // alternative theme variants
  themes: {
    primary: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          text: { value: 'red' }
        }
      },
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          muted: { value: '{colors.red.200}' },
          body: {
            value: {
              base: '{colors.red.600}',
              _osDark: '{colors.red.400}'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    secondary: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          text: { value: 'blue' }
        }
      },
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          muted: { value: '{colors.blue.200}' },
          body: {
            value: {
              base: '{colors.blue.600}',
              _osDark: '{colors.blue.400}'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Pregenerating themes

By default, no additional theme variant is generated, you need to specify the specific themes you want to generate in
`staticCss.themes` to include them in the CSS output.

```ts
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  staticCss: {
    themes: ['primary', 'secondary']
  }
})
```

This will generate the following CSS:

```css
@layer tokens {
  :where(:root, :host) {
    --colors-text: blue;
    --colors-body: var(--colors-blue-600);
  }

  [data-panda-theme='primary'] {
    --colors-text: red;
    --colors-muted: var(--colors-red-200);
    --colors-body: var(--colors-red-600);
  }

  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    :where(:root, :host) {
      --colors-body: var(--colors-blue-400);
    }

    [data-panda-theme='primary'] {
      --colors-body: var(--colors-red-400);
    }
  }
}
```

### Dynamically importing themes

An alternative way of applying a theme is by using the new `styled-system/themes` entrypoint where you can import the
themes expected CSS and apply them in your app.

> ℹ️ The `styled-system/themes` will always contain every themes (tree-shaken if not used), whereas `staticCss.themes` only
> applies to the CSS output.

Each theme has a corresponding JSON file with a similar structure:

```json
{
  "name": "primary",
  "id": "panda-themes-primary",
  "css": "[data-panda-theme=primary] { ... }"
}
```

#### Dynamically import a theme using its name

```ts
import { getTheme } from '../styled-system/themes'

const theme = await getTheme('red')
//    ^? {
//     name: "red";
//     id: string;
//     css: string;
// }
```

#### Inject the theme styles into the DOM:

```ts
import { injectTheme } from '../styled-system/themes'

const theme = await getTheme('red')
injectTheme(document.documentElement, theme) // this returns the injected style element
```

#### SSR example with NextJS:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'
import './globals.css'
import { ThemeName, getTheme } from '../../styled-system/themes'

export default async function RootLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const store = cookies()
  const themeName = store.get('theme')?.value as ThemeName
  const theme = themeName && (await getTheme(themeName))

  return (
    <html lang="en" data-panda-theme={themeName ? themeName : undefined}>
      {themeName && (
        <head>
          <style
            type="text/css"
            id={theme.id}
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: theme.css }}
          />
        </head>
      )}
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
'use client'
import { getTheme, injectTheme } from '../../styled-system/themes'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const current = document.documentElement.dataset.pandaTheme
          const next = current === 'primary' ? 'secondary' : 'primary'
          const theme = await getTheme(next)
          setCookie('theme', next, 7)
          injectTheme(document.documentElement, theme)
        }}
      >
        swap theme
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

// Set a Cookie
function setCookie(cName: string, cValue: any, expDays: number) {
  let date = new Date()
  date.setTime(date.getTime() + expDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  const expires = 'expires=' + date.toUTCString()
  document.cookie = cName + '=' + cValue + '; ' + expires + '; path=/'
}
```

### Theme contract

Finally, you can create a theme contract to ensure that all themes have the same structure:

```ts
import { defineThemeContract } from '@pandacss/dev'

const defineTheme = defineThemeContract({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      red: { value: '' } // theme implementations must have a red color
    }
  }
})

defineTheme({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      // ^^^^ ❌  Property 'red' is missing in type '{}' but required in type '{ red: { value: string; }; }'
      //
      // ✅ fixed with
      // red: { value: 'red' },
    }
  }
})
```

## Static CSS Generator

Panda can be used to generate a static set of utility classes for your project.

Panda can be used to generate a static set of utility classes for your project.

This is useful if you want to use Panda in an HTML project or you want absolute zero runtime.

## Usage

To generate a static set of CSS classes, add them to your `panda.config.js` file:

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    // the css properties you want to generate
    css: [],
    // the recipes you want to generate
    recipes: {}
  }
}
```

The `static` property supports two properties:

- `css` - an array of CSS properties you want to generate with their `conditions`
- `recipes` - the component recipes you want to generate

## Generating CSS Properties

The `css` property is an array of CSS properties you want to generate with their `conditions`.

You can specify the following options:

- `properties`: the CSS properties you want to generate
- `conditions`: the CSS conditions or selectors you want to generate in addition to the default values. Values can be
  `light, dark`, etc.
- `responsive`: whether or not to generate responsive classes
- `values`: the values you want to generate for the CSS property. When set to `*`, all values defined in the tokens will
  be included. When set to an array, only the values in the array will be generated.

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        properties: {
          margin: ['*'],
          padding: ['*', '50px', '80px']
        },
        responsive: true
      },
      {
        properties: {
          color: ['*'],
          backgroundColor: ['green.200', 'red.400']
        },
        conditions: ['light', 'dark']
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Generating Recipes

The `recipes` property is an object of component recipes you want to generate with their `conditions`.

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    recipes: {
      button: [
        {
          size: ['sm', 'md'],
          responsive: true
        },
        { variant: ['*'] }
      ],
      // shorthand for all variants
      tooltip: ['*']
    }
  }
}
```

You can also directly specify a recipe's `staticCss` rules from inside a recipe config, e.g.:

```js
import { defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const card = defineRecipe({
  className: 'card',
  base: { color: 'white' },
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: { fontSize: '14px' },
      large: { fontSize: '18px' }
    }
  },
  staticCss: [{ size: ['*'] }]
})
```

would be the equivalent of defining it inside the main config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  staticCss: {
    recipes: {
      card: {
        size: ['*']
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Or you could even generate the CSS for every config `recipe` / `slotRecipes` (and each of their variants):

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  staticCss: {
    recipes: '*'
  }
})
```

This is mostly useful for testing purposes with [`Storybook`](/docs/installation/storybook).

## Performance Considerations

Panda provides intelligent caching and memoization to optimize static CSS generation. However, **pre-generating large
numbers of styles can still impact build times**. It's important to be selective and only generate the styles you
actually need.

### Best Practices

**❌ Avoid: Generating every possible combination**

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        conditions: ['hover', 'focus', 'active', 'disabled'],
        properties: {
          // This expands to ALL tokens - very expensive!
          color: ['*'],
          backgroundColor: ['*'],
          borderColor: ['*'],
          width: ['*'],
          height: ['*']
          // ... 20+ more properties with wildcards
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**✅ Better: Only generate what you need**

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        conditions: ['_hover', '_focus'],
        properties: {
          // Only the colors you actually use
          color: ['red.500', 'blue.500', 'gray.600'],
          backgroundColor: ['white', 'gray.50', 'blue.50'],
          borderColor: ['gray.200', 'blue.500']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### When to Use Wildcards

Wildcards (`['*']`) are appropriate when:

- **Small token sets**: Properties with < 20 values (e.g., `fontWeight: ['*']`)
- **Critical utilities**: Styles you genuinely need in all variants
- **Testing scenarios**: Storybook or visual regression testing

### Use Responsive Selectively

The `responsive` property multiplies the number of generated classes by your breakpoints. Only enable it for properties
that genuinely need responsive behavior.

**❌ Avoid: Responsive for all properties**

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        // This generates classes for ALL breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
        responsive: true,
        properties: {
          color: ['red.500', 'blue.500'],
          backgroundColor: ['white', 'gray.50'],
          fontWeight: ['400', '500', '600'],
          borderRadius: ['sm', 'md', 'lg']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**✅ Better: Responsive only for layout properties**

```js
export default {
  staticCss: {
    css: [
      {
        // Responsive for layout properties that change across breakpoints
        responsive: true,
        properties: {
          display: ['none', 'block', 'flex'],
          flexDirection: ['row', 'column'],
          width: ['full', '1/2', '1/3']
        }
      },
      {
        // No responsive needed for colors/typography that stay the same
        properties: {
          color: ['red.500', 'blue.500'],
          fontWeight: ['400', '500', '600']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Properties that commonly need `responsive: true`:

- Layout: `display`, `flexDirection`, `gridTemplateColumns`
- Sizing: `width`, `height`, `maxWidth`
- Spacing: `padding`, `margin`, `gap`
- Positioning: `position`, `top`, `left`

Properties that rarely need `responsive: true`:

- Colors: `color`, `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`
- Typography: `fontWeight`, `textDecoration`, `fontFamily`
- Effects: `boxShadow`, `opacity`, `cursor`

## Removing unused CSS

For an even smaller css output size, you can utilize [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) to treeshake and remove unused
CSS. This tool will analyze your template and match selectors against your CSS.

# Migration


## Migrating from Stitches

Migrate your project from Stitches to Panda.

This guide helps you migrate from Stitches to Panda and understand the design differences between the libraries.

> **Disclaimer:** This isn't about comparing which one is best. Panda and Stitches are two different CSS-in-JS solutions
> with design decisions.

Here are some similarities between the two libraries.

- Panda uses the object literal syntax to define styles. It also supports the shorthand syntax for the `margin` and
  `padding` properties.
- Panda supports the `variants`, `defaultVariants` and `compoundVariants` APIs.
- Panda supports design tokens and themes.
- Panda supports all the variants of nested selectors (attribute, class, pseudo, descendant, child, sibling selectors
  and more). It also requires the use of the `&` to chain selectors.

Below are some of the differences between the two libraries.

## css function

In Stitches, the `css` function is used to author both regular style objects and variant style objects.

```tsx
import { css } from '@stitches/react'

// definition
const styles = css({
  border: 'solid 1px red',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',

  variants: {
    variant: {
      // ...
    }
  }
})

// usage
<button className={styles({ variant: 'primary' })} />
```

In Panda, the `css` function is only used to author atomic styles, and the `cva` function to create variant style
objects.

**The css function**

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

// definition
const styles = css({
  border: 'solid 1px red',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent'
})

// usage
<button className={styles} />
```

**The cva function**

```tsx
import { cva } from '../styled-system/css'

// definition
const styles = cva({
  base: {
    border: 'solid 1px red',
    backgroundColor: 'transparent'
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      // ...
    }
  }
})

// usage
<button className={styles({ variant: 'primary' })} />
```

## styled function

In Stitches, the `styled` function can be used to create components that are bound to both regular and variant styles
objects.

```tsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react'

const Button = styled('button', {
  // base styles
  backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
  borderRadius: '9999px',

  variants: {
    // variant styles
  }
})
```

In Panda, the base styles object needs to added to the `base` key.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  // base styles
  base: {
    backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
    borderRadius: '9999px'
  },
  variants: {
    // variant styles
  }
})
```

In Stitches, the styled function generates a unique className for each variant.

```tsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react'

const Button = styled('button', {})
// => <button class="c-coNKBW c-coNKBW-dnSdJM-variant-primary">Button</button>
```

In Panda, you can decide if you want unique classNames for the recipe or you want atomic classNames.

- **Atomic classes** using the `cva` function or defining the recipe inline in the `styled` function

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: {
    backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
    borderRadius: '9999px'
  }
})
// => <button class="bg_gainsboro rounded_999px">Button</button>
```

- **Selector classes** by defining the recipe in the `panda.config.ts` file. This approach only generates the classes
  and css for the variants that are used in the project.

```ts
import { defineConfig, defineRecipe } from '@pandacss/dev'

const buttonStyle = defineRecipe({
  className: 'button',
  base: {
    backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
    borderRadius: '9999px'
  },
  variants: {
    // variant styles
  }
})

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      recipes: {
        buttonStyle
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> You might need to run `panda codegen --clean` to generate the recipe functions.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'
import { buttonStyle } from '../styled-system/recipes'

// create a styled component using the recipe function
const Button = styled('button', buttonStyle)

// or you can use directly in the JSX
<button className={buttonStyle({ variant: 'primary' })}>Button</button>

// => <button className="button button--variant-primary">Button</button>
```

## Responsive Styles

In Stitches, you configure breakpoints in the `media` key of the `createStitches` method, and use it via the
`@<breakpoint>` syntax.

```ts
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react'

// configure
const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  media: {
    bp1: '(min-width: 640px)',
    bp2: '(min-width: 768px)'
  }
})

// usage
const styles = css({
  backgroundColor: 'gainsboro',
  '@bp1': {
    backgroundColor: 'tomato'
  }
})
```

In Panda, you configure breakpoints in the `theme.breakpoints` key of the `panda.config` function

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      breakpoints: {
        bp1: '640px',
        bp2: '768px'
      }
    }
  }
})

// usage
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  bg: 'gainsboro',
  bp1: { bg: 'tomato' },
  // or
  margin: { base: '10px', bp1: '20px' }
})
```

In Stitches, you use the `@initial` keyword to target the base styles.

In Panda, you use the `base` key to target the base styles.

## Tokens and Theme

### Tokens

In Stitches, tokens are defined in the `theme` key of the `createStitches` method.

```ts
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react'

const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  theme: {
    colors: {
      gray100: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)',
      gray200: 'hsl(206,12%,97%)'
    }
  },
  space: {},
  fonts: {}
})

// usage
const styles = css({
  backgroundColor: '$gray100'
})
```

In Panda, tokens are defined in the `theme` key of the `panda.config` function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        gray100: { value: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)' },
        gray200: { value: 'hsl(206,12%,97%)' }
      },
      spacing: {},
      fonts: {}
    },
    semanticTokens: {
      // ...
    }
  }
})

// usage
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const styles = css({
  backgroundColor: 'gray100'
})
```

Notice that in Panda, you don't need to use the `$` prefix to access the tokens. If you really want to use the `$`
prefix, you can either update the name of the token:

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    colors: {
-      gray100: { value: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)' },
+      $gray100: { value: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)' },
    },
  }
})
```

Or you can tweak the token engine to format them with the `$` prefix:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  hooks: {
    'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
      configure({
        formatTokenName: path => '$' + path.join('-')
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Themes

In Stitches, the `createTheme` function is used to define dark theme values.

```tsx
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react'

const { createTheme } = createStitches({})

// create theme
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    gray100: 'hsl(206,8%,12%)',
    gray200: 'hsl(206,7%,14%)'
  }
})

// apply theme
<div className={darkTheme}>
  <div>Content nested in dark theme.</div>
</div>
```

In Panda, themes are designed as semantic tokens. You can define the semantic tokens in the `semanticTokens` key of the
`panda.config` function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        gray100: {
          value: { base: 'hsl(206,22%,99%)', _dark: 'hsl(206,8%,12%)' }
        },
        gray200: {
          value: { base: 'hsl(206,12%,97%)', _dark: 'hsl(206,7%,14%)' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Token Aliases

In Stitches, you can create locally scoped tokens using the `$$` prefix

```ts
import { styled } from '@stitches/react'

const Button = styled('button', {
  $$shadowColor: '$colors$pink500',
  boxShadow: '0 0 0 15px $$shadowColor'
})
```

In Panda, there's no special syntax, you need to use the css variable syntax. CSS variables are able to query the theme
tokens directly using dot notation

```ts
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: {
    '--shadowColor': 'colors.pink500',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 15px var(--shadowColor)'
  }
})
```

## Animations

In Stitches, you can define keyframes using the `keyframes` method.

```ts
import { keyframes, styled } from '@stitches/react'

const scaleUp = keyframes({
  '0%': { transform: 'scale(1)' },
  '100%': { transform: 'scale(1.5)' }
})

// usage
const Button = styled('button', {
  '&:hover': {
    animation: `${scaleUp} 200ms`
  }
})
```

In Panda, you define keyframes in the `theme.keyframes` key of the `panda.config` function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        scaleUp: {
          '0%': { transform: 'scale(1)' },
          '100%': { transform: 'scale(1.5)' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// usage
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const style = css({
  '&:hover': {
    animation: 'scaleUp 200ms'
  }
})
```

## Utils

In Stitches, you can define utilities by using the `utils` key in the `createStitches` method.

```ts
import { createStitches, type PropertyValue } from '@stitches/react'

const { styled, css } = createStitches({
  utils: {
    linearGradient: (value: PropertyValue<'backgroundImage'>) => ({
      backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(${value})`
    })
  }
})
```

In Panda, you get a lot of built-in utilities (like mx, marginX, my, py, etc.) that you can use out of the box. You can
also create custom utilites using the `utilities` key in the `panda.config` function.

The utilities API allows you define the connected token scale, generated className, and transform function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  utilities: {
    extend: {
      linearGradient: {
        // (optional): the css property this maps to (to inherit the types from)
        property: 'backgroundImage',
        // (optional): the className to generate
        className: 'bg_gradient',
        // (optional): the shorthand name to use in the css
        shorthand: 'gradient',
        // (required): maps the value to the raw css object
        transform: value => ({
          backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(${value})`
        })
      }
    }
  }
})
```

> Running `panda codegen` will update the typings for the utilities, allowing for a type-safe developer experience.

Then you can use the utility in your styles.

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const buttonClass = css({
  linearGradient: '19deg, #21D4FD 0%, #B721FF 100%'
})
```

## Global Styles

In Stitches, you define the global styles using the `globalCss` function, and then call it in your app.

```tsx
import { globalCss } from '@stitches/react'

const globalStyles = globalCss({
  '*': { margin: 0, padding: 0 }
})

// then in your app
globalStyles()
```

In Panda, you define the global styles in the `panda.config.ts` using the `globalCss` function.

> The styles be injected automatically under the `base` cascade layer via PostCSS

```ts {3-5}
import { defineConfig, defineGlobalStyles } from '@pandacss/dev'

const globalCss = defineGlobalStyles({
  '*': { margin: 0, padding: 0 }
})

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  globalCss
})
```

## Targeting Components

In Stitches, you can directly target React or styled components via the `toString()` method.

```tsx
import { css } from '@stitches/react'

const Icon = () => (
  <svg className="right-arrow" ... />
);

// add a `toString` method
Icon.toString = () => '.right-arrow';

const buttonClass = css({
  [`& ${Icon}`]: {
    marginLeft: '5px'
  }
})
```

In Panda, you need to use the native selector directly. This is largely due to the static nature of Panda

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const Icon = () => (
  <svg className="right-arrow" ... />
);


const buttonClass = css({
  "& .right-arrow": {
    marginLeft: '5px'
  }
})
```

## Server Side Rendering

In Stitches, you need to configure the server-side rendering for your framework.

```tsx
// stitches.config.ts
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react'
export const { getCssText } = createStitches()

// _document.tsx
export default class Document extends NextDocument {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head>
          <style id="stitches" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: getCssText() }} />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

In Panda, you don't need to configure anything. Panda automatically extracts the styles and injects them at build time
using PostCSS.

## Conclusion

Before choosing your preferred CSS-in-JS library, be sure to consider your engineering and design goals. Both Stitches
and Panda are capable of achieving many of the same styling goals, but they have different approaches.

## Migrating from Styled Components

Migrate your project from Styled Components to Panda.

This guide outlines the steps needed to migrate your project from Styled Components to Panda and highlights key design
differences between the two libraries.

> **Disclaimer:** This isn't about comparing which one is best. Panda and Styled Components are two different CSS-in-JS
> solutions with design decisions.

Here are some similarities between the two libraries.

- Both libraries support the use of tagged template literals or object syntax to style components.
- Both libraries provide a way to define design tokens (variables) and use them in your styles.
- Both libraries require the use of `&` for nested selectors.

Below are some differences between the two libraries.

## Installation and Syntax

In styled-components, you can use both tagged template literals and object syntax to style components.

In Panda, you need to decide which syntax you want to use. Panda recommends using the object syntax, but provides a way
to opt-in to tagged template literals.

To initialize a project with the object syntax, run the following command.

```bash
panda init -p --jsx-framework react
```

To initialize a project with the tagged template literal syntax, run the following command.

```bash
panda init -p --syntax template-literal --jsx-framework react
```

Then you need to add the cascade layers to the global styles of your project.

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

## Tagged Template Syntax

In styled-components, the recommended way to style components is to use tagged template literals.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  color: #000;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
`
```

In Panda, you will use the autogenerate code in the `styled-system` directory at the root of your project.

> Remember to initialize your project with the `--syntax template-literal` flag or update the panda.config.ts file.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  color: #000;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
`
```

## Object Syntax

In styled-components, you can use the object syntax to style components.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Button = styled.button({
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  border: '1px solid #000',
  color: '#000',
  padding: '0.5rem 1rem'
})
```

In Panda, you add the style object to the `base` key of the style object. The `styled` factory allows you define base
styles, variants and compound variants of your component.

```jsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: {
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    border: '1px solid #000',
    color: '#000',
    padding: '0.5rem 1rem'
  }
})
```

## Prop Interpolation

In styled-components, you can interpolate the component's props to conditionally set styles.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  ${props =>
    props.color === 'violet' &&
    `
    background-color: 'blueviolet'
  `}

  ${props =>
    props.color === 'gray' &&
    `
    background-color: 'gainsboro'
  `}
`
```

In Panda, we model interpolations using the variants API. This allows define style groups or recipes that can be applied
to components.

````jsx
const Button = styled('button', {
  variants: {
    color: {
      violet: css`
        background-color: blueviolet;
      `,
      gray: css`
        background-color: gainsboro;
      `
    }
  }
})

// Usage
<Button color="violet">Button</Button>
``` -->

## Tokens and Themes

### Defining Tokens

In styled-components, you can define tokens in a theme object that is passed to the `ThemeProvider`.
This requires the use of React's context API to access the theme object in your styles

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'blue',
    secondary: 'red'
  }
}

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
````

In Panda, you define tokens in the `theme` key of the `panda.config.ts` file. This allows you to access the tokens in
your styles without the need for React's context API.

```tsx
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: {
          primary: { value: 'blue' },
          secondary: { value: 'red' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Using Tokens

In styled-components, you can use tokens in your styles using a function approach that provides the `theme` prop, and
requires ambient type declarations to get type safety.

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

// link.tsx
const StyledLink = styled.a(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.colors.primary,
  display: 'block',
  textDecoration: 'none'
}))

// theme.d.ts
declare module 'styled-components' {
  export interface DefaultTheme {
    colors: {
      primary: string
      secondary: string
    }
  }
}
```

In Panda, the tokens are automatically available in your styles and connected to each css property, removing the need
for an interpolation function.

```tsx
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    // extend the base theme
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        // add custom colors
        colors: {
          primary: { value: 'blue' },
          secondary: { value: 'red' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// link.tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const StyledLink = styled('a', {
  base: {
    color: 'primary',
    display: 'block',
    textDecoration: 'none'
  }
})
```

## Responsive Styles

### Tagged Template Syntax

In styled-components, you need to write the media query styles manually or use a helper function like
`styled-media-query`.

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  color: #000;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
  }
`
```

In Panda, it's pretty much the same thing except that you can't do any interpolation in the media query styles due the
static nature of Panda.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  color: #000;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
  }
`
```

### Object Syntax

In styled-components, you can use the `styled-media-query` helper function to write responsive styles.

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'
import media from 'styled-media-query'

const Button = styled.button({
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  border: '1px solid #000',
  color: '#000',
  padding: '0.5rem 1rem',

  [media.greaterThan('medium')]: {
    padding: '1rem 2rem'
  }
})
```

In Panda, you can use the pseudo props API to define responsive styles.

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled('button', {
  base: {
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    border: '1px solid #000',
    color: '#000',
    padding: { base: '0.5rem 1rem', md: '1rem 2rem' }
  }
})
```

## Global Styles

In styled-components, you can use the `createGlobalStyle` function to define global styles.

```tsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
`
```

In Panda, you can use the `globalCss` key of the `panda.config.ts` file to define global styles. This will automatically
add styles to the project via PostCSS.

```tsx
// panda.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  globalCss: {
    body: {
      margin: 0,
      padding: 0
    }
  }
})
```

## Targeting Components

In styled-components, you can target existing styled components within the styled function

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Link = styled.a`
  background: papayawhip;
  color: #bf4f74;
`

const Icon = styled.svg`
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;

  ${Link}:hover & {
    fill: rebeccapurple;
  }
`
```

In Panda, you need to use the native selector directly. This is largely due to the static nature of Panda

```tsx
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Link = styled.a`
  background: papayawhip;
  color: #bf4f74;
`

const Icon = styled.svg`
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;

  .Link:hover & {
    fill: rebeccapurple;
  }
`

const App = () => (
  <Link className="Link">
    <Icon />
  </Link>
)
```

## Animations

In styled components, you can define keyframes using the `keyframes` method.

```ts
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'

const rotate = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }

  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`

// usage
const Button = styled.button`
  &:hover {
    animation: ${rotate} 200ms;
  }
`
```

In Panda, you define keyframes in the `theme.keyframes` key of the `panda.config` function.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        rotate: {
          from: {
            transform: 'rotate(0deg)'
          },
          to: {
            transform: 'rotate(360deg)'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// usage
import { styled } from '../styled-system/jsx'

const Button = styled.button`
  &:hover {
    animation: rotate 200ms;
  }
`
```

## Server-Side Rendering

In styled components, you need to configure the server-side rendering for your framework.

```tsx
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
try {
  const html = renderToString(sheet.collectStyles(<YourApp />))
  const styleTags = sheet.getStyleTags() // or sheet.getStyleElement();
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
  console.error(error)
} finally {
  sheet.seal()
}
```

In Panda, you don't need to configure anything. Panda automatically extracts the styles and injects them at build time
using PostCSS.

## Conclusion

Before choosing your preferred CSS-in-JS library, be sure to consider your engineering and design goals. Both Styled
components and Panda are capable of achieving many of the same styling goals, but they have different approaches.

## Migrating from Theme UI

Migrate your project from Theme UI to Panda.

This guide outlines the steps needed to migrate your project from Theme UI to Panda and highlights key design
differences between the two libraries.

Here are some similarities between the two libraries.

- Panda and Theme UI both support JSX style props.
- Supports design tokens and themes.
- Support for styling primitives like `Box`, `Flex`, `Grid`, etc.

Below are some of the differences between the two libraries.

## Performance

Theme UI relies on `@emotion/styled` to style components. This means that every time you use the `sx` prop, runtime
CSS-in-JS is required to compute the styles in the browser. This can lead to performance issues in larger applications.

Panda relies on `postcss` and converts CSS-in-JS styles to static CSS at build-time, leading to better performance in
larger applications.

## Theming

In Theme UI, you need to wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` component which is a wrapper around `@emotion/react`
theme context.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'

const theme = {
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
    heading: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif'
  },
  colors: {
    text: '#000',
    background: '#fff'
  }
}

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

In Panda, you don't need to wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` component. Instead, you can pass the theme object
to the `panda.config.js` file.

The theme object in Panda is broken down into multiple parts, `tokens` and `semanticTokens`. The theme specification
also required passing the tokens as `{ value: XX }`

```js
// panda.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        fonts: {
          body: { value: 'system-ui, sans-serif' },
          heading: { value: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif' }
        },
        colors: {
          text: { value: '#000' },
          background: { value: '#fff' }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## The `sx` prop

In Theme UI, you can use the `sx` prop to style any component when you add the `jsxImportSource` pragma to the top of
your file.

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource theme-ui */

export const Demo = props => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary',
      fontSize: 4
    }}
  />
)
```

Panda offers three similar ways to style components. The first approach is to use the `styled` element syntax and rename
`sx` to `css`

```jsx
import { styled } from 'styled-system/jsx'

export const Demo = props => (
  <styled.div
    {...props}
    css={{
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary',
      fontSize: 4
    }}
  />
)
```

The second approach is to create styled components using the `styled` function. This approach allows you to create style
variants.

```jsx
import { styled } from 'styled-system/jsx'

export const Demo = styled('div', {
  base: {
    color: 'white',
    bg: 'primary',
    fontSize: 4
  }
})
```

The simplest approach is to use the `css` function to write one-off styles.

```jsx
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

export const Demo = props => (
  <div
    {...props}
    className={css({
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary',
      fontSize: 4
    })}
  />
)
```

## Variants

In Theme UI, variants are used to create groups of styles based on the theme. It offers variant groups in the theme for
several components.

- `Grid` maps to `theme.grids`
- `Button`, `IconButton` maps to `theme.buttons`
- `NavLink`, `Link` maps to `theme.links`
- `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea` maps to `theme.forms`
- `Heading`, `Text` maps to `theme.text`

```js
// theme.js

export default {
  colors: {
    primary: '#07c',
    secondary: '#30c',
    accent: '#609'
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary'
    },
    secondary: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'secondary'
    },
    accent: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'accent'
    }
  }
}

// Button.js
<button sx={{ variant: 'buttons.primary' }} />
```

In Panda, multi-variant styles are referred to as recipes. Recipes are a collection of styles that can be applied to any
component.

There are two ways to define recipes in Panda. The first approach is to use the `cva` function which produces atomic
classnames.

```js
import { cva } from 'styled-system/css'

const buttonStyles = cva({
  base: {
    display: 'inline-flex'
  },
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: {
        color: 'white',
        bg: 'primary'
      },
      secondary: {
        color: 'white',
        bg: 'secondary'
      },
      accent: {
        color: 'white',
        bg: 'accent'
      }
    }
  }
})

const Demo = () => (
  <button
    className={buttonStyles({
      variant: 'accent'
    })}
  />
)
```

The second approach is to define the recipe in the `theme.recipes` property of the panda config. This is referred to as
'Config recipes' in Panda and allows for sharing recipes across components and projects.

```js
// panda.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      recipes: {
        button: {
          className: 'button',
          base: { display: 'inline-flex' },
          variants: {
            variant: {
              primary: { color: 'white', bg: 'primary' },
              secondary: { color: 'white', bg: 'secondary' },
              accent: { color: 'white', bg: 'accent' }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// Button.js
import { button } from 'styled-system/recipes'

const Demo = () => <button className={button({ variant: 'accent' })} />
```

## Color Modes

In Theme UI, colors modes can be used to create a user-configurable light and dark mode values that are automatically
applied to components depending on color mode.

```jsx
// theme.js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#07c',
    modes: {
      dark: {
        primary: '#0cf'
      }
    }
  }
}

// Button.js
const Demo = () => <button sx={{ color: 'primary' }} />
```

In Panda, color modes related values are defined as `semanticTokens` in the theme. Semantic tokens are tokens that
change depending on the color mode.

```js
// panda.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      semanticTokens: {
        colors: {
          primary: { value: { base: '#07c', _dark: '#0cf' } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// Button.js
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'

const Demo = () => (
  <button
    className={css({
      color: 'primary'
    })}
  />
)
```

## Global Styles

Theme UI offers a Global component (that wraps Emotion’s) for adding global CSS with theme-based values.

```jsx
import { Global } from 'theme-ui'

export default props => (
  <Global
    styles={{
      button: {
        m: 0,
        bg: 'primary',
        color: 'background',
        border: 0
      }
    }}
  />
)
```

In Panda, global styles are defined in the `theme.global` property of the panda config.

```js
// panda.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  globalCss: {
    button: {
      m: 0,
      bg: 'primary',
      color: 'background',
      border: 0
    }
  }
})
```

## Component Styles

Theme UI offers pre-defined layout components like `Box`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Flex`

```jsx
import { Box, Grid } from 'theme-ui'

const Demo = () => (
  <Grid width={[128, null, 192]}>
    <Box bg="primary">Box</Box>
    <Box bg="muted">Box</Box>
    <Box bg="primary">Box</Box>
    <Box bg="muted">Box</Box>
  </Grid>
)
```

In Panda, these are called "layout patterns", or "patterns" for short. Panda provides similar patterns that can be used
as a function or JSX element just like Theme UI.

```jsx
import { Box, Grid } from 'styled-system/jsx'

const Demo = () => (
  <Grid width={[128, null, 192]}>
    <Box bg="primary">Box</Box>
    <Box bg="muted">Box</Box>
  </Grid>
)
```

The function approach can be handy as well

```jsx
import { css } from 'styled-system/css'
import { grid } from 'styled-system/patterns'

const Demo = () => (
  <div className={grid({ width: [128, null, 192] })}>
    <div className={css({ bg: 'primary' })}>Box</div>
    <div className={css({ bg: 'muted' })}>Box</div>
  </div>
)
```

## cssgen

Generate the CSS from files.

```bash
panda cssgen

# Generate CSS for specific type
panda cssgen tokens

# Generate CSS for specific glob
panda cssgen "src/**/*.css"

# Generate CSS files split into separate files per layer and recipe
panda cssgen --splitting
```

When using the `cssgen` command, you can pass a `{type}` argument to generate only a specific type of CSS. The supported
types are: `preflight`, `tokens`, `static`, `global`, `keyframes`.

### CSS Splitting

The `--splitting` flag enables CSS code splitting, which generates separate CSS files for different parts of your design
system instead of a single monolithic CSS file. This is useful for:

- **Selective loading** - Load only the CSS you need for specific pages
- **Easier debugging** - Identify which layer or recipe contributes to the final CSS

When using `--splitting`, Panda will generate the following structure:

```
styled-system/
├── styles.css              # @layer declarations + @imports for all layers
└── styles/
    ├── reset.css           # Preflight/reset CSS
    ├── global.css          # Global CSS styles
    ├── tokens.css          # Design token CSS variables
    ├── utilities.css       # Atomic utility classes
    ├── recipes.css         # @imports for all recipe files
    ├── recipes/
    │   ├── button.css      # Individual recipe: button
    │   ├── card.css        # Individual recipe: card
    │   └── ...             # Other recipes as separate files
    └── themes/
        └── dark.css        # Theme-specific tokens (not auto-imported)
        └── light.css       # Theme-specific tokens (not auto-imported)
```

The main `styles.css` file contains the `@layer` declarations and imports all the layer files (but not the themes):

```css
/* styled-system/styles.css */
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;

@import './styles/reset.css';
@import './styles/global.css';
@import './styles/tokens.css';
@import './styles/recipes.css';
@import './styles/utilities.css';
```

You can then choose how to import these files:

```css
/* Option 1: Import everything (default) */
@import './styled-system/styles.css';

/* Option 2: Import specific layers only */
@import './styled-system/styles/tokens.css';
@import './styled-system/styles/utilities.css';

/* Option 3: Import specific recipes */
@import './styled-system/styles/recipes/button.css';
@import './styled-system/styles/recipes/card.css';

/* Option 4: Import a specific theme (when using multiple themes) */
@import './styled-system/styles/themes/oceanic.css';
```

## Configuring Panda

Customize how Panda works via the `panda.config.ts` file in your project.

Customize how Panda works via the `panda.config.ts` file in your project.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // your configuration options here...
})
```

## Output css options

### presets

**Type**: `string[]`

**Default**: `['@pandacss/preset-base', '@pandacss/preset-panda']`

The set of reusable and shareable configuration presets.

By default, any preset you add will be smartly merged with the default configuration, with your own configuration acting
as a set of overrides and extensions.

```json
{
  "presets": ["@pandacss/preset-base", "@pandacss/preset-panda"]
}
```

### eject

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `false`

Whether to opt-out of the defaults config presets: [`@pandacss/preset-base`, `@pandacss/preset-panda`]

```json
{
  "eject": true
}
```

### preflight

**Type**: `boolean` | `{ scope: string; }`

**Default**: `false`

Whether to enable css reset styles. See also [Global styles](/docs/concepts/global-styles) for how reset interacts with global variables and layering.

Enable preflight:

```json
{
  "preflight": true
}
```

You can also scope the preflight; Especially useful for being able to scope the CSS reset to only a part of the app for
some reason.

Enable preflight and customize the scope:

```json
{
  "preflight": { "scope": ".extension" }
}
```

The resulting `reset` css would look like this:

```css
.extension button,
.extension select {
  text-transform: none;
}

.extension table {
  text-indent: 0;
  border-color: inherit;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

You can also set the level to `element` (defaults to `parent`) to only reset the elements that have the scope class
assigned.

```json
{
  "preflight": { "scope": ".extension", "level": "element" }
}
```

The resulting `reset` css would look like this:

```css
button.extension,
select.extension {
  text-transform: none;
}

table.extension {
  text-indent: 0;
  border-color: inherit;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```

### emitTokensOnly

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `false`

Whether to only emit the `tokens` directory

```json
{
  "emitTokensOnly": false
}
```

### prefix

**Type**: `string`

The namespace prefix for the generated css classes and css variables.

Ex: when using a prefix of `panda-`

```json
{
  "prefix": "panda"
}
```

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return <div className={css({ color: 'blue.500' })} />
}
```

would result in:

```css
.panda-text_blue\.500 {
  color: var(--panda-colors-blue-500);
}
```

### layers

**Type**: `Partial<Layer>`

Cascade layers used in generated css.

Ex: when customizing the utilities layer

```json
{
  "layers": {
    "utilities": "panda_utilities"
  }
}
```

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return <div className={css({ color: 'blue.500' })} />
}
```

would result in:

```css
@layer panda_utilities {
  .text_blue\.500 {
    color: var(--colors-blue-500);
  }
}
```

You should update the layer in your root css also.

### separator

**Type**: `'_' | '=' | '-'`

**Default**: `'_'`

The separator for the generated css classes.

```json
{
  "separator": "_"
}
```

Using a `=` with:

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return <div className={css({ color: 'blue.500' })} />
}
```

would result in:

```css
.text\=blue\.500 {
  color: var(--colors-blue-500);
}
```

### minify

**Type**: `boolean`

**Default**: `false`

Whether to minify the generated css. This can be set to `true` to reduce the size of the generated css.

```json
{
  "minify": false
}
```

### hash

**Type**: `boolean | { cssVar: boolean; className: boolean }`

**Default**: `false`

Whether to hash the generated class names / css variables. This is useful if want to shorten the class names or css
variables.

Hash the class names and css variables:

```json
{
  "hash": true
}
```

This

```tsx
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

const App = () => {
  return <div className={css({ color: 'blue.500' })} />
}
```

would result in something that looks like:

```css
.dOFUTE {
  color: var(--cgpxvS);
}
```

You can also hash them individually.

E.g. only hash the css variables:

```json
{
  "hash": { "cssVar": true, "className": false }
}
```

Then the result looks like this:

```css
.text_blue\.500 {
  color: var(--cgpxvS);
}
```

Now only hash the class names:

```json
{
  "hash": { "cssVar": false, "className": true }
}
```

Then the result looks like this:

```css
.dOFUTE {
  color: var(--colors-blue-500);
}
```

{
  "importMap": {

    "recipes": "@acme/styled-system",
    "patterns": "@acme/styled-system",
    "jsx": "@acme/styled-system"
  }
}
```

You can also use a string to customize the base import path and keep the default entrypoints:

```json
{
  "importMap": "@scope/styled-system"
}
```

is the equivalent of:

```json
{
  "importMap": {
    "css": "@scope/styled-system/css",

  - but the recipe usage is still valid `styled("div", { base: { color: "red.300" }, variants: { ...} })`

Ex with 'all':

```jsx
<styled.button marginTop="40px">Click me</styled.button>
```

Ex with 'minimal':

```jsx

<button className={css({ marginTop: '40px' })}>Click me</button>
```

{
  "validation": "error"

object in the config.

They will be called in sequence in the order they are defined in the `plugins` array, with the user's config called
last.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      name: 'token-format',
      hooks: {
        'tokens:created': ({ configure }) => {
          configure({
            formatTokenName: path => '$' + path.join('-')
          })
        }
      }
    }
  ]
