    Mesh allows users to connect accounts of financial institutions,

    crypto exchanges, and self-custody wallets. Mesh handles credential

    validation, MFA, and error handling for each integration. After

    an account is connected, Mesh allows client applications to read holdings,

    transaction history and balances and execute crypto transfers (with user
    approval).
