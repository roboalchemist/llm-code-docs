  title: Mesh Connect Integration API
  description: >-

    Mesh allows users to connect accounts of financial institutions,

    crypto exchanges, and self-custody wallets. Mesh handles credential

    validation, MFA, and error handling for each integration. After

    an account is connected, Mesh allows client applications to read holdings,

    transaction history and balances and execute crypto transfers (with user
    approval).

      Because of limitations of Binance API, initial loading of transaction
      history in Binance can take long time


      depending on the size of the portfolio.



      #### OkCoin:

      ### Integration-specific notes:



      #### Robinhood:



      Cryptocurrency transfers should be enabled in Robinhood settings.

       * `MfaCode` parameter is required to initiate a transaction in Robinhood.
       * The user's security settings should be configured to use an authenticator application.
       * Robinhood doesn't allow initiation of transactions if the authenticator application is not configured.


      #### Coinbase:



      `MfaCode` parameter should be used to initiate transactions in Coinbase.
       * If the end user's Coinbase account is configured to use text messages (SMS) for two factor authentication, the API will return `MfaRequired` status, and a text code will then be sent by Coinbase. The code is expected to be provided in the subsequent call using the `MfaCode` request field
       * If the account is configured to use an authenticator application, the API is expecting to get the code in the `MfaCode` request field.


      #### Kraken:



      Kraken requires the explicit chain name to be provided (e.g. `Dogecoin` or
      `Ethereum (ERC20)`). The list of possible chains can be obtained by
