| Error Code                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Level Found |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| NoEligibleNetworks              | None of the networks supported by Source and Target accounts can be used for the transfer. Individual reasons specifying why a particular network cannot be used may vary. | Holdings    |
| SymbolDoesNotMatch              | The symbol that was requested for the transfer is different from the holding’s symbol                                                                                      | Holdings    |
| NotSupportedForTransferByTarget | None of the networks for that token are eligible to transfer TO the source. This is often due to the **client** not supporting the token for transfer.                     | Holdings    |
| NotSupportedForTransferBySource | None of the networks for that token are eligible to transfer FROM the source. This is often due to **Mesh or the integration** not supporting the token for transfer.      | Holdings    |
| AmountNotSufficient             | The (amount to be transferred + the gas fee) is more than the available balance                                                                                            | Network     |
| NoTargetNetworkFound            | Target addresses/institution do not contain the corresponding network, so this network cannot be used for the transfer                                                     | Network     |
| GasFeeAssetBalanceNotEnough     | The amount of the asset is sufficient, but there’s not enough balance of the gas fee’s asset (e.g. not enough ETH to send USDC)                                            | Network     |
