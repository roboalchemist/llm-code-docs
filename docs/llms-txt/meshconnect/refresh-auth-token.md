# Refresh auth token

> Refresh auth token of the connected institution.
Some institutions do not require tokens to be refreshed.
            
The following institutions require custom flows:
            
WeBull: AuthToken should be provided along with the RefreshToken
            
Vanguard: security settings may activate MFA, requiring user action.
If MFA is triggered, a second refresh request should be sent.
Second request should contain MFA code and access token obtained from initial response

  title: Mesh Connect Integration API
  description: >-

    Mesh allows users to connect accounts of financial institutions,

    crypto exchanges, and self-custody wallets. Mesh handles credential

    validation, MFA, and error handling for each integration. After

    an account is connected, Mesh allows client applications to read holdings,

    transaction history and balances and execute crypto transfers (with user
    approval).

      ### Integration-specific notes:



      #### Binance:



      Because of limitations of Binance API, initial loading of transaction
      history in Binance can take long time


      depending on the size of the portfolio.



      #### OkCoin:



      Getting transactions history from OkCoin is not currently supported.
