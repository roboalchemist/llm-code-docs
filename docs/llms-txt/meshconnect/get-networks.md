# Get networks

> **Get supported networks list.**


---
Get the list of all networks supported by Mesh to perform transfers, including which tokens and integrations are supported.



The response always includes validation data:
- `addressPattern`: The regex pattern for validating addresses on this network
- `contractAddress`: For each token, the contract address (if applicable) to enable ERC20 contract address validation

  title: Mesh Connect Integration API
  description: >-

    Mesh allows users to connect accounts of financial institutions,

    crypto exchanges, and self-custody wallets. Mesh handles credential

    validation, MFA, and error handling for each integration. After

    an account is connected, Mesh allows client applications to read holdings,

    transaction history and balances and execute crypto transfers (with user
    approval).

      ### Integration-specific notes:



      #### Binance:



      Because of limitations of Binance API, initial loading of transaction
      history in Binance can take long time


      depending on the size of the portfolio.



      #### OkCoin:



      Getting transactions history from OkCoin is not currently supported.

      ### Integration-specific notes:



      #### Robinhood:



      Cryptocurrency transfers should be enabled in Robinhood settings.
      Transfers are disabled by default, enabling them for end users requires a
      review from Robinhood.


      Please note:
       * `MfaCode` parameter is required to initiate a transaction in Robinhood.
       * The user's security settings should be configured to use an authenticator application.
       * Robinhood doesn't allow initiation of transactions if the authenticator application is not configured.


      #### Coinbase:



      `MfaCode` parameter should be used to initiate transactions in Coinbase.
       * If the end user's Coinbase account is configured to use text messages (SMS) for two factor authentication, the API will return `MfaRequired` status, and a text code will then be sent by Coinbase. The code is expected to be provided in the subsequent call using the `MfaCode` request field
       * If the account is configured to use an authenticator application, the API is expecting to get the code in the `MfaCode` request field.


      #### Kraken:



      Kraken requires the explicit chain name to be provided (e.g. `Dogecoin` or
      `Ethereum (ERC20)`). The list of possible chains can be obtained by
      calling `symbol/details` endpoint.


      To initiate a transaction, a Kraken Address Key name should be provided in
      `TargetAddress` field. Target address should be added using Kraken UI,
      then its name should be used.



      #### Binance:



      `Enable Withdrawals` permission should be given to the user's API key to
      initiate transfers with Binance Us.


      Binance requires adding the IP address to the list of trusted IPs to be
      able to create API keys with transfer permission.
       * Please reach out to Front to get the static IP address. This address should be provided to the end user, and the user should be instructed to add it to the list of trusted IP addresses.
       * By default, the permission to enable withdrawals is turned off. If the end user's API key does not have the permission, asset transfers will not be available.


      #### KuCoin:



      KuCoin requires adding the IP address to the list of trusted IPs to be
      able to create API keys with transfer permission.


      `Fee` parameter should be used to initiate a transaction in KuCoin.

       * Please reach out to Front to get the static IP address. This address should be provided to the end user, and the user should be instructed to add it to the list of trusted IP addresses.
       * All currencies have their minimum `fee` and `amount` requirements. Please use `symbol/details` endpoint to get this data for a particular symbol.
       * KuCoin requires chain name to be provided for getting deposit address or initiating a cryptocurrency transfer. Some cryptocurrencies are supported over multiple chains. It's recommended to use `symbol/details` endpoint to get the list of supported chains and show it to the end user to select a target one.


      #### BinanceInternational:



      `Enable Withdrawals` permission should be given to the user's API key to
      initiate transfers with Binance International.
