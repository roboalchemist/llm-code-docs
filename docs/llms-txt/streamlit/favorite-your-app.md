# Favorite your app

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star (star) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

## Favoriting and unfavoriting your app

You can favorite your app:

1. From your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/), hover over your app.
   If your app is not yet favorited, a star outline (star_border) will appear on hover.
2. Click on the star (star_border) next to your app name to toggle its favorited status.
