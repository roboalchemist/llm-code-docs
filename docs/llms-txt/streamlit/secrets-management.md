# Secrets management

Storing unencrypted secrets in a git repository is a bad practice. For applications that require access to sensitive credentials, the recommended solution is to store those credentials outside the repository - such as using a credentials file not committed to the repository or passing them as environment variables.

Streamlit provides native file-based secrets management to easily store and securely access your secrets in your Streamlit app.

## How to use secrets management

### Develop locally and set up secrets

Streamlit provides two ways to set up secrets locally using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/latest) format:

1. In a **global secrets file** at `~/.streamlit/secrets.toml` for macOS/Linux or `%userprofile%/.streamlit/secrets.toml` for Windows:
   
   ```toml
   # Everything in this section will be available as an environment variable
   db_username = "Jane"
   db_password = "mypassword"

   # You can also add other sections if you like.
   # The contents of sections as shown below will not become environment variables,
   # but they'll be easily accessible from within Streamlit anyway as we show
   # later in this doc.
   [my_other_secrets]
   things_i_like = ["Streamlit", "Python"]
   ```

   If you use the global secrets file, you don't have to duplicate secrets across several project-level files if multiple Streamlit apps share the same secrets.

2. In a **per-project secrets file** at `$CWD/.streamlit/secrets.toml`, where `$CWD` is the folder you're running Streamlit from. If both a global secrets file and a per-project secrets file exist, secrets in the per-project file overwrite those defined in the global file.

   ```toml
   [db_credentials]
   username = "my_username"
   password = "my_password"
   ```

   Rather than passing each secret as attributes in a function, you can more compactly pass the section to achieve the same result. See the notional code below, which uses the secrets above:

   ```python
   # Verbose version
   my_db.connect(username=st.secrets.db_credentials.username, password=st.secrets.db_credentials.password)

   # Far more compact version!
   my_db.connect(**st.secrets.db_credentials)
   ```

### Use secrets in your app

Access your secrets by querying the `st.secrets` dict, or as environment variables. For example, if you enter the secrets from the section above, the code below shows you how to access them within your Streamlit app.

```python
import streamlit as st

# Everything is accessible via the st.secrets dict:
st.write("DB username:", st.secrets["db_username"])
st.write("DB password:", st.secrets["db_password"])

# And the root-level secrets are also accessible as environment variables:
import os

st.write(
    "Has environment variables been set:",
    os.environ["db_username"] == st.secrets["db_username"],
)
```

You can even compactly use TOML sections to pass multiple secrets as a single attribute. Consider the following secrets:

```toml
[db_credentials]
username = "my_username"
password = "my_password"
```

Rather than passing each secret as attributes in a function, you can more compactly pass the section to achieve the same result. See the notional code below, which uses the secrets above:

```python
# Verbose version
my_db.connect(username=st.secrets.db_credentials.username, password=st.secrets.db_credentials.password)

# Far more compact version!
my_db.connect(**st.secrets.db_credentials)
```

## Error handling

Here are some common errors you might encounter when using secrets management.

- If a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is created while the app is running, the server needs to be restarted for changes to be reflected in the app.
- If you try accessing a secret, but no `secrets.toml` file exists, Streamlit will raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception:

  ![Secrets management FileNotFoundError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/secrets-filenotfounderror.png)

- If you try accessing a secret that doesn't exist, Streamlit will raise a `KeyError` exception:

  ![Secrets management KeyError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/secrets-keyerror.png)
