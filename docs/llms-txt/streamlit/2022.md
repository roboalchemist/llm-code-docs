## Version 1.8.0

**Release date: March 24, 2022**

### Highlights

- 📊 Built-in charts (e.g., `st.line_chart`) get a brand-new look and parameters `x` and `y`. Check out our [blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/built-in-charts-get-a-new-look-and-parameters/) for more information.

### Notable Changes

- 🏃️ Functions cached with `st.experimental_memo` or `st.experimental_singleton` can now contain static `st` commands. This allows caching text, charts, dataframes, and more!
- 🐛 Design tweak to prevent jittering in sliders (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5612)
- 🐛 Bug fix: links in headers are red, not blue (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5609)
- 🐛 Bug fix: properly resize Plotly charts when exiting fullscreen (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5645)
- 🐝 Bug fix: don't accidentally trigger `st.balloons` and `st.snow` (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5401)

### Other Changes

- 🏚️ `st.time_input` allows for keyboard-only input (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5194)
- 📚 `st.memo` will warn the user when using `ttl` and `persist` keyword argument together (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5032)
- 🔖 `st.number_input` returns consistent type after rerun (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5359)
- 📽 `st.sidebar` UI fixes including a fix for scrollbars in Firefox browsers (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5157, https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/5324)
- 👩‍💻 Improvements to usage metrics to guide API development.
