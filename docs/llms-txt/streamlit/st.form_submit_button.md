# st.form_submit_button

Display a form submit button.

When this button is clicked, all widget values inside the form will be sent from the user's browser to your Streamlit server in a batch.

Every form must have at least one `st.form_submit_button`. An `st.form_submit_button` cannot exist outside of a form.

For more information about forms, check out our [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/forms).

## Arguments

- **label** (str): A short label explaining to the user what this button is for. This defaults to `"Submit"`. The label can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown of the following types: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Links, and Images. Images display like icons, with a max height equal to the font height.

  Unsupported Markdown elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g., `"1\. Not an ordered list"`.

  See the `body` parameter of [st.markdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.markdown) for additional, supported Markdown directives.

- **help** (str or None): A tooltip that gets displayed when the button is hovered over. If this is `None` (default), no tooltip is displayed.

  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the `body` parameter of `st.markdown`.

- **on_click** (callable): An optional callback invoked when this button is clicked.

- **args** (list or tuple): An optional list or tuple of args to pass to the callback.

- **kwargs** (dict): An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

- **key** (str or int): An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. No two widgets may have the same key.

- **type** ("primary", "secondary", or "tertiary"): An optional string that specifies the button type. This can be one of the following:

  - `"primary"`: The button's background is the app's primary color for additional emphasis.
  - `"secondary"` (default): The button's background coordinates with the app's background color for normal emphasis.
  - `"tertiary"`: The button is plain text without a border or background for subtlety.

- **icon** (str or None): An optional emoji or icon to display next to the button label. If `icon` is `None` (default), no icon is displayed. If `icon` is a string, the following options are valid:

  - A single-character emoji. For example, you can set `icon="🚨"` or `icon="🔥"`. Emoji short codes are not supported.
  - An icon from the Material Symbols library (rounded style) in the format `:material/icon_name:` where `icon_name` is the name of the icon in snake case.
  - `spinner`: Displays a spinner as an icon.

- **disabled** (bool): Whether to disable the button. If this is `False` (default), the user can interact with the button. If this is `True`, the button is grayed-out and can't be clicked.

  If the first `st.form_submit_button` in the form is disabled, the form will override submission behavior with `enter_to_submit=False`.

- **use_container_width** (bool): Whether to expand the button's width to fill its parent container. If `use_container_width` is `False` (default), Streamlit sizes the button to fit its contents. If `use_container_width` is `True`, the width of the button matches its parent container.

  In both cases, if the contents of the button are wider than the parent container, the contents will line wrap.

- **width** ("content", "stretch", or int): The width of the button. This can be one of the following:

  - `"content"` (default): The width of the button matches the width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent container.
  - `"stretch"`: The width of the button matches the width of the parent container.
  - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The button has a fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of the parent container, the width of the button matches the width of the parent container.

- **shortcut** (str or None): An optional keyboard shortcut that triggers the button. This can be one of the following strings:

  - A single alphanumeric key like `"K"` or `"4"`.
  - A function key like `"F11"`.
  - A special key like `"Enter"`, `"Esc"`, or `"Tab"`.
  - Any of the above combined with modifiers. For example, you can use `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+Shift+O`.

  Important: The keys `"C"` and `"R"` are reserved and can't be used, even with modifiers. Punctuation keys like `"."` and `","` aren't currently supported.

  For a list of supported keys and modifiers, see the documentation for [st.button](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.button).

## Returns

- **bool**: True if the button was clicked.
