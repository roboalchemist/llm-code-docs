# 2025 release notes

This page contains release notes for Streamlit versions released in 2025. For the latest version of Streamlit, see [Release notes](/develop/quick-reference/release-notes).

## Version 1.52.0

**Release date: December 3, 2025**

### Highlights

- 📧 Introducing custom [light and dark theme](/develop/api-reference/configuration/theming) configuration options!
- 📈 Announcing [reusable themes](/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#theme)!

### Notable Changes

- 🔕 To prevent widgets from resetting when you change a parameter, widgets are transitioning to an identity based only on their keys (if provided). The following widgets use only their key for their identity:
  - st.button
  - st.download_button
  - st.form_submit_button
  - st.checkbox
  - st.toggle
  - st.text_area
  - st.text_input
  - st.number_input
  - st.time_input
  - st.date_input
  - st.selectbox
  - st.multiselect

- 🛠️ You can set the width of most Streamlit elements.

- 🛠️ Font face declarations in [config.toml](/develop/api-reference/configuration/config.toml#theme) support weight and unicode ranges.

- 📚 You can configure a list of allowed origins when CORS protection is enabled.

- 📊 You can configure the width of the table cell to show the column type and button label.
