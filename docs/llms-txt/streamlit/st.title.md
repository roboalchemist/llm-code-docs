# st.title

Display text in title formatting.

Each document should have a single `st.title()`, although this is not enforced.

## Function signature

```jsx
st.title(body, anchor=None, *, help=None, width="stretch", text_alignment="left")
```

## Parameters

- **body** (str): The text to display as GitHub-flavored Markdown. Syntax information can be found at: [https://github.github.com/gfm](https://github.github.com/gfm).
  See the `body` parameter of [st.markdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.markdown) for additional, supported Markdown directives.
- **anchor** (str or False): The anchor name of the header that can be accessed with `#anchor` in the URL. If omitted, it generates an anchor using the body. If `False`, the anchor is not shown in the UI.
- **help** (str or None): A tooltip that gets displayed next to the title. If this is `None` (default), no tooltip is displayed.
  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the `body` parameter of `st.markdown`.
- **width** ("stretch", "content", or int): The width of the title element. This can be one of the following:
  - `"stretch"` (default): The width of the element matches the width of the parent container.
  - `"content"`: The width of the element matches the width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent container.
  - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of the parent container, the width of the element matches the width of the parent container.
- **text_alignment** ("left", "center", "right", or "justify"): The horizontal alignment of the text within the element. This can be one of the following:
  - `"left"` (default): Text is aligned to the left edge.
  - `"center"`: Text is centered.
  - `"right"`: Text is aligned to the right edge.
  - `"justify"`: Text is justified (stretched to fill the available width with the last line left-aligned).

  **Note**: For text alignment to have a visible effect, the element's width must be wider than its content. If you use `width="content"` with short text, the alignment may not be noticeable.

## Examples

```jsx
import streamlit as st

st.title("This is a title")
