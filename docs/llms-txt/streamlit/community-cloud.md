# Use Community Cloud to develop with GitHub Codespaces

To use GitHub Codespaces for Streamlit development, you need a properly configured `devcontainer.json` file to set up the environment. Fortunately, Streamlit Community Cloud is here to help! Although Community Cloud is primarily used to deploy and share apps with the rest of the world, we've built in some handy features to make it easy to use GitHub Codespaces. This guide explains how to create a Community Cloud account and use an automated workflow to get you into a GitHub codespace and live-editing a Streamlit app. All this happens right in your browser, no installation required.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a GitHub account.

## Sign up for Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/). At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (more_horiz) for your codespace.
2. If you want to return to your work later, click "Stop codespace". Otherwise, click "Delete".
3. Congratulations! You just deployed an app to Streamlit Community Cloud. 🎉 Return to your workspace at [share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/) and deploy another Streamlit app.

## Learn Streamlit fundamentals

If you haven't learned Streamlit's basic concepts yet, this is a great time to go to [Fundamentals](/get-started/fundamentals). Use your codespace to walk through and try basic Streamlit commands. When finished, come back here to learn how to clean up your codespace.

## Stop or delete your codespace

When you stop interacting with your codespace, GitHub will generally stop your codespace for you. However, the surest way to avoid undesired use of your capacity is to stop or delete your codespace when you are done.

1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (more_horiz) for your codespace.
2. If you want to return to your work later, click "Stop codespace". Otherwise, click "Delete".
3. If you want to return to your work later, click "Stop codespace". Otherwise, click "Delete".
