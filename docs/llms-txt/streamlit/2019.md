# 2019 release notes

This page contains release notes for Streamlit versions released in 2019. For the latest version of Streamlit, see [Release notes](/develop/quick-reference/release-notes).

## Version 0.52.0

**Release date: December 20, 2019**

### Highlights

- 📤 Preview release of the file uploader widget. To try it out just call `st.file_uploader`!
  - Note that as a preview release, things may change in the near future. Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the API!
- 👋 Support for [emoji codes](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) in `st.write` and `st.markdown`. Try it out with `st.write(“Hello :wave:”)`.

### Breaking changes

- 🛹 `st.pyplot` now clears figures by default, since that's what you want 99% of the time. This allows you to create two or more Matplotlib charts without having to call `pyplot.clf` every time. If you want to turn this behavior off, use `st.pyplot(clear_figure=False)`.
- 📣 `st.cache` no longer checks for input mutations. This is the first change of our ongoing effort to simplify the caching system and prepare Streamlit for the launch of other caching primitives like Session State!

## Version 0.51.0

**Release date: November 30, 2019**

### Highlights

- 🐕 You can now tweak the behavior of the file watcher with the config option `server.fileWatcherType`. Use it to switch between:
  - `auto` (default): Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available.
  - `watchdog`: Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module.
  - `poll`: Force Streamlit to always use polling.
  - `none`: Streamlit will not watch files.
- 📣 We now cache JS files in your browser for faster loading.
- 📲 Use `server.baseUrlPath` config option to set Streamlit's URL to something like `http://domain.com/customPath`.

### Notable bug fixes

- Fixes numerous Windows bugs, including [Issues #339](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/399) and [Issues #401](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/301).
- Fixes loading of root URL `/` on Windows.
- 🚀 Lightning fast `st.image`, ability to choose between JPEG and PNG compression, and between RGB and BGR (for OpenCV).
- 💡 Smarter API for `st.slider`, `st.selectbox`, and `st.radio`.
- 🎥 Improved handling of widget state when Python file is modified.
- 🙌 Improved HTML support in `st.write` and `st.markdown`. HTML is still unsafe, though!

### Breaking change

- 🛡️ We have temporarily disabled support for sharing static "snapshots" of Streamlit apps. Now that we're no longer in a limited-access beta, we need to make sure sharing is well thought through and abides by laws like the DMCA. But we're working on a solution!
