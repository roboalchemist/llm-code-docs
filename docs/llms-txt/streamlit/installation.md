# Install Streamlit

There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit. Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most common scenario.

## Option 1: I like the command line

Install Streamlit on your own machine using tools like `venv` and `pip`.

## Option 2: I prefer a graphical interface

Install Streamlit using the Anaconda Distribution graphical user interface. This is also the best approach if you're on Windows or don't have Python set up.

## Create an app in the cloud

### Option 1: I want a free cloud environment

Use Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub Codespaces so you don't have to go through the trouble of installing Python and setting up an environment.

### Option 2: I need something secure, controlled, and in the cloud

Use Streamlit in Snowflake to code your apps in the cloud, right alongside your data with role-based access controls.
