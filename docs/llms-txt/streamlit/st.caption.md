# st.caption

Display text in small font.

This should be used for captions, asides, footnotes, sidenotes, and other explanatory text.

## Function signature

```jsx
st.caption(body, unsafe_allow_html=False, *, help=None, width="stretch", text_alignment="left")
```

## Parameters

- **body** (str): The text to display as GitHub-flavored Markdown. Syntax information can be found at: [https://github.github.com/gfm](https://github.github.com/gfm).

  See the `body` parameter of [st.markdown](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.markdown) for additional, supported Markdown directives.

- **unsafe_allow_html** (bool): Whether to render HTML within `body`. If this is `False` (default), any HTML tags found in `body` will be escaped and therefore treated as raw text. If this is `True`, any HTML expressions within `body` will be rendered.

  Adding custom HTML to your app impacts safety, styling, and maintainability.

  **Note**: If you only want to insert HTML or CSS without Markdown text, we recommend using `st.html` instead.

- **help** (str or None): A tooltip that gets displayed next to the caption. If this is `None` (default), no tooltip is displayed.

  The tooltip can optionally contain GitHub-flavored Markdown, including the Markdown directives described in the `body` parameter of `st.markdown`.

- **width** ("stretch", "content", or int): The width of the caption element. This can be one of the following:

  - `stretch` (default): The width of the element matches the width of the parent container.
  - `content`: The width of the element matches the width of its content, but doesn't exceed the width of the parent container.
  - An integer specifying the width in pixels: The element has a fixed width. If the specified width is greater than the width of the parent container, the width of the element matches the width of the parent container.

- **text_alignment** ("left", "center", "right", or "justify"): The horizontal alignment of the text within the element. This can be one of the following:

  - `left` (default): Text is aligned to the left edge.
  - `center`: Text is centered.
  - `right`: Text is aligned to the right edge.
  - `justify`: Text is justified (stretched to fill the available width with the last line left-aligned).

  **Note**: For text alignment to have a visible effect, the element's width must be wider than its content. If you use `width="content"` with short text, the alignment may not be noticeable.

## Examples

```jsx
import streamlit as st

st.caption("This is a string that explains something above.")
st.caption("A caption with _italics_ :blue[colors] and emojis :sunglasses:")
