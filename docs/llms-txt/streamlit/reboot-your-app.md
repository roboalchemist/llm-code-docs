# Reboot your app

If you need to clear your app's memory or force a fresh build after modifying a file that Streamlit Community Cloud doesn't monitor, you may need to reboot your app. This will interrupt any user who may currently be using your app and may take a few minutes for your app to redeploy. Anyone visiting your app will see "Your app is in the oven" during a reboot.

Rebooting your app on Community Cloud is easy! You can reboot your app:

1. From your workspace at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/), click the overflow icon (more_vert) next to your app. Click "Reboot".
2. A confirmation will display. Click "Reboot".
