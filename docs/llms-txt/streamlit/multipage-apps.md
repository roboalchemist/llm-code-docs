# Multipage apps

## Overview

Streamlit provides multiple ways to define multipage apps. Understand the terminology and basic comparison between methods.

## Define multipage apps with `st.Page` and `st.navigation`

Learn about the preferred method for defining multipage apps. `st.Page` and `st.navigation` give you flexibility to organize your project directory and label your pages as you please.

## Creating multipage apps using the `pages/` directory

Define your multipage apps through directory structure. Place additional Python files in a `pages/` directory alongside your entrypoint file and pages are automatically shown in a navigation widget inside your app's sidebar.

## Working with widgets in multipage apps

Understand how widget identity is tied to pages. Learn strategies to get the behavior you want out of widgets.
