# Prep and deploy your app on Community Cloud

Streamlit Community Cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will be deployed in only a few minutes. If you don't have an app ready to deploy, you can fork or clone one from our [App gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery)—you can find apps for machine learning, data visualization, data exploration, A/B testing, and more. You can also [Deploy an app from a template](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/deploy-from-a-template). After you've deployed your app, check out how you can [Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces](/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/manage-your-app/edit-your-app#edit-your-app-with-github-codespaces).

When your app has everything it needs, deploying is easy. Just go to your workspace and click "Create app" in the upper-right corner. Follow the prompts to fill in your app's information, and then click "Deploy".
