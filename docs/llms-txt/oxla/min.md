# MIN

## Overview

`MIN()` is a function that returns the minimum value from a set of records.

## Syntax

The syntax for this function is as follows:

```sql  theme={null}
MIN(column_name)
```

This function's output data type will always be the same as the input one, however it returns `NULL` if there are no records or input consists of `NULL` values and it also returns `NaN` if the input contains a `NaN`.

## Examples

For the needs of this section, we will create a movies table that stores movie details, such as movie's title, category, and IMDb rating.

```sql  theme={null}
CREATE TABLE movies (
    movieid int,
    moviename text,
    moviecategory text,
    imdbrating real
);
INSERT INTO movies (movieid, moviename, moviecategory, imdbrating)
VALUES
(8557411, 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Drama', 9.4),
(8557421, 'Life Is Beautiful', 'Romance', 8.4),
(8557451, 'The Godfather', 'Crime', 9.3),
(8557311, 'Prisoners', 'Thriller', 8.5),
(8557321, 'Inception', 'Science Fiction', 9),
(8557351, 'The Dark Knight', 'Action', 9.2),
(8557221, 'Coco', 'Drama', 8.2),
(8557251, 'The Sixth Sense', 'Horror', 8.1),
(8557231, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', 'Action', 8.1),
(8557281, 'The Notebook', 'Romance', 7.8),
(8557291, 'Forrest Gump', 'Drama', 8);
```

```sql  theme={null}
SELECT * FROM movies;
```

By running the above query, we will get the following output:

```sql  theme={null}
+---------+--------------------------+-----------------+-------------+
| movieid | moviename                | moviecategory   | imdbrating  |
+---------+--------------------------+-----------------+-------------+
| 8557411 | The Shawshank Redemption | Drama           | 9.4         |
| 8557421 | Life Is Beautiful        | Romance         | 8.4         |
| 8557451 | The Godfather            | Crime           | 9.3         |
| 8557311 | Prisoners                | Thriller        | 8.5         |
| 8557321 | Inception                | Science Fiction | 9           |
| 8557351 | The Dark Knight          | Action          | 9.2         |
| 8557221 | Coco                     | Drama           | 8.2         |
| 8557251 | The Sixth Sense          | Horror          | 8.1         |
| 8557231 | Kill Bill: Vol. 1        | Action          | 8.1         |
| 8557281 | The Notebook             | Romance         | 7.8         |
| 8557291 | Forrest Gump             | Drama           | 8           |
+---------+--------------------------+-----------------+-------------+
```

### `MIN()` with a single expression

For example, you might want to know what is the lowest rating of all stored movies:

```sql  theme={null}
SELECT MIN(imdbRating) AS "Lowest Rating"
FROM movies;
```

```sql  theme={null}
+----------------+
| Lowest Rating  |
+----------------+
| 7.8            |
+----------------+
```

### `MIN()` with `GROUP BY` clause

In this example, we will use a `GROUP BY` clause to group the movie categories, then use `MIN()` function to get the lowest rating in each movie category and arrange the results in ascending order.

```sql  theme={null}
SELECT
  movieCategory AS "Movie Category",
  MIN(imdbRating) AS "Lowest Rating"
FROM movies
GROUP BY movieCategory
ORDER BY MIN(imdbRating) ASC;
```

By running the code above, we will get the following output:

```bash  theme={null}
 Movie Category  | Lowest Rating 
-----------------+---------------
 Romance         |           7.8
 Drama           |             8
 Horror          |           8.1
 Action          |           8.1
 Thriller        |           8.5
 Science Fiction |             9
 Crime           |           9.3
(7 rows)
```
