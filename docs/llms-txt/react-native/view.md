# View

The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](/docs/flexbox.md), [style](/docs/style.md), [some touch handling](/docs/handling-touches.md), and [accessibility](/docs/accessibility.md) controls. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.

This example creates a `View` that wraps two boxes with color and a text component in a row with padding.

note

`View`s are designed to be used with [`StyleSheet`](/docs/style.md) for clarity and performance, although inline styles are also supported.

### Synthetic Touch Events[​](#synthetic-touch-events "Direct link to Synthetic Touch Events")

For `View` responder props (e.g., `onResponderMove`), the synthetic touch event passed to them are in form of [PressEvent](/docs/pressevent.md).

| ------- | ------- |
| boolean | true    |

***

### `collapsableChildren`[​](#collapsablechildren "Direct link to collapsablechildren")

***

### `experimental_accessibilityOrder`[​](#experimental_accessibilityorder "Direct link to experimental_accessibilityorder")

Experimental 🧪

**This API is experimental.** Experimental APIs may contain bugs and are likely to change in a future version of React Native. Don't use them in production.

`experimental_accessibilityOrder` indicates the order in which an assistive technology focuses descendants of this `View`. This prop takes an array of strings where each string is a [`nativeID`](/docs/view.md#nativeid) of some descendant component whose order is being defined. This prop does not enable accessibility itself, each referenced component still needs to be accessible by setting [`accessible`](/docs/view.md#accessible) to true. This prop is both **nestable** and **exhaustive** meaning

* If `experimental_accessibilityOrder` contains a reference to some non-accessible component, it will focus the descendants of that component in the default order. Additionally, it can also contain a reference to other components that also have an `experimental_accessibilityOrder`.
* If some component that is otherwise accessible is not directly referenced in `experimental_accessibilityOrder`, or nested within some container directly referenced in `experimental_accessibilityOrder`, then it will not be accessible.

See the [accessibility guide](/docs/accessibility.md#experimental_accessibilityorder) for more information.

| Type             |
| ---------------- |
| array of strings |

***

### `focusable`Android[​](#focusable-android "Direct link to focusable-android")

***

### `hitSlop`[​](#hitslop "Direct link to hitslop")

This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view. Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least 30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels.

For example, if a touchable view has a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with `hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}`

note

The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds, and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| Type                                                                 |

warning

This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

***

### `importantForAccessibility`Android[​](#importantforaccessibility-android "Direct link to importantforaccessibility-android")

Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen. Works for Android only.

Possible values:

* `'auto'` - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
* `'yes'` - The view is important for accessibility.
* `'no'` - The view is not important for accessibility.
* `'no-hide-descendants'` - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.

See the [Android `importantForAccessibility` docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility) for reference.

| Type                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ |
| enum('auto', 'yes', 'no', 'no-hide-descendants') |

***

### `nativeID`[​](#nativeid "Direct link to nativeid")

Used to locate this view from native classes.

warning

This disables the 'layout-only view removal' optimization for this view!

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

***

### `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`[​](#needsoffscreenalphacompositing "Direct link to needsoffscreenalphacompositing")

Whether this `View` needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior. The default (`false`) falls back to drawing the component and its children with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value. This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the `View` you are setting an opacity on has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping `View`s, or text and a background).

Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default. If you do need to enable this property for an animation, consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view **contents** are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame). If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once, saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.

| ------------------------------------- |
| `({nativeEvent: PressEvent}) => void` |

***

### `pointerEvents`[​](#pointerevents "Direct link to pointerevents")

Controls whether the `View` can be the target of touch events.

* `'auto'`: The View can be the target of touch events.
* `'none'`: The View is never the target of touch events.
* `'box-none'`: The View is never the target of touch events but its subviews can be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

css

```
.box-none {
  pointer-events: none;
}
.box-none * {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
```

* `'box-only'`: The view can be the target of touch events but its subviews cannot be. It behaves like if the view had the following classes in CSS:

css

```
.box-only {
  pointer-events: auto;
}
.box-only * {
  pointer-events: none;

***

### `removeClippedSubviews`[​](#removeclippedsubviews "Direct link to removeclippedsubviews")

This is a reserved performance property exposed by `RCTView` and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews, most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound. The subviews must also have `overflow: hidden`, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

***

### `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`Android[​](#rendertohardwaretextureandroid-android "Direct link to rendertohardwaretextureandroid-android")

Whether this `View` should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.

On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale: in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can be re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.

| Type |
| ---- |
| bool |

### `shouldRasterizeIOS`iOS[​](#shouldrasterizeios-ios "Direct link to shouldrasterizeios-ios")

Whether this `View` should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.

On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children; for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view and quickly composite it during each frame.

Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory. Test and measure when using this property.
