# Text

A React component for displaying text.

`Text` supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.

In the following example, the nested title and body text will inherit the `fontFamily` from `styles.baseText`, but the title provides its own additional styles. The title and body will stack on top of each other on account of the literal newlines:

## Nested text[​](#nested-text "Direct link to Nested text")

Both Android and iOS allow you to display formatted text by annotating ranges of a string with specific formatting like bold or colored text (`NSAttributedString` on iOS, `SpannableString` on Android). In practice, this is very tedious. For React Native, we decided to use the web paradigm for this, where you can nest text to achieve the same effect.

Behind the scenes, React Native converts this to a flat `NSAttributedString` or `SpannableString` that contains the following information:

```
"I am bold and red"
0-9: bold
9-17: bold, red
```

## Containers[​](#containers "Direct link to Containers")

The `<Text>` element is unique relative to layout: everything inside is no longer using the Flexbox layout but using text layout. This means that elements inside of a `<Text>` are no longer rectangles, but wrap when they see the end of the line.

tsx

```
<Text>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</Text>
// Text container: the text will be inline, if the space allows it
// |First part and second part|

// otherwise, the text will flow as if it was one
// |First part |
// |and second |
// |part       |

<View>
  <Text>First part and </Text>
  <Text>second part</Text>
</View>
// View container: each text is its own block
// |First part and|
// |second part   |

// otherwise, the text will flow in its own block
// |First part |
// |and        |
// |second part|
```

## Limited Style Inheritance[​](#limited-style-inheritance "Direct link to Limited Style Inheritance")

On the web, the usual way to set a font family and size for the entire document is to take advantage of inherited CSS properties like so:

css

```
html {
  font-family:
    'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 11px;
  color: #141823;
}
```

All elements in the document will inherit this font unless they or one of their parents specifies a new rule.

In React Native, we are more strict about it: **you must wrap all the text nodes inside of a `<Text>` component**. You cannot have a text node directly under a `<View>`.

tsx

```
// BAD: will raise exception, can't have a text node as child of a <View>
<View>
  Some text
</View>

// GOOD
<View>
  <Text>
    Some text
  </Text>
</View>
```

You also lose the ability to set up a default font for an entire subtree. Meanwhile, `fontFamily` only accepts a single font name, which is different from `font-family` in CSS. The recommended way to use consistent fonts and sizes across your application is to create a component `MyAppText` that includes them and use this component across your app. You can also use this component to make more specific components like `MyAppHeaderText` for other kinds of text.

tsx

```
<View>
  <MyAppText>
    Text styled with the default font for the entire application
  </MyAppText>
  <MyAppHeaderText>Text styled as a header</MyAppHeaderText>
</View>
```

Assuming that `MyAppText` is a component that only renders out its children into a `Text` component with styling, then `MyAppHeaderText` can be defined as follows:

tsx

```
const MyAppHeaderText = ({children}) => {
  return (
    <MyAppText>
      <Text style={{fontSize: 20}}>{children}</Text>
    </MyAppText>
  );
};
```

Composing `MyAppText` in this way ensures that we get the styles from a top-level component, but leaves us the ability to add/override them in specific use cases.

React Native still has the concept of style inheritance, but limited to text subtrees. In this case, the second part will be both bold and red.

tsx

```
<Text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
  I am bold
  <Text style={{color: 'red'}}>and red</Text>
</Text>
```

We believe that this more constrained way to style text will yield better apps:

* (Developer) React components are designed with strong isolation in mind: You should be able to drop a component anywhere in your application, trusting that as long as the props are the same, it will look and behave the same way. Text properties that could inherit from outside of the props would break this isolation.

* (Implementor) The implementation of React Native is also simplified. We do not need to have a `fontFamily` field on every single element, and we do not need to potentially traverse the tree up to the root every time we display a text node. The style inheritance is only encoded inside of the native Text component and doesn't leak to other components or the system itself.

| string |

***

### `accessibilityLanguage`iOS[​](#accessibilitylanguage-ios "Direct link to accessibilitylanguage-ios")

A value indicating which language should be used by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. It should follow the [BCP 47 specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47).

See the [iOS `accessibilityLanguage` doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615192-accessibilitylanguage) for more information.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

***

### `accessibilityLabel`[​](#accessibilitylabel "Direct link to accessibilitylabel")

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

***

### `accessibilityRole`[​](#accessibilityrole "Direct link to accessibilityrole")

On iOS, these roles map to corresponding Accessibility Traits. Image button has the same functionality as if the trait was set to both 'image' and 'button'. See the [Accessibility guide](/docs/accessibility.md#accessibilitytraits-ios) for more information.

On Android, these roles have similar functionality on TalkBack as adding Accessibility Traits does on Voiceover in iOS

### `ellipsizeMode`[​](#ellipsizemode "Direct link to ellipsizemode")

When `numberOfLines` is set, this prop defines how the text will be truncated. `numberOfLines` must be set in conjunction with this prop.

This can be one of the following values:

* `head` - The line is displayed so that the end fits in the container and the missing text at the beginning of the line is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. e.g., "...wxyz"
* `middle` - The line is displayed so that the beginning and end fit in the container and the missing text in the middle is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. "ab...yz"
* `tail` - The line is displayed so that the beginning fits in the container and the missing text at the end of the line is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. e.g., "abcd..."
* `clip` - Lines are not drawn past the edge of the text container.

note

On Android, when `numberOfLines` is set to a value higher than `1`, only `tail` value will work correctly.

| Type                                           | Default |
