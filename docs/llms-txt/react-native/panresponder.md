# PanResponder

`PanResponder` reconciles several touches into a single gesture. It makes single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to recognize basic multi-touch gestures.

By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.

It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the [gesture responder system](/docs/gesture-responder-system.md). For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the native event object:

```
onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}
```

A native event is a synthetic touch event with form of [PressEvent](/docs/pressevent.md).

A `gestureState` object has the following:

* `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there's at least one touch on screen
* `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
* `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
* `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
* `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
* `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
* `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
* `vx` - current velocity of the gesture
* `vy` - current velocity of the gesture
* `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen

## Usage Pattern[​](#usage-pattern "Direct link to Usage Pattern")

tsx

```
const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const panResponder = React.useRef(
    PanResponder.create({
      // Ask to be the responder:
      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,

      onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows
        // what is happening!
        // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now
      },
      onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}
        // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is
        // gestureState.d{x,y}
      },
      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) =>
        true,
      onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The user has released all touches while this view is the
        // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded
      },
      onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture
        // should be cancelled
      },
      onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS
        // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.
        return true;
      },
    }),
  ).current;

  return <View {...panResponder.panHandlers} />;
};
```

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

`PanResponder` works with `Animated` API to help build complex gestures in the UI. The following example contains an animated `View` component which can be dragged freely across the screen

Try the [PanResponder example in RNTester](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/PanResponder/PanResponderExample.js).

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `create()`[​](#create "Direct link to create")

tsx

```
static create(config: PanResponderCallbacks): PanResponderInstance;
```

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| configRequired | object | Refer below |

The `config` object provides enhanced versions of all of the responder callbacks that provide not only the [`PressEvent`](/docs/pressevent.md), but also the `PanResponder` gesture state, by replacing the word `Responder` with `PanResponder` in each of the typical `onResponder*` callbacks. For example, the `config` object would look like:

* `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
* `onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`

In general, for events that have capture equivalents, we update the gestureState once in the capture phase and can use it in the bubble phase as well.

Be careful with `onStartShould*` callbacks. They only reflect updated `gestureState` for start/end events that bubble/capture to the Node. Once the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event being processed by the gesture and `gestureState` being updated accordingly. (numberActiveTouches) may not be totally accurate unless you are the responder.
