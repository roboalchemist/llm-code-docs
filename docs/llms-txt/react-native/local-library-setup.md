# Local libraries setup

A local library is a library containing views or modules that's local to your app and not published to a registry. This is different from the traditional setup for view and modules in the sense that a local library is decoupled from your app's native code.

The local library is created outside of the `android/` and `ios/` folders and makes use of autolinking to integrate with your app. The structure with a local library may look like this:

plaintext

```
MyApp
├── node_modules
├── modules <-- folder for your local libraries
│ └── awesome-module <-- your local library
├── android
├── ios
├── src
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

Since a local library's code exists outside of `android/` and `ios/` folders, it makes it easier to upgrade React Native versions in the future, copy to other projects etc.

To create local library we will use [create-react-native-library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/create). This tool contains all the necessary templates.

### Getting Started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")

Inside your React Native application's root folder, run the following command:

shell

```
npx create-react-native-library@latest awesome-module
```

Where `awesome-module` is the name you would like for the new module. After going through the prompts, you will have a new folder called `modules` in your project's root directory which contains the new module.

### Linking[​](#linking "Direct link to Linking")

By default, the generated library is automatically linked to the project using `link:` protocol when using Yarn and `file:` when using npm:

* npm
* Yarn

json

```
"dependencies": {
  "awesome-module": "file:./modules/awesome-module"
}
```

json

```
"dependencies": {
  "awesome-module": "link:./modules/awesome-module"
}
```

This creates a symlink to the library under `node_modules` which makes autolinking work.

### Installing dependencies[​](#installing-dependencies "Direct link to Installing dependencies")

To link the module you need to install dependencies:

* npm
* Yarn

shell

```
npm install
```

shell

```
yarn install
```

### Using module inside your app[​](#using-module-inside-your-app "Direct link to Using module inside your app")

To use the module inside your app, you can import it by its name:

js

```
import {multiply} from 'awesome-module';
```
