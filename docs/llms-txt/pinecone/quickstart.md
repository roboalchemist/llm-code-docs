# Quickstart

> Get started with Pinecone manually, with AI assistance, or with no-code tools.

This quickstart walks you through creating a Pinecone index and building a sample application for semantic search, recommendations, or RAG.

## Get set up

To get started, you'll need a Pinecone account and API key.

### 1. Create a Pinecone account

If you're new to Pinecone, sign up at [app.pinecone.io](https://app.pinecone.io) and choose a free plan:

* [Starter plan](https://pinecone.io/pricing/): Free access to most features, but you're limited to one cloud region and need to stay under Starter plan [limits](/reference/api/database-limits).

* [Standard plan trial](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/standard-trial): 21 days and \$300 in credits with access to Standard plan [features](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) and [higher limits](/reference/api/database-limits) that let you test Pinecone at scale.

<Note>
  If you're already on a Starter plan, you can activate a Standard plan trial at any time (one trial per organization).
</Note>

After signing up, you'll receive an API key in the console. Save this key. You'll need it to authenticate your requests to Pinecone.

### 2. Get a Pinecone API key

Create a new API key in the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/keys), or use the widget below to generate a key. If you don't have a Pinecone account, the widget will sign you up for the free [Starter plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/).

<div style={{minWidth: '450px', minHeight:'152px'}}>
  <div id="pinecone-connect-widget">
    <div class="connect-widget-skeleton">
      <div class="skeleton-content" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Your generated API key:

```shell  theme={null}
"{{YOUR_API_KEY}}"
```

## Build with Pinecone

Choose your approach to build with Pinecone below. Each approach achieves the same result—building a sample app for semantic search—but uses different tools and workflows.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Use [Pinecone's SDKs](/reference/pinecone-sdks) to manually create indexes, upsert data, and run queries.

    ### 1. Install an SDK

    Install the SDK for your preferred language:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Python theme={null}
      pip install pinecone
      ```

      ```shell JavaScript theme={null}
      npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone
      ```

      ```shell Java theme={null}
      # Maven
      <dependency>
        <groupId>io.pinecone</groupId>
        <artifactId>pinecone-client</artifactId>
        <version>5.0.0</version>
      </dependency>

      # Gradle
      implementation "io.pinecone:pinecone-client:5.0.0"
      ```

      ```shell Go theme={null}
      go get github.com/pinecone-io/go-pinecone/v4/pinecone
      ```

      ```shell C# theme={null}
      # .NET Core CLI
      dotnet add package Pinecone.Client 

      # NuGet CLI
      nuget install Pinecone.Client
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Tip>
      To get started in your browser, use the [Quickstart colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pinecone-io/examples/blob/master/docs/pinecone-quickstart.ipynb).
    </Tip>

    ### 2. Create an index

    In Pinecone, there are two types of indexes for storing vector data: [Dense indexes](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#dense-indexes) store <Tooltip tip="Each number in a dense vector is a point in a multidimensional space. Vectors that are closer together in that space are semantically similar.">dense vectors</Tooltip> for semantic search, and [sparse indexes](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#sparse-indexes) store <Tooltip tip="A sparse vector has a very large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion of values are non-zero. The dimensions represent words from a dictionary, and the values represent the importance of these words in the document.">sparse vectors</Tooltip> for lexical/keyword search.

    For this quickstart, [create a dense index](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-a-dense-index) that is integrated with an [embedding model hosted by Pinecone](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#embedding-models). With integrated models, you upsert and search with text and have Pinecone generate vectors automatically.

    <Note>
      If you prefer to use external embedding models, see [Bring your own vectors](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#bring-your-own-vectors).
    </Note>

    [Upsert](/guides/index-data/upsert-data) the sample dataset into a new [namespace](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#namespaces) in your index.

    Because your index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the textual statements and Pinecone converts them to dense vectors automatically.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      # Target the index
      dense_index = pc.Index(index_name)

      # Upsert the records into a namespace
      dense_index.upsert_records("example-namespace", records)
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
      // Target the index
      const index = pc.index(indexName).namespace("example-namespace");

      // Upsert the records into a namespace
      await index.upsertRecords(records);
      ```

      ```java Java theme={null}
      // Add to the Quickstart class:
      // Target the index
      Index index = new Index(config, connection, "quickstart-java");
      // Upsert the records into a namespace
      index.upsertRecords("example-namespace", upsertRecords);
      ```

      ```go Go theme={null}
      // Add to the main function:
      // Target the index
      idxModel, err := pc.DescribeIndex(ctx, indexName)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to describe index \"%v\": %v", indexName, err)
      }

      idxConnection, err := pc.Index(pinecone.NewIndexConnParams{Host: idxModel.Host, Namespace: "example-namespace"})
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to create IndexConnection for Host: %v: %v", idxModel.Host, err)
      }

      // Upsert the records into a namespace
      err = idxConnection.UpsertRecords(ctx, records)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to upsert vectors: %v", err)
      }
      ```

      ```csharp C# theme={null}
      // Upsert the records into a namespace
      await index.UpsertRecordsAsync(
          "example-namespace",
          records
      );
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Tip>
      To control costs when ingesting large datasets (10,000,000+ records), use [import](/guides/index-data/import-data) instead of upsert.
    </Tip>

    Pinecone is eventually consistent, so there can be a slight delay before new or changed records are visible to queries. You can [view index stats](/guides/index-data/check-data-freshness) to check if the current vector count matches the number of vectors you upserted (50):

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      # Wait for the upserted vectors to be indexed
      import time
      time.sleep(10)

      # View stats for the index
      stats = dense_index.describe_index_stats()
      print(stats)
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
      // Wait for the upserted vectors to be indexed
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));

      // View stats for the index
      const stats = await index.describeIndexStats();
      console.log(stats);
      ```

      ```java Java theme={null}
      // Add to the Quickstart class:
      // Wait for upserted vectors to be indexed
      Thread.sleep(5000);

      // View stats for the index
      DescribeIndexStatsResponse indexStatsResponse = index.describeIndexStats();
      System.out.println(indexStatsResponse);
      ```

      ```go Go theme={null}
      // Add to the main function:
      // View stats for the index
      stats, err := idxConnection.DescribeIndexStats(ctx)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to describe index \"%v\": %v", indexName, err)
      } else {
          fmt.Printf("%+v", prettifyStruct(*stats))
      }
      ```

      ```csharp C# theme={null}
      var indexStatsResponse = await index.DescribeIndexStatsAsync(new DescribeIndexStatsRequest());

      Console.WriteLine(indexStatsResponse);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The response looks like this:

    ### 4. Semantic search

    [Search the dense index](/guides/search/semantic-search) for ten records that are most semantically similar to the query, "Famous historical structures and monuments".

    Again, because your index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the query as text and Pinecone converts the text to a dense vector automatically.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      # Define the query
      query = "Famous historical structures and monuments"

      # Search the dense index
      results = dense_index.search(
          namespace="example-namespace",
          query={
              "top_k": 10,
              "inputs": {
                  'text': query
              }
          }
      )

      # Print the results
      for hit in results['result']['hits']:
              print(f"id: {hit['_id']:<5} | score: {round(hit['_score'], 2):<5} | category: {hit['fields']['category']:<10} | text: {hit['fields']['chunk_text']:<50}")
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
      // Define the query
      const query = 'Famous historical structures and monuments';

      // Search the dense index
      const results = await index.searchRecords({
        query: {
          topK: 10,
          inputs: { text: query },
        },
      });

      // Print the results
      results.result.hits.forEach(hit => {
        console.log(`id: ${hit.id}, score: ${hit.score.toFixed(2)}, category: ${hit.fields.category}, text: ${hit.fields.chunk_text}`);
      });
      ```

      ```java Java theme={null}
      // Add to the Quickstart class:
      // Define the query
      String query = "Famous historical structures and monuments";
      List<String> fields = new ArrayList<>();
      fields.add("category");
      fields.add("chunk_text");

      // Search the dense index
      SearchRecordsResponse recordsResponse = index.searchRecordsByText(query,  "example-namespace", fields, 10, null, null);

      // Print the results
      System.out.println(recordsResponse);
      ```

      ```go Go theme={null}
      // Add to the main function:
      // Define the query
      query := "Famous historical structures and monuments"

      // Search the dense index
      res, err := idxConnection.SearchRecords(ctx, &pinecone.SearchRecordsRequest{
          Query: pinecone.SearchRecordsQuery{
              TopK: 10,
              Inputs: &map[string]interface{}{
                  "text": query,
              },
          },
      })
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to search records: %v", err)
      }
      fmt.Printf(prettifyStruct(res))
      ```

      ```csharp C# theme={null}
      // Search the dense index
      var response = await index.SearchRecordsAsync(
          "example-namespace",
          new SearchRecordsRequest
          {
              Query = new SearchRecordsRequestQuery
              {
                  TopK = 10,
                  Inputs = new Dictionary<string, object?> { { "text", "Famous historical structures and monuments" } },
              },
              Fields = ["category", "chunk_text"],
          }
      );

      Console.WriteLine(response);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Notice that most of the results are about historical structures and monuments. However, a few unrelated statements are included as well and are ranked high in the list, for example, a statement about Shakespeare.

    ### 5. Rerank results

    To get a more accurate ranking, search again but this time [rerank the initial results](/guides/search/rerank-results) based on their relevance to the query.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python {10-14} theme={null}
      # Search the dense index and rerank results
      reranked_results = dense_index.search(

              "inputs": {
                  'text': query
              }
          },
          rerank={

              "top_n": 10,
              "rank_fields": ["chunk_text"]
          }   
      )

      # Print the reranked results
      for hit in reranked_results['result']['hits']:
          print(f"id: {hit['_id']}, score: {round(hit['_score'], 2)}, text: {hit['fields']['chunk_text']}, category: {hit['fields']['category']}")
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript {7-11} theme={null}
      // Search the dense index and rerank results
      const rerankedResults = await index.searchRecords({
        query: {

        rerank: {

          topN: 10,
          rankFields: ['chunk_text'],
        },
      });

      // Print the reranked results
      rerankedResults.result.hits.forEach(hit => {
        console.log(`id: ${hit.id}, score: ${hit.score.toFixed(2)}, text: ${hit.fields.chunk_text}, category: ${hit.fields.category}`);

          log.Fatalf("Failed to search records: %v", err)
      }
      fmt.Printf(prettifyStruct(resReranked))
      ```

      ```csharp C# {12-17} theme={null}

                  Inputs = new Dictionary<string, object?> { { "text", "Famous historical structures and monuments" } },
              },
              Fields = ["category", "chunk_text"],
              Rerank = new SearchRecordsRequestRerank
              {

          }
      );

      Console.WriteLine(responseReranked);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Notice that all of the most relevant results about historical structures and monuments are now ranked highest.

    ### 6. Improve results

    [Reranking results](/guides/search/rerank-results) is one of the most effective ways to improve search accuracy and relevance, but there are many other techniques to consider. For example:

    * [Filtering by metadata](/guides/search/filter-by-metadata): When records contain additional metadata, you can limit the search to records matching a [filter expression](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#metadata-filter-expressions).

    * [Hybrid search](/guides/search/hybrid-search): You can add [lexical search](/guides/search/lexical-search) to capture precise keyword matches (e.g., product SKUs, email addresses, domain-specific terms) in addition to semantic matches.

    * [Chunking strategies](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/): You can chunk your content in different ways to get better results. Consider factors like the length of the content, the complexity of queries, and how results will be used in your application.

    ### 7. Clean up

    When you no longer need your example index, delete it as follows:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      # Delete the index
      pc.delete_index(index_name)
      ```

      ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
      // Delete the index
      await pc.deleteIndex(indexName);
      ```

      ```java Java theme={null}
      // Add to the Quickstart class:
      // Delete the index
      pc.deleteIndex(indexName);
      ```

      ```go Go theme={null}
      // Add to the main function:
      // Delete the index
      err = pc.DeleteIndex(ctx, indexName)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to delete index: %v", err)
      } else {
          fmt.Println("Index \"%v\" deleted successfully", indexName)
      }
      ```

      ```csharp C# theme={null}
      // Delete the index
      await pinecone.DeleteIndexAsync(indexName);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Tip>
      For production indexes, consider [enabling deletion protection](/guides/manage-data/manage-indexes#configure-deletion-protection).

        onMouseOut={(e) => (e.currentTarget.style.background = "var(--brand-blue)")}
      >
        <span
          style={{

      letterSpacing: 0.4,
    }}
        >
          Download AGENTS.md and launch in Cursor
        </span>
      </a>
    </div>

    This opens Cursor and enters this prompt:

    ```text  theme={null}
    First, download and run this remote script: 

    curl -sSL https://docs.pinecone.io/install-agent-reference | sh 

    Then, help me get started with Pinecone.
    ```

    <Note>
      To see the contents of the install script, use a web browser to visit this URL: [https://docs.pinecone.io/install-agent-reference](https://docs.pinecone.io/install-agent-reference).
    </Note>

    When you run this prompt:

    1. Cursor executes a remote script that downloads Pinecone agent reference files, extracts them into an `.agents` folder, and creates an `AGENTS.md` file. These files provide Cursor with context it can use to help you get started with Pinecone.

    2. Then, Cursor helps you build a sample app of your choice (quick test, semantic search, RAG, or recommendations) in the programming language of your choice.

    ### Next steps

    After building some sample apps, use the `AGENTS.md` file to continue building with Pinecone, planning and implementing code for your own use cases.

  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    Use [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) to build a Pinecone application with current best practices. Instead of copying code snippets, work with an agent that understands Pinecone APIs and implements production-ready patterns automatically.

    <Note>
      Because this quickstart relies on AI, the exact implementation may vary each time.
    </Note>

    <Tip>
      If you don't have Claude Code installed, see the [Claude Code quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart).
    </Tip>

    ### 1. Set your API key

    Set the `PINECONE_API_KEY` environment variable before installing the plugin and activating Claude Code:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    export PINECONE_API_KEY="{{YOUR_API_KEY}}"
    ```

    ### 2. Install the Pinecone plugin for Claude Code

    The Pinecone plugin provides Claude Code with up-to-date Pinecone API references and best practices. Install it using one of these methods:

    1. From your terminal, run:

       ```shell  theme={null}
       claude plugin install pinecone
       ```

    2. Or, from within Claude Code, run:

       ```text  theme={null}
       /plugin install pinecone
       ```

    <Tip>
      For more information about Pinecone's Claude Code plugin, see its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-claude-code-plugin).
    </Tip>

    ### 3. Run the quickstart command

    To use the plugin to work through Pinecone's quickstart, start Claude Code and run this command:

    ```text  theme={null}
    /pinecone:quickstart
    ```

    This command does the following things:

    * Downloads and configures an [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-agents-ref) file that provides Claude Code with up-to-date Pinecone API information and best practices.
    * Guides you through setting up Pinecone using the [Pinecone CLI](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/cli/overview) and [Pinecone MCP server](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/operations/mcp-server).
    * Generates sample code to demonstrate various Pinecone use cases (quick start, semantic search, RAG, or recommendations).

    Once complete, you can use the configured `AGENTS.md` files, MCP server, and CLI to build your application. The plugin also includes other slash commands, such as `/pinecone:query`, for interactively querying your indexes.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="n8n">
    Use [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/) to create a workflow that downloads files via HTTP and lets you chat with them using Pinecone Database and OpenAI.

    <Tip>
      If you're not interested in chunking and embedding your own data or figuring out which search method to use, [use n8n with Pinecone Assistant](/guides/assistant/quickstart/n8n-quickstart) instead.
    </Tip>

    ### 1. Get an OpenAI API key

    Create a new API key in the [OpenAI console](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

    ### 2. Create an index

    [Create an index](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/create-index/serverless) in the Pinecone console:

    * Name your index `n8n-dense-index`
    * Under **Configuration**, check **Custom settings** and set **Dimension** to 1536.
    * Leave everything else as default.

    ### 3. Set up n8n

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a new workflow">
        In your n8n account, [create a new workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/create/).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Import a workflow template">
        Copy this workflow template URL:

        ```shell  theme={null}
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinecone-io/n8n-templates/refs/heads/main/database-quickstart/database-quickstart.json
        ```

        Paste the URL into the workflow editor and then click **Import** to add the workflow.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add credentials to the workflow">
        * Add your Pinecone credentials:
          * In the **Pinecone Vector Store** node, select **Credential to connect with** > **Create new credential** and paste in your Pinecone API key.
          * Name the credential **Pinecone** so that other nodes reference it.

        * Add your OpenAI credentials:
          * In the **OpenAI Chat Model**, select **Credential to connect with** > **Create new credential** and paste in your OpenAI API key.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Activate the workflow">
        The workflow is configured to download recent Pinecone release notes and upload them to your Pinecone index. Click **Execute workflow** to start the workflow.

        <Tip>
          You can add your own files to the workflow by changing the URLs in the **Set file urls** node.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### 4. Chat with your docs

    Once the workflow is activated, ask it for the latest changes to Pinecone Database:

    ```
    What's new in Pinecone Database?
    ```

    ### Next steps

    * Use your own data:
      * Change the urls in **Set file urls** node to use your own files.
      * You may need to adjust the chunk sizes in the **Recursive Character Text Splitter** node or use a different chunking strategy. You want chunks that are big enough to contain meaningful information but not so big that the meaning is diluted or it can't fit within the context window of the embedding model. See [Chunking Strategies for LLM Applications](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) for more info.
      * Customize the system message of the **AI Agent** node to reflect what the **Pinecone Vector Store Tool** will be used for. Be sure to include info on what data can be retrieved using that tool.
      * Customize the description of the **Pinecone Vector Store Tool** to reflect what data you are storing in the Pinecone index.
    * Use n8n, Pinecone Assistant, and OpenAI to [chat with your Google Drive documents](https://n8n.io/workflows/9942-rag-powered-document-chat-with-google-drive-openai-and-pinecone-assistant/).
    * Get help in the [Pinecone Discord community](https://discord.gg/tJ8V62S3sH).
