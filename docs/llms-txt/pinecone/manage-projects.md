# Manage projects

> View, rename, and delete projects in your organization.

This page shows you how to view project details, rename a project, and delete a project.

<Note>
  You must be an [organization owner](/guides/assistant/admin/organizations-overview#organization-roles) or [project owner](/guides/assistant/admin/projects-overview#project-roles) to edit project details or delete a project.
</Note>

## View project details

You can view the details of a project, as in the following example:

<Note>
  An [access token](/guides/assistant/admin/manage-organization-service-accounts#retrieve-an-access-token) must be provided to complete this action through the Admin API. The Admin API is in [public preview](/assistant-release-notes/feature-availability).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  PINECONE_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  PROJECT_ID="32c8235a-5220-4a80-a9f1-69c24109e6f2"

  curl -X GET "https://api.pinecone.io/admin/projects/$PROJECT_ID" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $PINECONE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       -H "X-Pinecone-Api-Version: 2025-04" \
       -H "accept: application/json"
  ```

  ```bash CLI theme={null}
  PROJECT_ID="32c8235a-5220-4a80-a9f1-69c24109e6f2"

  # Target the organization that contains the project.
  pc target -o "example-org" 
  # Fetch the project details.
  pc project describe -i $PROJECT_ID
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The example returns a response like the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json curl theme={null}
  {
    "id": "32c8235a-5220-4a80-a9f1-69c24109e6f2",
    "name": "example-project",
    "max_pods": 5,
    "force_encryption_with_cmek": false,
    "organization_id": "-NM7af6f234168c4e44a",
    "created_at": "2025-10-27T23:27:46.370088Z"
  }
  ```

  ```text CLI theme={null}
