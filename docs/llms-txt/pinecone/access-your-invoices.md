# Access your invoices

> View and download billing invoices from Pinecone.

You can access your billing history and invoices in the Pinecone console:

1. Go to [**Settings > Billing > Overview**](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/billing).
2. Scroll down to the **Payment history and invoices** section.
3. For each billing period, you can download the invoice by clicking the **Download** button.

Each invoice includes line items for the services used during the billing period. If the total cost of that usage is below the monthly minimum, the invoice also includes a line item covering the rest of the minimum usage commitment.
