## SDK versions

SDK versions are pinned to specific [API versions](/reference/api/versioning). When a new API version is released, a new version of the SDK is also released.

The mappings between API versions and SDK versions are as follows:

|                                     | `2025-04` | `2025-01` | `2024-10` | `2024-07`     | `2024-04` |
| ----------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :-------- |
| [Python SDK](/reference/python-sdk) | v7.x      | v6.x      | v5.3.x    | v5.0.x-v5.2.x | v4.x      |
| [Node.js SDK](/reference/node-sdk)  | v6.x      | v5.x      | v4.x      | v3.x          | v2.x      |
| [Java SDK](/reference/java-sdk)     | v5.x      | v4.x      | v3.x      | v2.x          | v1.x      |
| [Go SDK](/reference/go-sdk)         | v4.x      | v3.x      | v2.x      | v1.x          | v0.x      |
| [.NET SDK](/reference/dotnet-sdk)   | v4.x      | v3.x      | v2.x      | v1.x          | v0.x      |

When a new stable API version is released, you should upgrade your SDK to the latest version to ensure compatibility with the latest API changes.

<Note>
  SDK versions are not available for the current release candidate API (`2025-10`).
</Note>

## Limitations

While Pinecone tracks read unit usage with decimal precision, the Pinecone API and SDKs round these values up to the nearest whole number in query, fetch, and list responses. For example, if a query uses 0.45 read units, the API and SDKs will report it as 1 read unit.

For precise read unit reporting, see [index-level metrics](/guides/production/monitoring) or the organization-wide [Usage dashboard](/guides/manage-cost/monitor-usage-and-costs#monitor-organization-level-usage-and-costs).
