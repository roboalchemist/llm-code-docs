[Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com) provides cutting-edge embedding and rerankers. Voyage AI's generalist [embedding models](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings) continually top the [MTEB leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard), and the [domain-specific embeddings](https://blog.voyageai.com/2024/01/23/voyage-code-2-elevate-your-code-retrieval/) enhance the retrieval quality for enterprise use cases significantly.

<PrimarySecondaryCTA secondaryHref={"#setup-guide"} secondaryLabel={"View setup guide"} />

## Setup guide

In this guide, we use the [Voyage Embedding API endpoint](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings) to generate text embeddings for terms of service and consumer contract documents, and then index those embeddings in the Pinecone vector database.

This is a powerful and common combination for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic search, question-answering, code assistants, and other applications that rely on NLP and search over a large corpus of text data.

### 1. Set up the environment

Start by installing the Voyage and Pinecone clients and HuggingFace *Datasets* for downloading the *LegalBench: Consumer Contracts QA* ([`mteb/legalbench_consumer_contracts_qa`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/legalbench_consumer_contracts_qa)) dataset used in this guide:

```shell Shell theme={null}
pip install -U voyageai pinecone[grpc] datasets
```

### 2. Create embeddings

Sign up for an API key at [Voyage AI](https://dash.voyageai.com) and then use it to initialize your connection.

```Python Python theme={null}
import voyageai

vc = voyageai.Client(api_key="<YOUR_VOYAGE_API_KEY>")
```

Load the *LegalBench: Consumer Contracts QA*  dataset, which contains 154 consumer contract documents and 396 labeled queries about these documents.

```Python Python theme={null}
from datasets import load_dataset

# load the documents and queries of legalbench consumer contracts qa dataset
documents = load_dataset('mteb/legalbench_consumer_contracts_qa', 'corpus', cache_dir = './', split='corpus')
queries = load_dataset('mteb/legalbench_consumer_contracts_qa', 'queries', cache_dir = './', split='queries')

```

Each document in `mteb/legalbench_consumer_contracts_qa` contains a `text` field by which we will embed using the Voyage AI client.

```Python Python theme={null}
num_documents = len(documents['text'])
voyageai_batch_size = 128  # Please check the restrictions of number of examples and number of tokens per request here https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings
embeds = []
while len(embeds) < num_documents:
    embeds.extend(vc.embed(
        texts=documents['text'][len(embeds):len(embeds)+voyageai_batch_size],
        model='voyage-law-2',  # Please check the available models here https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings
        input_type='document',
        truncation=True
    ).embeddings)
```

Check the dimensionality of the returned vectors. You will need to save the embedding dimensionality from this to be used when initializing your Pinecone index later.

```Python Python theme={null}
import numpy as np

shape = np.array(embeds).shape
print(shape)
```

```
[Out]:
(154, 1024)
```

In this example, you can see that for each of the `154` documents, we created a `1024`-dimensional embedding with the Voyage AI `voyage-law-2` model.

### 3. Store the Embeddings

Now that you have your embeddings, you can move on to indexing them in the Pinecone vector database. For this, you need a Pinecone API key. [Sign up for one here](https://app.pinecone.io).

You first initialize our connection to Pinecone and then create a new index called `voyageai-pinecone-legalbench` for storing the embeddings. When creating the index, you specify that you would like to use the cosine similarity metric to align with Voyage AI's embeddings, and also pass the embedding dimensionality of `1024`.

```Python Python theme={null}
from pinecone.grpc import PineconeGRPC as Pinecone
from pinecone import ServerlessSpec

# initialize connection to pinecone (get API key at app.pinecone.io)
pc = Pinecone(api_key="<YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY>")

index_name = 'voyageai-pinecone-legalbench'

# if the index does not exist, we create it
if not pc.has_index(index_name):
    pc.create_index(
        index_name,
        dimension=shape[1],
        spec=ServerlessSpec(
            cloud='aws',
            region='us-east-1'
        ),
        metric='cosine'
    )

# connect to index
index = pc.Index(index_name)
```

Now you can begin populating the index with your embeddings. Pinecone expects you to provide a list of tuples in the format (`id`, `vector`, `metadata`), where the `metadata` field is an optional extra field where you can store anything you want in a dictionary format. For this example, you will store the original text of the embeddings.

While uploading your data, you will batch everything to avoid pushing too much data in one go.

```Python Python theme={null}
batch_size = 128

ids = [str(i) for i in range(shape[0])]
# create list of metadata dictionaries
meta = [{'text': text} for text in documents['text']]

# create list of (id, vector, metadata) tuples to be upserted
to_upsert = list(zip(ids, embeds, meta))

for i in range(0, shape[0], batch_size):
    i_end = min(i+batch_size, shape[0])
    index.upsert(vectors=to_upsert[i:i_end])

# let's view the index statistics
print(index.describe_index_stats())
`

`[Out]:
{'dimension': 1024,
 'index_fullness': 0.0,
 'namespaces': {'': {'vector_count': 154}},
 'total_vector_count': 154}
```

You can see from `index.describe_index_stats` that you have a *1024-dimensionality* index populated with *154* embeddings. The `indexFullness` metric tells you how full your index is. At the moment, it is empty. Using the default value of one *p1* pod, you can fit around 750K embeddings before the `indexFullness` reaches capacity. The [Usage Estimator](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) can be used to identify the number of pods required for a given number of *n*-dimensional embeddings.

### 4. Semantic search

Now that you have your indexed vectors, you can perform a few search queries. When searching, you will first embed your query using `voyage-law-2`, and then search using the returned vector in Pinecone.

```Python Python theme={null}
# get a sample query from the dataset, "Will Google help me if I think someone has taken and used content Ive created without my permission?" 
query = queries['text'][0]
print(f"Query: {query}")

# create the query embedding
xq = vc.embed(
    texts=[query],
    model='voyage-law-2',
    input_type="query",
    truncation=True
).embeddings

# query, returning the top 3 most similar results
res = index.query(vector=xq, top_k=3, include_metadata=True)
```

The response from Pinecone includes your original text in the `metadata` field. Let's print out the `top_k` most similar questions and their respective similarity scores.

```Python Python theme={null}
for match in res['matches']:
    print(f"{match['score']:.2f}: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

```[Out]:  theme={null}
