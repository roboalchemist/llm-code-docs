# Assistant API reference

Use the [Assistant API](/guides/assistant/quickstart) to upload documents, ask questions, and receive responses that reference your documents. This is known as [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/).

## Versioning

The Assistant API is versioned to ensure that your applications continue to work as expected as the platform evolves. For more details, see [API versioning](/reference/api/versioning) in the Pinecone Database documentation.
