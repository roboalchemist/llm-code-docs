## Set monthly spend alerts

You can set up email alerts to monitor your organization's monthly spending. These alerts notify designated recipients when spending reaches specified thresholds. The alerts automatically reset at the start of each monthly billing cycle.

To set a spend alert:

1. Go to [Settings > Spend alerts](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/spend-alerts) in the Pinecone console
2. Click **+ Add Alert**.
3. Enter the dollar amount for the spend alert.
4. Enter the email addresses to send the alert to. [Organization owners](/guides/organizations/understanding-organizations#organization-roles) are listed by default.
5. Click **Create**.

To edit a spend alert:

1. In the row of the spend alert you want to edit, click **ellipsis (...) menu > Edit**.
2. Change the dollar amount and/or email addresses for the spend alert.
3. Click **Update**.

<Note>
  **Auto-spend spike alert**: To protect from unexpected cost increases, Pinecone sends an alert when spending exceeds double your previous month's invoice amount. While the alert threshold is fixed and the alert cannot be deleted, you can modify which email addresses receive the alert and enable or disable the alert notifications.

## List by ID prefix

By using a [hierarchical ID schema](/guides/index-data/data-modeling#use-structured-ids), you can retrieve records without performing a query. To do so, you can use [`list`](/reference/api/latest/data-plane/list) to retrieve records by ID prefix, then use `fetch` to retrieve the records you need. This can reduce costs, because [`query` consumes more RUs when scanning a larger namespace](/guides/manage-cost/understanding-cost#query), while [`fetch` consumes a fixed ratio of RUs to records retrieved](/guides/manage-cost/understanding-cost#fetch).

## Use namespaces for multitenancy

If your application requires you to isolate the data of each customer/user, consider [implementing multitenancy with serverless indexes and namespaces](/guides/index-data/implement-multitenancy). With serverless indexes, you pay only for the amount of data stored and operations performed. For queries in particular, the cost is partly based on the total number of records that must be scanned, so using namespaces can significantly reduce query costs.
