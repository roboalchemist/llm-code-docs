# Standard trial

> Get $300 credits for 21 days with the Standard plan trial.

The Standard trial lets you evaluate Pinecone without requiring any up-front payment. You get \$300 in credits over 21 days with access to Standard plan [features](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) and [limits](/reference/api/database-limits) that are suitable for testing Pinecone at scale.

<Note>
  If you're building a small or personal project, consider the free [Starter plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) instead.
