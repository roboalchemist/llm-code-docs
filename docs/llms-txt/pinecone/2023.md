### Features

## November 2023

### Features

* The new [Pinecone AWS Reference Architecture](https://github.com/pinecone-io/aws-reference-architecture-pulumi/tree/main) is an open-source, distributed system that performs vector-database-enabled semantic search over Postgres records. You can use it as a learning resource or as a starting point for high-scale use cases.

### SDKs

* [Canopy](https://github.com/pinecone-io/canopy/blob/main/README.md) is a new open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and context engine built on top of Pinecone. It enables you to start chatting with your documents or text data with a few simple commands.\
