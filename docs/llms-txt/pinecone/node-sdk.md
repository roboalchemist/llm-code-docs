## Requirements

The Pinecone Node SDK requires TypeScript 4.1 or later and Node 18.x or later.

## SDK versions

SDK versions are pinned to specific [API versions](/reference/api/versioning). When a new API version is released, a new version of the SDK is also released.

The mappings between API versions and Node.js SDK versions are as follows:

| API version        | SDK version |
| :----------------- | :---------- |
| `2025-04` (latest) | v6.x        |
| `2025-01`          | v5.x        |
| `2024-10`          | v4.x        |
| `2024-07`          | v3.x        |
| `2024-04`          | v2.x        |

When a new stable API version is released, you should upgrade your SDK to the latest version to ensure compatibility with the latest API changes.

## Install

To install the latest version of the [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-ts-client), written in TypeScript, run the following command:

```Shell  theme={null}
npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone
```

To check your SDK version, run the following command:

```Shell  theme={null}
npm list | grep @pinecone-database/pinecone
```

## Upgrade

If you already have the Node.js SDK, upgrade to the latest version as follows:

```Shell  theme={null}
npm install @pinecone-database/pinecone@latest
```

## Initialize

Once installed, you can import the library and then use an [API key](/guides/projects/manage-api-keys) to initialize a client instance:

```JavaScript  theme={null}
import { Pinecone } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';

const pc = new Pinecone({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});
```

## Proxy configuration

If your network setup requires you to interact with Pinecone through a proxy, you can pass a custom `ProxyAgent` from the [`undici` library](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/). Below is an example of how to construct an `undici` `ProxyAgent` that routes network traffic through a [`mitm` proxy server](https://mitmproxy.org/) while hitting Pinecone's `/indexes` endpoint.

<Note>
  The following strategy relies on Node's native [`fetch`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#fetch) implementation, released in Node v16 and stabilized in Node v21. If you are running Node versions 18-21, you may experience issues stemming from the instability of the feature. There are currently no known issues related to proxying in Node v18+.
</Note>

```JavaScript JavaScript theme={null}
import {
  Pinecone,
  type PineconeConfiguration,
} from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';
import { Dispatcher, ProxyAgent } from 'undici';
import * as fs from 'fs';

const cert = fs.readFileSync('path/to/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem');

const client = new ProxyAgent({
  uri: 'https://your-proxy.com',
  requestTls: {
    port: 'YOUR_PROXY_SERVER_PORT',
    ca: cert,
    host: 'YOUR_PROXY_SERVER_HOST',
  },
});

const customFetch = (
  input: string | URL | Request,
  init: RequestInit | undefined
) => {
  return fetch(input, {
    ...init,
    dispatcher: client as Dispatcher,
    keepalive: true,  # optional
  });
};

const config: PineconeConfiguration = {
  apiKey:
    'YOUR_API_KEY',
  fetchApi: customFetch,
};

const pc = new Pinecone(config);

const indexes = async () => {
  return await pc.listIndexes();
};

indexes().then((response) => {
  console.log('My indexes: ', response);
});
```
