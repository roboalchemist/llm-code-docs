# Integrate with Google Cloud Storage

> Integrate Google Cloud Storage for bulk data import

<Note>
  This feature is in [public preview](/release-notes/feature-availability) and available only on [Standard and Enterprise plans](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/).
</Note>

This page shows you how to integrate Pinecone with a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. Once your integration is set up, you can use it to [import data](/guides/index-data/import-data) from your bucket into a Pinecone index hosted on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have the following:

* A [Pinecone account](https://app.pinecone.io/)
* A [Google Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)

## 1. Create a service account and key

Pinecone will use a service account to access your GCS bucket.

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) for your Pinecone integration.
2. [Create a service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating). Select **JSON** as the key type.

   The key will be downloaded to your computer. You'll use this key when adding a storage integration in Pinecone.

## 2. Grant access to the bucket

[Add your service account as a principal to the bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).

* For the principal, use your service account email address.
* For the role, select **Storage Object Viewer** or another role that has permission to list and read objects in a bucket.

## 3. Add a storage integration

In the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects), add an integration with Google Cloud Storage:

1. Select your project.
2. Go to [**Manage > Storage integrations**](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/storage).
3. Click **Add integration**.
4. Enter a unique integration name.
5. Select **Google Cloud Storage**.
6. Open the JSON key file for your service account.
7. Copy the contents of the key file and paste them into the **Index account key JSON** field.
8. Click **Add integration**.

## Next steps

[Import data](/guides/index-data/import-data) from your GCS bucket into your Pinecone index.
