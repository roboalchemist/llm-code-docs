# Pinecone Database limits

This page describes different types of limits for Pinecone Database.

## Rate limits

Rate limits help protect your applications from misuse and maintain the health of our shared serverless infrastructure. These limits are designed to support typical production workloads while ensuring reliable performance for all users.

**Most rate limits can be adjusted upon request.** If you need higher limits to scale your application, [contact Support](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket) with details about your use case. Pinecone is committed to supporting your growth and can often accommodate higher throughput requirements.

Rate limits vary based on [pricing plan](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/) and apply to [serverless indexes](/guides/index-data/indexing-overview) only.

<Note>
  Indexes built on [Dedicated Read Nodes](/guides/index-data/dedicated-read-nodes) are not subject to read unit limits for query, fetch, and list operations. For sizing and capacity planning guidance, see the [Dedicated Read Nodes](/guides/index-data/dedicated-read-nodes) guide.
</Note>

### Data plane operations: request-per-second limits

Pinecone enforces rate limits on the number of API requests per second at the namespace level for data plane operations (query, upsert, delete, and update). These limits provide protection against excessive request rates.

#### Affected operations

The following operations are subject to request-per-second rate limiting:

| Operation | Scope         | Limit |
| --------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Query     | Per namespace | 100   |
| Upsert    | Per namespace | 100   |
| Delete    | Per namespace | 100   |
| Update    | Per namespace | 100   |

#### Error response

When you exceed the request-per-second limit, you'll receive an HTTP `429 - TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` response. The error message indicates which operation exceeded the limit and includes the namespace name and limit value. See the individual limit sections below for specific error message formats.

#### How request-per-second limits work with limits on read and write units

Request-per-second limits are enforced in addition to existing read unit and write unit limits. Requests must not exceed any applicable limits:

* Index-level limits - read and write unit limits, per index
* Namespace-level limits - read and write unit limits, per namespace
* Request-per-second limits - requests per second, per namespace

If any limit is exceeded, the request fails with a 429 error.

#### Recommendations

If you're hitting request-per-second limits:

1. Implement retry logic. Use exponential backoff to handle rate limit errors gracefully. See [Error Handling Guide](/guides/production/error-handling#implement-retry-logic).
2. Pace your requests. Add client-side rate limiting to stay under limits.
3. Consider [Dedicated Read Nodes](/guides/index-data/dedicated-read-nodes), which don't have request-per-second limits and provide dedicated capacity for high-throughput workloads.
4. If you need higher limits, [contact Support](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket) with details about your use case.

<sup>1 On the Starter plan, all serverless must be in the `us-east-1` region of AWS.</sup><br />

### Projects per organization

| Starter plan | Standard plan | Enterprise plan |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1            | 20            | 100             |

When you reach this quota for an organization, trying to [create projects](/guides/projects/create-a-project) will fail and return a `403 - QUOTA_EXCEEDED` status with the following error:

```
Request failed. You've reached the max projects allowed in organization <org name>. 
To add more projects, upgrade your plan.
```

To increase this quota, [upgrade your plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/upgrade-billing-plan) or [contact Support](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket).

### Serverless indexes per project

| Starter plan | Standard plan | Enterprise plan |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| 5            | 20            | 200             |

When you reach this quota for a project, trying to [create serverless indexes](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#create-a-serverless-index) in the project will fail and return a `403 - QUOTA_EXCEEDED` status with the following error:

```
Request failed. You've reached the max serverless indexes allowed in project <project>. 
Use namespaces to partition your data into logical groups, or upgrade your plan to add more serverless indexes.
```

To stay under this quota, consider using [namespaces](/guides/index-data/create-an-index#namespaces) instead of creating multiple indexes. Namespaces let you partition your data into logical groups within a single index. This approach not only helps you stay within index limits, but can also improve query performance and lower costs by limiting searches to relevant data subsets.

To increase this quota, [upgrade your plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/upgrade-billing-plan).

### Serverless index storage per project

<Note>This limit applies to organizations on the Starter plan only.</Note>

| Starter plan | Standard plan | Enterprise plan |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| 2 GB         | N/A           | N/A             |

When you've reached this quota for a project, updates and upserts into serverless indexes will fail and return a `403 - QUOTA_EXCEEDED` status with the following error:

```
Request failed. You've reached the max storage allowed for project <project name>. 
To update or upsert new data, delete records or upgrade your plan.
```

To continue writing data into your serverless indexes, [delete records](/guides/manage-data/delete-data) to bring your project under the limit or [upgrade your plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/upgrade-billing-plan).

### Namespaces per serverless index

| Starter plan | Standard plan | Enterprise plan |

When you reach this quota for a serverless index, trying to [upsert records into a new namespace](/guides/index-data/upsert-data) in the index will fail and return a `403 - QUOTA_EXCEEDED` status with the following error:

```
Request failed. You've reached the max namespaces allowed in serverless index <index name>. 
To add more namespaces, upgrade your plan.
```

To increase this quota, [upgrade your plan](/guides/organizations/manage-billing/upgrade-billing-plan).

<Note>
  While the Standard and Enterprise plans support up to [100,000 namespaces per index](/reference/api/database-limits#namespaces-per-serverless-index), Pinecone can accommodate million-scale namespaces and beyond for specific use cases. If your application requires more than 100,000 namespaces, [contact Support](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket).

## Operation limits

Operation limits are restrictions on the size, number, or other characteristics of operations in Pinecone. Operation limits are fixed and do not vary based on pricing plan.

### Upsert limits

| Metric                                                             | Limit                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Import limits

<Note>
  If your import exceeds these limits, you'll get an `Exceeds system limit` error. Pinecone can help unblock these imports quickly. [Contact Pinecone support](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/settings/support/ticket) for assistance.
</Note>

| Metric                    | Limit   |
| :------------------------ | :------ |
| Max namespaces per import | 10,000  |
| Max size per namespace    | 500 GB  |
| Max files per import      | 100,000 |
| Max size per file         | 10 GB   |

### Query limits

| Metric            | Limit  |
| :---------------- | :----- |
| Max `top_k` value | 10,000 |
| Max result size   | 4MB    |

The query result size is affected by the dimension of the dense vectors and whether or not dense vector values and metadata are included in the result.

<Tip>
  If a query fails due to exceeding the 4MB result size limit, choose a lower `top_k` value, or use `include_metadata=False` or `include_values=False` to exclude metadata or values from the result. For better performance, especially with higher `top_k` values, avoid including vector values unless you need them.
</Tip>

### Fetch limits

| Metric                           | Limit |
| :------------------------------- | :---- |
| Max record IDs per fetch request | 1,000 |

### Delete limits

| Metric                            | Limit |
| :-------------------------------- | :---- |
| Max record IDs per delete request | 1,000 |

### Metadata filter limits

The following limits apply to [metadata filter expressions](/guides/search/filter-by-metadata#metadata-filter-expressions) used in query, delete, update, and fetch operations.

| Limit                                       | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum values per `$in` or `$nin` operator | 10,000 | Each `$in` or `$nin` operator accepts up to 10,000 values in its array. This limit applies per operator—if you have multiple `$in` operators in a single filter, each is independently limited to 10,000 values. |

When you exceed this limit, the request will fail and return a `400 - BAD_REQUEST` error.

#### Rationale

Large `$in` operators can impact query performance and cost. Filters with thousands of values increase request payload size and end-to-end latency. Additionally, using large filters typically indicates a shared namespace architecture, which increases query costs—queries scan the entire namespace regardless of filters.

#### Alternative approaches

If you need to filter by more than 10,000 values, consider these alternatives:

* **Use namespaces for tenant isolation**: Instead of filtering by tenant IDs within a single namespace, create separate namespaces for each tenant or tenant group. This can also reduce query costs. See [Design for multi-tenancy](/guides/index-data/data-modeling#design-for-multi-tenancy).
* **Use broader access control groups**: Instead of filtering by individual user IDs, filter by organization, project, or role. This reduces the number of values in your `$in` filter. See [Design for multi-tenancy](/guides/index-data/data-modeling#use-access-control-groups-instead-of-individual-ids).
* **Post-filter client-side**: Retrieve a larger top K without filtering (for example, top 1000), then filter results client-side.
* **Run multiple queries**: Split your filter into multiple queries with smaller `$in` operators and combine the results client-side.

<Tip>
  To avoid hitting this limit in production, validate the size of your `$in` and `$nin` arrays in your application code before making the request to Pinecone.
</Tip>

## Identifier limits

An identifier is a string of characters used to identify "named" [objects in Pinecone](/guides/get-started/concepts). The following Pinecone objects use strings as identifiers:

| Object                                                    | Field       | Max # characters | Allowed characters                                                                                                                        |
