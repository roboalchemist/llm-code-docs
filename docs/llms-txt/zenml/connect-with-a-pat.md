If you are using ZenML Pro and need to call the ZenML Pro workspace API from a non-interactive environment, you also have the option of creating and using a Personal Access Token. Personal Access Tokens are scoped to your ZenML Pro user account and can be used to access all workspaces you are a member of in any organization. See the [ZenML Pro Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.zenml.io/pro/access-management/personal-access-tokens) documentation for more information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Personal Access Tokens are only available in ZenML Pro**

If you are using ZenML OSS and need to call the ZenML OSS API from a non-interactive environment, you can use a service account and an API key. See the [Connect with a service account](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/connecting-to-zenml/connect-with-a-service-account) documentation for more information.
