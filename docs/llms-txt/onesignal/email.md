> Send a message using the email channel.

## Overview

The Create message API allows you to send push notifications, emails, and SMS to your users. This guide is specific for email. See [Push notification](/reference/push-notification) or [SMS](/reference/sms) to send to those channels.

Ensure your [Email setup](/docs/en/email-setup) is complete.

<Note>
  Review the [Sending messages with the OneSignal API](/reference/create-message) guide for details on how to structure your messages.
