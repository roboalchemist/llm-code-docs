## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

1. Access to Clay: You must have a Clay account with administrator privileges.

2. Web Scraper API Access: You should have your Bright Data API key including authentication details, the needed endpoints, and request/response structures in place.

### Step 2: Create an API Request Workflow in Clay

Clay allows you to create automated workflows using its user-friendly interface. To call your Web Scraper API, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Clay**:

   * Log into your Clay account.

   * Navigate to the Workflows section.

2. **Set Up a Trigger**:

   * Choose how you'd like to trigger the workflow (e.g., manually, scheduled, or based on an event in another service integrated with Clay).

3. **Add an HTTP Request Action**:

   * Add an HTTP request block to your workflow.

   * Select the HTTP method supported by your Web Scraper API (POST "[Trigger a collection](https://docs.brightdata.com/api-reference/web-scraper-api/delivery-apis/download-snapshot)").

4. **Configure the Request**:

   * In the HTTP request block, input the following:

   * URL: Enter the API endpoint (e.g., [https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger](https://docs.brightdata.com/api-reference/rest-api/scraper/asynchronous-requests)).

   * Headers: Include any required headers, such as:

   ```JSON  theme={null}
     {
         "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
     }
   ```

   * Body (if required): Add any parameters required in the body as JSON.

5. **Test the Request**:

   * Send a test request using Clay's testing tools to ensure that the Web Scraper API responds with the expected data.

***

### Step 3: Process the Response in Clay

Once you’ve successfully connected to the Web Scraper API, you can process the response data:

1. **Integrate with Other Services**:

   * Use Clay to send the data to a database, Google Sheets, email, or any other service.

2. **Add Conditions/Logic**:

   * Create conditions or filters in your workflow. For example, only process items with a price above a certain threshold.

***

### Step 4: Schedule or Deploy Your Workflow

Configure your workflow to run automatically based on your preferred schedule (e.g., every hour or daily) or trigger it manually when needed.
