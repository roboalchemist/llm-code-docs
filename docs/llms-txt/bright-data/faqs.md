  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle timeout issues when using Bright Data MCP Server?">
    Some web data tools can take longer to execute, especially when dealing with complex websites. To ensure your agent can consume the data:

    1. Set a high enough timeout in your agent settings (180 seconds is recommended)
    2. For particularly slow sites, you may need to increase this value further
    3. Use the specialized `web_data_*` tools when available, as they're often faster than general scraping
    4. For browser automation sequences, keep operations close together in time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What security considerations should I keep in mind?">
    Always treat scraped web content as untrusted data. Never use raw scraped content directly in LLM prompts to avoid potential prompt injection risks. Instead:

    * Filter and validate all web data before passing it to the LLM
    * Use structured data extraction rather than raw text when possible
    * Be cautious with executing JavaScript from scraped content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I getting a 'spawn npx ENOENT' error?">
    This error occurs when your system cannot find the `npx` command. To fix it:

    1. Find your Node.js path:
       * On macOS: Run `which node` in Terminal
       * On Windows: Run `where node` in Command Prompt
    2. Update your MCP configuration to use the full path instead of `npx`:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Bright Data": {
          "command": "/usr/local/bin/node", // Replace with your actual Node.js path
          "args": ["node_modules/@brightdata/mcp/index.js"],
          "env": {
            "API_TOKEN": "<your-api-token>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I monitor my usage and costs?">
    You can use the `session_stats` tool to check your usage during the current session. For comprehensive usage tracking and billing information, log in to your Bright Data account dashboard. The `session_stats` tool will show you information about:

    * Number of requests made during the current session
    * Tools used and their frequency
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a playground where I can try Bright Data MCP Server?">
    Yes, you can try Bright Data MCP without any setup using the [Bright Data AI Playground](https://brightdata.com/ai/playground-chat). It provides an easy way to explore the capabilities of Bright Data MCP without any local setup. Just sign in and start experimenting with web data collection!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I connect my AI agent with Bright Data's MCP?" iconType="solid">
    You can connect your AI agent with Bright Data by following these steps:

    1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (only required for the self-hosted option)
    2. Create a [Bright Data account](https://brightdata.com/?hs_signup=1\&utm_source=docs) (new users get free credit for testing)
    3. Copy your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users) (new users receive an **API key** in the welcome email)
    4. Configure your agent with your API key. For more detailed examples, visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-usage-examples) or check our [MCP documentation](https://docs.brightdata.com/ai/mcp-server/overview#configuration).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When using MCP, should I create zones or configure them?">
    No, zones are created automatically for you. All you need is Node.js (for self-hosted) and your Bright Data API key. If you want to change your zone name to something specific, you can always do so through the [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a free access tier for the Bright Data MCP?">
    Yes! Bright Data provides a free tier of **5,000 requests/month** to new MCP users. The free tier includes web search and web page scraping via Web Unlocker. See [What is the MCP free tier?](#) below for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the MCP free tier?">
    The MCP free tier allows you to connect your AI agent via MCP (Model Context Protocol) to Bright Data services for free.
    You get up to 5,000 requests per month for web search and scraping any public webpage via Web Unlocker at no cost. This is ideal for testing, development, or light usage.

    For more information, see the [Remote MCP Quickstart](/ai/mcp-server/remote/quickstart).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when the free tier limit is reached?">
    When you exceed the 5,000 monthly request limit on the free tier, requests will start failing. To continue using the MCP server, you need to create a new Web Unlocker zone and configure the MCP to use it:

    1. Go to [brightdata.com/cp](https://brightdata.com/cp) and click **Add** (top-right)
    2. Select **Unlocker zone** and create it with any name (e.g., `my_unlocker`)
    3. Update your MCP configuration to use the new zone:
       * **Remote MCP:** Add `&unlocker=ZONE_NAME` to your MCP URL
       * **Self-hosted MCP:** Set the `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=ZONE_NAME` environment variable
    4. Restart your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor) after the configuration change
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple MCP instances in parallel?">
    Yes, you can run multiple MCP instances for parallelized workloads. However, if you are using the self-hosted (local) MCP with `npx`, each instance downloads and caches the package separately, which can consume significant disk space.

    For parallel use cases, we recommend using the **Remote MCP** instead. It requires no local installation, runs entirely in the cloud, and eliminates disk space concerns. Simply point each instance to the remote endpoint:

    ```
    https://mcp.brightdata.com/sse?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN
    ```

    See the [Remote MCP Quickstart](/ai/mcp-server/remote/quickstart) for setup instructions.
