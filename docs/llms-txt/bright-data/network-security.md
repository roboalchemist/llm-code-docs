# How does Bright Data ensure Network Security?

Most of the traffic that goes through both a regular ISP and a virtual ISP is encrypted with an SSL tunnel so its content is not visible to the ISP. Due to this the methods to secure the network and prevent illegal activities available to ISPs are limited and are mostly targeted at large scale DDoS prevention and domain denylists. However at Bright Data we do a lot more:
