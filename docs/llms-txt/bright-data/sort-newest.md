We heard others complaining about the same.|The room thermostat stayed at 72-73 the entire time - with the windows cracked, which I've appreciated this feature at this hotel.|72 or 73 may work for some ppl in their homes,  but not in a high rise hotel.||The elevator system was new and completely inefficient - we were riding the service elevator most of the time.||If you're reading this Hilton, room 2737 needs a new bathroom door - there was obviously a water issue in the bathroom and the wood composite was buckling and coming through on the bottom of the door. The wallpaper was peeling and the tub and sink were both very old and worn, there black mold on the shower and sink."

        "comment": "We traveled to NYC to watch The Christmas Spectacular at the Radio City Music Hall and stayed at the Hilton for the night. We loved the location as it was within of 5 minute walking distance of literally everything there is to see at Christmas time. Our room was quite spacious and clean with two full beds and a nice view. Staff was friendly and I loved that you can get there early and check in your bags so you can go explore before check in time as we arrived to the city around noon. Also loved that there was parking on site. We used the valet so you pulled in, got everything out you would need, they give you a card with a number and you walk into the doors and right to the luggage storage area. The elevator system is insane and that's my only complaint. I've never stayed in a hotel where you have to put in your room number and can only ride a certain elevator to your room. Seemed our elevators were always the ones with tons of people waiting to get on or off. The only outside noise you could hear were horns, but I was ok with that and thankful I never heard my neighbors or anyone in the halls. I got an insane discount on my room through my employer otherwise I would never be able to stay here during Christmastime. But I understand why the rate is so high as it is a hotel that sits in the middle of all the amazing attractions NYC has to offer. Would definitely stay here again!"

However, this hotel is really lovely and other than this and the elevators being slow I can’t fault it. They have installed a new elevator system and should have thought it through as during busy times they are packed and it can take quite some time to get one. |Rooms are lovely , cleaned every day, excellent location and staff all really lovely. I would recommend staying here."
