## What is Make.com?

[Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/brightdata) (formerly Integromat) is a visual automation platform that lets you connect various apps and services to create powerful workflows, without writing any code.

Bright Data's integration with Make enables seamless web data collection and processing. With this integration, you can automate tasks like scraping websites, retrieving datasets, and making API calls.

Bright Data offers the following six modules in Make:

1. **Run an Unlocker API** – Access and extract data from sites that block bots.
2. **Download a Snapshot Content** – Retrieve the full content of a previously captured dataset.
3. **Filter a Dataset** – Apply filters to datasets and generate refined snapshots.
4. **Get a Snapshot Metadata** – Fetch detailed metadata for a snapshot.
5. **Get a Snapshot Part** – Retrieve a specific section of a snapshot.
6. **Make an API Call** – Execute any authorized request to Bright Data’s API.

## Why Use Bright Data With Make.com?

Integrating Bright Data with [Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/brightdata) allows you to build sophisticated web data pipelines—without writing a single line of code.

You can visually design and automate workflows that connect Bright Data with over 2,000 other apps and services. For example, you can:

* Extract data from websites using **Unlocker API**.
* Download and store snapshot content.
* Apply filters to datasets dynamically.
* Retrieve snapshot metadata or specific parts.
* Trigger authorized Bright Data API calls.

These capabilities let you build end-to-end data flows that connect Bright Data with tools like Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion, Slack, or your internal systems.
