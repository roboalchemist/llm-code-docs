  <Accordion title="How Bright Data billing works?">
    **A minimum monthly commitment** - Each plan requires you to commit to paying a minimum amount at the beginning of every month while your account is in “active” status. This minimum commitment will set the limits for your basic usage: once your usage goes over your minimum commitment amount, you will need to add additional funds to keep using our service.

  <Accordion title="How do I re-verify my account to clear a billing issue?">
    If your account was blocked, you will immediately receive an email explaining how to resolve the issue. Contact your dedicated account manager or Bright Data's compliance team at [compliance@brightdata.com](mailto:compliance@brightdata.com). To reinstate your blocked account, you will need to provide the following:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Registered Companies">
        * A company registration form
        * A photo of the flagged payment method
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Non Registered Companies">
        * Photo ID, driver's license, or passport
        * A photo of the flagged payment method
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Bright Data billing cycle work if I am only using data-center IPs?">
    When customers only use data-center IPs, we calculate their cost on a daily basis. We subtract this daily cost from the current balance in your account, showing the remaining balance available for use. Costs are calculated according to the IP types used (shared vs. dedicated), as well as bandwidth/GB used. We also calculate any additional costs for added features (like exclusive time or dedicated domain/host).\
    You will be billed for the costs described above on the 1st of every month. The balance remaining in your account will reflect the amount available for future use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Bright Data billing cycle works?">
    Bright Data's billing cycle starts on the 1st of each month. This means that you will be billed for your monthly account commitment automatically at the 1st of every month as long as your account status is active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I join Bright Data in the middle of the billing cycle (in the middle of the month)?">
    If you join Bright Data in the middle of the month, your first minimum account commitment payment will be charged on the day you join and usage will retroactively apply only to the days in which your account was active during the month.

    **Example**: You join the Bright Data Residential Network on the June 25th, your price plan has a \$500 minimum monthly commitment and you make your first payment of \$500.

    What will happen on July 1st?

    * Our system will see your account was active for only 6 days during June which are 20% of the month, so the relative part of the minimum monthly commitment will be \$100. Unless the cost of your usage was higher than that, \$100 will be your cost for June.
    * We will send you an invoice and take \$100 from your balance against June cost, leaving your balance with \$400.
    * Since on the 1st of every month your balance needs to comply with your minimum monthly commitment, we will now charge your credit card for \$100 in order to top it back to \$500 to comply with your minimum monthly commitment for July.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I receive an invoice?">
    Yes. You will receive an invoice by the third Israeli business day of the month. The invoice will provide details of your previous month's usage. It will breakdown how your usage related to your minimum account commitment (and if applicable, any additional funds that were added during the course of the month).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the time zone used for my billing cycle?">
    All billing calculations are made according to our dashboard timezone which is UTC+0. How this can effect your billing? You have the option to enable and disable your Zones. The time of enabling/disabling will be in UTC time therefore the daily charges will be applied accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I will not be using Bright Data on a daily basis but on a per-project basis. Do I still need to pay the entire minimum monthly commitment?">

  <Accordion title="How can I prevent suspension of my account?">
    To ensure that your account is never suspended, we highly recommend that you use our automatic recharging option.

The amount set is entirely up to you and can be of any denomination.
