# Overcoming website blocking

> See general advice on how to overcome blocking and errors from websites

The first step for troubleshooting your error is checking the entire network error response - It could contain critical information regarding the origin of the error and possibly instructions for resolving it.

To analyze the entire response you can run a `curl` command from your shell prompt and add the option flag `-v` or `-i`. These flags will run curl in verbose mode and print out the header fields

```
curl -v [rest of curl command options]
```

## General Tips

### IPs

The main things to consider for IPs are:

* Geolocation: it's generally best to match the peer country to the country of the target.
  Using more specific targeting can also help:
  City is more specific than State, and State more specific than country

* Pool type: using Shared IPs can be a cost saving measure if the target isn't sensitive to multiple requests from the same IP. If the target is sensitive to that, using Dedicated IPs can help.

* Quality: Bright Data offers 4 'normal' proxy networks, in addition to our Automated Scraping Solutions.
  These are listed below in order of increasing difficulty to detect:
  Data Center - ISP - Residential - Mobile
  If one of these networks is consistently blocked, trying the next one down in the list may help get past the blocking.

* Consistency: for single-URL scrapes, you should generally be rotating the IP frequently to avoid rate limits. If you're trying to emulate a real user, the tips in the section below can help keep the IP consistent.

### Sessions

* If you're trying to mimic a real user, you should use the session ID username parameter:
  [Proxy and IP Rotation control](https://docs.brightdata.com/api-reference/proxy/rotate_ips#using-the-same-proxy-for-multiple-requests-session)
  This tells us that for a request with the same ID, you want to keep the same IP for the request.
  Doing this allows you to appear more like a normal user when using rotating networks like Residential and Mobile.

* If your use-case is single scrapes, you might still want to use this parameter, but in a different way:
  When the ID changes, that tells us that you want to use a different IP than the last one.
  Iterating over multiple IDs within 60 seconds will allow you to rotate through your allocated IPs.

### Request Method / Fingerprint

* Request Method: "Normal users" will typically use a browser to access websites. You can integrate the proxies into a regular browser, either directly or via our extension (available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bright-data/efohiadmkaogdhibjbmeppjpebenaool?hl=en)).
  If you're using a different integration, like browser automation, or direct API requests, it's important to keep this in mind and make your requests look as much like a real browser as possible to avoid detection.

* Fingerprint: Part of looking like a real user is the headers and cookies you send with the request, but another part is having the same attributes that a real browser would have. You can find many resources online about this, and we also offer the Unlocker API and Browser API, which manage all of this on your behalf.

## Automated Solution

Should you find that none of our proxy solutions (Datacenter, ISP, Residential, Mobile proxies) are effective for your needs, We recommend trying our [Automated Scraping Solutions](https://docs.brightdata.com/scraping-automation/introduction), particularly the Unlocker API, which autonomously manage all of the above mentioned measures and more to ensure high success rates.
