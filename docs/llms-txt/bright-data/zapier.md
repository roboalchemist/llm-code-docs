<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

    * A valid Bright Data API Key
    * An active Zapier account
    * Access to the Bright Data Zapier app
    * A clear understanding of what data you want to scrape and where it should be sent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Zap">
    Log in to your Zapier account, navigate to the **Zaps** section, and click **Create Zap** to start building your automation workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up a Trigger">
    Choose a trigger app and event that fits your use case. Common examples include:

    * **Schedule by Zapier** — run a scraper hourly, daily, or weekly
    * **New Row in Google Sheets** — trigger scraping when new input data is added
    * **Webhooks or Form Submissions** — trigger scrapers dynamically using real-time inputs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Bright Data as an Action">
    In the **Action** step, search for and select **Bright Data**. You will then be prompted to choose one of the available scraping or Unlocker actions.

    For example:

    * Select **Scrape Amazon** to collect product data
    * Select **Scrape LinkedIn** to extract profile or company information
    * Select **Run an Unlocker API** for advanced dynamic website access

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Action Parameters">
    Configure the required input fields for the selected action.\
    Depending on the scraper, this may include:

    * Target URLs or search terms
    * Country or localization settings
    * Result limits or pagination options
    * Output format preferences
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Action">
    Click **Test Action** to validate your configuration.\
    Zapier will execute a sample scrape and return example output so you can confirm:

    * Data is returned successfully
    * Fields are mapped correctly
    * The response matches your expectations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Downstream Actions (Optional)">
    After the Bright Data action, you can chain additional steps, such as:

    * Save results to Google Sheets or Airtable
    * Send alerts to Slack or Email
    * Push structured data into CRMs or internal tools
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish and Monitor Your Zap">
    Once everything is verified, click **Publish Zap** to activate it.

    After publishing:

    * Monitor task history in Zapier
    * Adjust triggers or scraping parameters as needed
    * Scale workflows by duplicating Zaps for other platforms
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

* Start with low-frequency triggers and scale gradually
* Validate output fields before sending data to production tools
* Use scheduling triggers for predictable workloads
* Monitor Zapier task usage and Bright Data API limits
* Keep API keys secure and rotate them periodically
