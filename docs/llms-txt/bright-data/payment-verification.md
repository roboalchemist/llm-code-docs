# Payment Method Verification

> Understand why a payment method is required to access Proxy Networks and Web Unlocker API on a free trial, and how to add one.

## Overview

When you sign up for Bright Data with a **personal email address** you receive a **free credit** to explore the platform. Certain products require you to **add a valid payment method** before you can create or use them.

<Note>
  Adding a payment method **does not trigger a charge**. It is used solely for identity verification and to unlock full product access.
</Note>

## Who is affected?

This requirement applies if **all** of the following are true:

| Condition          | Detail                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email type**     | You signed up with a personal / freemail domain                         |
| **Payment status** | No valid payment method is on file, you are using the free credit only. |

<Tip>
  Users who signed up with a **business email** or who already have a payment method on file are **not** affected and can use all products immediately.
</Tip>

## Which products are gated?

| Gated products (payment method required) | Available on free credit |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Residential Proxy                        | SERP API                 |
| Mobile Proxy                             | Browser API              |
| ISP Proxy                                | Web Scraper API          |
| Datacenter Proxy                         | Datasets Marketplace     |
| Web Unlocker API                         |                          |

## What you will see in the Control Panel

### Zone Creation Wizard - Create Proxy / Add API

When creating a **Proxy zone** or a **Web Unlocker API zone**, the wizard includes an additional step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your zone">
    Choose your product type and assign a name as usual.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set zone options">
    Configure any additional settings (geolocation, IP type, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add payment method">
    Instead of the usual **Create Proxy** / **Add API** button, you will see **Add payment method**. Clicking it opens the payment method form.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize creation">
    Once a valid payment method is saved, your zone is created automatically. If you leave the payment flow without completing it, the zone is **not** created, but your configuration is saved so you can resume later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Your zone will **not** be created until a payment method is successfully added.
</Warning>

### Network Dropdown - SERP API / Browser API configuration

If you are configuring an **allowed** product (SERP API or Browser API) and attempt to switch the underlying network to a gated product, the restricted networks appear **grayed out** in the dropdown:

* Unlocker API
* Residential
* Mobile
* ISP
* Datacenter

Hovering over a grayed-out option displays a tooltip:

> **"Add a payment method to unlock this product."**

The tooltip includes a link that opens the payment method form directly.

### Trial Credit Modal - "See Details"

In the credit breakdown modal, gated products display a **"Payment method required"** badge next to:

* **Web Unlocker**
* **Proxy Networks** (covers Residential, Mobile, Datacenter, ISP)

The modal footer includes an **"Add payment method"** button (primary style) alongside the existing "Got it" button.
