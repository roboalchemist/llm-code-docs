# Using Teams

> Use Teams to collect individual Augment Code accounts (Indie, Standard, or Max plans) into a Team. Once established you can bundle billing for your organization.

## About Teams

If multiple people from your organization use Augment Code through our [Indie, Standard or Max plan](https://augmentcode.com/pricing), Teams gathers accounts together for better collaboration. Teams simplify account management, offer better access control and centralize billing. Team administrators have special privileges to invite members, manage seats, change plans, and control team settings. Teams are not available for Enterprise plans since this plan by defaults groups the entire organization.

<Note>
  Team settings and billing management are only accessible to accounts assigned as the administrator. Individual team members can view team information but cannot modify settings or manage subscriptions. To change which account is set as the administrator, contact [Augment Code Support](https://portal.usepylon.com/augment-code/forms/augment-support)
</Note>

## Adding Team Members

To add team members, you must be an administrator with available seats on your plan.

1. **Navigate to Team from Account** - Go to your [Account](https://app.augmentcode.com/account/), and then select the "Team" tab

2. **Initiate Invitation** - Click "Add team member," enter the email address, and click "Send invitation"

3. **Invitation Status** - The invitation appears as "Pending" in your team members list and counts toward your seat allocation

4. **Acceptance** - The invitee receives an email with instructions to join. Once they authenticate with their Augment account (or create one), they become an active team member

<Note>
  Invitations expire after 7 days. Pending invitations can be cancelled before acceptance. If your team is at capacity, add more seats before inviting new members. You can send multiple invitations simultaneously using comma-separated emails.
</Note>

## Removing Team Members

To remove team members, you must be an administrator. Members can also remove themselves from a team.

1. **Navigate to Team from Account** - Go to your [Account](https://app.augmentcode.com/account/), select the "Team" tab, and find the member you want to remove

2. **Remove Member** - Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to the member's name, select "Remove Member," and confirm the removal

3. **After Removal** - The member immediately loses access to team resources and their account reverts to individual status. For paid plans, the seat becomes available at the next billing cycle.

<Note>
  Leaving? [Ask Augment Code Support](https://support.augmentcode.com/) to grant administrator access to another account before removing yourself if you're the only administrator.
</Note>

### Cancelling Pending Invitations

To cancel a pending invitation, navigate to the team members list, filter by "Pending" status, click the three-dot menu next to the pending invitation, and select "Cancel Invitation."

## Managing Team Plans and Subscriptions

Augment offers flexible plans to meet your team's needs. Visit [augmentcode.com/pricing](https://augmentcode.com/pricing) for current plan options and pricing.

### Changing Plans

To change your team's plan, you must be a team administrator with a valid payment method for paid plans.

1. **Access Plan Selection** - Go to [Account](https://app.augmentcode.com/account/) then select Subscription and click "Change Plan" or "Upgrade"

2. **Select New Plan** - Review available plans, pricing, and included features for your team size

3. **Configure Details** - Set the number of seats needed and review pricing calculations

4. **Confirm** - Add or update your payment method if needed, review prorated charges or credits, and confirm the plan change

<Note>
  Plan changes may be immediate (upgrades, free to paid, trial to paid) or take effect at the end of your billing cycle (downgrades). Prorated charges and credits are calculated automatically for mid-cycle changes.
</Note>

### Managing Seats

**Adding Seats**

1. **Navigate to Team Settings** - Go to [Account](https://app.augmentcode.com/account/) then the Team tab and click "Manage Seats"

2. **Increase Seat Count** - Use the number control to increase seats and review the new monthly cost

3. **Save Changes** - Click "Save changes" to confirm. Additional seats are billed immediately (prorated) and the new monthly rate takes effect immediately

**Removing Seats**

1. **Check Current Usage** - Ensure you have unused seats. You cannot reduce seats below your active members plus pending invitations

2. **Decrease Seat Count** - Navigate to "Manage Seats," reduce the number using the control, and save changes

3. **Billing Impact** - Removed seats remain active until the next billing cycle. Credits are applied at the next billing period

## Troubleshooting

**Cannot add members - no seats available**

* Purchase additional seats or remove inactive members
* Cancel pending invitations to free up seat allocation

**Payment method required**

* Add a valid credit card in Account > Billing
* Ensure your payment method is not expired
* Contact support for payment issues

**Cannot remove last admin**

* Promote another member to admin first before removing yourself

**Invitation expired**

* Resend the invitation from the Team tab
* Verify the correct email address was used
* Check spam folders for the invitation email

## Best Practices

**Regular Audits** - Review team membership monthly, remove inactive members promptly, and monitor seat utilization to optimize costs.

**Invitation Management** - Verify email addresses before sending invitations and follow up with invitees directly. Cancel unaccepted invitations after 48 hours to free up seats.

**Billing Optimization** - Right-size your seat count and plan seat changes for billing cycle boundaries to avoid prorated charges.

**Security** - Remove members immediately upon departure, regularly review admin permissions, and use company email addresses for all team members.
