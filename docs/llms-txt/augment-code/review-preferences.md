    ## Choose Your Review Style

    Augment Code Review offers two review styles to match your team's preferences. Both maintain the same low false positive rate while offering different levels of coverage.

    ### Available Review Styles

    Set your review style on the [Configuration page](https://app.augmentcode.com/settings/code-review).

    * **Thorough**: Provides comprehensive coverage, catching 50% more bugs than Precise. Ideal for teams that want maximum code quality assurance.

    * **Precise**: Focuses on the most critical issues with fewer overall comments. Best for teams that prefer a more targeted review approach.

    <Note>
      **Thorough** is the default review style for all users, but you can switch to **Precise** at any time.
