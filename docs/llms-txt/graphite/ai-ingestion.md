# LLM-Friendly Documentation

> Optimized formats of Graphite Documentation for ingestion as context for LLMs and AI tools.

[llms-txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files are specialized documentation resources designed specifically for AI and Large Language Model (LLM) consumption. These files provide structured, machine-readable documentation.

### /llms.txt

The `/llms.txt` file is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. AI tools can use this file to understand documentation structure.

### /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines the entire documentation site into a single file as full context for AI tools.
