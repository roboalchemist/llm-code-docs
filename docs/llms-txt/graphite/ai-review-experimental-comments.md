## About experimental comments

### Why am I seeing this?

As a part of improving Graphite Agent, some comments that users receive are created by **experimental pipelines** that the team is testing.
By testing these experimental pipelines, we can learn what works well and what doesn't, which helps us build features that truly improve your development experience.

### We'd appreciate your feedback

Your input is incredibly valuable and helps us make Graphite Agent better for everyone. We want to know:

* What did you find helpful about this comment?
* What could be improved?
* Would you want to see more comments like this in the future?

Our team reviews each comment that receives feedback to improve Graphite Agent and deliver a better experience.

### How to leave feedback

Use the 👍 or 👎 reaction on the comment itself in your PR, in Graphite or in GitHub.

**If you downvote on Graphite**, a popup will appear asking for more details. Your specific feedback helps us understand what went wrong and how to improve future reviews.

Our team may reach out to you to ask for more information.
