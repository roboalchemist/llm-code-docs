# CLI Overview

> Create, stack, and submit pull requests directly from the command line.

The Graphite CLI is a tool to help you break up large engineering tasks into a series of small, incremental code changes directly from the command line. The Graphite CLI makes it easy to stay unblocked as an author, develop faster, and provide more helpful comments as a reviewer.
