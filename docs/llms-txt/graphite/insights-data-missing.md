## Insights Data in Graphite

> Learn how to ensure Graphite can compute insights for your repositories

Insights data in Graphite is computed based on a few factors. If you’re not seeing data for your repositories, it may be due to one of the following:

* **Repositories not yet selected in Graphite**
  Graphite computes insights only for repositories explicitly selected by you or your organization in the [Graphite app](https://app.graphite.com/). Be sure to select the repositories you'd like insights to be computed for.

* **Insights are pending computation in Graphite**
  Once you've selected repositories, Graphite will need some time to compute insights. In most cases, this happens within a day or two.

* **Your selected date range exceeds your current plan’s sync window.**
  Each Graphite plan includes a defined sync period for historical GitHub data. The Starter plan includes insights going back up to 2 months. The Standard and Enterprise plans include up to 2 years.
