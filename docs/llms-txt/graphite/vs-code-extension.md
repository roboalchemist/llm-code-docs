# VS Code Extension

> Not a CLI person? Graphite's VS Code extension lets you create and manage stacked pull requests visually, right from your IDE.

The Graphite VS Code extension builds directly off of the Graphite CLI - it allows you to break up large engineering tasks into a series of small, incremental code changes directly from your IDE.

## Installation

In order to install the Graphite VS Code extension, make sure that you have the [Graphite CLI installed](/install-the-cli).

After that, you can install the extension from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Graphite.gti-vscode) and the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Graphite/gti-vscode), or by searching for "Graphite" in the extensions tab of your IDE.

## Launch the extension

You have a few options to start the VS Code extension:

* Click the Graphite icon in your VS Code sidebar (try dragging it to your sidebar!)

* Run the **Graphite: Open Graphite interactive** command from the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)

* [Define your own keyboard shortcut](https://code.visualstudio.com/getstarted/keybindings) to run the `graphite.open-gti` command

<Tip>
  You can modify the "Show in Sidebar" option in your VS Code settings to display the extension in an editor tab instead of a sidebar tab.
</Tip>

## Current features
