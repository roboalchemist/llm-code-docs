# User permissions

> Learn how to manage users and billing information for your organization as a Graphite admin.

Team admins can manage billing, add or remove seats, and view or download invoices from *Settings* > [*Billing*](https://app.graphite.com/settings/billing). Team admins can also promote other members of the team to the admin role or restrict their access to read-only mode.

## Becoming a Graphite admin

* If you have admin or owner privileges in GitHub, you are automatically an admin for that organization in Graphite.

* If you create a team in Graphite, you become a Graphite admin for that team.

* If you enter payment details in Graphite, you become a Graphite admin for that team.

* If another Graphite admin promotes you to admin, you become an admin for the team.

<Note>
  Being a Graphite admin does not grant you additional privileges in GitHub.

## Manage users

Graphite admins can manage Graphite users in their plan from *Settings* > [*Billing*](https://app.graphite.com/settings/billing) in the Graphite app.

* To add a member to your team, click `Invite your teammates`; once they accept the invitation, they will appear in your team membership list.

* Edit a team member's role by selecting either "Admin" or "Member" next to their name.

  * Graphite admins can make anyone in their organization a Graphite admin (even if they're not an owner in GitHub).

  * Graphite admins can change Graphite admins (who aren't GitHub owners) to "Member" status. This means GitHub owners are always Graphite admins (and this is immutable).

* To remove a member from your team, click the `...` icon next to their name and select `Remove from team`.

* To restrict a team member's access to read-only mode, click the `...` icon next to their name and select `Restrict access`. Admins can be in read-only mode and retain their admin privileges (e.g., manage billing info).

## Request to join

Request to Join is an Enterprise-only feature that gives workspace admins greater control over billing and seat management. When enabled, it limits the number of users that can join your workspace based on your contracted number of seats with Graphite. Once the workspace reaches this limit, any additional teammates attempting to join will need to request admin approval before gaining access. Admins can enable or disable this setting from the billing settings page, and will receive email notifications when teammates submit join requests. Pending requests can be approved or denied directly from the billing settings or via email.

## Manage billing

Graphite subscriptions are managed through the Stripe billing portal, found at *Settings* > [*Billing*](https://app.graphite.com/settings/billing) > *Manage plan*. Anyone in your org can pay through the billing portal, and the person who manages Graphite payments for your org can update the previous payment method.
