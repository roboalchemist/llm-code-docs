## Why You Should Use Graphite

> One end-to-end tool to simplify and accelerate your team’s developer workflow.

Teams that use stacked pull requests deliver high quality software faster. Graphite is the integrated developer platform that helps teams on GitHub stack.

Graphite puts developer experience first, giving you all of the features you’ve been missing on GitHub: stacked pull requests, intelligent notifications, an advanced, filtered PR inbox, and a completely redesigned CLI that automates tedious complexity like squashing and rebasing.

“Stacking” with Graphite empowers you to:

* **Stay unblocked**. With [stacking](https://stacking.dev), you can keep moving forward and never wait for a code review again.

* **Upgrade from vanilla Git**. Create pull requests much faster and [automate away tedious Git complexity](/comparing-git-and-gt) such as squashing, rebasing, and cleaning up stale branches.

* **Get even more out of the tools you love**. Easily manage stacks of PRs with a [CLI](/cli-overview), web app, and [VS Code extension](/vs-code-extension) that are built for speed and simplicity.

* **Stay on top of feedback & review requests**. Filter out the noise with targeted, actionable [notifications in Slack](/slack-notifications) when you need to act on a PR.

With Graphite, engineers spend more time shipping code and less time wrestling with their workflow.

## Graphite is built for teams

Graphite is designed to make your developer experience even better as your team grows. And with real-time syncing with GitHub, you can use Graphite even if the rest of your team doesn’t yet.

Among active users, we see an **overall decrease of 65% in time elapsed between merged pull requests** once they start using Graphite. Across companies, we found that it takes on average **16% less time before a PR is reviewed**, compared to before they started using Graphite.

Fast-growing companies like Ramp, say [it’s significantly easier to review PRs](https://graphite.com/customer/ramp) with Graphite because you’re only looking at the portion of the PR that’s relevant to you.

### Write better code with Graphite

* **High-quality code review**: stacking encourages smaller pull requests, meaning less context is needed for reviewers to provide meaningful feedback.

* **Faster code review**: you can see the PRs awaiting your review either through the [PR inbox](/use-pr-inbox) or customizable and actionable Slack notifications.

* **A “greener” trunk branch**: Graphite's stack-aware [Merge Queue](/graphite-merge-queue) helps teams ship faster while keeping their trunk branch green.

* **Useful metrics:** with everyone using Graphite, your team can see how your [Insights](/insights) (like number of review cycles until merge, or time until review) improve over time.

* **Memes!** add color to code review with your own [memes and GIFs](/memes-and-macros#upload-new-memes).

### How to help your team get started

It’s easy to share Graphite with your teammates. Use the *Invite others* option in the bottom left of the Graphite App to send a link or email invitation.

You can also set up a demo! [Reach out to our Sales team here](https://graphite.com/contact-us) to schedule.
