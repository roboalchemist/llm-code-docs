# Code Indexing Security

> Graphite offers a secure code-indexing service which improves the performance of platform features. This feature is opt-in and no AI is trained on your data.

Code Indexing connects to your code repositories to dramatically improve the speed and completeness of Graphite features. You can read more about the feature [here](/code-indexing). This feature is **opt-in** and **is not used to train on your data**.

We know that your source code is one of your most valuable assets, which is why we handle it with the highest level of care:

* By default, this feature is **disabled**. It must be explicitly enabled by an organization administrator.
* Neither we nor our subprocessors use your code to train any AI models.
* Your data is kept in a dedicated environment, logically isolated from all other customers.
* All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, as outlined in our commitment to data protection.

We are committed to protecting your data and privacy. Upon an administrator disabling Code Indexing through the [settings page](https://app.graphite.com/settings/code-indexing) or deleting your organization, all indexed data will be deleted within 30 days.
