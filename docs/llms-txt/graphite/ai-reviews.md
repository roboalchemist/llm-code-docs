# AI Reviews

> Catch bugs before they ship to production with AI code review

AI reviews powered by Graphite Agent help your team build better software by automatically reviewing pull requests and catching bugs before they ship.

## How AI reviews help your team

AI reviews analyze every pull request in your repositories, identifying potential issues and suggesting fixes instantly - no manual configuration required. AI reviews help your team:

* **Ship faster**: Reduce review cycles and speed up the merge process
* **Fix bugs early**: Catch logic issues, edge cases, and performance problems before they reach production
* **Improve code quality**: Get actionable feedback that makes your codebase more robust
* **Reduce incidents**: Prevent bugs that cause outages or customer-facing issues

## What makes AI reviews different

Unlike other code review tools, AI reviews:

* **Focuses on real bugs** - not just style issues or best practices
* **Understands context** - analyzes your entire codebase to provide relevant feedback
* **Provides actionable suggestions** - shows exactly how to fix issues, not just what's wrong
* **Learns from feedback** - improves based on how your team interacts with comments
