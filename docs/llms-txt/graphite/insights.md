Graphite's goal is to improve engineering efficiency. Graphite Insights helps measure and improve that efficiency through transparent, customizable stats.

Insights allows you to create, save, and share custom views with your queries. You can look at activity for yourself and your team members. This transparency aims to give all team members the benefit of data—regardless of their role on the team.

### Adjust the Insights time period

The statistics that are shown on the Insights page are aggregated over a specific time period. Graphite provides four fixed time periods for your convenience: the past week, month, quarter, or year. You also have the option to input a custom time period.

Each Graphite plan includes a defined sync period for historical GitHub data. The Starter plan includes insights going back up to 2 months. The Standard and Enterprise plans include up to 2 years.

### Select users

You also have the ability to filter and view insights for specific people or groups of people, as well as the aggregate across your entire organization.
