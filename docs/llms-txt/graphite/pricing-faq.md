# Pricing FAQ

> Your pricing questions, answered.

### **I need help convincing my team to pay. What should I do?**

We have plenty of resources for Graphite champions. Here are a few:

* Documentation on **[why your team should use Graphite](https://graphite.com/docs/why-you-should-use-graphite)**
* Case studies that show [**how Graphite improved developer productivity**](https://graphite.com/customers) at Asana, Ramp, and Shopify.
* [**Schedule a Graphite demo**](https://graphite.com/contact-us) for your team!

### **Do you have an individual tier?**

We have a Hobby tier on personal repositories with these features:

* GitHub sync with personal repos
* Inbox/Notifications
* CLI/VSCode/MCP
* AI PR titles and descriptions
* Limited AI Chat
* Limited AI reviews

### **When does my trial end?**

Your trial ends either 30 days after it began or when you upgrade, whichever comes first.

### **What happens if my trial ends, and I haven’t upgraded?**

If one of your trials ends and you haven’t upgraded to the **Starter** or **Team** plans, your workspace will lose access to Graphite features. If you're using Graphite with your personal repositories, your workspace will be placed into the free **Hobby** tier which gives you limited access to Graphite.

### **What Graphite features are available for each tier?**

You can find a breakdown of features in the **Starter**, **Team**, or **Enterprise** plans in the pricing and plans doc or our pricing page.

### Does Graphite offer plans for startups?

Early stage startups can apply to our Startup plan. If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a \$1500 credit (6 months of Team for ≤ 5 seats). After your credit expires (or is used), you’ll be automatically upgraded to the **Team** plan.

You can read more about the Startup plan [here](https://graphite.com/docs/graphite-for-startups).

### **My project is open source and doesn’t have significant funding. Can I use Graphite for free?**

Reach out to our team at [billing@graphite.com](mailto:billing@graphite.com) to check your eligibility. Please include the link to the GitHub org, link to the website, and a brief description of the project.

### **What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept payment for the Starter and Team plans via credit card. Billing is managed via Stripe.

### Can someone who doesn’t use Graphite pay for my subscription?

Yes. Click `Select a plan` in organization billing settings for the product you wish to purchase. Then, copy the URL of the Stripe portal (starts with `https://billing.graphite.com`), and send it to whoever is making the purchase.

### **How do I purchase a specific number of seats?**

As you add members to your team, Graphite will automatically calculate the number of seats to bill. We do not currently support adding “empty” seats to a team or setting a seat cap. Admins can manage seats by manually adding and removing users.

### **Who is on my Graphite team?**

Anyone who joins your workspace on Graphite, or whose PR is [reviewed by Graphite Agent](/ai-reviews), is considered a member of your team.

### **What is “advanced” Merge Queue?**

If you have sophisticated merge queue needs that aren’t met by the Team plan, [reach out to our sales team](https://graphite.com/contact-us) to learn more.
