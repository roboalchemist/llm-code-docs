# Page templates reference

 

This document is a reference to the elements of the Page Template XML format. Refer to the [Introduction to Page Templates](../../querying/page-templates.html).

A page template describes a particular way or set of ways of organizing data from some sources on a page. It has the following structure:

```
<[page](#page)id="[[id]](#id)">_\<!-- The top-level section of this page --\>_[page-element]*
</page>
```

…where each `[page-element]` is one of:

\<[section](#section)\>[page-element]\*\</section\>_A nested section (screen area)_\<[source](#source) name="[source-name]"\> [renderer]\* [parameter]\* \</source\>_A data source which should be placed in this section_\<[renderer](#renderer) name="[renderer-name]"\> [parameter]\* \</renderer\>_The renderer to use for the source or section containing this_\<[choice](#choice)\> [map] or [page-element]/[alternative]\* \</choice\>_A choice between alternative page elements resolved at runtime_\<placeholder id="[id]"/\>_an element to be replaced by a map item at runtime_\<[include](#include) idref="[page-id]"\>/\>_Include the page elements contained in another page_

where the nested elements above are:

\<parameter name="[name]"\>[value]\</parameter\>_A parameter of the owning element. Renderer parameters are sent as-is to the frontend in the result. Source parameters are sent to the source by setting the query parameter`source.[sourceName].[name]`._\<alternative\> [page-element]\* \</alternative\>_multiple page elements constituting one choice alternative_\<[map](#map) to="placeholder-id1 placeholder-id2 …"\> [page-element]/[item]\* \</alternative\>_a mapping of some page elements to placeholders_\<[item](#item)\> [page-element]\* \</item\>_multiple page elements which should all map to one placeholder_

All tags may also include a `description` attribute to document the use of the tag. Tags and attributes are described in detail in the following.

## id

An id has the format:

```
id ::= name(:major(.minor(.micro(.qualifier)?)?)?)?
name ::=_identifier_major ::=_integer_minor ::=_integer_micro ::=_integer_qualifier ::=_identifier_
```

Any omitted numeric version component missing is taken to mean 0, while a missing qualifier is taken to mean the empty string.

## page

The root tag of a page template. Defines a page, is also its root section. Attributes and subtags are the same as for [section](#section), with the exception that the `id` attribute is mandatory for a page.

## section

A representation of an area of screen real-estate. At runtime a section will contain content from various sources. The final renderer will render the section with its data items and/or subsections in an area of screen real-estate determined by its containing tag.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | A unique identifier of this section used for referring. | _No id_ |
| layout | An identifier. Permissible values are `row`, `column` and any additional layouts supported by the renderer i of the returned page. | `column` |
| region | An identifier. The permissible values, and whether this is mandatory is determined by the particular layout identifier of the containing section (`row` and `column` does not specify any region identifiers). | _None_ |
| source | A space-separated set of sources permissible within this. This is a shorthand for defining sources as subtags. The total source list of this section consists of both the sources listed here and as subtags. | _All sources are permissible if none are specified._ |
| max | The maximum number of items permissible within this section (including any subsections). Regardless of the blending method used, the most relevant items are kept. | _Unrestricted_ |
| min | The minimum number of items desired within this. | _Unrestricted_ |
| order | The method of ordering to use on the items displayed in this container. This may be any [sorting specification](sorting-language.html) over the fields of the hits, plus the source name and relevance score, for example `[source]
      -[relevance] category` to group by source, sort each group primarily by decreasing relevance and secondarily by the "category" field. The `[source]` identifier will sort sources by the order in which they are listed in the template in use. | |

## source

A data source whose data should be placed in the containing section.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | The name of this source. | _Mandatory_ |
| url | The url of this source. If this is set, the data of this source is _not_ fetched, but instead the source tag (with url) will appear in the returned page such that the frontend may fetch it. This is provided primarily as a migration path, as such data can not be inspected and processed to optimize the returned page. | _No url: Fetch this configured source from the container._ |

## renderer

A renderer to use to render a section of a data item (hit) of a particular type.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | The name of this renderer. | _Mandatory_ |
| for | The name of a hit type or a source this is the renderer for. | _If in a section: This is the renderer for the whole section.  
If in a source: This is the default renderer for hits from this source._ |

## choice

A choice between multiple alternative (lists of) page elements. A resolver chooses between the possible alternatives for each request at runtime. The `alternative` tag is used to enclose an alternative. If an alternative consists of just one page element tag, the enclosing alternative tag may be skipped.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| method | the name of the method for making the choice. Must be supported by the optimizer in use. | _Any method_ |

### Contained tags

Either:

| Tag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [page-element] | An alternative consisting of a single page element. | 0-n |
| alternative | An alternative consisting of multiple page elements. | 0-n |

or

| Tag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [map](#map) | Specify all alternatives as a single mapping function. | 0-1 |

## map

Specify all the alternatives of a choice as a mapping function of elements to placeholders. A map is a convenience shorthand of writing many alternatives in the case where a collection of elements should be mapped to a set of placeholders with the constraint that each placeholder should get a unique element. This is useful e.g. in the case where a set of sources are to be mapped to a set of sections.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to | A space-separated list of the placeholder id's the map values should be mapped to. There cannot be more placeholder id's than there are values in this map (but fewer is ok). |

| Contained Tags | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [page-element] | A map item consisting of a single page element to map to a placeholder. | 0-n |
| item | 

An item containing multiple page elements to be mapped to a single placeholder.

 | 0-n |

## include

Includes the page elements contained directly in the `page` element in the given page template (the page tag itself is not included). Inclusion works exactly as if the `include` tag was literally replaced by the content of the included page.

| Attribute | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| idref | The id specification of the page to include. Portions of the version may be left unspecified to get the latest matching version. | _(Mandatory)_ |
