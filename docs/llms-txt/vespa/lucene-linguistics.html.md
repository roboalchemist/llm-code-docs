# Lucene Linguistics

 

Lucene Linguistics is a custom [linguistics](linguistics.html) implementation of the [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org) library. It provides a Lucene analyzer to handle text processing for a language with an optional variation per [stemming mode](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/linguistics/src/main/java/com/yahoo/language/process/StemMode.java).

## Crash course to Lucene text analysis

Lucene [text analysis](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/package-summary.html) is a process of converting text into searchable tokens. This text analysis consists of a series of components applied to the text in order:

- [CharFilters](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/CharFilter.html): transform the text before it is tokenized, while providing corrected character offsets to account for these modifications. 
- [Tokenizers](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Tokenizer.html): responsible for breaking up incoming text into tokens. 
- [TokenFilters](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenFilter.html): responsible for modifying tokens that have been created by the Tokenizer. 

A specific configuration of the above components is wrapped into an [Analyzer](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html) object.

The text analysis works as follows:
1. All char filters are applied in the specified order on the entire text string
2. Token filters in the specified order are applied on each token.

## Defaults language analysis

Lucene Linguistics out-of-the-box exposes the analysis components provided by the [lucene-core](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/index.html) and the [lucene-analysis-common](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/analysis/common/index.html) libraries. Other libraries with Lucene text analysis components (e.g. [analysis-kuromoji](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/analysis/kuromoji/index.html)) can be added to the application package as a Maven dependency.

Lucene Linguistics out-of-the-box provides analyzers for 40 languages:

- Arabic
- Armenian
- Basque
- Bengali
- Bulgarian
- Catalan
- Chinese
- Czech
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Estonian
- Finnish
- French
- Galician
- German
- Greek
- Hindi
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Irish
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Kurdish
- Latvian
- Lithuanian
- Nepali
- Norwegian
- Persian
- Portuguese
- Romanian
- Russian
- Serbian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Tamil
- Telugu
- Thai
- Turkish

The Lucene [StandardAnalyzer](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_8_0/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardAnalyzer.html) is used for the languages that doesn't have a custom nor a default analyzer.

## Linguistics key

Linguistics keys identify a configuration of text analysis. It can be made of two parts, separated by a semicolon, though you can omit one or the other. The two parts are:

- A [linguistics profile](linguistics.html#linguistics-profiles). 
- A language key. 

The language key, in turn, has 2 parts: a mandatory [language code](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/linguistics/src/main/java/com/yahoo/language/Language.java) and an optional stemming mode. The format is `LANGUAGE_CODE[/STEM_MODE]`. There are 5 stemming modes: `NONE, DEFAULT, ALL, SHORTEST, BEST` (they can be specified in the [field schema](../reference/schemas/schemas.html#stemming)).

Examples of linguistics key:

- `profile=whitespaceLowercase`: a profile that applies to all languages. You can bind it to different fields by specifying their [linguistics profiles](linguistics.html#linguistics-profiles) in the schema. 
- `profile=whitespaceLowercase;language=en`: a profile that applies to the English language. You'd still bind it to fields via their [linguistics profiles](linguistics.html#linguistics-profiles) in the schema, but it will only be applied to the English texts (either at indexing or query time). 
- `en`: English language: applies to all English texts where no profile is specified (in the schema or [in the query](linguistics.html#overriding-profile-for-query-strings)). 
- `en/BEST`: English language with the `BEST` stemming mode. Like the previous example, but only applies when [stemming](../reference/schemas/schemas.html#stemming) is set to `BEST`. 

 **Note:** You can use different profiles for document fields and query strings. See [Different processing for query strings](linguistics.html#different-processing-for-query-strings) and the[multiple-profiles sample app](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/lucene-linguistics/multiple-profiles) for more information.

## Customizing text analysis

Lucene linguistics provides multiple ways to customize text analysis per language:

- `LuceneLinguistics` component configuration in the `services.xml`
- `ComponentsRegistry`

### LuceneLinguistics component configuration

In `services.xml` it is possible to construct an analyzer by providing [configuration for the](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/lucene-linguistics/src/main/resources/configdefinitions/lucene-analysis.def)`LuceneLinguistics` component (from all text analysis components that are available on the classpath). Example for the English language:

```
```
<component id="linguistics"
             class="com.yahoo.language.lucene.LuceneLinguistics"
             bundle="your-bundle-name">
    <config name="com.yahoo.language.lucene.lucene-analysis">
      <configDir>lucene-linguistics</configDir>
      <analysis>
        <item key="profile=standardStopStem;language=en">
          <tokenizer>
            <name>standard</name>
          </tokenizer>
          <tokenFilters>
            <item>
              <name>stop</name>
              <conf>
                <item key="words">en/stopwords.txt</item>
                <item key="ignoreCase">true</item>
              </conf>
            </item>
            <item>
              <name>englishMinimalStem</name>
            </item>
          </tokenFilters>
        </item>
      </analysis>
    </config>
  </component>
```
```

Notes:

- `item key="profile=standardStopStem;language=en"` value is a [linguistics key](#linguistics-key). 
- `name` values are the [SPI names](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.naming/javax/naming/spi/package-summary.html) of the text analysis components. You'll typically find them in the [Lucene analysis JavaDocs](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_11_1/analysis/common/allclasses-index.html). For example, the name `stop` along with other options can be found in the [StopFilterFactory JavaDoc](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_11_1/analysis/common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/core/StopFilterFactory.html). 
- The `en/stopwords.txt` file must be placed in your application package under the `lucene-linguistics` directory, which is referenced by the `configDir` option. 
- If `configDir` is not provided the files must be on the classpath. 

### Components registry

The [ComponentsRegistry](../applications/dependency-injection.html#depending-on-all-components-of-a-specific-type) mechanism can be used to set a Lucene Analyzer for a language.

```
```
<component
    id="en"
    class="org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.SimpleAnalyzer"
    bundle="your-bundle-name" />
```
```

Where:

- `id` must be a [linguistics key](#linguistics-key); 
- `class` is the implementation class that extends the `Analyzer` class; 
- `bundle` is a name of the application package as specified in the `pom.xml` (or can be any bundle added to your `components` dir that contains the class). 

For this to work, the class must provide **only** a constructor without arguments.

In case your analyzer class needs some initialization you must wrap the analyzer into a class that implements the `Provider<Analyzer>` class.

### Custom text analysis components

The text analysis components are loaded via Java Service provider interface ([SPI](https://www.baeldung.com/java-spi)).

To use an external library that is properly prepared it is enough to add the library to the application package as a Maven dependency.

In case you need to create a custom component the steps are:

1. Implement a component in a Java class
2. Register the component class in the (e.g. a custom token filter) `META-INF/services/org.apache.lucene.analysis.TokenFilterFactory` file that is on the classpath. 

## Language Detection

Lucene Linguistics doesn't provide language detection. This means that for both feeding and searching you should provide a [language parameter](../reference/api/query.html#model.language).

## Indexing all stems

Some analyzers expand the input text into multiple tokens on the same position. For example, those based on the [NGramTokenFilter](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_11_1/analysis/common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/ngram/NGramTokenFilter.html). Here's a sample analyzer configuration:

```
```
<item key="profile=ngram;language=en">
  <tokenizer>
    <name>whitespace</name>
  </tokenizer>
  <tokenFilters>
    <item>
      <name>nGram</name>
      <conf>
        <item key="minGramSize">2</item>
        <item key="maxGramSize">2</item>
      </conf>
    </item>
  </tokenFilters>
</item>
```
```

This will take a text like `dog` and produce `do` and `og` as tokens, plus (by default) the original `dog`. However, Vespa only takes the first token (`do`) and writes it to the index, ignoring the other "stems". As a result, a search for `og` will not match documents that contain `dog`, which is the whole point of using letter n-grams.

To index all stems, you can use the [stemming](../reference/schemas/schemas.html#stemming) parameter in the schema definition of your field:

```
field title_grams type string {
  indexing: summary | index
  linguistics {
      profile: ngram
  }
  stemming: multiple
}
```

Now, Vespa will index all stems, and a search for `og` will match documents that contain `dog`.

 **Note:** Queries look for all stems by default (regardless of the schema configuration). For example, a search for`dog` would expand to `do` and `og` as well, looking for all three terms.
