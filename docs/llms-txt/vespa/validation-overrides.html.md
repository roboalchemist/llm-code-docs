# validation-overrides.xml

 

_validation-overrides.xml_ is added to the root of an [application package](application-packages.html) (i.e. next to [services.xml](services/services.html)) to allow a deployment that otherwise fails to validate to proceed. The message will explain what the validation concerns and how to add a validation override

Validations protect against inadvertently corrupting a production instance. Overriding them may be useful e.g. if the application is not in production yet or if you think the consequences of inconsistencies or loss of the data in a particular field are fine.

Read more about schema changes in the [schema reference](../schemas/schemas.html#modifying-schemas).

## Structure

```
```
<validation-overrides>
    <allow until="iso-8601-date" comment="Optional note">validation-id</allow>
</validation-overrides>
```
```

Any number of `allow` tags is permissible. Example:

```
```
<validation-overrides>
    <allow
        until="2025-01-31"
        comment="Reduce to needed cluster size after benchmarking">resources-reduction</allow>
    <allow
        until="2025-02-03">field-type-change</allow>
</validation-overrides>
```
```

## allow

An `allow` tag disables a particular validation for a limited time and contains a single validation id. `allow` tags with unknown ids are ignored.

| Attribute | Mandatory | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| until | Yes | The last day this change is allowed, as a ISO-8601-format date in UTC, e.g. 2016-01-30. Dates may at most be 30 days in the future, but should be as close to now as possible for safety, while allowing time for review and propagation to all deployed zones. `allow`-tags with dates in the past are ignored. |
| comment | No | Text explaining the reason for the change to humans. |
