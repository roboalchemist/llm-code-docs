# About this documentation

 

The Vespa documentation ([https://docs.vespa.ai/](https://docs.vespa.ai/)) provides all the information required to use all Vespa features and deploy them in any supported environment.

It is split into guides and tutorials, which explains features and how to use them to solve problems, and reference documentation which list complete information about all features and APIs.

## Applicability

The Vespa platform is open source, and can be deployed in self-managed systems and on the Vespa Cloud service. Some add-ons (but no core functionality) are only available under a commercial license.

Documents that describe functionality with such limited applicability are clearly marked by one or more of the following chips:

| Vespa CloudThis content is applicable to Vespa Cloud deployments. | Only applicable with Vespa Cloud deployments. |
| Self-managedThis content is applicable to self-managed Vespa systems. | Only applicable with self-managed deployments. |
| EnterpriseNot open source: This functionality is only available commercially. | Not open source: Available commercially only (both self-managed and on cloud unless also marked by one of the other chips above). |

  
  

For clarity, any document _not_ marked with any of these chips describes functionality that is open source and available both on with Vespa Cloud and self-managed deployments.
