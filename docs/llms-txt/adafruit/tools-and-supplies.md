# Flora Snaps

## Tools & supplies

First gather your tools and supplies! You will need [teeny tiny 5mm snaps](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1126), a [Flora main board](http://www.adafruit.com/products/659), [conductive thread](http://www.adafruit.com/products/641), and a [needle](http://www.adafruit.com/products/615).  
  
You'll also need some clear nail polish or fray check.

 **Soldering iron**  
  
Any entry level 'all-in-one' soldering iron that you might find at your local hardware store should work. As with most things in life, you get what you pay for.   
Upgrading to a higher end soldering iron setup, like the [Hakko FX-888 that we stock in our store](http://adafruit.com/products/180 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/180"), will make soldering fun and easy.  
<u><br>Do not use a "ColdHeat" soldering iron</u>! They are not suitable for delicate electronics work and can damage the Flora ([see here](http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/cold-soldering2.htm)).

 **Solder**  
  
You will want rosin core, 60/40 solder. Good solder is a good thing. Bad solder leads to bridging and cold solder joints which can be tough to find.

 **Multimeter**  
  
You will need a good quality basic multimeter that can measure voltage and continuity.

Solder wick will help correct any mistakes and adjust the fit of your snaps.

A [Panavise](http://adafruit.com/products/151) is useful, but not strictly necessary.
