# Adafruit Pi Cobbler Kit

## Solder it!

First up, open up your kit and verify you have the components - gray cable, blue PCB, black connector and a stick of male header. The header is breakaway, so it might be one long piece instead of two shorter

![raspberry_pi_ID914parts_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/601/medium640/raspberry_pi_ID914parts_LRG.jpg?1396764419)

![raspberry_pi_t1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/951/medium640/raspberry_pi_t1.jpg?1396804279)

Start by putting the PCB in front of you with the text as shown on the left. Then place the header on top.   
  
**<u>For the classic cobbler: THERE IS A NOTCH IN THE HEADER MAKE SURE ITS RIGHT NEXT TO THE PIN LABELED #21! </u>**  
  
**<u>For the T-cobbler: THERE IS A NOTCH IN THE HEADER MAKE SURE ITS RIGHT NEXT TO TWO HOLES AT THE T JUNCTION<br><br></u>** Its really important to line up the header right, because otherwise the pins will be reversed, making the cobbler useless

![raspberry_pi_idcplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/602/medium640/raspberry_pi_idcplace.jpg?1396764425)

![raspberry_pi_tnot.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/952/medium640/raspberry_pi_tnot.jpg?1396804287)

Flip over the two pieces so they are resting on the black header.

![raspberry_pi_tflip.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/953/medium640/raspberry_pi_tflip.jpg?1396804298)

With your soldering iron heated up to 700 degrees F, and some solder, heat up each ring/pin pair for 2 seconds, then poke the end of the solder in to melt it in and make a strong electrical and mechanical connection. Then pull the solder away. Finally remove the iron.   
  
Repeat for all 26 pins!

![raspberry_pi_idcsolder1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/604/medium640/raspberry_pi_idcsolder1.jpg?1396764441)

![raspberry_pi_idcsoldered.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/606/medium640/raspberry_pi_idcsoldered.jpg?1396764456)

![raspberry_pi_tsolder1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/954/medium640/raspberry_pi_tsolder1.jpg?1396804309)

![raspberry_pi_tsolder2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/955/medium640/raspberry_pi_tsolder2.jpg?1396804320)

Next break the long piece of header into two 13 pin pieces. You can do this with diagonal cutters, pliers or your fingers

![raspberry_pi_headerbreak.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/607/medium640/raspberry_pi_headerbreak.jpg?1396764464)

![raspberry_pi_thead.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/956/medium640/raspberry_pi_thead.jpg?1396804332)

The easiest way to align the pins is to plug them into a solder-less breadboard as shown, with the LONG ends down into the breadboard.   
  
Then place the cobbler PCB on top so that the short ends of the header stick through the 26 pads on either side of the connector. If the PCB doesn't slip right on, check that you have the pins aligned and spaced right. It doesn't matter which way the PCB is oriented on the breadboard.

![raspberry_pi_headerplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/608/medium640/raspberry_pi_headerplace.jpg?1396764477)

![raspberry_pi_bbplace.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/610/medium640/raspberry_pi_bbplace.jpg?1396764494)

![raspberry_pi_tnext.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/957/medium640/raspberry_pi_tnext.jpg?1396804343)

![raspberry_pi_ttop.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/958/medium640/raspberry_pi_ttop.jpg?1396804358)

Solder each of the 26 pads just like you did with the connector before.

![raspberry_pi_bbsolder1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/611/medium640/raspberry_pi_bbsolder1.jpg?1396764484)

![raspberry_pi_bbsoldered.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/613/medium640/raspberry_pi_bbsoldered.jpg?1396764514)

![raspberry_pi_tsolder1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/960/medium640/raspberry_pi_tsolder1.jpg?1396804377)

That's it! Now you can turn off the soldering iron and plug the IDC cable. Note that one wire of the cable has a red stripe. That's pin #1. Because the cobbler connector has that notch, you can only put it in the right way (whew!)  
  
<u><b>However, it is possible to put the cable in upside down on the Raspberry Pi! Check the images on the left to verify that the stripe is on the edge closest to the SD card!</b><br><br></u>_Note that the stripe may be red (gray cable) or white (black cable)_
