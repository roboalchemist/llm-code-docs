# Wave Shield Voice Changer

## Tips for Use in Costumes

- Give your project a complete dry run well ahead of time…don’t dash right off to the party!&nbsp;Know how long batteries will last. Check that&nbsp;wires aren’t pulled and connections aren’t strained. Make sure no components get&nbsp;uncomfortably or dangerously hot.&nbsp;Fine-tune audio levels and reduce feedback.
- Build it extra rugged and&nbsp;motion-proof. Stranded wire flexes much better than solid-core wire. Use beefy, [NASA-style inline splices](http://blog.makezine.com/2012/02/28/how-to-splice-wire-to-nasa-standards/). Implement strain reliefs to avoid cracked solder connections. Breadboards are fine for prototyping, but [solder up&nbsp;your rig for deployment](http://adafruit.com/products/591 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/591").
- Don’t shout — speak softly and let the amplifier boost your voice. You want people to hear the “bent” sound, not your natural voice.
- Point speakers away from the microphone to avoid feedback. Even a few degrees can make a big difference.
- Sweat is horribly corrosive stuff! It’s mostly salt water — and&nbsp;look what that does to ships at sea. Even worse, it’s <u>conductive</u>!&nbsp;Seal&nbsp;_everything._&nbsp;Heat-shrink all wire connections,&nbsp;and use plastic enclosures or epoxy&nbsp;for any electronics that are&nbsp;fully inside a costume. If using a microphone inside a mask (which may have both&nbsp;sweat&nbsp;_and_&nbsp;condensation from breath, ewww!), borrow an old audio pro trick and wrap the mic inside a balloon.  
- Pack spare batteries and, space permitting, a minimal repair kit of safety pins, a few zip ties and a length of duct tape.  
- Never let technical wizardry get in the way of a good performance! The example sketch uses a membrane keypad with many&nbsp;tiny buttons…that’s fine for a tabletop “sound board” instrument, but a poor choice&nbsp;for a&nbsp;Godzilla suit&nbsp;(who really should be continually thrashing about leveling Tokyo, not standing still to hunt around for a specific button). More isn’t always better…one or two buttons hidden in a glove may suffice. Practice until your performance is&nbsp;natural and your technology is&nbsp;discreet.
