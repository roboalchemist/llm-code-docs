# Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)

## Connecting to an FSR

Because FSRs are basically resistors, they are non-polarized. That means you can connect them up 'either way'a and they'll work just fine!FSRs are often a polymer with conductive material silk-screened on. That means they're plastic and the connection tab is crimped on somewhat delicate material. The best way to connect to these is to simply plug them into a breadboard.![force___flex_FSRbb.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/431/medium640/force___flex_FSRbb.jpg?1396762959)

or use a clamp-style connector like alligator clips, or a&nbsp;female header.![force___flex_fsrhead.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/432/medium640/force___flex_fsrhead.jpg?1396762967)

or a terminal block such as&nbsp;[Phoenix #1881448](http://mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvXvCN7QvKasXNwb4IufXV%2fCdHopRH7bbg%3d)![force___flex_fsrterminal.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/433/medium640/force___flex_fsrterminal.jpg?1396762972)

It is possible to solder onto the tabs but&nbsp;_you must be very fast_&nbsp;because if your iron is not good quality or you dally even a few seconds, you will melt the plastic and ruin the FSR!&nbsp; **Don't attempt to solder directly to your FSR unless you are absolutely sure you have the skills to do so.** - [Previous Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr/testing-an-fsr.md)

### Terminal Block - 2-pin 3.5mm - pack of 5!

[Terminal Block - 2-pin 3.5mm - pack of 5!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/724)
Nothing makes a project harder to maintain than a lot of loose wiring. That's why we like to use terminal blocks whenever making PCB-to-Wire connections. These particular 3.5mm terminal blocks are our favorite: big enough for a range of wire gauges, easy to adjust with a screwdriver, and...
