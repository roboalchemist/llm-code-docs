# How to Make a Pogo Pin Test Jig

## Overview

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/520/medium800/manufacturing_pogoears.jpeg?1396784015)

If you end up buying a pick and place to assemble PCBs (or even if you're doing it by hand) you'll need to test out your boards! If you have an assembler do it for you, its still probably a good idea to have a jig you can give them. A good jig will tell you whats going right and whats going wrong.

In this tutorial I will show how I designed a very basic jig with a "tested good" audible indicator. The board its testing is very simple but the basic premise can be expanded to large projects with ease.
