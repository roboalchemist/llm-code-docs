# FLORA TV-B-Gone

## Fabric pinwheel

The functional circuit is quite attractive as-is, but it's pretty conspicuous. You can dress it up however you like! Below is just one example.

You can make a fabric yoyo and install it right over the pushbutton in the center of the Flora. There are dozens of [fabric yoyo tutorials](http://kangacreative.blogspot.com/2011/05/easy-peasy-fabric-yoyo-tutorial.html) online!

Apply an adhesive pinback to the front side of the Flora board. Be careful to avoid obscuring the Flora's on/off switch.

### 3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST

[3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST](https://www.adafruit.com/product/727)
This battery holder connects 3 AAA batteries together in series for powering all kinds of projects. We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes...
