# DIY WiFi Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Camera

## Assembling Enclosure

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/014/267/medium800/raspberry_pi_open-case-parts.jpg?1392319529)

## Mounting Pi Cam

Start by adding a piece of tape to the back of the camera's PCB, to prevent any shorts. Use a short ribbon cable and flip it over to the back of the Pi, covering the ethernet port.   
  
Position the camera with the camera hole in the pitouch-cover.stl part. Align it up so the nubs snap into the left and right mounting holes of the pi cam. Press fit the cover into the **pitouch-top** part.  
  
Position the **pitouch-top** part over the Raspberry Pi and angle it down so the SD card slot slips into the proper opening of the pitouch part.

**Note:** The camera in the photo is plugged into the incorrect port.

## Adding Lenses

Snap the **pitouch-camring** part into the camera hole of the **pitouch-top** part. Insert a 12mm split ring into the **pitouch-camring**. The photojojo lens use magnets for mount and connects to the split ring.

## Mounting the Raspberry Pi and Touch Screen
With the camera and pi mounted to the **pitouch-top** part, flip the the body and place the **pitouch-bottom** part over the touch screen. Press the **pitouch-bottom** part down snapping the parts together.![raspberry_pi_FM1A8180.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/014/307/medium640/raspberry_pi_FM1A8180.jpg?1392325483)

## Adding Side Bands and Tripod Mount
You can optionally add a tripod mount and grippy bumpers. The Tripod mount can be attached to the bottom of the camera body with 4 small screws. Align up the holes and add screws. Add a standard tripod nut to the bottom of the tripod for attaching to other tripod mounts. ![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/014/312/medium800/raspberry_pi_touchscreen.jpg?1392326306)

## Upload, Share and Make
Plug in power to the micro-USB port and photos to your hearts content! If you do make one, please be sure to snap a picture of your creation and click the "[I Made One](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:244361/add_instance "Link: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:244361/add\_instance")" button to our [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:244361/ "Link: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:244361/") design so we can feature it on our blog!
