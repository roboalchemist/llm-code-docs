## Necessary Packages

# Update Your Pi to the Latest Raspbian
Your Pi will need to be running the latest version of Raspbian. This tutorial was written using Raspbian Stretch (Nov. 2018). Checkout our guide for&nbsp;[Preparing an SD Card for your Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-lesson-1-preparing-and-sd-card-for-your-raspberry-pi)&nbsp;if you have not done so already. After the installation is complete be sure and run the following commands to make sure your packages are up to date.&nbsp;

```
$ sudo apt-get install update -y
$ sudo apt-get install upgrade -y
```

# Install pip3
pip3 is already installed with a full Raspbian installation, but the Raspbian Lite does not include pip3 so it needs to be installed as shown below.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

```

# Install adafruit-blinka
```
$ sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka
```

# Install imapclient
```
sudo pip3 install imapclient
```
