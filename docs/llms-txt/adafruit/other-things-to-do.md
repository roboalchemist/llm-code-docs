# Arduino Lesson 3. RGB LEDs

## Other Things to Do

- Try putting a ping-pong ball over the LED  
- Try changing the delays to speed up or slow down the color changing  

There are lots of things you can do with RGB LEDs. Check out some of the projects on the Internet using RGB LEDs and you will find multi-color persistence of vision devices, as well as all sorts of lighting effects.&nbsp;

### Diffused RGB (tri-color) LED

[Diffused RGB (tri-color) LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/159)
Diffused 5mm tri-color LED with separate red, green and blue LED chips inside! Nice indicator, and fun to color-swirl. 60 degree viewing angle. We like diffused RGB LEDs because they color mix inside instead of appearing as 3 distinct LEDs.

These are Common-Anode type which means you...
