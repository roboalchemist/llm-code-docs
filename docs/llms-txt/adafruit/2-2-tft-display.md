# 2.2" TFT Display

## Overview

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/049/581/medium800/arduino_compatibles_1480-00.jpg?1513980592)

This lovely little display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. Even a very small one with low memory and few pins available!

Warning:

This display comes with an EYESPI connector! This 18-pin 0.5mm pitch FPC connector has a flip-top connector for using a flex cable to hook up your display. It enables you to avoid soldering and get your display up off of the breadboard! Consider it a sort of "STEMMA QT for displays" - a way to quickly connect and extend display wiring that uses a lot of SPI pins. It also allows for communicating with displays over longer distances. The [EYESPI flex cables](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=eyespi+cable&sort=BestMatch) are available in multiple lengths to suit any project. This is especially useful for projects where you want your display mounted separate from your microcontroller.

The 2.2" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost "Nokia 6110" and similar LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340) can display full 16-bit color. And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other.

The breakout has the TFT display soldered on (it uses a delicate flex-circuit connector) as well as a ultra-low-dropout 3.3V regulator and a 3/5V level shifter so you can use it with 3.3V or 5V power and logic. We also had a little space so we placed a microSD card holder so you can easily load full color bitmaps from a FAT16/FAT32 formatted microSD card. The microSD card is not included [but you can pick one up here](http://www.adafruit.com/products/102 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/102").
