# Sitcom SFX Door Trigger

## Test it

Now its testing time. The Pi looks for the two sensor inputs: the first one is the magnetic door switch, when that opens it knows that someone is entering or leaving. The PIR sensor is used to tell what side of the door they're on - that's what determines which WAV to play.  
  
Here's a little video of my roommate trying out both entering and leaving:

### Magnetic contact switch (door sensor)

[Magnetic contact switch (door sensor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/375)
This sensor is essentially a reed switch, encased in an ABS plastic shell. Normally the reed is 'open' (no connection between the two wires). The other half is a magnet. When the magnet is less than 13mm (0.5") away, the reed switch closes. They're often used to detect when a...
