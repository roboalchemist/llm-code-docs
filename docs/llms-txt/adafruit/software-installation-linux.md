# Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Lesson 5. Using a Console Cable

## Software Installation (Linux)

Linux Kernels 2.4.31 and above already have the PL2303 and CP210X USB driver for the Console Lead built-in, so you should not need to install that.  
  
Some distributions such as Ubuntu 12.10 do not include the "screen" command. Try running the command "screen" and if you get an error message, you can install it by typing the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install screen
```
