Arduino is a great starting point for electronics, and with a motor shield it can also be a nice tidy platform for robotics and mechatronics. Here is a design for a full-featured motor shield that will be able to power many simple to medium-complexity projects.

- **2 connections for 5V 'hobby' servos** &nbsp;connected to the Arduino's high-resolution dedicated timer - no jitter!
- **Up to 4 bi-directional DC** &nbsp;motors with individual 8-bit speed selection (so, about 0.5% resolution)
- **Up to 2 stepper motors** &nbsp;(unipolar or bipolar) with single coil, double coil, interleaved or micro-stepping.
- 4 H-Bridges: L293D chipset provides 0.6A per bridge (1.2A peak) with thermal shutdown protection, 4.5V to 25V
- Pull down resistors keep motors disabled during power-up
- Big terminal block connectors to easily hook up wires (10-22AWG) and power
- Arduino reset button brought up top
- 2-pin terminal block to connect external power, for seperate logic/motor supplies
- Tested compatible with Mega, Diecimila, & Duemilanove
- [Full kit available for purchase from the Adafruit shop.](http://adafruit.com/products/81 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/81")

We sure love the ATmega328 here at Adafruit, and we use them&nbsp;_a lot_&nbsp;for our own projects. The processor has plenty of GPIO, Analog inputs, hardware UART SPI and I2C, timers and PWM galore - just enough for most simple projects. When we need to go small, we use a <a...></a...>
