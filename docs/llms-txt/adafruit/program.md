# FLORA Pixel Brooch

## Program

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/739/medium800/flora_PB282303b.jpg?1396786489)

Connect the FLORA to your computer with a USB cable.

# For version 2 pixels:
Install the [NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) and go to File--\>Examples--\>Adafruit\_NeoPixel--\>strandtest.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/009/701/medium800/flora_Screen_Shot_2013-05-14_at_2.48.57_PM_%282%29.png?1396895574)

The example sketch is set for 60 pixels, so you can change "Adafruit\_NeoPixel(60...);" to "Adafruit\_NeoPixel(3...);" if you like, but it will still work just fine with the defaults. This sketch will animate through all colors and is a good test. Be sure this sketch lights up your pixels before making any modifications to the code.

# For version 1 pixels:
In the Adafruit IDE, open up the Smart Pixels sample code-- go to File--\>Examples--\>Adafruit\_FloraPixel--\>floratest. Check out our "[Getting Started with Flora](http://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/overview)" tutorial for more info on the software.

The example sketch is set for eight pixels, so you can change "Adafruit\_FloraPixel(8);" to "Adafruit\_FloraPixel(3);" if you like, but it will still work just fine with the defaults. This sketch will animate through all colors and is a good test. Be sure this sketch lights up your pixels before making any modifications to the code.
