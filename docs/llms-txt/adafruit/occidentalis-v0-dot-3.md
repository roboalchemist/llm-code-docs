# Adafruit Raspberry Pi Educational Linux Distro

## Occidentalis v0.3

Its been a few years since we released Occidentalis. At the time, the standard Raspbian distribution was still very young and we found a lot of ways to add more hardware support.

However, nowadays Raspbian is quite mature as software goes and has integrated a lot of the modifications!

[So, instead of trying to keep up with continuous Raspbian releases, we created a Pi Bootstrapper, a program that you can run on your computer (or Pi) which will install a lot of our favorite tools and support for you!
