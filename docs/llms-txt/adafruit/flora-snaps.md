# Flora Snaps

## Overview

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDwmnfpjlno

The small 5mm size of these tin-plated brass snaps means they fit perfectly on Flora's pads! Snaps make a great connector for wearables-- solder one side to the board and sew the other to your project with conductive thread. Easily disconnect your Flora for use in multiple projects, or remove it prior to machine washing.
