## Cut Fabric

Pin the pattern to your fabric. You want four pieces total, so here I have pinned and cut two layers at a time and I will repeat on a different area of fabric.

If your fabric is big enough, you can cut all four layers at once, or cut four layers with the shoulder seam (marked on the pattern) on the fold.

Get ready to sew at the shoulder seam if you didn't cut it on the fold-- make two stacks of two fabric layers each.
