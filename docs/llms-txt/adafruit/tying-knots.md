## Tying knots

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/214/medium800/flora_DSC_0107.jpg?1396793917)

Before cutting anything, tie the threads in a tight square knot at the back of the fabric.

Seal this knot by applying a drop of clear nail polish or Fray Check.

When dry, trim the tail end of the thread very closely to the sealed knot. Now you can continue stitching with the long tail to connect up different parts of your circuit!
