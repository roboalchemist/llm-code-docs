# Matrix and 7-Segment LED Backpack with the Raspberry Pi

## 14-Segment Alphanumeric Display

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/080/622/medium800/led_matrices_alpha.jpg?1567810579)

## CircuitPython Code
The 14 segment alphanumeric display is demonstrated in the&nbsp; **alphanum4\_test.py** &nbsp;script in the examples folder. If you run this example it will scroll a text message across the display. The message if followed by a run down of various integer, decimal, hex and character values. This display is great for showing complete text messages because the 14 segment displays are very flexible.  
  
With the 14 segment display the usage is very similar to the 7 segment display above.
