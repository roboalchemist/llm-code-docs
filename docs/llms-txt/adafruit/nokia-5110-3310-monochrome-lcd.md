This is a quick tutorial for our 84x48 pixel monochrome LCD display. These displays are small, only about 1.5" diameter, but very readable due and comes with a backlight. This display is made of 84x48 individual pixels, so you can use it for graphics, text or bitmaps. These displays are inexpensive, easy to use, require only a few digital I/O pins and are fairly low power as well.  
  
To drive the display, you will need 3 to 5 digital output pins (depending on whether you want to manually control the chip select and reset lines). Another pin can be used to control (via on/off or PWM) the backlight. **To make things easy for you, we've written a nice graphics library that can print text, pixels, rectangles, circles and lines!** The library is written for the Arduino but can easily be ported to your favorite microcontroller.  
  
**[You can pick up one of these displays at the adafruit shop!](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37&products_id=338)**
