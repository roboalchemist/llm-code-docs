# DIY 8x2 LCD Shield

## Check Out the Pins

The first step is to turn over the LCD and check out the pins. Parallel LCDs almost always have 14 or 16 pins. In this model they are all the way to the left, near the label J1. I soldered 2 7-pin female headers for e-z plugging. Somtimes the pins are along the bottom all in a row.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/951/medium800/lcds___displays_lcdrev.jpg?1396767363)

Look closely at the header for the numbers that show which pins are which. In this model, the first pin is at the top right, the second pin is top left, etc till pin 14 in the bottom left.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/952/medium800/lcds___displays_lcdpins.jpg?1396767370)

When the LCD is flipped over, the pinout will be&nbsp;_mirrored_ **,&nbsp;** to help me keep track of it, I made a diagram:| **1** | **2** |

Whatever your pinout is, make sure you have a diagram written out since you will need to refer to it many times!- [Previous Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-8x2-lcd-shield/overview-and-parts.md)

[Solid-Core Wire Spool - 25ft - 22AWG - Yellow](https://www.adafruit.com/product/289)
Perfect for bread-boarding, free wiring, etc. This spool of solid-core wire is easy to solder to. When bent it keeps its shape pretty well. We like to have a few spools of this stuff around. We suggest picking up wire strippers to match. Wire gauge is 22 AWG which we've found is the best...

### Adafruit Proto Shield for Arduino Kit

[Adafruit Proto Shield for Arduino Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/51)
Works with the Uno! This prototyping shield is the best out there (well, we think so, at least). It works with UNO, NG, Diecimila and Duemilanove Arduinos. You can use it with a Leonardo but it will not break out the hardware SPI pins (they're only on the ISP connector underneath) or the...
