# Playing sounds and using buttons with Raspberry Pi

## Circuit Diagram

All Raspberry Pi versions released to date can use the CircuitPython wiring below. We have used the same GPIO pins 23, 24 and 25 as they are available on Raspberry Pi v1, v2, v3 and Zeros. It does not matter if your cobbler is a 40-pin version or the earlier 26-pin version.

# CircuitPython T-Cobbler

Note that we are not using pull up resistors and do not need to connect to the 3.3v rail. We can do direct pin to button and button to GND connections with CircuitPython configuration.
