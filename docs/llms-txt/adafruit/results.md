# Light Painting with Raspberry Pi

## Results

These first images were&nbsp;cobbled together pretty quickly,&nbsp;and we didn’t go out of our way for a good, dark location.&nbsp;With some planning and refinement the results can potentially be _much_ nicer than this.  
  
These are all 10- to 15-second exposures.  
  
The ring of fire:

_Tron Legacy_ light cycle:![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/632/medium800/raspberry_pi_tron.jpg?1396774557)

Total project time, starting from zero Python experience to having a working demo, photographs and a tutorial, was about two days. Great things are afoot!
