## Scale calibration

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/010/367/medium800/3d_printing_IMG_20130803_222458.jpg?1396904082)

Scale calibration illustrates the process in which you compare the desired dimensions with the actual dimensions your printer produces. The easiest method for accomplishing this is to start by printing a calibration object, like a [Calibration Cube](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064 "Link: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064") or the [Calibration Vector](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:109114 "Link: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:109114"). Once complete, use a set of calipers to check the dimensions and record your results.  
  
If the dimensions are not to your liking, there are a few quick tweaks you can implement to improve your results:

1. **Novice:** Simply scale your object before printing. If your calibration object measures 10.5mm, and it should be 10.0mm, scale the object down to 95.24%. (10.0mm x 100%)/10.5mm = 95.24%.
2. **Intermediate:** Edit the firmware to reflect a more accurate steps/mm calculating the required steps/mm vs the actual steps/mm.
3. **Expert:** Change both the feedrate and flowrate as they dictate how much plastic is distributed per mm. These settings can be used to fine tune your printer once you are close in calibration.
