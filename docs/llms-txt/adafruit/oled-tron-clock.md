# OLED TRON Clock

## Overview & Parts

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEXTzzFYUs

While watching Tron for the umpteenth time, I started thinking about how data could be displayed in abstract, but still readable, ways. &nbsp;The OLED display, with its crispness, seemed like a good fit for what I had in mind. &nbsp;After considering a few different options, I settled on building a stylized clock display.  
  
You will need:

- [Arduino Uno](http://www.adafruit.com/products/50)
- [Monochrome 128×64 OLED graphic display](http://www.adafruit.com/products/326)
- [DS1307 Real Time Clock breakout board kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/264)

The blocks are drawn so that, from outside to inside, each ring represents hours, minutes, and seconds. &nbsp;The time is read with 0 at the top left corner. &nbsp;The current hour and minute are indicated by the empty block in each ring. &nbsp;The current second is drawn as a solid block (this ends up looking like a square moving around the inside ring). &nbsp;In the above picture, the time can be read as&nbsp;8:23 and about 38 seconds.
