# Adafruit Triple Axis Gyro Breakout

## Overview

The Adafruit Triple Axis Gyro Breakout is based on the STMicro [L3GD20 MEMS digital output&nbsp;gyroscope chip](http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/DATASHEET/DM00036465.pdf "Link: http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL\_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL\_LITERATURE/DATASHEET/DM00036465.pdf"). &nbsp;We include a 3.3v regulator on board for compatibility with 5v controllers like the Arduino. &nbsp;And there are&nbsp;4 holes so that it can be rigidly mounted.

## How it Works:
The triple-axis gyro sensor is a MEMS (Micro Electrical Mechanical System) device consisting of 3 micro-machined 'tuning fork'&nbsp;structures on a silicon wafer. &nbsp;These structures are designed to vibrate when stimulated by an electrical signal. &nbsp;When rotated about the axis of the tuning fork, the tines will deflect due to the&nbsp;[Coriolis&nbsp;force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect). This deflection is proportional to the speed of rotation.  
  
The 3 MEMS structures are arranged orthogonally, on&nbsp;the X, Y and Z axis. &nbsp;Deflection on each tuning fork&nbsp;is detected as a change in capacitance between sensing plates built into the&nbsp;MEMS structure&nbsp;and converted to a degrees-per-second&nbsp;rotation rate for&nbsp;each of the three axis. &nbsp;

## What can it do?
Gyroscopes are useful for many types of motion sensing applications. &nbsp;They are often paired with&nbsp;[accelerometers](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-analog-accelerometer-breakouts/overview) for inertial&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;systems, 3D motion capture&nbsp;and inverted pendulum (e.g. Segway) type applications. &nbsp;The L3GD20 is particularly versatile,&nbsp;with three full axes of sensing, selectable ±250, ±500, and ±2000 degree-per-second sensitivity ranges and built-in high/low pass filtering.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/287/medium800/sensors_Ladyada's_Gyros.jpg?1396794941)

A gyroscope is a type of sensor that can sense twisting and turning motions. Often paired with an accelerometer, you can use these to do 3D motion capture and inertial measurement (that is - you can tell how an object is moving!) As these sensors become more popular and easier to manufacture,...
