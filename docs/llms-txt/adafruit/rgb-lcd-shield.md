# RGB LCD Shield

## Overview

This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the range of LCDs we stock in the shop, such as our classic [blue & white](http://www.adafruit.com/products/181) as well as the fancy [RGB negative](http://www.adafruit.com/products/399) and [RGB positive](http://www.adafruit.com/products/398).

Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then perhaps another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's half of the pins available on a classic Arduino!

With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects. So we devised a shield that lets you control&nbsp; **a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Arduino!** The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can use I2C-based sensors, real-time clocks, etc. and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.

This shield is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.

The shield is designed for 'classic' Arduino-shaped boards such as the Uno, Metro, etc. But it will also fit "Mega" sized boards because the I2C pins are labeled SCL/SDA.

This used to come as a kit but now comes as an assembled SMT design, so much less soldering is required.

 **Revision History:**

- **As of May 29, 2024&nbsp;–** &nbsp;The PCB's design has been updated. Now it comes with the&nbsp; buttons, chips and other components already soldered into place. You will still need to solder on the shield headers and the LCD, but it's a lot easier.
