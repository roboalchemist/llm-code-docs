# Matrix and 7-Segment LED Backpack with the Raspberry Pi

## 7-Segment Clock

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/080/624/medium800/led_matrices_clock.jpg?1567812948)

## CircuitPython Code
Display the system time on a four digit seven segment display.

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/Matrix_7-Segment_LED_Backpack_Raspberry_Pi/sevensegment_clock/code.py

## Download and Run the Code
We can easily copy this code onto our Pi's home directory using the 'wget' command and then run it using the following commands.

```
cd
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/master/Matrix_7-Segment_LED_Backpack_Raspberry_Pi/sevensegment_clock.py
python3 ./sevensegment_clock.py
```

You should see the time appear on your 7-segment display in 24-hour format with a slow blinking colon. It should look like this:
