# Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Lesson 6. Using SSH

## SSH under Windows

If you use windows, then you will need to download a free program called “PuTTY” from here: [http://www.putty.org/](http://www.putty.org/).

Having downloaded and installed PuTTY (it's a single file called putty.exe), run the program.

Enter the IP address that you found earlier and click “Open”. This will give you a warning (the first time) and then prompt you for the user (“pi”) and password (“raspberry”).

The ssh window will then be ready for use.
