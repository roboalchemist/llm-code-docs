# Light Meter

## Overview & Parts

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zGL-Ln3BqA

I recently needed to measure how different materials affect light transmission for a gardening project. &nbsp;This seemed like a perfect fit for an Arduino project based around the TSL2561 Light sensor.

It can display the raw "Visible light" count from the sensor and then the calculated Lux.

I used the following parts in this project:

- [Arduino Uno](http://www.adafruit.com/products/50)
- [TSL2561 Digital Light Sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/products/439 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/439")
- [16×2 LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/181 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/181")
- [LCD I2C / SPI&nbsp;Backpack](http://www.adafruit.com/products/292 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/292")

Optional&nbsp;(but definitely helps keep everything tidy):

- [Lady Ada’s Bento Box](http://www.adafruit.com/products/765 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/765")

### 4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter

[4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/757)
Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flashcards, and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V. Here we've got a **&nbsp;4-channel I2C-safe...**
