# Getting Started with FLORA

## Windows Driver Installation

Info: 

Info: 

Before you plug in your board, you'll need to possibly install a driver!  
  
Click below to download our Driver Installer.

[Download Latest Adafruit Windows Driver Installer](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/latest/adafruit_drivers_*.exe)
Download and run the installer.

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/031/264/medium800/flora_1download.png?1457993219)

Run the installer! Since we bundle the SiLabs and FTDI drivers as well, you'll need to click through the license

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/031/265/medium800/flora_2lic.png?1457993232)

Select which drivers you want to install, we suggest selecting all of them so you don't have to do this again!

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/046/662/medium800/flora_driver-installer-v2000.png?1505789091)

As of version 2.5.0.0, the Adafruit drivers package is no longer signed, and some of the drivers it contains are also no longer signed. You'll need to click the second item in this dialog box when it appears:

On Windows 7, by default, we install a single driver for most of Adafruit's boards, including the **Feather 32u4, the Feather M0, Feather M0, Express, Circuit Playground, Circuit Playground Express,&nbsp;Gemma M0, Trinket M0, Metro M0 Express**. On Windows 10 and 11 that driver is not necessary (it's built in to Windows) and it will not be listed.

The&nbsp; **Trinket / Pro Trinket / Gemma / USBtinyISP** drivers are also installed by default.

You can also, optionally, install the **Arduino Gemma** (different than the Adafruit Gemma!), **Huzzah and Metro 328** drivers.

Click **Install** to do the installin'.

# Manual Driver Installation

If windows needs the driver files (inf/cat) for some reason you can get all the drivers by downloading the source code zip file from this link:

[Latest Adafruit Windows Drivers release](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/latest)
And point windows to the **Drivers** folder when it asks for the driver location
