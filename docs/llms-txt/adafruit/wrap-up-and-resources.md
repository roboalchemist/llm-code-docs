# DeLorean Time Circuit

## Wrap-Up and Resources

Go for it! If you don’t own a DeLorean, this will still impress your co-workers and look great on your desk.&nbsp;Or maybe you can devise a scheme around Halloween or a cosplay geek-fest like&nbsp;[Dragon\*Con](http://dragoncon.org/).&nbsp;Bolt it just below the arc reactor on your Iron Man suit (you&nbsp;_do_&nbsp;have an Iron Man suit, right?). Or if you have a young son in a stroller, attach the time circuit to the tray, dress junior in mirrored shades and a&nbsp;“life preserver”&nbsp;down vest, while dad dons a Doc Brown getup…you’ll take home&nbsp;_all the candy in the neighborhood!_
