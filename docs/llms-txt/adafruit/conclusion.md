# Li-Ion & LiPoly Batteries

## Conclusion

Lithium Ion and Lithium Ion Polymer batteries are a great power source for projects but they require care during use and charging. They can be easy to damage or misuse and can hurt you or your property! All the batteries we sell pass testing and certification but you should still be careful with them. Read the datasheet, follow our suggestions and those in the datasheet as well as common sense!

[The manufacturer of our lithium ion batteries indicates the following warnings and cautions:](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/30003-0.pdf)

- Do NOT immerse the battery in water or other liquids. Keep or store the battery in a cool and dry place/environment.&nbsp;  
- Do NOT use or store the battery near any source of heat.
- Use a charger that is clearly specified to be compatible for charging the battery and has appropriate charging protection (voltage, current, temperature)
- Do NOT install the battery in reverse polarity.
- Do NOT connect the battery to an electrical outlet or other incompatible power source.
- Do NOT discard the battery in fire.
- Do NOT short circuit the battery. Do NOT connect the positive and negative terminals to each other with metallic object(s) or other conductive material(s).
- Do NOT transport or store the battery together with metal objects, such as hairpins, necklaces, or any other conductive object or material.
- Do NOT strike, crush, puncture, disassemble, or throw the battery.
- Do NOT directly solder the battery or battery terminals.
- Do NOT pierce the battery.
- Lithium batteries should be used only with proper voltage, current, and temperature protection circuitry and protection.&nbsp;  

- Do NOT use or leave the battery in a high temperature environment (for example, under direct sunlight or in a vehicle in hot weather). Failure to take this precaution can lead to overheating of battery and/or fire or explosion. Also, performance of battery will degrade and lifetime will be reduced.
- Do NOT use battery in a location where there is high static-electricity or magnetic fields, otherwise safety devices may be damaged which cannot be visible.
- If the battery leaks and the electrolyte get into the eyes, do NOT rub eyes. Instead, rinse and wash eyes with clean water, and immediately seek medical attention.
- It the battery gives off an odor, generates heat, becomes discolored or deformed, or in any way appears abnormal during use, recharging, or storage, immediately remove it from the device or battery charger and stop using it.
- In case the battery terminals are dirty, clean the terminals with a dry cloth before use. Otherwise, poor performance may occur due to the poor connection with the instrument or device.
- Be aware that discarded batteries may cause fire or explosion. Therefore, apply a non-conductive tape to the battery terminals to insulate them before discarding.

**Temp sensor&nbsp;FAQ:&nbsp;** Most DIY/hobbyist chargers don't come with temperature sensors built in because they are not always right next to your battery and they are intended to be used at low charge rates and indoors where the temperature is around 25 degrees C. If you want to charge your batteries at high rates (above 0.5 **C** ) or outdoors, you should get a temperature-based charging solution.
