## Extra Supplies

In addition to an Adafruit [EL wire starter pack](http://www.adafruit.com/products/320 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/320") (or [EL tape starter pack](http://www.adafruit.com/category/50_79 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/category/50\_79")), each of my students also gets:

- **Adhesive!** I prefer E6000 because it is super strong and flexible, sticks to almost everything, and it doesn't require mixing-- it's available i[n multipacks of smaller tubes](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TBYEXM "Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007TBYEXM"). Some people don't like it because it's kinda stinky. You can also use quickset (5 or 7 minutes) epoxy. Hot glue isn't so great for this.
- **Round toothpicks** - for working with the E6000 - each student gets a small handful in their bag. Pick them up at the grocery store or on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036B2SIC).
- **Invisible thread** - like fine fishing line, this polyester filament is strong, flexible, see-thru, and you can sew with it! I get mine from [Stuff4](http://www.stuff4crafts.com/clear-sulky-premium-invisible-thread-440-yards-232-0011.html). Each student gets an entire spool.
- **[Pack needles](https://www.adafruit.com/products/615)**
- **AA batteries**
- **[EL splitter](https://www.adafruit.com/products/402)**
- **2x [In-line power wire (male)](https://www.adafruit.com/products/319)** - this way students can have up to three total lines of EL wire coming from the inverter
- **Extra [heat shrink tubing](https://www.adafruit.com/products/344 "Link: https://www.adafruit.com/products/344")** - useful for masking sections of EL wire to make dotted lines, etc.
- **Tiny lighter** - for shrinking heat shrink

I usually charge students a $35 materials fee - roughly $20 for the EL starter pack (although [hackerspaces](http://www.adafruit.com/hacker_spaces/) and [educators](http://www.adafruit.com/educators) can qualify for special pricing or volume discounts), the rest for the items in the above list plus expendibles like hot glue sticks, the instructor's demo supplies and the like. I also pick up a few sound-activated and 4xAAA inverters in case a student's design requires one-- get enough supplies for everyone to comfortably share and create in a generous environment. They should leave feeling empowered to finish their project or take on a new one- and not like they have to buy a bunch more stuff to do it. You can always use extra supplies for a future class!

You may wish to pick up a few [embroidered "learn to solder" badges](https://www.adafruit.com/products/465) to give to students if it's their first time soldering.
