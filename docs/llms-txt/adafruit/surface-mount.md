# Adafruit Guide To Excellent Soldering

## Surface Mount Components

The previous page showed how to make a good through-hole joint. &nbsp;But more and more components are only available in surface mount form these days. &nbsp;Not all surface mount packages are easily worked by hand, but there are plenty that can be managed with the same basic tools used for through-hole soldering.  
  
Let's start with a surface-mount&nbsp;part common to several Adafruit kits: The SD Card Holder:

## Immobilize the Joint
Unlike many surface mount components, immobilizing the SD card holder is relatively easy. &nbsp;There are small pegs on the back that fit into positioning holes in the board. &nbsp;Once it is in place, solder the four small corner tabs to make it permanent.

## Heat the Joint
Start by putting the tip of the hot iron on the solder pad adjacent to the pin. &nbsp;The pad will take longer to heat, so we apply most of the heat to the pad to start.![tools_Surface_Mount_Heat.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/041/medium640/tools_Surface_Mount_Heat.jpg?1396778470)

## Apply the Solder
When the joint is hot, apply solder to the side opposite the iron. &nbsp;The solder should melt and start to flow into the joint.![tools_Surface_Mount_Solder.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/042/medium640/tools_Surface_Mount_Solder.jpg?1396778477)

## Let it Flow
Apply just enough solder to ensure a good joint, then keep the heat on while the solder wicks up between the pin and the pad to make a good electrical bond.![tools_Surface_Mount_Wick.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/043/medium640/tools_Surface_Mount_Wick.jpg?1396778482)

## Let it Cool
Remove the iron and allow the joint to cool undisturbed.![tools_Surface_Mount_Cool.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/044/medium640/tools_Surface_Mount_Cool.jpg?1396778490)
