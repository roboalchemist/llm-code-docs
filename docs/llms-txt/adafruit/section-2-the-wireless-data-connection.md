_This section focuses on the different methods of producing a wireless data connection_  
  
Do EACH of the following and submit to your instructor:  
  

1. Identify and describe XBee's three primary network topologies

  1. Provide instances where these topologies could be used

2. Identify and describe the format in which data is sent between XBee modules

  1. How might you optimize your data packets to reduce size and simplify interpretation

3. Identify and describe the supported baud rates

  1. Provide advantages of using a lower rate over a higher
  2. Provide advantages of using a higher rate over a lower

4. Identify and describe the different "Function Sets" the XBee can be configured for

  1. How do these differ between the series 1 & 2 modules

  
Do ONE of the following and submit to your instructor:  
  

1. Using a pair of XBee series 1 modules, produce a point to point network and demonstrate successful bi-directional communication

  1. Complete a range test inside of a building and record your results
  2. Complete a range test outside with a clear line of sight and record your results
  3. Detail the factors, both hardware and structural, that affect the range of your connection

2. Using a pair of XBee series 2 modules, produce a point to point network and demonstrate successful bi-directional communication

  1. Complete a range test inside of a building and record your results
  2. Complete a range test outside with a clear line of sight and record your results
  3. Detail the factors, both hardware and structural, that affects the range of your connection

  
Do ONE of the following and submit to your instructor:  
  

1. Using a pair of XBee series 1 modules, reconfigure the modules to a higher baud-rate, produce a point to point network, and successfully transfer data

  1. Replicate the previous range test inside of a building and record your results
  2. Replicate the previous range test outside with a clear line of sight and record your results
  3. Detail the effect of baud-rate on range

2. Using a pair of XBee series 2 modules, reconfigure the modules to a higher baud-rate, produce a point to point network, and successfully transfer data

  1. Replicate the previous range test inside of a building and record your results
  2. Replicate the previous range test outside with a clear line of sight and record your results
  3. Detail the effect of baud-rate on range
