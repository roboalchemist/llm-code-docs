# Character LCDs

## Overview

[We sell tons of lovely character LCDs for use with Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/63_96), they are extremely common and a fast way to have your project show status messages. This tutorial will show how you can easily connect a character LCD, either 16x2 or&nbsp;[20x4](http://www.adafruit.com/products/198 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/198").

The LCDs we sell at Adafruit have a low power LED backlight, run on +5v and require only 6 data pins to talk to. You can use&nbsp; **any** &nbsp;data pins you want!

This tutorial will cover character LCDs carried at Adafruit -&nbsp;[such as our "standard" blue&white 16x2, RGB 16x2 LCDs, "standard" blue&white 20x4 and RGB 20x4](https://www.adafruit.com/category/63_96 "Link: https://www.adafruit.com/category/63\_96"). We don't guarantee it will work with any other LCDs. If you need help getting other LCDs to work, please contact the place you purchased it from, they'll be happy to help!
