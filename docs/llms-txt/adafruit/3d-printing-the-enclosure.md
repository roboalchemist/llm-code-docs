Our assembly guide walks your through the process of putting it together. [Download STLs](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:244361)
## Snap-fit color enclosure
Print pitouch-cover.stl file in a different color for a stylish look. We used transparent green PLA for the cover and true white for the rest, but you can choose any color you like. ## Optional Parts

- **pitouch-tripod.stl** If you don't want a Tripod Mount
- **pitouch-band.stl** If you don't want Grippy edges
- **pitouch-camring.stl** If you don't want interchangeable lenses.
