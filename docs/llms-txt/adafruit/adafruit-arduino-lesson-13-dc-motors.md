# Arduino Lesson 13. DC Motors

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to control a small DC motor using an Arduino and a transistor.

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/338/medium800/learn_arduino_overview.jpg?1396782013)

You will use an Arduino analog output (PWM) to control the speed of the motor by sending a number between 0 and 255 from the Serial Monitor.

### DC Toy / Hobby Motor - 130 Size

[DC Toy / Hobby Motor - 130 Size](https://www.adafruit.com/product/711)
These are standard '130 size' DC hobby motors. They come with a wider operating range than most toy motors: from 4.5 to 9VDC instead of 1.5-4.5V. This range makes them perfect for controlling with an Adafruit Motor Shield, or with an Arduino where you are more likely to have 5 or 9V...
