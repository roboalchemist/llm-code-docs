## Using RC Servos

Warning: 

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/898/medium800/adafruit_products_servo.jpg?1396777241)

Hobby servos are the easiest way to get going with motor control. They have a 3-pin 0.1" female header connection with +5V, ground and signal inputs. The motor shield simply brings out the 16bit PWM output lines to two 3-pin headers so that its easy to plug in and go. They can take a lot of power so a 9V battery wont last more than a few minutes!

The nice thing about using the onboard PWM is that its very precise and goes about its business in the background. You can use the built in **Servo** library

[Using the servos is easy, please read the official Arduino documentation for how to use them and see the example Servo sketches in the IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo).

**Power for the Servos comes from the Arduino's on-board 5V regulator, powered directly from the USB or DC power jack on the Arduino**. If you need an external supply, cut the trace right below the servo pins (on v1.2 boards) and connect a 5V or 6V DC supply directly. Using an external supply is for advanced users as you can accidentally destroy the servos by connecting a power supply incorrectly!
