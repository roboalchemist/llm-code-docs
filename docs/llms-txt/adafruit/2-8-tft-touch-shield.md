# 2.8" TFT Touch Shield

## Overview

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/776/medium800/lcds___displays_tftshield.jpg?1396786950)

Spice up your Arduino project with a beautiful large touchscreen display shield with built in microSD card connection. This TFT display is big (2.8" diagonal) bright (4 white-LED backlight) and colorful (18-bit 262,000 different shades)! 240x320 pixels with individual pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen.  
  
The shield is fully assembled, tested and ready to go. No wiring, no soldering! Simply plug it in and load up our library - you'll have it running in under 10 minutes!  
  
This display shield has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. The shield does require a lot of pins: 12 lines total for the display, 13 total if you use the microSD card

Of course, we wouldn't just leave you with a datasheet and a "good luck!" - [we've written a full open source graphics library that can draw pixels, lines, rectangles, circles and text](https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library "Link: https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library"). We[also have a touch screen library that detects x, y and z (pressure)](https://github.com/adafruit/Touch-Screen-Library) and example code to demonstrate all of it. The code is written for Arduino but can be easily ported to your favorite microcontroller!

We sure love the ATmega328 here at Adafruit, and we use them&nbsp;_a lot_&nbsp;for our own projects. The processor has plenty of GPIO, Analog inputs, hardware UART SPI and I2C, timers and PWM galore - just enough for most simple projects. When we need to go small, we use a <a...></a...>
