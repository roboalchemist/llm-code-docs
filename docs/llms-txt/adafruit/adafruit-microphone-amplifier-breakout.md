This guide shows how to connect the Adafruit Electret Microphone Amplifier to measure&nbsp;sound levels with your Arduino.  
  
The Microphone Amplifier mates an [Electret Capsule Microphone](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/CMA-4544PF-W.pdf) with a&nbsp;[MAX4466 Operational Amplifier](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/MAX4465-MAX4469.pdf) optimized for use in microphone pre-amplifier applications. &nbsp;The flexible supply voltage and&nbsp;and adjustable gain make this module adaptable to a wide variety of audio applications.

## Specifications:

- Supply Voltage: 2.4v-5v  
- Output: Rail-to-Rail - up to&nbsp;to 5vp-p  
- Frequency Response: 20Hz - 20 KHz  
- Adjustable Gain 25x-125x  
- [Available From: &nbsp;Adafruit of course!](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1063 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1063")
