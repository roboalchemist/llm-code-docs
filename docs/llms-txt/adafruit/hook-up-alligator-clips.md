## Hook up alligator clips

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/069/730/medium800/led_pixels_cpx_alligatorclips.jpg?1548106119)

Hook up three alligator clips to your Circuit Playground Express as shown: one to **VOUT** , one to **A1** , and one to **GND**. I used a red wire for power and a black wire for ground for clarity, but it doesn't matter what color you use.

Hook up the other ends of your alligator clips to a single pixel. **VOUT** (red) connects to the **+** on the pixel, **GND** (black) to the **-** , and **A1** (yellow) to the pad marked with an arrow pointing towards the LED on the tiny board (not away from it).

Wiring on a FLORA is very similar.&nbsp; Just wire to **D6** instead of **A1**.&nbsp; **VBATT** and **VOUT** are more or less the same, for our purposes.

On GEMMA or Gemma M0, the wiring is very similar. Hook up **VOUT** (red in the picture above) to **+** , **GND** to **-** (black above), and **D1** to the inward facing arrow (yellow above).
