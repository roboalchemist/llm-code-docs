# Arduino Lesson 9. Sensing Light

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to measure light intensity using an Analog Input. You will build on lesson 8 and use the level of light to control the number of LEDs to be lit.

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...
