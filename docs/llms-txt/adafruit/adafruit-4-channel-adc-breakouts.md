The ADS1115 and ADS1015 4-channel breakout boards are perfect for adding high-resolution analog to digital conversion to any microprocessor-based project. &nbsp;These boards can run with power and logic signals between 2v to 5v, so they are compatible with all common 3.3v and 5v processors. &nbsp;As many of 4 of these boards can be controlled from the same 2-wire I2C bus, giving you up to 16 single-ended or 8 differential channels. &nbsp;A programmable gain amplifier provides up to x16 gain for small signals.  
  
These two boards are very similar, differing only in resolution and speed. The ADS1115 provides 16-bit precision at 860 samples/second, while the ADS1015 provides 12-bit precision at 3300 samples/second.

To get you going fast, we spun up a custom-made PCB in the[&nbsp; **STEMMA QT** &nbsp;form factor](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma%20qt%20sensor "STEMMA QT form factor"), making it easy to interface with. The&nbsp;[STEMMA QT connectors](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt)&nbsp;on either side are compatible with the&nbsp;[SparkFun Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) I2C connectors. This allows you to make solderless connections between your development board and either the ADS1115 or ADS1015. You can chain the boards with a wide range of other sensors and accessories using a [**compatible cable**](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=stemma%20qt%20cable).
