Hidden inside this fashion accessory is a stealthy purpose-- it powers down television sets from across the room! This guide will walk you through the steps for creating your own Flora TV-B-Gone, a wearable gadget triggered by the button in the center of its flower design. The infrared LEDs communicate with TVs the same way your remote does (invisibly to the human eye) but the program contains codes to power down just about every TV brand. You can embellish your design however you like to match your outfit or encase it completely in a jacket pocket. The basic design is here, how you make yours is up to you!

### 3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST

[3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST](https://www.adafruit.com/product/727)
This battery holder connects 3 AAA batteries together in series for powering all kinds of projects. We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes...
