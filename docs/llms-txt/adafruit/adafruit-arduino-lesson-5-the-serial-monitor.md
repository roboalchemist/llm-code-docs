# Arduino Lesson 5. The Serial Monitor

## Overview

In this lesson, you will build on lesson 4, adding the facility to control the LEDs from your computer using the Arduino Serial Monitor. The serial monitor is the 'tether' between the computer and your Arduino - it lets you send and receive text messages, handy for debugging and also controlling the Arduino from a keyboard!

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/178/medium800/learn_arduino_summary.png?1396780242)

For example, you will be able to send commands from your computer to turn on LEDs.  
  
In this lesson, you will use exactly the same parts and a similar breadboard layout as Lesson 4. So, if you have not already done so, follow lesson 4 now.
