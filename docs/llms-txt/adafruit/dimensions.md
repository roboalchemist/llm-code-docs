# 12mm LED Pixels

## Dimensions

There’s a fair amount of variance between pixels due to the rubbery, waterproof coating.&nbsp;The figures given here are just guidelines, rounded up to the next whole millimeter (except for the mounting hole diameter). Allow yourself some extra&nbsp;“wiggle room” for spacing&nbsp;when planning an installation.  
  
For mounting holes, 11.5 millimeters is a good guideline, or might go as narrow as 11 mm for a really firm grip, though at that size&nbsp;pixels will be hard to remove and the mounting flange&nbsp;may take some abuse in the process.
