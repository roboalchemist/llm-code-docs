# 12mm LED Pixels

## CircuitPython and Python Wiring

It's easy to use the 12mm LED pixels with CircuitPython and the&nbsp;[Adafruit CircuitPython WS2801](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_WS2801)&nbsp;module.&nbsp; This module allows you to easily write Python code to control the lights.

You can use these LEDs with any CircuitPython microcontroller board or with a computer that has GPIO.

## CircuitPython Wiring

You can wire up the WS2801 strand for CircuitPython and using any two GPIO pins. One will serve as the clock Pin and one as the Data Pin.

Danger: 

- **Microcontroller GND&nbsp;** to **&nbsp;Blue Ground line**  
- **Microcontroller D6&nbsp;** to **Green Serial Clock line**
- **Microcontroller D5&nbsp;** to **Yellow Serial Data line**
- **5V Regulated Supply +5V** to **Red +5V Line**
- **5V Regulated Supply Ground** to **Blue Ground line**

## Python Wiring

Wiring for Python is pretty simple as well.

- **Microcontroller GND&nbsp;** to **&nbsp;Blue Ground line**  
- **Microcontroller D6&nbsp;** to **Green Serial Clock line**
- **Microcontroller D5&nbsp;** to **Yellow Serial Data line**
- **5V Regulated Supply +5V** to **Red +5V Line**
- **5V Regulated Supply Ground** to **Blue Ground line**

### Hardware SPI Wiring on the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi seem to be an exception in that Hardware SPI seems to work pretty well on here.

- **Microcontroller GND&nbsp;** to **&nbsp;Blue Ground line**  
- **Microcontroller SCLK&nbsp;** to **Green Serial Clock line**
- **Microcontroller MOSI&nbsp;** to **Yellow Serial Data line**
- **5V Regulated Supply +5V** to **Red +5V Line**
- **5V Regulated Supply Ground** to **Blue Ground line**
