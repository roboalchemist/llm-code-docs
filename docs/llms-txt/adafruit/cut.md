Line up your colored wheels by the letters and numbers – 4a is the first wheel on the 4-band side, for example. Keep track of your pieces because we’re about to cut out the ID numbers!

Now carefully cut out the inner circles on your wheels, placing each one back in line before cutting the next one. Of course you can always refer back to this page if you forget which wheel is which!
