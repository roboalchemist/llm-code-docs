# Adafruit Pi Cobbler Kit

## Overview

Now that you've finally got your hands on a [Raspberry Pi®](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), you're probably itching to make some fun embedded computer projects with it. What you need is an add on prototyping Pi Cobbler from Adafruit, which can break out all those tasty power, GPIO, I2C and SPI pins from the 26 pin header onto a solderless breadboard. This mini kit will make "cobbling together" prototypes with the Pi super easy.  
  
 The Pi Cobbler mini kit comes with a 26 pin ribbon cable, a custom PCB, ribbon cable socket and header pins. A little soldering is required to put it together but its really easy, even a beginner can do it in 15 minutes! Once soldered together, the cable plugs between the Pi computer and the Cobbler breakout. The Cobbler can plug into any solderless breadboard (or even a prototyping board like the PermaProto). The Cobbler PCB has all the pins labeled nicely so you can go forth and build circuits without keeping a pin-out printout at your desk. We think this will make it more fun to expand the Pi and build custom circuitry with it.  
  
**Please note, this kit only contains a 26 pin ribbon cable, a custom PCB, ribbon cable socket and header pins.** A Raspberry Pi, breadboard, breadboarding wires, cables, components, case, power supply, etc is not included! We do stock many of those items in the shop, so check those out as well!
