# Arduino Lesson 11. LCD Displays - Part 1

## Soldering Pins to the Display

The display needs 16 pins, so if your header strip is longer than that then break it off to the right length.

Then put the length of 16 header pins into the solder tabs on the display and starting at one end, solder each of the pins in place. It can be easier to put the long end of the pins into the breadboard so that the header pins are held straight.

If you do not do this, then solder one pin in first and then get the pins in straight, melting the solder on the pin before making any adjustment.
