# Biometric Lock Box

## Final Assembly

## Make the strike.
Cut a strip of brass about 2.5" (64mm) long.  

- Measure the distance from the top of the solenoid shaft to the edge of the box lid - typically&nbsp;about 0.44" (11mm).  
- Drill a .31" (8mm)&nbsp;hole in one end for the solenoid shaft. &nbsp;The edge of the hole should be 11mm from the end of the strip.  
- Drill 2 more 1/8" (3mm) holes for rivets.  
- Bend the strike above the hole&nbsp;as shown below.

## Temporarily install the strike

- Position the strike on the front of the box and align the top with the edge of the box as shown.  
- Fasten it temporarily with machine screws. &nbsp;Make sure you can unfasten it from outside the box. &nbsp;We will need to open the box for adjustments&nbsp;if the latch binds.

## Test latch operation
If the latch binds or fails to engage the strike, shim the solenoid and/or adjust the position of the strike as needed.![biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1097-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/262/medium640/biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1097-1024.jpg?1396794613)

## Rivet the strike
Once you have verified that everything is positioned for proper latch operation, make it permanent and tamper-proof&nbsp;by replacing the screws with pop-rivets.![biometric_2012_12_29_IMG_1127-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/263/medium640/biometric_2012_12_29_IMG_1127-1024.jpg?1396794620)

### N-channel power MOSFET

[N-channel power MOSFET](https://www.adafruit.com/product/355)
When you need to switch a lot of power, N-channel MOSFETs are best for the job. These FETs can switch over 60A and 30V and are TO-220 packages so they fit nicely into any breadboard or perfboard. Heat sinking is easy with TO-220's, but because of the very low Rds(on) of down to 0.009 ohms...

### Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC

[Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/412)
Solenoids are basically electromagnets: they are made of a big coil of copper wire with an armature (a slug of metal) in the middle. When the coil is energized, the slug is pulled into the center of the coil. This makes the solenoid able to pull (from one end) or push (from the other)
