# Digital LED Belt

## Install Driver

We'll start out easy, by plugging in the atmega32u4 board and installing the driver. For mac and linux users, you can skip this step! If you're using windows, however, you'll need to do this:  
  
[Download the \*\*inf\*\* by right-click saving this file and saving it to the Desktop](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/atmega32u4cdc.inf)  
  
Then plug a mini-B cable into the board and you should see the LED light up on it and you'll be asked to install the driver.  
  
Select&nbsp; **No, not this time** :

Select&nbsp; **Install from a list or specific location** :![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/315/medium800/led_strips_32u4driver2.gif?1448059485)

Browse to the deskop (or where-ever you saved the&nbsp; **inf** )![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/316/medium800/led_strips_32u4driver3.gif?1448059480)

Click&nbsp; **Continue Anyways** &nbsp;(we didn't pay for Logo testing, but we're using the built in driver so its OK)![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/317/medium800/led_strips_32u4driver4.gif?1448059475)

Thats it! The USB-serial port should now show up under the device manager. If you press the reset button it will 'disappear' and reappear.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/318/medium800/led_strips_devicemanager.jpg?1396795374)
