You can relive the early days of computer gaming on your Arduino&nbsp;with&nbsp;[Hunt the Wumpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus). &nbsp;This game is a particularly good fit for&nbsp;the RGB LCD shield:

- Different screens can have different backlight colors
- The LCD is large enough for selecting caves to move to or shoot into
- The Wumpus, bat, and pit can all have custom characters
- The D-Pad is well suited to handling menu navigation

You will need:  

- [Adafruit RGB LCD Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/716)  
- [Arduino Uno](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50)
