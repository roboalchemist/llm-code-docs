# Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Lesson 8. Using a Servo Motor

## Overview

This lesson describes how to control a single servo motor using Python. &nbsp;

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/489/medium800/learn_raspberry_pi_overview.jpg?1396797194)

Servo motors are controlled by pulses of varying lengths. This requires fairly accurate timing. The&nbsp;Raspberry Pi has one pin that generates pulses in hardware, without having to rely on the operating system.
