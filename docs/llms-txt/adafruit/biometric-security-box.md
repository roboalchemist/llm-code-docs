# Biometric Lock Box

## Overview

The Biometric Security Box uses the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor as well as a numeric pass-code and a mechanical key-lock to provide triple-security. &nbsp;This tutorial is based on a 4x6 card file box, but can be easily adapted to larger lock-boxes&nbsp;– or even a full-size door!

### N-channel power MOSFET

[N-channel power MOSFET](https://www.adafruit.com/product/355)
When you need to switch a lot of power, N-channel MOSFETs are best for the job. These FETs can switch over 60A and 30V and are TO-220 packages so they fit nicely into any breadboard or perfboard. Heat sinking is easy with TO-220's, but because of the very low Rds(on) of down to 0.009 ohms...

### Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC

[Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/412)
Solenoids are basically electromagnets: they are made of a big coil of copper wire with an armature (a slug of metal) in the middle. When the coil is energized, the slug is pulled into the center of the coil. This makes the solenoid able to pull (from one end) or push (from the other)
