# Internet of Things Printer for Raspberry Pi

## Case Assembly 1 (Pre 2017)

Danger: 

The enclosure is comprised of seven (7) laser-cut acrylic pieces. The paper backing should already have been peeled off during the “Preparation” step. If any remains, take care of that now.  
  
Some case pieces are reversible and can be flipped over and installed either way, while others have a specific orientation. You’ve already been acquainted with some of these pieces during the soldering stage. Let’s assign names to the rest of these parts so we can refer to them in these directions:

# Install Raspberry Pi on Bottom Plate

Remove the WiFi adapter and SD card if you haven’t already.

The bottom piece is scored on one side, with an outline showing the placement and orientation of the Raspberry Pi board.

![raspberry_pi_bottom1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/313/medium640/raspberry_pi_bottom1.jpg?1396810846)

All but the earliest Raspberry Pi boards have two mounting holes. Insert a 1/2" #4-40 screw into each of these holes from the top of the board.

![raspberry_pi_bottom2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/314/medium640/raspberry_pi_bottom2.jpg?1396810854)

Using your fingertips to keep the screws in place, flip the board over and install a 1/4" nylon spacer over each of the two screws.

![raspberry_pi_bottom3.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/315/medium640/raspberry_pi_bottom3.jpg?1396810865)

Position the bottom plate over the Raspberry Pi (remember, the scored side should face the board) and secure in place with two #4-40 nuts. Tighten the screws from the other side using a small screwdriver and gentle pressure — don’t crank the screws down hard or you’ll crack the case!

![raspberry_pi_bottom4.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/316/medium640/raspberry_pi_bottom4.jpg?1396810873)

If you have an early “rev1” Raspberry Pi board without mounting holes, this can be installed using a set of four [board edge mounts](http://adafruit.com/products/1116 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/1116") (sold separately, not included in kit).

![raspberry_pi_bottom5.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/317/medium640/raspberry_pi_bottom5.jpg?1396810882)

# Install Thermal Printer
The parts baggie included with the thermal printer contains two triangle-shaped brackets and two long screws. These will hold the printer inside the case.  
  
Note the location of the paper feed button. This should be oriented toward the BACK of the printer.

![raspberry_pi_printer1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/318/medium640/raspberry_pi_printer1.jpg?1396810890)

Being mindful of the wires and other attached components, slide the thermal printer through the large slot on the top case piece, with the feed button toward the BACK (the silver button is toward the front).

![raspberry_pi_printer2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/319/medium640/raspberry_pi_printer2.jpg?1396810898)

Set the printer and top piece face-down and insert the two brackets and screws. Use a small screwdriver to secure these in place. Use gentle pressure! Cranking these down tightly can crack the case.

![raspberry_pi_printer3.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/004/320/medium640/raspberry_pi_printer3.jpg?1396810907)

Connect the power and serial cables from the DC jack and Cobbler, noting the labels on the bottom of the printer. The connectors are identical and it’s easy to get these switched around.

![raspberry_pi_PowerAndSerial.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/041/016/medium640/raspberry_pi_PowerAndSerial.jpg?1492906211)

With these three pieces now “tethered” by wires, they should always be lifted and moved around as a single unit. Don’t pull on any of the wires.
