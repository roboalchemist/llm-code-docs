# LED Bicycle Handlebars

## Frequently Asked Qs

### 

Each meter of LED strip draws about 1 Amp - so a one-meter strip will last about 4 hours on 8 AA batteries (3 hours for rechargeables). A two meter strip will be half that.

### 

Yes! We suggest using NiMH rechargeables! They'll do a great job at driving the LED strip.

### 

The easiest way to make it dimmer is to go with a [6xAA battery holder](http://adafruit.com/products/248) - the lower voltage will still light up the strip but not as much as 8 AA's

### 

Use 6 to 8 C or D cells for extra power. A 12V lantern battery will also do a good job, or a 12V lead acid battery.
