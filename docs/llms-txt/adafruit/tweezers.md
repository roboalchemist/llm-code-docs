## Tweezers

If you're doing SMT, you're doing rework and anything that makes rework suck less is a big win. We use hot air for reworking some SMT parts but if you have leaded parts, especially big ones, hot air can take a really long time. If you want fast component removal/reworking we suggest getting a hot tweezer jig!![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/341/medium800/manufacturing_tweezers.jpg?1396762308)

The&nbsp;[MX500 soldering station](http://www.ladyada.net///metcaliron.html)&nbsp;is particularly good for hot tweezing, it has two ports on the front. One connects to the iron and the other we connect to a hot tweezer. You can switch out tips just like with the soldering wand.&nbsp;[The system is called MX-PTZ](http://www.okinternational.com/product_soldering/mxPTZ)&nbsp;and you can check out Metcal's page for all the various tips you can get for reworking different-sized parts.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/342/medium800/manufacturing_tweezeclosed.jpg?1396762316)

## Removing a SOIC

Our favorite use for tweezers is to remove or rework SOIC and such. These are big chips, hard to heat up evenly and quickly but the large&nbsp; **PTTC-x06** &nbsp;or&nbsp; **PTTC-x07&nbsp;** cartridges make em easy!

For example, I want to remove this 14-SOIC chip:

Simply wait for the tweezers to heat up, then grab both sides of the SOIC.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/344/medium800/manufacturing_tweezesoic_t.jpg?1396762328)

and voila! The chip comes off easily, cleanly and without affecting the rest of the circuit.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/345/medium800/manufacturing_tweezed.jpg?1396762336)
