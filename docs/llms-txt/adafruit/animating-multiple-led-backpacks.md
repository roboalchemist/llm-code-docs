# Animating Multiple LED Backpacks

## Overview

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/252/medium800/led_matrix_matrix.jpg?1396780997)

Adafruit LED backpacks make it incredibly simple to add small bitmapped displays to a project.&nbsp;Each requires just four wires: power, ground and two communication lines to a microcontroller.  
  
Two common questions we receive:  
1. How can I use more than one 8x8 matrix backpack in an Arduino sketch?
2. Can I have two (or more)&nbsp;matrices always showing the same image?

This tutorial demonstrates both.  
  
We’ve had spooky Halloween displays on the brain lately, but the concepts here are equally applicable to more innocent schemes!
