# DIY 8x2 LCD Shield

## Overview & Parts

This tutorial will show you how to solder together a shield for an LCD with a 8x2 header.  
## Parts
Aside from the parts offered available from Adafruit, you will need to source the LCD yourself. &nbsp;Parallel LCDs come in a couple different sizes, from 16 characters, 1 line (16x1) to 24 characters, 4 lines (24x4).![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/950/medium800/lcds___displays_lcd.jpg?1396767357)

In this tutorial I use the&nbsp;[16x2 Picvue from Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&productId=365982)&nbsp;because that’s what I had in my box of stuff, but you can easily adapt it for any other LCD. The wiring may differ a little bit but that will be covered.

[Solid-Core Wire Spool - 25ft - 22AWG - Yellow](https://www.adafruit.com/product/289)
Perfect for bread-boarding, free wiring, etc. This spool of solid-core wire is easy to solder to. When bent it keeps its shape pretty well. We like to have a few spools of this stuff around. We suggest picking up wire strippers to match. Wire gauge is 22 AWG which we've found is the best...

[36-pin 0.1" Female header - pack of 5!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/598)
Female header is like the duct tape of electronics. Its great for connecting things together, soldering to perf-boards, sockets for wires or break-away header, etc. We go through these guys real fast, and thought that given how handy they are, we'd offer them in a pack of five!

### Adafruit Proto Shield for Arduino Kit

[Adafruit Proto Shield for Arduino Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/51)
Works with the Uno! This prototyping shield is the best out there (well, we think so, at least). It works with UNO, NG, Diecimila and Duemilanove Arduinos. You can use it with a Leonardo but it will not break out the hardware SPI pins (they're only on the ISP connector underneath) or the...

We sure love the ATmega328 here at Adafruit, and we use them&nbsp;_a lot_&nbsp;for our own projects. The processor has plenty of GPIO, Analog inputs, hardware UART SPI and I2C, timers and PWM galore - just enough for most simple projects. When we need to go small, we use a <a...></a...>
