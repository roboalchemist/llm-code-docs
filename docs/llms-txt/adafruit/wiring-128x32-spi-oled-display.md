## Wiring 128x32 SPI OLED display

## 128x32 SPI OLED
The 128x32 SPI OLED is very easy to get up and running because it has built in level shifting. First up, take a piece of 0.1" header 8 pins long.

Plug the header long end down into a breadboard and place the OLED on top. Solder the short pins into the OLED PCB.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/125/medium800/lcds___displays_spi12832solder.jpg?1396769023)

Finally, connect the pins to your Arduino -&nbsp; **GND** &nbsp;goes to ground,&nbsp; **Vin** &nbsp;goes to 5V,&nbsp; **DATA** &nbsp;to digital&nbsp; **9** ,&nbsp; **CLK** &nbsp;to digital&nbsp; **10** ,&nbsp; **D/C** &nbsp;to digital&nbsp; **11** ,&nbsp; **RST** &nbsp;to digital&nbsp; **13** &nbsp;and finally&nbsp; **CS** &nbsp;to digital&nbsp; **12.**  
  
_( **Note** : If using the display with other SPI devices, D/C, CLK and DAT may be shared, but CS must be unique for each device.)_&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
This matches the example code we have written. Once you get this working, you can try another set of pins.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
Finally you can run the&nbsp; **File→Sketchbook→Libraries→Adafruit\_SSD1306→SSD1306\_128x32\_SPI&nbsp;example**
