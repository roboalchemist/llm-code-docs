# Arduino Lesson 6. Digital Inputs

## Push Switches

Switches are really simple components. When you press a button or flip a lever, they connect two contacts together so that electricity can flow through them.

The little tactile switches that are used in this lesson have four connections, which can be a little confusing.

Actually, there are only really two electrical connections, as inside the switch package pins B and C are connected together, as are A and D.
