Warning: 

We finally have the Adafruit WebIDE in a place where we think it's solid enough for a beta release. First, a disclaimer: this release will likely have bugs, and minor issues.  
  
 The Adafruit WebIDE is by far the easiest way to run code on your Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone. Just connect your Pi or BeagleBone to your local network, and log on to the WebIDE in your web browser to edit Python, Ruby, JavaScript, or anything and easily send it over to your Pi. The WebiDE includes a terminal, so you can easily send various commands to your Pi right from the browser. Also, your code will be versioned in a local git repository, and pushed remotely out to any remote git repository so you can access it from anywhere, and any time.
