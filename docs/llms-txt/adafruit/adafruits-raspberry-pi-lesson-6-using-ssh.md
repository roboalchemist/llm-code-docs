A common reason for remote controlling your Pi from another computer (like your laptop or desktop) is that you may be using your Pi solely to control some electronics and therefore not need a keyboard, mouse and monitor, other than for setting it up.

It also can just save on desktop clutter, and the problem of having multiple keyboards and mice all over the place.
