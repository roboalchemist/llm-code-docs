# Skill Badge Requirements: Raspberry Pi

## Overview

Originating in Cambridge University’s Computer Laboratory, the Raspberry Pi is a super-affordable educational computing system that has taken the Maker-world by storm. This inexpensive system-on-chip (SOC) breakout for Broadcom's BCM2385 boasts a 700 Mhz ARM with 256MB of RAM, TV, HDMI, stereo audio, USB, SD memory slot, Ethernet and 17 GPIO for general purpose hackery. Each device is capable of running a wide range of operating systems that allow the Pi to function as anything from a media center to the primary control system for a high altitude balloon. In fact, this requirements sheet was written on a Raspberry Pi Model B using a Motorola Lapdock, Raspbian and Leafpad.

_Instructions for completion:_  
  
Record the section, item number and requirement before each response on your notepaper. This will assist your instructor when evaluating the completion of the requirements.  
  
**Example:**  
  
2.1 Measure and calculate the surface area (Aeff) of the solar cell supplied by your instructor.  

- I calculated the surface area (Aeff) of my solar cell to be 2 square inches, with the dimensions of 2in x 1in.
