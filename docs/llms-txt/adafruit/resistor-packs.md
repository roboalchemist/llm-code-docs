## Resistor Packs

For prototyping, modding, hacking and reworking, its good to have a range of resistors in your favorite package size. We like the digikey box packs of resistors, and have a set of the 5% in 0603, 0805 and 1206. Sometimes we wish there were more values so we may get the 0805 in 1% for a few values

Either way, having a resistor set is essential!

Pick your poison:

**[1206 5% resistor pack (50 of each value)](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=PHE2A-KIT-ND)**

**[0805 5% resistor pack (50 of each value)](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=PHA1A-KIT-ND)**

**[0603 5% resistor pack (50 of each value)](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&name=PHG2A-KIT-ND)**

For the 1%, they come in boxes of ranges, pick them up as necessary

**0805 1% Resistors (50 of each value):&nbsp;**  
1.0-9.76: PHC1A-KIT-ND&nbsp;  
10.0-97.6: PHC2A-KIT-ND&nbsp;  
100-976: PHC3A-KIT-ND&nbsp;  
1.00K-9.76K: PHC4A-KIT-ND&nbsp;  
10.0K-97.6K: PHC5A-KIT-ND&nbsp;  
100K-1.0M: PHC6A-KIT-ND
