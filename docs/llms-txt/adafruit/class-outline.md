# EL Workshop

## Class Outline

Get acquainted with your students - ask them to introduce themselves and show off the items they brought to adorn with EL wire. Introduce yourself while you're at it.  
  
Introduce the materials and tools - show off the materials in the students' kits and the function of each tool.  
  
Show a smattering of EL projects from around the web to get your students inspired!  
  
If you brought extra EL materials (other types of inverters, EL panel, etc.), show how they work. The sound-activated inverter always induces some "ooo"s from the class.  
  
Describe how the whole circuit will work- what EL wire is made from and how it lights up, the inverter's step up to AC, and the safety precautions to be taken during construction.

Solder demo - show the EL soldering process start-to-finish and explain how to decide when to solder a new branch and when to just mask a section of EL with heat shrink.  
  
Solder practice - have each student make a practice EL solder joint with scrap materials. As they take turns with the soldering iron, the rest of the students can start planning their project design.

Design planning time! Have your students plan out their design using their EL wire and masking tape. Walk around the room helping advise the best way to incorporate it-- your blessing and suggestions will give the students confidence about their designs.

Construction! Advise students to finish all of their design's required soldering before they leave class - they can always finish gluing or sewing at home.  
  
Demonstrate sewing and gluing techniques - either on some sample material or using a students' project as an example.

The rest of the class is spent constructing the projects. Check in with each student multiple times to keep him/her on track. Your students may run into roadblocks along the way - a tangled thread can cause major anxiety for a newbie stitcher! It's your job to reassure your students that they CAN DO IT, there are solutions to each problem they encounter, and that you will help them make it awesome.
