## About Batteries

Different battery types have different output voltages…a function of their internal chemistry.&nbsp;Among common household batteries —&nbsp;the kinds you&nbsp;might&nbsp;find at the grocery store —&nbsp;there are two major types:

Rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMH) cells output **1.2 Volts** , as do nickel cadmium (NiCd) cells. The latter have fallen out of favor for a number of&nbsp;reasons, but maybe you still have a few around the house.  
  
These cells are more expensive up front, and require a charger. But for frequent use, they can be more economical in the long run.

![leds_nimh-1.png](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/319/medium640/leds_nimh-1.png?1396770976)

Single-use, disposable alkaline cells output **1.5 Volts**.  
  
Though not reusable, for _occasional_ use they may be&nbsp;more economical.&nbsp;But the main benefit is their ubiquity — replacements can be bought almost anywhere, important when you’re away from home and a charger.

![leds_alkaline-1.png](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/328/medium640/leds_alkaline-1.png?1396771088)

(We’re using approximate numbers here. Actual output will vary by some fraction of a volt depending on the cell’s age,&nbsp;state of discharge, temperature and other factors.&nbsp;For most casual projects, these small factors can be ignored for simplicity’s sake.)

When cells are wired&nbsp;_in series_&nbsp;(joined end to end, as when installed in our&nbsp;[4X AA battery holder](http://adafruit.com/products/830)), **add up&nbsp;the voltages to determine the total output:**

![leds_830_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/323/medium640/leds_830_LRG.jpg?1396771027)

4 NiMH cells = 4.8 Volts total. That’s right in our target voltage range, making it&nbsp;perfect for the LED strips! **If you’re using rechargeables, the 4 cell holder can be used directly to power your project.** ![leds_nimh-4.png](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/329/medium640/leds_nimh-4.png?1396771109)

| 4 alkaline cells = 6.0 Volts total. Uh oh… **that's too much!** &nbsp;If connected directly&nbsp;to an LED strip, this will burn it out.&nbsp;Fortunately, there’s an easy workaround… |
