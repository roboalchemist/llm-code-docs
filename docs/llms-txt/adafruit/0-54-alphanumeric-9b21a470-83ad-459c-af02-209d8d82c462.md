# Adafruit LED Backpacks

## Arduino Wiring and Setup

# Downloading the Arduino Library

We wrote a basic library to help you work with the alphanumeric backpack. The library is written for the Arduino and will work with any Arduino as it just uses the I2C pins. The code is very portable and can be easily adapted to any I2C-capable micro.  
  
Begin by downloading our [Adafruit LED Backpack library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library "Link: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library")and the [Adafruit GFX library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) from the Arduino library manager.

Open up the Arduino library manager:

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/084/450/medium800/led_matrices_1library_manager_menu.png?1574045106)

Search for the&nbsp; **Adafruit LED Backpack&nbsp;** library and install it

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/084/451/medium800/led_matrices_led_backpack.png?1574045191)

When asked to install dependencies, click **Install all.**

# Wiring STEMMA QT Version

Here is an example of the STEMMA QT version wired to a Metro using the STEMMA QT connector on the backpack.

- **Board 5V** &nbsp;to **backpack Vio (red wire)**
- **Board GND** &nbsp;to **backpack** **GND (black wire)**
- **Board SCL** &nbsp;to **backpack** **SCL (yellow wire)**
- **Board SDA** &nbsp;to **backpack** **SDA (blue wire)**

![led_matrices_QAB_Arduino_STEMMA_bb.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/115/395/medium640/led_matrices_QAB_Arduino_STEMMA_bb.jpg?1664307667)

Here is an example of the STEMMA QT version wired to a Metro using a solderless breadboard. This example also includes how to wire up the VHi pin, which makes the LEDs appear brighter.

- **Board 5V** &nbsp;to **backpack Vio (long red wire)**
- **Board GND** &nbsp;to **backpack** **GND (black wire)**
- **Board SCL** &nbsp;to **backpack** **SCL (yellow wire)**
- **Board SDA** &nbsp;to **backpack** **SDA (blue wire)**
- **Backpack VIO** to **backpack VHi (short red wire)**

# Wiring Original Version
- Connect **CLK** to the I2C clock - on Arduino UNO thats Analog #5 (or SCL), on the Leonardo it's Digital #3, on the Mega it's digital #21
- Connect **DAT** to the I2C data - on Arduino UNO thats Analog #4 (or SDA), on the Leonardo it's Digital #2, on the Mega it's digital #20
- Connect **GND** to common ground
- Connect **VCC+** to power - 5V is best but 3V will work if that's all you've got (it will be dimmer)
- Connect **Vi2c** to your microcontroller's logic level (3-5V) - If you're using an Arduino, this is almost certainly 5V. If its a 3V Arduino such as a Due, connect it to 3V

Both **Vi2c** and **Vcc** MUST be connected to 3 to 5VDC! Vcc is for the LED driver power, Vi2c is what sets the logic level for communication to the chip.

# Load Demo

Restart the Arduino IDE and load up the **File→Adafruit\_LEDBackpack→quadalphanum** demo

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/017/221/medium800/led_matrix_loaddemo.png?1402079321)

Upload to your Arduino, and open up the Serial console at 9600 baud speed. You'll see each digit light up all the segments, then the display will scroll through the 'font table' showing every character that it knows how to display. Finally, you'll get a notice to start typing into the serial console. Type a message and hit return, you'll see it scroll onto the display!

# Library Reference
For the quad displays, we have a special object that can handle ascii data for easy printing.  
  
You can create the object with  
```
Adafruit_AlphaNum4 alpha4 = Adafruit_AlphaNum4();
```

There's no arguments or pins because the backpacks use the fixed I2C pins.  
By default, the address is 0x70, but you can pass in the I2C address used when you initialize the display with **begin**

```
alpha4.begin(0x70);  // pass in the address
```

Next up, the segments can be turned on/off for each digit by writing the 'raw' bitmap you want, for example, all the LEDs off on digit #3 is

```
alpha4.writeDigitRaw(3, 0x0);
```

All the segments on for digit #0 is

```
alpha4.writeDigitRaw(0, 0x3FFF);
```

This is the segment map:

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/017/225/medium800/led_matrix_segments.png?1402079767)

the 16 bit digit you pass in for raw image has this mapping **:**

> 0 **DP N M L K J H G2 G1 F E D C B A**

The first bit isn't used, you can make it 0 or 1  
  
To turn on just the **A** segment, use 0x0001  
To turn on just the **G1** segment, use 0x0040

# ASCII data
If you're just looking to print 'text' you can use our font table, just pass in an ASCII character!  
  
For example, to set digit #0 to **A** call:  
```
alpha4.writeDigitAscii(0, 'A')
```

# Writing Data
Don't forget to 'write' the data to the display with  
```
alpha4.writeDisplay();
```

That's what actually 'sets' the data onto the LEDs!
