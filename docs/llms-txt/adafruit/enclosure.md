# Reverse Geocache Box

## Enclosure

You can use pretty much any box you want for your reverse geocache. Make sure you don’t cover up the GPS antenna with any metal that would block the reception. I made my box out of cherry and cut holes for the LCD and Power Button. I cut matching 45° angles on the back side to allow the box to open 90°.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/889/medium800/customer_projects_geobox_tutorial_public_top_bottom.jpg?1396788355)

Next, insert all of your electronics. I cut a square hole in the side of the box with a jigsaw so I can connect to the Uno without taking it out of the box. I connected the circuit up to the power switch and mounted the servo on some standoffs.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/891/medium800/customer_projects_IMG_20121113_164444.jpg?1396788381)

I added some foam covered in velvet cloth on the bottom to hold the ring:![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/892/medium800/customer_projects_IMG_20121114_085206.jpg?1396788393)

I added a latch mechanism to the servo arm that locks the box (not shown).- [Previous Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/reverse-geocache-engagement-box/assembly.md)
