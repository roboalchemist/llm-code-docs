# Adalight Project Pack

## Overview

**PLEASE NOTE: we’re retiring this guide but keeping the information up for anyone who might learn from the ideas and code. It relies on an old version of Processing (at some point may stop working on new hardware), recent operating systems are more restrictive about screen capture, and the LEDs used are much less common now than NeoPixels. It _can_ still run with some extra work, but there’s better alternatives now, Google for “DIY Ambilight clone” for others’ projects!**

 **Adalight** &nbsp;is a do-it-yourself LED project kit&nbsp;that adds realtime ambient lighting effects to your computer monitor or home theater media PC. Inspired by the&nbsp;[Ambilight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight)&nbsp;feature of Philips’ LCD HDTVs, Adalight adds pop to TV shows, movies or games!http://vimeo.com/30043456

Adalight relies on the fact that many people now have a computer in their living room for streaming video.&nbsp;Our special&nbsp;software continually analyzes the content of the screen to generate an immersive&nbsp;lighting display.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;a “pass through” device and does not&nbsp;work with your cable TV box or game console, only <u>computer-driven</u> content.  
  
The system is built upon some of the most popular&nbsp;cross-platform, open-source tools, so it works equally well on Windows, Mac or Linux computers.&nbsp;Technical users can climb in and make their own changes — larger displays, multiple monitor support, or adding new features.  
  
**Every monitor is a little&nbsp;different, so this project requires a bit of “maker ingenuity” to complete. Please read through the complete tutorial ahead of time for ideas on parts and tools you may need.**
