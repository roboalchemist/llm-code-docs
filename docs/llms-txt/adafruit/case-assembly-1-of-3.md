# Internet of Things Printer for Raspberry Pi

## Case Prep

# Peel and Clean Case Parts

The enclosure is comprised of seven (7) laser-cut acrylic pieces. **Peel** the paper backing from the acrylic case pieces. Some people use a razor blade as a scraper to get this started, but a fingernail at a corner is usually sufficient and won’t gouge the plastic.

After peeling, the parts may have a little bit of paper soot on them from laser cutting. Wiping off may suffice, or&nbsp;they can be **washed** with soap and water…but be absolutely certain that everything is **<u>completely dry</u>** before assembling components in the case!
