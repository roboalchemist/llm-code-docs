# DeLorean Time Circuit

## Background

Getting the big question right out of the way: no, we&nbsp;_won’t_&nbsp;be selling these. Legally, we&nbsp;_can’t,_&nbsp;for trademark reasons.&nbsp;But it’s generally okay for anyone to create replica props&nbsp;_for their own personal use_, so we hope this writeup will inspire some cool projects among our customers…

From the moment&nbsp;[these](http://www.adafruit.com/products/878)&nbsp;[LED](http://www.adafruit.com/products/880)&nbsp;[displays](http://www.adafruit.com/products/879)&nbsp;made an appearance on our weekly&nbsp;[Ask an Engineer](http://www.adafruit.com/chat/)&nbsp;show, comparisons were being made to the DeLorean&nbsp;time circuit from the&nbsp;_Back to the Future_&nbsp;films. It was a moral imperative then to make a demo! If you’re handy with Arduino and some shop tools, you should be able to pull off something similar (better, even), or adapt the ideas&nbsp;to other projects.&nbsp;This was quickly built in fun, so please don’t expect the same level of polish as a finished product tutorial.
