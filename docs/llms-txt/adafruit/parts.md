## Remove lining from Lid
Carefully peel the fabric lining from the inside of the box lid. &nbsp;You can discard the lining.

## Lay out components
Arrange the major components in the lid and mark their positions. &nbsp;Be sure to leave room for wiring and spacers to support the false lid.  
![biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1117-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/247/medium640/biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1117-1024.jpg?1396794492)

## Measure and mark cutouts
Mark the cutouts for the fingerprint sensor, power switch and keypad cable on the top of the lid. &nbsp;Also mark the position for the power jack on the back of the box.  
![biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1115-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/248/medium640/biometric_2012_12_28_IMG_1115-1024.jpg?1396794498)

## Cut the cable slot
Use an X-Acto or utility knife to cut a rectangular slot for the keypad cable.![biometric_2012_07_02_IMG_0356-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/249/medium640/biometric_2012_07_02_IMG_0356-1024.jpg?1396794507)

## Drill the holes
Drill holes for fingerprint sensor, power switch and power jack.![biometric_2012_07_02_IMG_0354-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/250/medium640/biometric_2012_07_02_IMG_0354-1024.jpg?1396794515)

## Cut a false lid
We will use a false lid to hide the circuitry inside the lid of the box. &nbsp;Cut a piece of 1/8" (3mm)&nbsp;plywood or hardboard to fit the inside of the lid. &nbsp;Also cut some 0.85" (22mm) spacer blocks to go under&nbsp;the false lid.  
![biometric_2012_07_04_IMG_0369-1024.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/251/medium640/biometric_2012_07_04_IMG_0369-1024.jpg?1396794525)

### N-channel power MOSFET

[N-channel power MOSFET](https://www.adafruit.com/product/355)
When you need to switch a lot of power, N-channel MOSFETs are best for the job. These FETs can switch over 60A and 30V and are TO-220 packages so they fit nicely into any breadboard or perfboard. Heat sinking is easy with TO-220's, but because of the very low Rds(on) of down to 0.009 ohms...

### Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC

[Small  Push-Pull Solenoid - 12VDC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/412)
Solenoids are basically electromagnets: they are made of a big coil of copper wire with an armature (a slug of metal) in the middle. When the coil is energized, the slug is pulled into the center of the coil. This makes the solenoid able to pull (from one end) or push (from the other)
