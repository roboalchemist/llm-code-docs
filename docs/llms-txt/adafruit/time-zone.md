# Drive a 16x2 LCD with the Raspberry Pi

## Time Zone

Last, but not least: My Pi came configured with UT (Universal Time). I prefer to see time based on my time zone, which is Mountain. Here is how to configure time on the Pi for any location. This is a one time configuration setting that will survive between reboots.

We can use raspi-config to easy set our timezone. Choose the following:

- Localisation Options
- Change Timezone
- Continent / Country
- Time zone

## Run raspi-config
```auto
sudo raspi-config
```
