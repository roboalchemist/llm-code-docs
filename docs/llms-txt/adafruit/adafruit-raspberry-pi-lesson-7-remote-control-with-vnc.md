# Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Lesson 7. Remote Control with VNC

## Overview

In this lesson we will explain how to install and use VNC on your raspberry Pi. This will allow you to see your Raspberry Pi's desktop remotely in a graphical way, using the mouse as if you were sitting in front of your Pi.

Connecting to a Pi like this can save on desktop clutter, and the problem of having multiple keyboards and mice all over the place. It also means you can put your Pi somewhere else on the network, but still control it.
