## Sew on sockets

Press your snappy Flora against the garment firmly and wiggle the board so the studs make small impressions on the fabric.

These markings show where to sew the corresponding sockets.

Sew the sockets onto the garment with conductive thread. Stitch the threads to their corresponding components of the circuit. Use nail polish or fray check to seal the knots before trimming the loose end very close-- stray threads cause shorts!

The Flora will be connected most securely if it has supporting sockets at various spots around the circular board. If your circuit doesn't use pads on all sides of the Flora, you can sew sockets with plain thread in strategic spots, as seen in the upper right of this photo.

Snap your Flora into position! Try connecting and disconnecting it a few times to test the solder joints again.
