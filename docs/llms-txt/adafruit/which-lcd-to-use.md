# I2C/SPI LCD Backpack

## Which LCD to Use?

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/875/medium800/lcds___displays_variety_t.jpeg?1396777100)

This backpack will work with any 'standard'/'classic'&nbsp; **character** &nbsp;LCD. It does not work with&nbsp; **graphic** &nbsp;LCDs. Character LCDs come in sizes ranging from 8x1 (8 characters, one line) to 40x4 (40 characters, four lines). The backpack will also only fit LCDs that have a single line of pins at the top, not the ones that have a 2x10 or 2x8 connector on the side. Those are much rarer these days but just keep a look out for that!  
  
The backpack will work with RGB LCDs. Just be aware that you won't be able to control the backlight pin, you can do that separately from the LCD control with your microcontroller.

The backpack **won't** work with 40x4 LCDs because they have a second Enable pin.

## Wait - the backpack has 16 holes, but my LCD only has 14 pins!

As long as your LCD has a&nbsp;HD44780&nbsp;driver chip, you're OK.&nbsp;The extra two pins are for the backlight. Your LCD doesn't have a backlight.   
  
We'll show you which holes to ignore in the Assembly section of this guide.
