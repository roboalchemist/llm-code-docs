# Internet of Things Printer for Raspberry Pi

## Case Assembly: 1 of 2

Danger: 

Some case pieces are reversible and can be flipped over and installed either way, while others have a specific orientation. You’ve already been acquainted with a couple&nbsp;of these pieces during the soldering stage. Let’s assign names to the rest of these parts so we can refer to them in these directions:

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/041/012/medium800/raspberry_pi_casemap.png?1492902396)

If you need to replace a broken piece or want to laser-cut your own case in a different color or material, this ZIP file contains all the parts in Adobe Illustrator, PDF and SVG formats:

# Install Raspberry Pi on Bottom Plate

Remove the WiFi adapter and SD card if you haven’t already.

The bottom piece is scored on one side, with an outline showing the placement and orientation of the Raspberry Pi board.

Push out the laser cut holes and mount the Raspberry Pi Board to the bottom plate using the included plastic&nbsp;#4-40 screws

![raspberry_pi_DSC_3464.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/039/501/medium640/raspberry_pi_DSC_3464.jpg?1487630108)

# Install Thermal Printer
The parts baggie included with the thermal printer contains two triangle-shaped brackets and two long screws. These will hold the printer inside the case.  
  
Note the location of the paper feed button. This should be oriented toward the BACK of the printer.

![raspberry_pi_printer1.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/039/503/medium640/raspberry_pi_printer1.jpg?1487630176)

Being mindful of the wires and other attached components, slide the thermal printer through the large slot on the top case piece, with the feed button toward the BACK (the silver button is toward the front).

![raspberry_pi_printer2.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/039/505/medium640/raspberry_pi_printer2.jpg?1487630336)

Set the printer and top piece face-down and insert the two brackets and screws. Use a small screwdriver to secure these in place. Use gentle pressure! Cranking these down tightly can crack the case.

![raspberry_pi_DSC_3469.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/039/506/medium640/raspberry_pi_DSC_3469.jpg?1487630377)

Connect the serial cable and power from the DC jack, noting the labels on the bottom of the printer. The connectors are identical and it’s easy to get these switched around.
