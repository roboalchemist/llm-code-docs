# Analog Inputs for Raspberry Pi Using the MCP3008

## Python Script

The following code can be downloaded directly to your Raspberry Pi. It will read the trimpot value, translate the reading to a volume range and modify the OS output volume level on your Raspberry Pi.&nbsp;

The remap\_range() method is being used to convert the 16-bit analog in range 0 - 65,535 to volume 0-100%.
