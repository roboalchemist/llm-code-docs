# Arduino Lesson 12. LCD Displays - Part 2

## Overview

In this lesson, you will build on what we have learnt in lesson 11 and use a LCD display to show the temperature and light intensity. &nbsp;

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/442/medium800/learn_arduino_overview.jpg?1396783197)

Light intensity is measured using the same photocell that you used in lesson 9.

To measure the temperature, you will use a temperature measurement chip. This device has just three leads two for 5V and GND and the third lead is connected directly to an analog input on the Arduino.

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...
