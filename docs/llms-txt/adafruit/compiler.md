# Chumby Hacker Board

## Compiler

## Toolchain
You can easily install an open source toolchain to get started developing right on the Chumby Hacker board!  
  
Step one is to download the following file [http://files.chumby.com/hacks/falconwing\_toolchain.sh](http://files.chumby.com/hacks/falconwing_toolchain.sh) (20M) and save it onto any USB key. Then insert that USB into one of the CHB's USB ports.  
![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/382/medium800/microcomputers_usbkey.gif?1447864332)

Run&nbsp; **df** &nbsp;to find the name of the USB key![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/383/medium800/microcomputers_df.gif?1447864337)

 **cp** the file from the USB key onto **/mnt/storage**  
  
Then **cd** into /mnt/storage and run the **./falconwing\_toolchain.sh** script to install the toolchain.  
![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/384/medium800/microcomputers_toolchain.gif?1447864338)

When you are done, you can **rm falconwing\_toolchain.sh** to free up some space.  
  
**Please save a backup of the falconwing\_toolchain.sh file somewhere so you dont end up having to re-download it (Chumby is kindly hosting this file but its very large!)**
