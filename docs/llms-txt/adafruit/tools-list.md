## Tools
There are a few tools that are required for assembly. None of these tools are included. If you don't have them, now would be a good time to borrow or purchase them. They are very very handy whenever assembling/fixing/modifying electronic devices! I provide links to buy them, but of course, you should get them where ever is most convenient/inexpensive. Many of these parts are available in a place like Radio Shack or other (higher quality) DIY electronics stores.  
 **Soldering iron**  
  
Any entry level 'all-in-one' soldering iron that you might find at your local hardware store should work. &nbsp;As with most things in life, you get what you pay for. &nbsp;  
  
Upgrading to a higher end soldering iron setup, like the [Hakko FX-888 that we stock in our store](http://adafruit.com/products/180 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/180"), will make soldering fun and easy.  
<u><br>Do not use a "ColdHeat" soldering iron</u>! &nbsp;They are not suitable for delicate electronics work and can damage the kit ([see here](http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/cold-soldering2.htm)).

 **Solder**  
  
You will want rosin core, 60/40 solder. Good solder is a good thing. Bad solder leads to bridging and cold solder joints which can be tough to find.

 **Multimeter**  
  
You will need a good quality basic multimeter that can measure voltage and continuity.

 **Flush Diagonal Cutters**  
  
You will need flush diagonal cutters to trim the wires and leads off of components once you have soldered them in place.  
  
[Click here to buy our favorite cutters.](http://adafruit.com/products/152 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/152")

 **Solder Sucker**  
  
Strangely enough, that's the technical term for this desoldering vacuum tool. Useful in cleaning up mistakes, every electrical engineer has one of these on their desk.  
  
[Click here to buy a one.](http://adafruit.com/products/148 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/148")

 **Helping Third Hand With Magnifier**  
  
Not&nbsp;_absolutely&nbsp;_necessary but will make things go much much faster, and it will make soldering much easier.  
  
[Pick one up here.](http://adafruit.com/products/291 "Link: http://adafruit.com/products/291")
