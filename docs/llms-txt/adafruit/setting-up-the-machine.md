# Skill Badge Guide: 3D Printing

## Setting up the machine

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/031/628/medium800/3d_printing_controlsC.jpg?1460151189)

Before you operate your machine, check the following to ensure its proper operation:

1. Make sure the filament spool is installed properly and turns freely.
2. Gently move each axis and ensure they move smoothly.
3. Check that the build platform is level.

These three checks will help to eliminate many of the problems that inhibit a good print job. If the spool sticks while it unravels it will pull up on the extruder and may prevent it from extruding. If the axis don't move freely, they may need to be greased or realigned. This will help prevent the stepper from skipping a step, resulting in a shifted print job. Finally, if the build platform is not level the first layer will most likely not stick evenly and will cause distortion or warping of the printed model.
