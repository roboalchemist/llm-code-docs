## Fabrication

To keep this ultra slim, a&nbsp;[Teensy](https://www.adafruit.com/products/199)&nbsp;microcontroller board was used — a standard Arduino wouldn’t fit, not even the&nbsp;[headerless Leonardo](https://www.adafruit.com/products/883 "Link: https://www.adafruit.com/products/883"). After prototyping the full circuit on a breadboard, all the parts were soldered point-to-point and “dead bug” style inside the case.&nbsp;Power is provided by three AA cells in series — a bit under the ideal 5 Volts, but still sufficient to run everything. The cells fit in the “chin” below the three dates. I’d mail-ordered a special battery holder for this, and then in my rush to complete the project I went ahead and made all the case parts based on the holder dimensions on a web site.&nbsp;Naturally then, with the case already cut and glued, the part that arrived was slightly larger than the dimensions posted.&nbsp;The fix was to break off the battery contacts from the ends of the holder and epoxy putty them directly into the case. This eliminated just enough girth for everything to fit. The remaining electronics were delicately folded into the case with copious amounts of hot-melt glue, tape and swearing.

The case was fabricated from laser-cut acrylic and sprayed with faux hammered metal paint.&nbsp;A metal enclosure would have been more authentic (and more work), but a corollary to “[Maslow’s hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)” dictates that when you have a laser cutter, every project appears ideally suited to acrylic.

The labels were inkjet printed&nbsp;and made into stickers with a Xyron applicator, trimmed with an X-Acto knife, then painstakingly touched up with a Sharpie marker to hide the white edges.&nbsp;After the labels were applied, the bezels received a thick spray of acrylic sealer, then attached to the front of the case with epoxy.

A classic Dymo labeler (the plastic punched letter kind) might suffice here.&nbsp;In the film trilogy, most of the instruments (including the Flux Capacitor) were labeled that way. But the Time Circuit, being a close-up “hero prop” that required maximum legibility for the audience, had cleanly-printed labels.&nbsp;Sticklers for accuracy might want to take the extra step.
