# Arduino Lesson 10. Making Sounds

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to make sounds with your Arduino. First you will make the Arduino play a 'musical' scale and then combine this with a photocell, to make a Theremin-like instrument that changes the pitch played as you wave your hand over the photocell.

### Piezo Buzzer

[Piezo Buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160)
Piezo buzzers are used for making beeps, tones and alerts. This one is petite but loud! Drive it with 3-30V peak-to-peak square wave. To use, connect one pin to ground (either one) and the other pin to a square wave out from a timer or microcontroller. For the loudest tones, stay around 4 KHz,...

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...
