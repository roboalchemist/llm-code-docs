# Creating Accurate Footprints in Eagle

## Finding an Accurate Reference

In order to make an accurate footprint, you need a mechanically accurate reference image. &nbsp;Thankfully, most datasheets contain accurate mechanical drawings for at least the top and side view, which is enough in our case to produce an accurate 2D outline of the part.  
  
As an example, we'll be working with the following image from a datasheet for a surface-mount push-push micro-SD connector:
