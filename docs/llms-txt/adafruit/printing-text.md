## Printing Text

The thermal printer has a few handy things it can do, most of which are in the **A\_printertest** &nbsp;sketch. These are shown in the image above. In order, starting from the top:

- Inverted text:&nbsp;this is invoked by calling&nbsp;**inverseOn()**&nbsp;— you will get text that’s white-on-black instead of black-on-white.&nbsp;**inverseOff()&nbsp;**turns this off.
- Double height: this makes text thats extra tall, call&nbsp;**doubleHeightOn()**&nbsp;—&nbsp;likewise, turn off with&nbsp;**doubleHeightOff()**
- Left/Center/Right justified: this aligns text to&nbsp;the left or right edge of the page, or centered. You can set the alignment by calling&nbsp;**justify('R')&nbsp;**(for right-justified),&nbsp;**justify('C')&nbsp;**(for centered) or&nbsp;**justify('L')&nbsp;**(for left-justified). Left-justified is the default state.
- **Bold** text: makes it stand out a bit more, enable with&nbsp;**boldOn()**&nbsp;and turn off with&nbsp;**boldOff()**
- Underlined text: makes it stand out a bit more, enable with&nbsp;**underlineOn()**&nbsp;and turn off with&nbsp;**underlineOff()**
- Large/Medium/Small text: by default we use small, medium is twice as tall, large is twice as wide/tall. Set the size with&nbsp;**setSize('L')**,&nbsp;**setSize('M')**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**setSize('S')**
- Line spacing: you can change the space&nbsp;_between&nbsp;_lines of text by calling&nbsp;**setLineHeight()**&nbsp;where&nbsp; **numpix** &nbsp;is the number of pixels. The minimum is 24 (no extra space between lines), the default spacing is 32, and double-spaced text would be 64.

Look through the source of the A\_printertest sketch to see these used in context.
