# Arduino Lesson 15. DC Motor Reversing

## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to control both the direction and speed of a small DC motor using an Arduino and the L293D motor driver chip.

### DC Toy / Hobby Motor - 130 Size

[DC Toy / Hobby Motor - 130 Size](https://www.adafruit.com/product/711)
These are standard '130 size' DC hobby motors. They come with a wider operating range than most toy motors: from 4.5 to 9VDC instead of 1.5-4.5V. This range makes them perfect for controlling with an Adafruit Motor Shield, or with an Arduino where you are more likely to have 5 or 9V...
