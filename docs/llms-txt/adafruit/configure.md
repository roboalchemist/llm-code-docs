## Configure

You'll also need to configure the barcode scanner. The way you configure it is very cute, once its powered you scan barcodes from the printed out manual (see Downloads below) to tell it how you are going to use it, what volume the beeper should beep at, etc. etc. If you're using RS-232 you would indicate the baud rate by scanning say the 9600 baud rate in the manual.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/874/medium800/shipping_quickstart.jpg?1396766121)
