# DIY WiFi Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Camera

## Next Steps…

This is just a taster. Where you go next is up to you…

- The camera board could be swapped out for the infrared-sensitive [Pi NoIR](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1567) camera.
- The Icon and Button classes in the cam.py script are pretty rudimentary, but might be sufficient for your own touchscreen applications (whether photography-related or otherwise).  
- The camera code could be expanded to do new things. There are _lots_ of [camera settings we haven’t even touched](http://picamera.readthedocs.org). Other capabilities like a self-timer, intervalometer or motion detection could be added. Or capturing video.

Look at this embarrassing assemblage of _rubber bands!_ There’s so much more that could be done here for a proper enclosure…perhaps even laser-cut or 3D-printed if you have access to such.

The package could be slimmed down considerably; there’s a _huge_ amount of empty space between the PiTFT and Raspberry Pi (even more with a Model A board). Advanced makers could squeeze a slim LiPo battery and a 5V boost converter in there, connecting to the expansion header at the right edge of the TFT board instead of the side-protruding USB power connector. The result would be similar in size to some consumer point-and-shoot digital cameras.
