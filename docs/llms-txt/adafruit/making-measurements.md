_This section focuses measuring the power produced by a solar cell._  
  
Materials Needed:  

- Solar cell with terminals exposed
- Ruler or Caliper
- Multimeter
- Notepaper

Do EACH of the following and submit to your instructor:  
  

1. Measure and calculate the surface area (Aeff) of the solar cell supplied by your instructor.
2. Configure and use a multimeter to measure your cell’s Voc in direct sunlight. Record your results.
3. Configure and use a multimeter to measure your cell’s Isc in direct sunlight. Record your results.
4. Calculate your cell’s approximate Psa. Record your results.
5. Calculate your cell’s approximate efficiency based on a Pin of 1000W/m^2.
6. Record your results. ɳ = Psa / (Pin x Aeff)
