# Skill Badge Guide: 3D Printing

## 3D Printing Overview

The 3D printer uses a process called _fused deposition modeling_ to construct a solid object from a virtual model. This process involves the controlled deposition of a molten feed stock, typically ABS or PLA plastic, onto a build surface where layer-by-layer the model emerges. Each 3D printer features a series of motors to move the three axis and the extruder, and a controller to move the motors and manage the build process.
