# Basic Resistor Sensor Reading on Raspberry Pi

## How it works

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/326/medium800/raspberry_pi_TEK0000.jpg?1396771056)

This capture from an oscilloscope shows whats happening on the digital pin (yellow). The blue line indicates when the Pi starts counting and when the counting is complete, about 4.5ms later.  
  
This is because the capacitor acts like a bucket and the resistor is like a thin pipe. To fill a bucket up with a very thin pipe takes enough time that you can figure out how wide the pipe is by timing how long it takes to fill the bucket up halfway  
  
In this case, our 'bucket' is a 1uF ceramic capacitor. You can change the capacitor nearly any way you want but the timing values will also change. 1uF seems to be an OK place to start for most sensors. If you want more range, use a bigger cap - but it will take longer to measure. For faster reads, go with a smaller capacitor

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...
