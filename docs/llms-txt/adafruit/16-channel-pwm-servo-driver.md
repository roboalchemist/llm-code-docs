# Adafruit  PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Driver

## Overview

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/292/medium800/adafruit_products_ID815servo_LRG.jpg?1396781394)

Driving servo motors with the Arduino Servo library is pretty easy, but each one consumes&nbsp;a precious pin - not to mention some Arduino processing power. &nbsp;The Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver will drive up to 16 servos over I2C with only 2 pins. &nbsp;The on-board PWM controller will drive all 16 channels simultaneously with no additional Arduino processing overhead. &nbsp;What's more, you can chain up to&nbsp;62 of them&nbsp;to control up to 992&nbsp;servos - all with&nbsp;the same 2 pins!  
  
The Adafruit PWM/Servo Driver is the perfect solution for any project that requires a lot of servos.
