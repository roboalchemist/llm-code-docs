# Barcode Scanner

## Stand

If you are scanning at a desk, it may be convenient to have the scanner in a stand, this way you dont have to press the trigger every time to scan a sheet of paper. We use the stand and then just slide invoices with barcodes underneath the scanner. There's a little magnet in the stand and the scanner detects it to know when it should stay on. There are also powersaving modes if you want, check the manual for the config barcodes![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/876/medium800/shipping_stand.jpg?1396766106)
