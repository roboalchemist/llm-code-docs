# 1.8" TFT Display Breakout and Shield

## Breakout Assembly

## Prepare the header strip:

Cut the strip to length if necessary. It will be easier to solder if you insert it into a breadboard - **long pins down**

![lcds___displays_header.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/019/556/medium640/lcds___displays_header.jpg?1409944088)

## Add the breakout board:

Place the breakout board over the pins so that the short pins poke through the breakout pads

## And Solder!

Be sure to solder all pins for reliable electrical contact.
