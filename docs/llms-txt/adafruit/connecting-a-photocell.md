## Connecting a Photocell

Because photocells are basically resistors, they are non-polarized. That means you can connect them up 'either way' and they'll work just fine!![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/456/medium800/light_cdsbb.jpg?1396763194)

Photocells are pretty hardy, you can easily solder to them, clip the leads, plug them into breadboards, use alligator clips, etc. The only care you should take is to avoid bending the leads right at the epoxied sensor, as they could break off if flexed too often.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/457/medium800/light_cdswired.jpg?1396763201)

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...

### Digital Multimeter

[Digital Multimeter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/71)
This is a basic multimeter, I've played with it a bunch and I think its a great addition to a toolbox. It's low cost and simple to use with a big clear display and all the measurements you need:

- AC/DC Voltage measurement
- Current measurement, from 1uA up to...
