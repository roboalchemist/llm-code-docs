## SMT Wipes

Now that you've finished stenciling, you'll want to clean up! Paste can get everywhere, especially when doing a lot of boards and the paste is liquidy. We recycle our paste (putting it back into the pot) even though its suggested not to do that. (If we ever go thru a pot a day maybe we wont have to but paste is pretty expensive!) Then we wipe down the scrapers, stencil and area using SMT stencil wipes which are totally awesome and make clean up really easy. They're also good for cleaning off a board if/when you have a messy stencil paste deposit and want to redo it.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/000/339/medium800/manufacturing_smtwipes.jpg?1396762294)
