# How to Make a Pogo Pin Test Jig

## Arduino Shield Jigs

I will be using [an Arduino to make this jig](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=17&products_id=50). Arduinos are very standard, easy to power and are a breeze for short projects like this. You'll also want a [proto shield PCB](http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=17_21&products_id=55 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main\_page=product\_info&cPath=17\_21&products\_id=55")  
  
I think I'll put the victim...like this!

Mark and drill the mounting holes - four in this case. Luckily (or on purpose???) I placed the mounting holes on 0.1" boundaries.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/526/medium800/manufacturing_drill.jpeg?1396784071)

Solder wires from each pogo pin to a matching pin on the shield. For this SD card interface I connected the SPI pins to the SPI port. Then the output of the 3.3v regulator goes to an analog pin. I also connected the card detect pin up so I can tell when a board is being tested.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/528/medium800/manufacturing_wires.jpeg?1396784093)

A piezo buzzer is connected to pin #9 (underneath the PCB).![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/529/medium800/manufacturing_wiresolder.jpeg?1396784104)
