# Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Lesson 5. Using a Console Cable

## Software Installation (Mac)

OSX includes terminal emulation software that you can use from the command line, so we only need to install the USB drivers for the cable.

# Install Drivers

Next, install the latest drivers for the cable chipset.

There's _two_ possible chipsets. The older cables use Prolific brand, the newer cables (as of 2017) use SiLabs brand. **If you're not sure which you have, just install both drivers! There's no risk and the cable will work no matter what**

&nbsp;

## Prolific Chipset

For the "Prolific Chipset"&nbsp; cable, grab the drivers from here

[You can grab the latest drivers from Prolific!](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41)
[Here is a mirror of PL2303_Mac_OSX_Drv_V1_6_2_20190723.rar in case Prolific is down](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/081/284/original/PL2303_Mac_OSX_Drv_V1_6_2_20190723.rar?1569118464)
And if you're using an [older version of Mac OS&nbsp;X (10.8-10.6) then try this Prolific driver version 1.5.1](https://www.adafruit.com/images/product-files/954/md_PL2303_MacOSX_10_6-10_10_v1_5_1.zip).

## SiLabs CP210X Drivers

If you are running [**Mac OS X , please use the SiLabs drivers**](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) here

Warning: 

[Download LEGACY Mac CP210X Driver](http://community.silabs.com/t5/Interface-Knowledge-Base/Legacy-OS-Software-and-Driver-Packages/ta-p/182585)
# Install!

Both downloads are standard Mac installers. Accept all defaults when prompted.
