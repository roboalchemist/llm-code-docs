# Digital LED Belt

## Solder Header

This step is pretty easy, find the small header piece in the package and solder it into the spot at the end of the Atmega32u4 breakout board. Make sure the short pins are going into the PCB and the long pins are facing up.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/319/medium800/led_strips_2x3place.jpg?1396795381)

You may need to use a piece of tape to keep the header in place while soldering it. Solder all 6 pins.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/320/medium800/led_strips_2x3solder.jpg?1396795390)
