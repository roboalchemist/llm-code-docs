_The following section focuses on investigating the different concepts that govern the operation of a solar cell._  
  
Do EACH of the following and submit to your instructor:

1. Identify and describe the photoelectric effect.
2. Identify and describe three different types of solar cells, their advantages and disadvantages.
3. Identify and describe the layers that make up a typical cell.
4. Identify and describe the following terminology:

  1. Effective surface area (Aeff)
  2. Open circuit voltage (Voc)
  3. Short circuit current &nbsp;(Isc)
  4. Power output (Psa)
  5. Input power density (Pin)
  6. Efficiency (ɳ)

5. Identify and describe the hardware that makes up a panel.
6. Identify and describe how individual cells are connected to make a panel.
7. Describe why solar technology might be cost prohibitive.

  1. What can be done to lower the cost?

8. Identify the equipment and describe the method in which solar panels are connected to the electrical grid.
9. Identify and describe two methods for storing the electrical energy produced by your solar cell.
