## Setting the Time

First wake the watch by **tapping** either side button. With the time display active, you can enter time-setting mode by **holding** down **both** side buttons for about two seconds.&nbsp;If using the watch for the first time, or after swapping batteries, it may wake in time-setting mode automatically.

Date and time are set by cycling through each digit.&nbsp;The currently-active digit is shown with a blinking underline cursor.&nbsp; **Tap** the **left** button to advance to the next digit, or **tap** the **right** button to increment the current digit (it will “roll over” to 0 or 1 as needed).

## **Tap&nbsp;**** →⌚ = Next digit**  
**⌚← Tap = Current digit +1**
There are two digits each for the year, month, day, hour and minute, and the watch will briefly display the symbols **Y** , **M** , **D** , etc. when&nbsp;moving from one pair of digits to the next. The high and low digits are set individually…this is different from most digital clocks, we find it faster and less troublesome.&nbsp;The range for each digit varies, and the watch will keep the values&nbsp;in check.

There is no seconds adjustment. Seconds will be reset to zero when exiting time-setting mode.  
The last “digit” is&nbsp;a 12- or 24-hour display mode selection.&nbsp;12/24 currently only affects the marquee mode; the binary display is limited to&nbsp;12-hour time. Advancing past the 12/24 item will scroll back to the first digit of the year. So if you overshoot a digit you wanted to set, just repeatedly tap the left button until you roll around to it again.

## Tap →⌚ =&nbsp;Y→Y→M→M→D→D→H→H→M→M→12/24↩
To exit time-setting mode and&nbsp;return to the last time display mode, **hold** down **both** buttons for two seconds again.
