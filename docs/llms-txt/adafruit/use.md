## Using the WebIDE

Danger: 

The Adafruit Learning System Raspberry Pi WebIDE is packed with neat features. &nbsp;Many of which aren't all that obvious. &nbsp;Here is a running list of all of those features, and how they work.

Danger: 

[https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-WebIDE/issues](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-WebIDE/issues)![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/172/medium800/adafruit_products_Using1.jpg?1396780142)

When you first load up the WebIDE for the first time, you should see something similar to what you see above (click on the image to view it in its full size).

1. Here is where you can view your editor settings.
2. Here is a list of all of your repositories. The Adafruit Raspberry Pi Python Code repository ([https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git)) is automatically cloned into your Bitbucket account. We have also created a my-pi-projects repository. If it has the little folder icon, that means there are files contained within. If it has an arrow icon, that means it is a file that can be viewed in the WebIDE.
3. Click here to clone a repository from Github or Bitbucket. Follow the instructions in the popup.
4. No matter where you are in the WebIDE, there will always be a terminal button. Click this to talk directly to your Raspberry Pi, or do things like install libraries without leaving the WebIDE. Handy!
5. When you first log in (or refresh your WebIDE in your browser), you will be greeted with a nice message. Read this for any news on the WebIDE.

&nbsp;

When you view any of the included code examples from Adafruit, there are a couple unique items.

1. As with any piece of code, you can simply click the Run button to execute the code on your Raspberry Pi. &nbsp;The terminal will automatically open when you click Run.
2. The Adafruit code is read only, but you can easily copy this code to your my-pi-projects repository. &nbsp;Just click this link and it will automatically copy the folder, and all of its contents over.

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/174/medium800/adafruit_products_Using3.jpg?1396780159)

Once you have copied, imported, or created code from scratch in your my-pi-projects (or other repository), this is the screen you will see.

1. If you want to create a new file, press this button, and name your file (make sure to add a proper file type, like .py to the end of your name, otherwise the editor won't know what to do with it). &nbsp;Then click save to add your new file to the current folder.
2. You can also upload a premade file. &nbsp;Once again, make sure it is named properly before importing. &nbsp;You can also import images to the folder (and view those images right in the IDE).
3. Make sure to click save after making any changes to code. &nbsp;This will then update the files in your Bitbucket account.

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/175/medium800/adafruit_products_Using4.jpg?1396780167)

Renaming and deleting files is easy!

1. Just right click on any of the files that you want to change and the following box will pop up. &nbsp;Click delete to permanently delete that file. &nbsp;If you click rename, you will be asked what name you want the file to change to. &nbsp;Make the change, then click save.

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/176/medium800/adafruit_products_Using5.jpg?1396780172)

In the upper right of the WebIDE, you will see this.

1. If it is green, and says 'Connected', that means the WebIDE is communicating with your Raspberry Pi. If it is disconnected, the WebIDE will keep trying to make contact with your Pi for awhile, then it will finally give up. It will then ask you to reconnect your Pi, and refresh the browser.
2. You can log out of your Bitbucket account at any time by clicking Log out. 

What isn't shown in the image above is our auto-update feature. If we push out a new update for the WebIDE, you will see it pop up between 'Connected' and 'Log out'. Simply click the link, sit back, and the WebIDE will automatically download, unpack, install, restart your Raspberry Pi, and even refresh your browser for you. It doesn't get any easier than that.  
  
In order to see if there are updates available, refresh your browser every day.  
  
Once the WebIDE is installed, you can shutdown (shutdown -h now) or restart (shutdown -r now) your Pi anytime. The next time you want to use it, just start your Pi, and reload **raspberrypi.local** to log back into the WebIDE. - [Previous Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/webide/getting-started.md)
