## Tin the pads

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/911/medium800/flora_DSC_0014.jpg?1396788650)

Use your hot soldering iron to heat up one of the metal pads on the back of the Flora. Apply a small amount of solder to the pad. This is called tinning.

Spread the solder around the metal pad with the tip of your soldering iron. The solder will form the connection between the Flora and the snap.
