# 2.8" TFT Touchscreen

## Mounting Options

Info: 

We wanted to make sure that you could easily put this display in a box. There are four mounting holes on tabs. If you really don't need the tabs they can be cut off with a hacksaw or tin-snips. The holes are 2.25" apart in the short direction and 2.95" apart in the long direction. The drill holes are 0.125" and will easily take a #4 imperial or M3 (3mm) screw. The PCB is 0.063" thick.- [Previous Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/2-8-tft-touchscreen/connection-options.md)
