# Send Raspberry Pi Data to COSM

## COSM Graph View

Info: 

This is how COSM [displays the temperature we are sending it](https://cosm.com/feeds/68872).&nbsp;We can see both celsius and fahrenheit temperature graphs.&nbsp;The graphs have independent sliders&nbsp;so it can easily be adjusted from minutes to weeks to months. There are a lot of fun settings for viewing the graph data.   
  
A really cool feature is that you can have triggers go off based on the data values. COSM will alert you via HTTP POST or Twitter so that you can setup alarms if things go bad. If we connected up more sensors the MCP3008 we could easily have more graphs appear.&nbsp;
