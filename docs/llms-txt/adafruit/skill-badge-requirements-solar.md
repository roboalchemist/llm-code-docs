# Skill Badge Requirements: Solar

## Overview

Solar cells, or photovoltaics, are made out of photosensitive semiconductors that convert light energy into electricity in a process known as the photoelectric effect. This process describes the interaction between light energy and the materials that make up the individual cell. Depending on how the cell is configured, conversion efficiencies can exceed 30%!

_Instructions for completion:_  
  
Record the section, item number and requirement before each response on your notepaper. This will assist your instructor when evaluating the completion of the requirements.  
  
**Example:**  
  
2.1 Measure and calculate the surface area (Aeff) of the solar cell supplied by your instructor.  

- I calculated the surface area (Aeff) of my solar cell to be 2 square inches, with the dimensions of 2in x 1in.
