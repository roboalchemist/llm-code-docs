### PIR (motion) sensor

[PIR (motion) sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/189)
PIR sensors are used to detect motion from pets/humanoids from about 20 feet away (possibly works on zombies, not guaranteed). This one has an adjustable delay before firing (approx 2-4 seconds), adjustable sensitivity **and** we include a 1 foot (30 cm) cable with a socket so you...
