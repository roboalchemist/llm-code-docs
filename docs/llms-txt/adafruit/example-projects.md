### Terminal Block - 2-pin 3.5mm - pack of 5!

[Terminal Block - 2-pin 3.5mm - pack of 5!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/724)
Nothing makes a project harder to maintain than a lot of loose wiring. That's why we like to use terminal blocks whenever making PCB-to-Wire connections. These particular 3.5mm terminal blocks are our favorite: big enough for a range of wire gauges, easy to adjust with a screwdriver, and...
