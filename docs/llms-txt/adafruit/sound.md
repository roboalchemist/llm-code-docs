# Arduino Lesson 10. Making Sounds

## Sound

Sound waves are vibrations in the air pressure. The speed of the vibrations (cycles per second or Hertz) is what makes the pitch of the sound. The higher the frequency of the vibration, the higher the pitch.

Middle C is usually defined as a frequency of 261 Hz. If you turn a digital output on and off again 261 times every second then that output will be middle C.

To hear the output, we need to attach something that will convert the electrical signal into sound waves. This can be done with a loudspeaker or as we have used here a piezo sounder.

Piezo sounders use a special crystal that expands and contracts as an electrical signal passes through it. This will generate a tone that we can hear.

### Piezo Buzzer

[Piezo Buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160)
Piezo buzzers are used for making beeps, tones and alerts. This one is petite but loud! Drive it with 3-30V peak-to-peak square wave. To use, connect one pin to ground (either one) and the other pin to a square wave out from a timer or microcontroller. For the loudest tones, stay around 4 KHz,...

### Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)

[Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)
CdS cells are little light sensors. As the squiggly face is exposed to more light, the resistance goes down. When it's light, the resistance is about ~1KΩ, when dark it goes up to ~10KΩ.

To use, connect one side of the photocell (either one, it's symmetric) to power...
