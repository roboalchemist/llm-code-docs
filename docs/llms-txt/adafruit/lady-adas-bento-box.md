Portage for your projects!&nbsp;[Lady Ada's Bento Box](http://www.adafruit.com/products/765)&nbsp;is a crush-proof, drop-proof & water-proof prototyping kit that combines the ultra-rugged&nbsp;[Otterbox 3000](http://www.adafruit.com/products/339)&nbsp;with a&nbsp;[storage tin](http://www.adafruit.com/products/97)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[half-size (400-point) breadboard](http://www.adafruit.com/products/64)&nbsp;. In the middle is a spot for attaching an Arduino UNO (or any other PCB that has the same shape and mounting holes). There's plenty of clearance for wires (even ones with plastic bits on the end such as our premium jumper wires or wire bundles) and parts on the breadboard, and the box is so sturdy you never have to worry about any delicate parts inside getting damaged. Toss it in your backpack, suitcase, duffel bag and you can be sure to work on it when you get to school, work or home. **The Otterbox we were using has been sadly discontinued but here are the files if you want to mod & hack&nbsp; your own!**
