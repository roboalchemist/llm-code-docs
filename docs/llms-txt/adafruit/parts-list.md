## Electronics
Because many users already have Arduino hardware,&nbsp; **the kit does not include microcontroller and/or network boards**. You will need to additionally purchase or bring:

- an&nbsp;Arduino Ethernet&nbsp;board and a USB-to-serial programming adapter such as the&nbsp;[FTDI Friend](https://www.adafruit.com/products/284)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[TTL-232 Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/70).

-or-

- an&nbsp;Arduino Uno / [Adafruit Metro 328P board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2488) and&nbsp;[Ethernet Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2971).

Directions are provided for both. In either case, you will also need:

- Cables for USB programming and Ethernet.
