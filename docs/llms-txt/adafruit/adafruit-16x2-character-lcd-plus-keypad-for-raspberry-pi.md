## Overview

This new Adafruit plate makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. We really like the range of LCDs we stock in the shop, such as our classic&nbsp;[blue & white](http://www.adafruit.com/products/181 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/181")&nbsp;as well as the fancy&nbsp;[RGB negative](http://www.adafruit.com/products/399 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/399")&nbsp;and&nbsp;[RGB positive](http://www.adafruit.com/products/398). Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then perhaps another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Raspberry Pi!

With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control&nbsp; **a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the Pi!** &nbsp;The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.

Info: 

This plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.&nbsp;  
  
The kit is designed for any Raspberry Pi - version 1 and 2.  
  
[If you want plug in a Cobbler or Gertboard at the same time, check out our Stacking Header, you can fit an IDC cable over it if the Plate is assembled with this part.](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1112 "Link: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1112")
