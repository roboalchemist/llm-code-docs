# Reverse Geocache Box

## Parts and Tools

To get started with your reverse geocache build, here are the required parts:

[An Arduino UNO](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50) -&nbsp;The brains of the reverse geocache.![customer_projects_arduinounor3_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/874/medium640/customer_projects_arduinounor3_LRG.jpg?1396788220)

[Adafruit Ultimate GPS Module](http://www.adafruit.com/products/746) - This little guy will tell us where we are, and where we need to go.![customer_projects_746_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/875/medium640/customer_projects_746_LRG.jpg?1396788227)

[A Standard 16x2 LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/181) - This will be used to communicate with the person using the reverse geocache box. &nbsp;You can have it help people navigate to the destination, give them a clue, or ask them to marry you. &nbsp;:)![customer_projects_LCDblue162_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/876/medium640/customer_projects_LCDblue162_LRG.jpg?1396788236)

[A Micro Servo](http://www.adafruit.com/products/169) - This little servo will be used to lock and unlock the box with the Arduino.![customer_projects_ID169_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/877/medium640/customer_projects_ID169_LRG.jpg?1396788244)

[Prototyping Board](http://www.adafruit.com/products/571) - Assemble and solder your electronics to this proto-board so it doesn't fall apart in the field.![customer_projects_permaprotohalf_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/878/medium640/customer_projects_permaprotohalf_LRG.jpg?1396788253)

[A Power Switch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/915) - Kenton prefers the Adafruit Waterproof Metal On/Off Switch (with blue LED ring).![customer_projects_metalbutton16mmblue_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/879/medium640/customer_projects_metalbutton16mmblue_LRG.jpg?1396788264)

[Hook-Up Wire](https://www.adafruit.com/products/288 "Link: https://www.adafruit.com/products/288") - For connecting all of the electronics together.![customer_projects_redwire_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/880/medium640/customer_projects_redwire_LRG.jpg?1396788271)

[A Battery](https://www.adafruit.com/products/67) - Power the whole thing with this 9V battery holder.![customer_projects_9vbattplug_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/881/medium640/customer_projects_9vbattplug_LRG.jpg?1396788280)

A Box - Something to enclose the project in. &nbsp;Kenton made his out of cherry, but you can use just about anything. &nbsp;Just don't use a metal box, as the metal will block the GPS signals.

Also, you will need a few tools and supplies:

[A Soldering Iron](http://adafruit.com/products/180) - Use this to solder the electronics to the proto-board. &nbsp;If you have never soldered before, [check out our soldering tutorial here](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).![customer_projects_xytronics258usa_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/883/medium640/customer_projects_xytronics258usa_LRG.jpg?1396788300)

[A Spool of Solder](http://adafruit.com/products/145)![customer_projects_145solder_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/884/medium640/customer_projects_145solder_LRG.jpg?1396788309)

[Solder Wick](http://adafruit.com/products/149) - To fix your soldering mistakes the easy way.![customer_projects_wick_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/885/medium640/customer_projects_wick_LRG.jpg?1396788315)

[Wire Cutter & Stripper](http://adafruit.com/products/527)![customer_projects_csp301_LRG.jpg](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/886/medium640/customer_projects_csp301_LRG.jpg?1396788321)
