# Conductive Thread

## Connecting components

The thread must travel between components to connect them, while avoiding other paths of conductive thread in the circuit. The thread acts like uninsulated wire or traces on a circuit board, but this circuit board is made out of fabric!

The most straightforward connection is a running stitch. You can also learn many more [hand embroidery stitches](http://www.needlenthread.com/2006/06/basic-embroidery-stitches-line-stitches.html) which can have decorative or functional appeal in your project.

As you stitch along, pause periodically to whip-stitch a chainable pixel's ground pad (-).

Turning 180 degrees

Now that all the pixels are anchored by one pad, clean up any stray threads on the back.

Tie a knot with a sewing needle! Insert the needle under a previous stitch.

Pull the thread almost all the way through, leaving a small loop. Put your needle through this loop and pull the thread through, creating a tight knot.  
  
Don't forget to seal the knot with Fray Check or clear nail polish before trimming the tail closely.

[Stainless Thin Conductive Yarn / Thick Conductive Thread - 30 ft](https://www.adafruit.com/product/603)
This 316L stainless steel thread falls somewhere between a thick thread and a thin yarn. Most sewing machines wouldn't be happy with this thread since its thick, and it has the 'furry' soft feel of yarn which makes it poor for most e-textiles/wearables projects. However, the high...
