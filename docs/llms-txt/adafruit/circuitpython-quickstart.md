# Nokia 5110/3310 Monochrome LCD

## CircuitPython Wiring

It's easy to use the Nokia 5110/3310 LCD with CircuitPython and the&nbsp;[Adafruit CircuitPython PCD8544](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PCD8544)&nbsp;module.&nbsp; This module allows you to easily write Python code to control the display.

You can use this sensor with any CircuitPython microcontroller board or with a computer that has GPIO and Python&nbsp;[thanks to Adafruit\_Blinka, our CircuitPython-for-Python compatibility library](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux).

We'll cover how to wire the Nokia LCD to your CircuitPython microcontroller board. First assemble your LCD.

We're going to show you how to wire it up to a Feather M4 Express. Because the logic levels on a Feather M4 Express are already 3.3v, you don't need a logic level shifter.

Connect the LCD to your microcontroller board as shown below.

- **Microcontroller GND&nbsp;** to **&nbsp;LCD Gnd**  
- **Microcontroller 3V&nbsp;** to **LCD Vcc**
- **Microcontroller SCK&nbsp;** to **LCD&nbsp;Clk**
- **Microcontroller MOSI&nbsp;** to **LCD Din**
- **Microcontroller D6&nbsp;** to **LCD D/C**
- **Microcontroller D5&nbsp;** to **LCD&nbsp;CS**
- **Microcontroller D9&nbsp;** to **LCD&nbsp;Rst**
- **Microcontroller D10&nbsp;** to **LCD Led**
