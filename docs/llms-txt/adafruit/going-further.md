# GPS Dog Collar

## Going Further

## The Original Summary

That about sums up the main parts of the code. &nbsp;Your challenge, should you choose to accept, is to improve upon what we have done here. &nbsp;The next logical step would be to use the built in data logger feature of the Ultimate GPS module, and map your dog walks when you get home.

## Going Further

This project was completed in 2012. Advancements in parts are such that this project might be more easily done on a board such as a Feather M0 in CircuitPython.

As far as replicating the original project: Adafruit now carries the original ATmega32u4 processor on the Feather 32u4 Basic and Feather 32u4 Adalogger boards. The latter provides an SD card capability good for data logging. At present we do not have diagrams and code to implement the project with these boards but the changes from the original processor board would&nbsp; be very small. The boards are listed in the Featured Products page.

### Monochrome 128x32 SPI OLED graphic display

[Monochrome 128x32 SPI OLED graphic display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/661)
These displays are small, only about 1" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This display is made of 128x32 individual white OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is...

[3 x AAA Battery Holder with On/Off Switch and 2-Pin JST](https://www.adafruit.com/product/727)
This battery holder connects 3 AAA batteries together in series for powering all kinds of projects. We spec'd these out because the box is slim, and 3 AAA's add up to about 3.3-4.5V, a very similar range to Lithium Ion/polymer (Li-Ion) batteries and have an on-off switch. That makes...
