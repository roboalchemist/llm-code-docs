# How to Make a Pogo Pin Test Jig

## Testing

Now the fun part! When a board is ready to test, insert a uSD card, and simply slip it into the orienting 'registration' standoffs and press down to make contact with the pogo pins. The Arduino will automatically detect when the CD pin is shorted to ground (good) and begin the test procedure. If all is good, it will beep!![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/002/530/medium800/manufacturing_placed.jpeg?1396784114)
