# Drive a 16x2 LCD with the Raspberry Pi

## Python Script

![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/754/medium800/raspberry_pi_timeip.jpg?1396776056)

The following&nbsp; code can be downloaded to your raspberry pi and run to get the date, time and IP address of your machine on the LCD display.

# The Code
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/Drive_a_16x2_LCD_with_the_Raspberry_Pi/Drive_a_16x2_LCD_with_the_Raspberry_Pi.py

## Download the Code
Let's put this file right in your home directory for simplicity. The wget command makes things easy.

```auto
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/master/Drive_a_16x2_LCD_with_the_Raspberry_Pi/Drive_a_16x2_LCD_with_the_Raspberry_Pi.py
```

# Running the Code
The following command will start the program and you should see the LCD display come to life with date, time and IP address.

```auto
sudo python3 ./Drive_a_16x2_LCD_with_the_Raspberry_Pi.py
```
