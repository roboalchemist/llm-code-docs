# Adafruit Raspberry Pi Educational Linux Distro

## Overview

Its been a few years since we released Occidentalis. At the time, the standard Raspbian distribution was still very young and we found a lot of ways to add more hardware support.

However, nowadays the now named [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) is quite mature as software goes and has integrated a lot of the modifications!

[So, instead of trying to keep up with continuous Raspbian releases, we created a Pi Bootstrapper, a program that you can run on your computer (or Pi) which will install a lot of our favorite tools and support for you! Check it out here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Pi-Finder#adafruit-raspberry-pi-finder)
