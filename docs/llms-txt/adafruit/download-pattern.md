[Download the free PDF](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/adafruit-sash.pdf) pattern for this sash and print it out (it's 3 pages- one size fits most kids). It's printed with a bit of overlap on each piece so that you can easily tile the pieces together into one sheet.![](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/001/666/medium800/braincrafts_skill-badge-sash-02.jpg?1396774896)

Cut off the margin on one overlapping piece of the pattern.
