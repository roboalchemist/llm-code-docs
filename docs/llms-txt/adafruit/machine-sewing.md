## Machine sewing

You can use our 2 ply conductive thread in the bobbin of a sewing machine. Thread the machine's needle with plain thread.

Use a water-disolvable marker to plan out your circuit traces.

You may need to adjust the tension on your machine. Experiment on a scrap piece of fabric and examine the balance between the conductive and regular thread. Adjust the tension and experiment again until you are satisfied.

Machine stitch your circuit.

Leave long tails of conductive thread at the ends of your stitching lines in case you need to pick them up with a hand sewing needle and connect to other components.

Spritz away the markings with water. Be sure to let the fabric completely dry before powering up your circuit.

### Stainless Thin Conductive Yarn / Thick Conductive Thread - 30 ft

[Stainless Thin Conductive Yarn / Thick Conductive Thread - 30 ft](https://www.adafruit.com/product/603)
This 316L stainless steel thread falls somewhere between a thick thread and a thin yarn. Most sewing machines wouldn't be happy with this thread since its thick, and it has the 'furry' soft feel of yarn which makes it poor for most e-textiles/wearables projects. However, the high...
