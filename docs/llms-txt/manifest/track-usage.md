# Track usage

> Understand what data Manifest tracks and how costs are calculated

## Overview dashboard

The dashboard shows:

* **Total messages** — number of LLM calls.
* **Total tokens** — input, output, and cache read tokens.
* **Total cost** — calculated from model pricing and token counts.
* **Messages over time** — chart of LLM calls by period.
* **Cost over time** — chart of spend by period.
* **Model distribution** — breakdown of which models handled requests.

## Metrics captured

| Metric                | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Messages**          | Number of LLM calls                      |
| **Input tokens**      | Prompt tokens sent                       |
| **Output tokens**     | Completion tokens received               |
| **Cache read tokens** | Tokens served from cache                 |
| **Cost (USD)**        | Calculated from model pricing × tokens   |
| **Duration (ms)**     | Round-trip latency                       |
| **Model**             | Which LLM handled the request            |
| **Routing tier**      | simple / standard / complex / reasoning  |
| **Agent name**        | The OpenClaw agent that sent the request |

## How cost is calculated

Manifest maintains a pricing table for 40+ models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and more).

```
Cost = input_tokens × input_price + output_tokens × output_price
```

Pricing is refreshed automatically in the background. In local mode, pricing syncs from OpenRouter.

## Message log

Every LLM call is recorded with full metadata. The message log provides:

* Paginated list of all requests.
* Filters by agent, model, and time range.
