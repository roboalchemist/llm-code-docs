# The Threshold Trials

## The Threshold Trials

In line with the above test, some brands have have moved towards free shipping over a certain threshold to keep customers from finding another seller that does offer free shipping, as well as to increase AOV. If you're not already doing this, you could test a few different thresholds out, and if you do already have a threshold, you could test a higher and lower threshold (or a couple higher/lower) to try to find the sweet spot. Check out this [case study](https://blog.intelligems.io/intelli-blog/boost-aov-by-upping-your-free-shipping-threshold) on a brand who recently ran this type of test and found a \~6% increase in AOV and \~12% increase in revenue per site visitor!

*What this test design might look like:*

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="162"></th><th></th><th></th><th width="243"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Control Group</strong></td><td><strong>Lower Threshold</strong></td><td><strong>Higher Threshold</strong></td><td><strong>Highest Threshold</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Threshold</strong></td><td>$75</td><td>$50</td><td>$100</td><td>$125</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend taking a look at a histogram of your order values for the last month (or more) when deciding what thresholds to test. For example, if a majority of your orders come in around $90-$100, but your current threshold is $50, you may want to consider testing out a $100 threshold to push people to add one more item to their cart.
