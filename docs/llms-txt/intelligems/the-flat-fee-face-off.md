# The Flat Fee Face Off

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="310"></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Control Group</strong></td><td><strong>Slightly Higher</strong></td><td><strong>Highest</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Flat Shipping Rate</strong></td><td>Free</td><td>$5</td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
