# Performance P\&L

### **Overview**

The **Performance P\&L** is a unified store-level performance dashboard with the following features:

* Recent Performance Snapshot: View recent performance snapshots and all data observed since installation.
  * Compare PPV, RPV, CVR, AOV, and Gross Margin and more.
* Historic Performance Over Time: Trend metrics over time with weekly or monthly grouping.
* Profit and Loss Details: View full P\&L in table form with profit and revenue breakdowns.
* Filter capabilities: Filter by device, visitor type, channel, z-score, country, and landing page.

#### Filter Details

* **Matched to Session:** Orders where checkout journey was directly observed via Intelligems script.
* **All Orders:** Includes POS, subscriptions, and non-web orders. Orders that didn’t reach checkout in any way.

By default, our views are filtered to Orders Matched to Session in order to enable visitor-based metrics as well as visitor-based filters

The remaining filters are consistent in definition and operation with [filters in Experiment Analytics](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/experiment-analytics/filters)
