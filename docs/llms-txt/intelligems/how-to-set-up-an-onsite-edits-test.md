## **Step 1: Create a new test**

Navigate to the "A/B Tests" tab in the menu on the left-hand side of the Intelligems app. Once you're there, click 'Create New Test' above the experiments table. Give it a name, and a specific description of what you're testing. Select "Content Test", then "Onsite Edits", then "Create Test".

## **Step 2: Create your test groups**

Create a test group for each variation you want to include in the test. Fill in the Test Name and Test Description for the experiment you are creating. This information is all internal - the more detail you include here the better! Tests can be live for several weeks, and your future self will thank you for including the details here.

You can add new groups to include in the test by clicking on the ‘+’ button. Name the groups for the experiment and use the slider to allocate what percentage of traffic will go to each group. Click ‘Continue’ when you are done.

## **Step 3: Set up targeting if needed**

Targeting is an optional step. By default, a visitor will be immediately assigned to one of the test groups using its random split-test mechanism. This assignment is determined at the first visit and is stored via a first‐party cookie, ensuring that the visitor remains in the same group on subsequent visits during the edits test period. Onsite Edits are made at the selector level; these same selectors can and do appear on many pages throughout the site.

The targeting tool allows you to apply specific conditions to certain site visitors. There are a few different ways you can do this:

* You can set up currency and country targeting that allows you to limit your test to a single currency and/or a list of specific countries. This feature is defaulted to your store currency for price test.
* You can use UTM parameters to customize your user experience under the Audience option.
* You can filter traffic based on JavaScript Expressions under the Audience option.
* You can filter traffic based on device type (i.e. mobile or desktop) under the Audience option.
* You can filter traffic based off of whether a visitor is new or returning under the Audience option.
* You can prevent users from being targeted by related experiments to reduce undesired interactions under the Mutually Exclusive Tests option.

You can learn more about targeting [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/content-testing/targeting)!

## Step 4: Select "Add & Edit changes in Visual Editor"

Selecting this will save your test and take you to your website with our widget open and edit mode enabled. From here, you can set up any Onsite Edits you would like. See each of the guides below for more information on setting up different types of onsite edits.

* [Image Onsite Editor](https://docs.intelligems.io/general-features/image-onsite-editor)
* [CSS & JavaScript Injection](https://docs.intelligems.io/general-features/css-and-javascript-injection)

## Step 5: Set Your Test Goals

Finally, select whether analytics should by default consider only orders containing certain products you want to test (for example something related to a particular PDP), or orders containing any products in your shop.\
\
You can always change this later after the test has started by changing the option in your Analytics filters.
