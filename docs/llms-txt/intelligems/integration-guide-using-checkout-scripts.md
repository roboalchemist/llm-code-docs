# Integration Guide using Checkout Scripts

Before you can run a Price Test on your Shopify store, there is a small integration that needs to be done. There are five components to the integration:

1. Add Intelligems JavaScript
2. Tag product prices
3. Add the Checkout Script
4. Update your cart
5. QA your integration, and publish your changes

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you have chosen to have Intelligems complete the integration, many of these steps will be done on your behalf.
{% endhint %}
