# How to Set Up Brand Promise Badge Icons at Checkout

## Brand Promises Badge Icons Block

Launching a Brand Promises Badge Block is one of the most effective ways to build trust and confidence at checkout. It highlights your brand’s key value propositions like Free Shipping, Free Returns, and a Lifetime Warranty at the exact moment a shopper is deciding to buy.

### Who is this for

This Personalization is designed for **all visitors** — it should display for 100% of checkout traffic.\
Every shopper benefits from seeing your core brand promises and trust signals, regardless of audience segment or channel.

### What this Personalization does

This experience adds a block to your Shopify checkout page. Each badge features an icon, title, and subtitle, allowing you to communicate up to six key brand promises in a clean, visual layout.

This example includes:

* **Free Shipping** – Fast, reliable delivery
* **Free Returns** – 30-day return policy
* **Lifetime Warranty** – Quality guaranteed

### When to use it

Create a Checkout Personalization with your unique brand promises when you want to:

* Reinforce trust and brand credibility at checkout
* Ease buyer hesitation and reduce abandonment
* Communicate your policies clearly at the point of purchase
* Replace or supplement third-party “trust badge” apps with a native Intelligems solution\\

**Pro Tip:** A Checkout Personalization can include multiple blocks. Combine a trust badge above your payment section with a social proof header or image block for maximum impact.

### Why it matters
