# Offers Limits

## Understanding the Offer Limit for Experiences and Offer Tests

To ensure smooth performance and prevent conflicts with other third-party discount apps (such as those integrated via Shopify), our platform enforces an **offer limit** on the number of *active* offers you can run at any given time. This includes Offers related to both **Experiences** and **Offer Tests**.

### What is the Offer Limit?

The **default offer limit** is **15 offers**. However, depending on your specific setup, the limit has the potential to be increased. This limit is configurable and can be adjusted based on the needs of your organization.

### What Counts Towards the Offer Limit?

Offers that count towards this limit include those in the following states:

* **Pending**: Created but not live.
* **Started**: Currently live and running.
* **Paused**: Temporarily stopped but still available for preview.

### Archiving Offers

Once you reach the offer limit, you won’t be able to create or enable new offers until space is made. This is where archiving comes into play:

1. **Archiving an Experience** allows you to free up space without having to delete an offer entirely.
2. **Archived Experiences**:
   * Are labeled as archived in the Experiences page.
   * Can be **un-archived** as long as you’re within your offer limit.

**Note**: You **cannot archive** an active (live) offer without first confirming that you want to end it.

#### How Do I Archive an Experience?

To archive an Experience, navigate to the Experiences page. Locate the card for the Experience you'd like to archive, then click the three dots on the right-hand side of the card to access more options and select the archive option.

Alternatively, you can also archive an Experience from its detail page. Once inside an Experience, the archive option can be found by clicking the three dots in the same spot on the top header.

What Should I Do if I Hit the Limit?

If you receive the “Offer Limit Reached” message, you have the following options:

* **Archive or delete** one of your existing offers to free up space.
* If your **Offer Test** contains multiple offers, you can end or delete offers within the test to reduce the total count.
