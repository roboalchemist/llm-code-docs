# Offers Limits

## Understanding the Offer Limit for Personalizations and Offer Tests

To ensure smooth performance and prevent conflicts with other third-party discount apps (such as those integrated via Shopify), our platform enforces an **offer limit** on the number of *active* offers you can run at any given time. This includes Offers related to both **Personalizations** and **Offer Tests**.

### What is the Offer Limit?

The **default offer limit** is **15 offers**. However, depending on your specific setup, the limit has the potential to be increased. This limit is configurable and can be adjusted based on the needs of your organization.

### What Counts Towards the Offer Limit?

Offers that count towards this limit include those in the following states:

* **Pending**: Created but not live.
* **Started**: Currently live and running.
* **Paused**: Temporarily stopped but still available for preview.

### Archiving Offers

Once you reach the offer limit, you won’t be able to create or enable new offers until space is made. This is where archiving comes into play:

1. **Archiving a Personalization** allows you to free up space without having to delete an offer entirely.
2. **Archived Personalizations**:
   * Are labeled as archived in the Personalizations page.
   * Can be **un-archived** as long as you’re within your offer limit.

**Note**: You **cannot archive** an active (live) offer without first confirming that you want to end it.

#### How Do I Archive a Personalization?

To archive a Personalization, navigate to the Personalizations page. Locate the card for the Personalization you'd like to archive, then click the three dots on the right-hand side of the card to access more options and select the archive option.

Alternatively, you can also archive a Personalization from its detail page. Once inside an Personalization, the archive option can be found by clicking the three dots in the same spot on the top header.

What Should I Do if I Hit the Limit?

If you receive the “Offer Limit Reached” message, you have the following options:

* **Archive or delete** one of your existing offers to free up space.
* If your **Offer Test** contains multiple offers, you can end or delete offers within the test to reduce the total count.
