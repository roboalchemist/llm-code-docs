# How to Set Up Seasonal Clearance Discount

## Seasonal Clearance Extra 20% off Sale Collection

You can use **Offers** to power your end-of-season clearance sales. This is ideal when you need to move through remaining inventory quickly, whether that’s last sizes, discontinued SKUs, or seasonal products. With Intelligems, you can easily set up an **extra discount** on your Sale Collection, layer on tiered discounts, and pair it with urgency messaging to drive faster sell-through.
