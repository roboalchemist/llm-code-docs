# Testing Different Imagery

Testing homepage banners or product page images is essential for brands aiming to optimize their online presence and drive conversions. The images used on these pages play a significant role in capturing users' attention, conveying brand messaging, and influencing purchasing decisions. By conducting tests, brands can assess various elements such as image composition, color schemes, product placement, and messaging to identify which resonates most effectively with their target audience.
