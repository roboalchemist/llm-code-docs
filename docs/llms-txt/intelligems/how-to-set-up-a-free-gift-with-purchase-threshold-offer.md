# How to Set Up a Free Gift With Purchase Threshold Offer

## Free Gift with Purchase Offer

You can use **Offers** to reward shoppers with a free gift once they cross a certain spend threshold. This is a powerful way to increase average order value (AOV), move inventory, and delight customers—without relying on deep discounting.

Offer Personalizations are available on Core, Plus, and Blue Plans. Testing your Offers against each other is only available on Plus and Blue.

**Example:** Free gift on orders over $150, Free gift for an influencer audience, Free gift to VIPs\
\
**Goal:** Increase AOV with margin protection\
\
**Who:** All shoppers or targeted audience\
\
**What:** Free gift with purchase (low-cost, high-perceived value)

**When:** Evergreen or seasonal

**Offer Type:** Threshold-based free gift\
\
**Amount:** Gift with \~$8 COGS has a perceived value of $30–40

#### Experience

* Timing: Evergreen or seasonal
* Where:
  * PDP
  * Cart
  * Checkout
  * Emails
* Display: Progress bar or unlock message
* Activation: Automatic when the threshold is hit

**Why it works:** Free gifts feel like a bonus to shoppers. Even if the cost is low for you (and often less than a discount), the perceived value is high. This motivates customers to add more to their cart while protecting your margins.
