# Getting Started with Personalizations

{% embed url="<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVfyqao3XRg>" %}

## What are Personalizations?

A Personalization shows one or more site modifications to all visitors or a targeted audience, temporarily or permanently.

With a broad range of Modifications including URL redirects, text changes, offers and price changes, layout changes, javascript injections, Global Style components like progress bar, quantity buttons, slideouts, and more, a Personalization can be used to completely overhaul your site or simply fine tune text and layouts.

**How do Personalizations relate to Experiences?** Experiences have been renamed to Personalizations. Nothing else changed.&#x20;

## What can you achieve with Personalizations?

While Intelligems’ testing tools allow you to pit experiences against each other to find which ones produce the best results, Personalizations allow you to act on those findings and show the right experience to the right shop visitors quickly, all without writing code.

With Personalizations you can:

* **Deploy, test, and target offers:** Offer codeless promotions, volume discounts, and free gifts, displaying popups, progress bars, quantity buttons, and other components. For example, you can offer a discount and modified copy to all returning visitors. To make informed decisions, you can also test offers against each other to determine which ones work best for a target audience before deploying them.
* **Quickly ship codeless edits**: Immediately go live with changes without Shopify limitations or developer delays. For example, you could deploy a warning about delayed international shipping to everyone outside your country.
* **Maintain consistency from ads to Landing Pages:** Send visitors to unique landing pages with personalized content and offers. For example, you can show a banner at the top of your PDP only to visitors arriving from an Instagram campaign by redirecting them to a different page, or swapping your Shopify page layout depending on the audience. You can do all of this without having to manage multiple links.
* **Personalize product discovery:** Boost conversions by showing different collections for certain customers. For example, redirect athletes to a version of your home page that highlights sports-related products in your main collection.
* **Overhaul your site’s look and feel:** Show a completely different Shopify theme with altered navigation for users in a different country.
* **Lower your prices:** Show lower prices for one or more products during a special event or when overstocked.
* **Take action on your test results:** Quickly roll out winning variants to all visitors or specific customer segments.

## How do you make and use a Personalization?

Before using Personalizations and most other Intelligems features, you'll need to add the Intelligems script to your theme; [here is our help guide](https://docs.intelligems.io/getting-started/adding-intelligems-script-to-your-theme). Once you've done that:

* **Step 1 - Initialize:** There are three ways to create a Personalization.
  * Option 1: Go to the Personalizations > Site Content > Select which type of Content change(s) you want to create
  * Option 2: Go to Personalizations > Offers > Select which type of Offer(s) you want to create
  * Option 3: Go to one of your tests and use the “Roll out” button to Roll a winning test group into a Personalization. This will carry out many of the steps below automatically, saving you time.
* **Step 2 - Modifications:** Add one or more modifications based on your goal, whether it’s a simple text change, adding a component like progress bar, quantity button, or slideout, or as complicated as a rebrand with interactive javascript elements. Click [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/personalizations/personalization-modifications) to read more about Modifications.
* **Step 3 - Targeting:** Decide who should see the Personalization, if not all visitors to your site. Intelligems allows you to limit visitors to those that match robust rules, those coming in via a special link, and those shopping in a certain currency. You can also limit which site pages the modifications should appear on, if not all. Click [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/personalizations/targeting-personalizations) to read more about Targeting.
* **Step 4 - Preview:** Make sure everything looks and works as you’d expect before activating it. Click [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/personalizations/previewing-personalizations) to read more about Previewing.
* **Step 5 - Activate it:** Once you’re ready, activate it. You can pause and resume as many times as you need, which is useful for recurring promotions.

You can also:

* **Track Stats:** Check how many visitors saw each Personalization and which ones delivered the most orders and revenue.
* **Update:** Edit a Personalization at any time to change its modifications, targeting, and more.
* **Combine:** Stack Personalizations, allowing a visitor to be presented with more than one Personalization at the same time. For example, a visitor can be exposed to a “New visitors discount” Personalization while also seeing the homepage layout tweaks of the “Mobile users Optimization” Personalization.
* **Duplicate:** When creating multiple similar Personalizations, you can save time by duplicating an existing one and editing it rather than starting from scratch. This is also a handy way to preview changes you want to make to an active Personalization without needing to turn it off.
* **Launch Offers:** One type of modification within a Personalization is an "Offer". An example of this may be a discount or free gift with purchase. Intelligems allows you to launch Offers as a Personalization, outside of a test.
* **Launch Checkout Blocks:** With Checkout, you can launch content blocks on your Checkout page for Shopify Plus customers. Trust badges, social proof, shipping messages, product upsell, you name it. More blocks coming soon.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pricing:** You can create and test Site Content and Offer Personalizations on Core, Plus, and Blue plans. To create and test Checkout Personalizations, you need to be on Core, Plus, or Blue plans *and* on a Shopify Plus plan. &#x20;
