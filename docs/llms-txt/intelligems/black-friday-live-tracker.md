# Black Friday Live Tracker

The Intelligems BFCM Tracker gives brands a real time performance view for Q4. It shows revenue, orders, and price levels at the hourly level and benchmarks performance against last year, a typical-day baseline, and the Intelligems Index.

### Holiday Index details

* **Index:** Our Holiday Index is comprised of more than 1,000+ brands and represents more than $20B in annual GMV. We normalize each brand's performance relative to a 'typical-day' performance. We then average normalized performance relative to typical day to produce our index measurements
* **Typical-Day performance:** We use average performance from October 1 to October 14, 2025 to establish a typical-day baseline
* **2025 vs. 2024 comparisons:** In our charts, we match based on same day relative to holiday, with Black Friday last year (November 29, 2024) matched to Black Friday of this year (November 28, 2025)
  * E.g. Monday November 18, 2024 is matched to Monday, November 17, 2025

### **Key Metrics**

1. **Revenue -** "How am I pacing vs. last year?"
   * Hourly: Shows total revenue for the day with a comparison to the same hour last year
   * Q4: Shows total revenue Q4-to-date compared to equivalent dates last year
2. **Revenue (as % of Typical Full Day) -** "How am I pacing vs. a typical day"
   * Hourly: Shows total revenue for the day thus far, divided by revenue for a typical day
     * If you hit a value of 120% by 1 pm, it means you have already exceeded a full normal day of revenue.
   * Q4: Shows average Q4 daily revenue relative to a typical day
     * A value of 120% means that an average Q4 day is +20% above a typical day
3. **Index (as % of Typical Full Day) - "**"How is the industry pacing vs. a typical day"
   * Hourly: Shows how total revenue for the day divided by a typical day for our index
     * Note - we do some normalization and adjustments, but easiest to explain as an ‘average’
   * Q4: Shows average Q4 daily revenue relative to a typical day for our index

### **Common comparisons**

To assess Black Friday and Cyber Monday performance, there are a few comparisons that you can do:

1. **Your performance vs. last year -** compare whether you are outperforming last year
2. **Your performance vs. your typical day -** compare the lift you are able to achieve relative to an ordinary day and whether those achieve expected targets
3. **Your % lift vs. Index % lift -** compare whether you generated more lift than observed by the index as a whole
4. **Index vs. last year** - compare whether the market appeared to have larger or smaller than typical levels of lift over the holiday period
