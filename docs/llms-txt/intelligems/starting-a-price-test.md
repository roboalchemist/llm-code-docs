# Starting a Price Test

## **Step 1: Confirm Intelligems script is in your live theme**

In addition to Intelligems Javascript, confirm any other theme changes completed during the integration are in your live theme as well. **If not**, please publish the script and any changes before proceeding.

## **Step 2: Press the Start Button**

In the Intelligems app, navigate to the A/B Tests tab and click the play button next to the pricing test you are wanting to start.

## **Step 3: confirmed you've done the integration and also QA'd your test**

At this point, we display two checkboxes so you can confirm you've done the [Price Test Integration](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/price-testing-integration-guides), and that you've also [QA'd your test](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/price-test-qa-checklist). If you've done both, check both checkboxes, and click 'Confirm'.

## **Step 4: Click "Yes, Update My Prices and Start Test"**

**If C*****heckout Scripts*****&#x20;or&#x20;*****Functions*****&#x20;are being used to run your test,** after you click `Start`, you'll see a pop-up asking if you want the Intelligems Wizard to update your Shopify prices. Please select 'Yes, Update My Prices and Start Test' in the pop-up. This will allow Intelligems to automatically update your product prices to the highest price in the test for each product, which is necessary for your test to run correctly.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While there are certain scenarios where prices do not need to be updated, we do not recommend selecting "No, I'll Update My Prices" unless you 100% know what you're doing!
{% endhint %}

**If&#x20;*****Duplicate Products*** **were used to create the test,** this pop up will not come up. Instead, you'll see a modal displaying your duplicate products, and the option to start the test. Duplicate products were created when you set your test up for each price group. As long as you followed [these steps](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/price-testing-integration-guides/integration-guide-using-duplicate-products/step-4-configure-duplicate-products)[ ](https://docs.intelligems.io/getting-started/price-testing-integration-guides/integration-guide-using-duplicate-products/step-4-configure-duplicate-products)to configure your duplicate products, your test is ready to go, so you can click on 'Start Test'.

## **Step 4: Check Your Site**

Now that the test is live, we recommend going through the add to cart and checkout process in a few incognito browsers so you can get added to different test groups and ensure everything is working as expected. If you have not already QA'd your test before launching it, we recommend going through [this checklist](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/price-test-qa-checklist). Please [reach out to our support team](https://portal.usepylon.com/intelligems/forms/intelligems-support-request) with any issues!
