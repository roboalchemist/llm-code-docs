# Welcome to Intelligems

## **What is Intelligems?**

Intelligems is the ultimate profit optimization tool. We provide data-driven solutions and help maximize profits for Shopify merchants wanting to optimize their content, prices, discounts, and shipping rates.

Our mission is simple: we want to help e-commerce entrepreneurs improve their businesses and make more money, by helping you use data to manage your websites and profitability more effectively. We aim to provide independent e-commerce stores access to the same revenue optimization tools that power the growth and profitability of companies like Amazon and Uber.

## **Why Intelligems?**

Our founders and several team members met at Via Transportation, a ridesharing company based in NYC. Over the course of five years, we gradually built out the tools, data, algorithms, and systems to compete with the rapidly evolving rideshare market.

The most powerful tool we built was a dynamic pricing engine underpinned by robust A/B testing. Any question or hypothesis we had, we could simply run a test to get the (statistically significant) answer.

Now, as Intelligems, we are bringing our learning, mindset, and toolkit to e-commerce operators, especially Shopify store owners.

## **What can we test with Intelligems?**

Intelligems let’s you test just about anything on your Shopify store. See below for more details on the four different categories of tests Intelligems can help you run. If you don’t see what you’re looking for in one of those options, or aren’t sure of the best way to set up a specific test you have in mind, reach out to our support team [here](https://portal.usepylon.com/intelligems/forms/intelligems-support-request).

### Pricing

Intelligems takes the guesswork out of setting your product prices by allowing you to A/B test prices in real time in order to find the “right” product prices to drive profit, revenue, and conversion boosts.

### Shipping

Testing your shipping rates and thresholds with Intelligems allows you to find rates that work for you and your customers. The right shipping profile can allow you to boost profits, maximize conversion without sacrificing on margin, or boost AOV.

### Content

Intelligems can run A/B tests for website imagery and copy, landing pages, Shopify themes or templates, UX, and more. With Google Optimize recently sunsetting, now is the right time to transition.
