# How to Set Up a Single Image Influencer Endorsement at Checkout

## Social Proof Image

Adding an **Influencer Endorsement Image Block** at checkout is a great way to build instant trust and credibility. It lets you showcase a celebrity, creator, or partner endorsement right at the moment a shopper is completing their purchase, turning familiarity and social proof into conversion.

### Who is this for

This experience is designed for **all visitors** — it should display for **100% of checkout traffic.**\
Every shopper benefits from seeing recognizable social proof or influencer credibility, especially those unfamiliar with your brand.

### What this Personalization does

This experience adds a single image to your Shopify checkout page.\
The block features a bold, single-line endorsement from the influencer to help build trust.

This example includes:

* **Influencer image**
* **Influencer quote**

You can position the image anywhere within the checkout, most often near the order total or payment section for maximum visibility.

### When to use it

Use the Influencer Endorsement Image Block when you want to:

* Build credibility and trust with a familiar face
* Reinforce social proof from press, creators, or partnerships
* Showcase your brand’s influence and recognition
* Convert brand awareness into purchase confidence

**Pro Tip:** A Checkout Personalization can include multiple blocks. Combine a trust badge above your payment section with a social proof header or image block for maximum impact.

### Why it matters

Social proof is one of the strongest drivers of purchase confidence. Featuring recognizable endorsements or public praise where customers finalize their orders helps remove last-minute doubts and builds deeper trust in your brand.
