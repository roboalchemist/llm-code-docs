# Overview

Intelligems features a sophisticated analytics engine that can measure a wide variety of metrics on your Shopify store with zero setup. Data is available in near real-time — there will generally be a \~30-60s lag between activity on your site and metrics updating in the Intelligems dashboard.

## Types of Analytics

Our analytics engine spans three different offerings:

* **Experiment Analytics** - Measures the outcome of a specific test or experiment and see which variations drove the best results.
* **Experience Analytics** - Monitors the performance of a given experience, whether its a content change or offer
* **Sitewide Analytics -** Provides a profit-first view of your store's overall performance with deep dives to uncover underlying performance drivers and identify new opportunities

## Sources

Intelligems uses data from a variety of sources to arrive at a clear picture of performance, including:

* Shopify client-side web pixels
* Shopify server-to-server webhooks
* Intelligems’ own client-side tracking
