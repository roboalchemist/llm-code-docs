# Testing Cart Elements

The cart is a pivotal point in the customer journey. A/B testing components of your cart ensures that the user experience is seamless, intuitive, and efficient. By understanding how customers interact with the cart, stores can identify pain points, such as confusing navigation or lack of features, and optimize accordingly.

When it comes to your site’s cart, there are endless elements you could test. Below are just a few of the things that brands often test:

* Displaying the option for a customer to enter a discount code in the cart
* Testing a third-party cart app vs. your Shopify cart
* A different call to action on your checkout button
* Displaying a [free shipping progress bar](https://docs.intelligems.io/shipping-testing/shipping-progress-bar-integration) to incentivize users to spend more

The best way to set these tests up in Intelligems depends on a few factors, including what exactly you are looking to test, how your cart is set up on your site, and your team’s technical aptitude. See below for a few examples:

* If you are looking to test a relatively small and non-complicated portion of your cart, you may be able to set your test up using Intelligems’ [Find & Replace tool](https://docs.intelligems.io/content-testing/find-and-replace)!
  * Test the call-to-action text in the checkout button
  * Show vs. hide components like a progress bar or discount code input field
  * Show vs. hide upsells in the cart
* If you are planning to test something more complicated, if the cart can be controlled using JavaScript, you can use Intelligems’ [JavaScript injection tool](https://docs.intelligems.io/content-testing/css-and-javascript-injection) to test this. If the cart cannot be controlled using JavaScript, or writing JavaScript is not in you team’s capabilities, you could also run it as a [Theme Test](https://docs.intelligems.io/content-testing/content-testing-getting-started/how-to-set-up-a-theme-test).
