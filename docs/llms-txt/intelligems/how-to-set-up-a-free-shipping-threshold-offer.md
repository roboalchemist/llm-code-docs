# How to Set Up a Free Shipping Threshold Offer

## Free Shipping Threshold Offer

You can use **Offers** to power Free Shipping promotions. This type of offer reduces friction for customers, increases conversion, and incentivizes higher spend when paired with a threshold.

{% hint style="info" %}
Offer Experiences are available on Core, Plus, and Blue Plans. Testing your Offers against each other is only available on Plus and Blue.
{% endhint %}

**Examples:** Free standard shipping at $75+, Free expedited shipping at $150+

**Goal:** Conversion optimization + AOV increase

**Who:** Universal shoppers

**What:** Free shipping when spend threshold is met

**When:** Evergreen or seasonal

**Offer Type:** Free Shipping Threshold

**Amount:** $75 spend (adjustable to your margins and shipping costs)

**Offer Experience**

* Timing: Evergreen or time-limited campaign
* Where:
  * Cart and checkout
  * Homepage banners
  * PDP shipping callouts
  * Emails
* Display: Progress bar or unlock message, shipping banners
* Activation: Automatic when spend threshold is met

**Why it works:** Free shipping reduces cart abandonment, meets customer expectations, and encourages larger baskets to unlock the perk.
