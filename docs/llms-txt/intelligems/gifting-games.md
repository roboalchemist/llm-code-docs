# Gifting Games

Offers allow you to serve specific discounts and offers to your site visitors using. One of these types of Offers is a Gift With Purchase. While you can have such an Experience on all the time, Intelligems can also help you test which thresholds and gifts drive the most value.

You can do this by setting up an [Offer Test](https://docs.intelligems.io/offer-personalizations/testing-offer-personalizations).

*What these test designs might look like:*

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="197"></th><th width="281"></th><th width="331"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Control Group</strong></td><td><strong>New Group</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Test - On vs. Off</strong></td><td>No Gift With Purchase</td><td>Gift Provided at $100 Threshold</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Second Test - $100 Threshold vs. $150 Threshold</strong></td><td>Gift Provided at $100 Threshold</td><td>Gift Provided at $150 Threshold</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Third Test - Gift A vs. Gift B</strong></td><td>Gift A Provided at $100 Threshold</td><td>Gift B Provided at $100 Threshold</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend taking a look at a histogram of your order values for the last month (or more) when deciding what threshold to provide a Gift With Purchase at, especially if this will be a new addition to the site. For example, if a majority of your orders come in around $100, you may not want to provide a gift for orders over $100, but rather start around $150.
