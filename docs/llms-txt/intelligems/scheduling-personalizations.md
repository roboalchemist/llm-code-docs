# Scheduling Experiences

## **Scheduling Experiences Overview**

The **Scheduling Experiences** feature allows you to control *when* specific modifications will appear on your site by setting start and end times. This makes it easy to automate updates, ensuring that changes go live exactly when you want and stop at the right time. Whether it’s a promotional banner for a flash sale or a seasonal announcement, scheduling makes it easy to automate time-sensitive personalizations without having to manually turn them on and off.

## **Why Would I Need to Use Scheduling for Experiences?**

Scheduling is essential for making sure your Experiences are displayed at the right moment without requiring constant oversight. This feature allows you to time your modifications to align with key business events and user behavior patterns. For example:

* **Launching Timed Promotions:** Automatically show a discount banner during a flash sale.
* **Managing Seasonal Campaigns:** Set up a special message for a holiday campaign, so it starts and stops exactly as needed.
* **Future Planning:** Schedule Experiences to launch new content or variations at a future date, so you can "set it and forget it."

## **How to Set Up a Schedule**

You can choose to set a schedule **when creating a new Experience** or add a schedule to **an existing Experience**.

1. **Where to Find Scheduling:**

   * **Scheduling for New Experience:** After you save your Experience, go to the header and select the **down arrow** next to **Activate**. From the dropdown menu, select **Schedule**. This will open the schedule dialogue where you can define the start and end times for your Experience.

   * **Scheduling for Existing Experiences:** In your personalizations list, click the **three-dot menu** on the right of a personalization and select **Schedule Experience**.

2. **Set Up Timing:**

   * **Start Date & Time**: Set the exact date and time when your Experience should begin displaying (e.g., October 15th at 8:00 AM).

   * **End Date & Time (Optional)**: If your Experience should only run for a limited period, set an end date and time. Leaving this field blank means the Experience will run indefinitely until you manually stop it.

3. **Review and Confirm:**

   * Use the **Preview** feature to check that the Experience appears as expected.

## **Example Use Cases**

* **Time-Limited Offers:** Show a banner for a single-day event (e.g., “24-Hour Flash Sale”).
* **Seasonal Promotions:** Set a start date for a holiday campaign and let it run indefinitely until you want to turn it off manually.
* **Ongoing Variations:** Use scheduling to launch new variants for long-term testing without setting an expiration date.
