# Data Sharing

If you’d like to receive more granular data for your experiments, including information on every visitor session, or if you’d like data delivered directly to your data warehouse or data lake instead of using manual exports, you can use Intelligems Data Sharing. Intelligems can automatically sync data to most popular data platforms, including Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, and more.

This requires an add-on to your Intelligems plan. Please reach out to us for more information [here](https://portal.usepylon.com/intelligems/forms/intelligems-support-request).
