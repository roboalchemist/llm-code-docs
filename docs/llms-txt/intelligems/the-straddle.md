# The Straddle

Increase and decrease the price of every product by 10%. This is a great place to start as it will give you a look at elasticity across the board. If you don't want to start with your entire store, pick a few products or a collection to test first and iterate from there. Check out this [case study](https://blog.intelligems.io/intelli-blog/drive-conversions-revenue-through-price-decreases) on a brand who recently ran this type of test on their main collection and found that the lower price group generated nearly a 40% lift in conversion rate which yielded a 15% increase in revenue.

*What this test design might look like:*

|               | **Control Price** | **+10%** | **-10%** |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Product A** | $10               | $11      | $9       |
| **Product B** | $20               | $22      | $18      |

{% hint style="info" %}
The Control Group should almost always be equal to what is currently live on the site - keeping one group consistent will keep your baseline consistent, giving you the most actionable results.
