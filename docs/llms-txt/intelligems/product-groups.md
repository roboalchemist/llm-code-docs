# Product Groups

By default, other tabs in the analytics dashboard will display for all products. For certain tests, it may be beneficial to look at the results for certain product groups, or even get as granular as looking at the results for individual products. To do this, you can use the Product Groups tab. First, you must follow [these steps](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/how-to-add-product-groups-to-intelligems-analytics) to set up Product Groups. Product groups can be added anytime before, during or after a test.

Once you have uploaded product groups, within the Product Groups tab, you will find:

#### Product Group Mix

This chart shows your top product groups by revenue or units sold (depending on what you have selected in the top right of the chart). All remaining product groups are combined into the All Others group.

#### Product Group Detail

Key revenue and profit metrics for each Product Group.
