# Checkout Personalizations Library

We built Checkout Personalizations to be the best checkout tool to power content right on your Checkout page to improve conversion, AOV, and profit per visitor, right inside of Intelligems.

## How to Think About Checkout Personalizations

Every great checkout experience comes down to three simple questions: **Where, Who, and What.**\
Together, these three pieces form the backbone of your checkout strategy, shaping how you communicate trust, urgency, and brand values at the final step of the journey.

### Where does it appear?

The location of your block is one of the biggest levers for conversion impact.

* **Above the Order Summary**: Build trust right before customers review their cart totals.
* **Below the Order Total**: Reinforce key benefits before payment (for example, free returns or warranty).
* **Above the Payment Section**: Encourage final commitment with social proof or guarantees.
* **Bottom of Checkout**: Use closing reassurance like “Secure payment processing” or “Ships in 24 hours.”

Each position changes the customer’s perception, from confidence before commitment to relief after reassurance.

### Who should see it?

Checkout Experiences can be customized and targeted to reach the right customer segments.

* **All Visitors**: Use universal trust signals like badges and guarantees.
* **New vs. Returning Visitors**: Offer reassurance for first-time buyers or special perks for repeat customers.
* **Geographic Targeting**: Display shipping promises or payment methods specific to a customer’s region.

A well-targeted checkout experience feels personal, not generic, and reinforces confidence in the brand.

### What do you want to communicate?

The content of your block should answer one question:

> “What message will help a shopper complete their purchase with confidence?”

* **Trust & Assurance**: Secure checkout, SSL encryption, 30-day returns, warranty.
* **Value Reinforcement**: Free shipping, lifetime guarantee, made in USA, sustainably sourced.
* **Social Proof**: “Trusted by 100,000+ customers” or influencer endorsements.
* **Urgency or Timeliness**: “Orders placed before 2 PM ship same day.”

Each message plays a role in reducing hesitation and improving conversion at the finish line.

**Pro Tip:** A Checkout Personalization can include multiple blocks. Combine a trust badge above your payment section with a social proof header or image block for maximum impact.
{% endhint %}

### Why it matters

Checkout is your most valuable piece of real estate. A few well-placed words or icons can be the difference between an abandoned cart and a completed sale.\
By pairing the right message, to the right audience, in the right place, you create trust and momentum that carry shoppers across the finish line.

Put simply:\
**A great checkout experience builds confidence, clarity, and connection, all in service of higher conversion and happier customers.**
