# Step 5: QA your integration, and publish your changes

After you have completed all previous integration steps, go through your store using Preview Mode in (you can access preview mode by clicking on the Eye icon next to your test, or by adding /?ig-preview=true to the end of your website's URL) and make sure everything looks correct. Follow our QA checklist [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/price-test-qa-checklist)!

Once you have verified Intelligems is fully integrated, you can publish your theme changes (if you haven't already) and start your test from the Intelligems App! Check out our step-by-step guide on doing this [here](https://docs.intelligems.io/price-testing/starting-a-price-test).

#### What happens next?

Now that you've started your first test, here are some things to do next:

* Check the Analytics Dashboard in the Intelligems app to see how the test is doing frequently. Note that it may take one to two hours for data to flow in!
* Start thinking about your [testing roadmap](https://docs.intelligems.io/getting-started/best-practices/test-design-best-practices).
* Review some [test suggestions](https://docs.intelligems.io/getting-started/common-use-cases).
