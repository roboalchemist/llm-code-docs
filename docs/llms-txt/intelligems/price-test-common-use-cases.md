# Price Test Common Use Cases

Price testing is a powerful tool because it allows businesses to determine the optimal price point for their products or services. By experimenting with different prices, companies can gather data on consumer behavior, demand elasticity, and profitability. This helps them understand what customers are willing to pay, which in turn maximizes revenue, enhances market positioning, and minimizes the risk of underpricing or overpricing. Effective price testing leads to better decision-making, ensuring businesses stay competitive while meeting customer expectations and financial goals.
