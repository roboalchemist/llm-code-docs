# The Double Down

Iterate based on the results from the test above. Let's say you run the test outlined above, and find that you see higher conversion and higher revenue per visitor on Product A at the $9 price point and on Product B you don't see a change in conversion across the three price points, but you see an increase in revenue per visitor on the $22 price point. Because [price elasticity is a curve](https://blog.intelligems.io/intelli-blog/price-elasticity), it may make sense to run another test drilling in further on the price for these products.

*What this test design might look like based on the above scenario:*

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="242"></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Control Price</strong></td><td><strong>Lower/Higher</strong></td><td><strong>Even Lower/Higher</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Product A</strong></td><td>$9</td><td>$8</td><td>$7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Product B</strong></td><td>$22</td><td>$24</td><td>$26</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that this is one scenario where your Control Group is not what has been live on the site, but rather the 'winner' from the previous test.
