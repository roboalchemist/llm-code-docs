# How to Set Up a Single Image Social Proof at Checkout

## Social Proof Image

Adding an image block to your checkout is a simple yet powerful way to build trust and social proof at the most critical step of the purchase journey. This example highlights how to display a statement like **“100,000+ Happy Customers”** to instantly convey credibility and reinforce shopper confidence.

### Who is this for

This experience is designed for **all visitors** — it should display for **100% of checkout traffic.**\
Every shopper benefits from seeing social proof, especially first-time buyers who may not be familiar with your brand yet.

### What this Personalization does

This experience adds a single image to your Shopify checkout page.\
The block features a bold, single-line statement that communicates scale, trust, or social proof right where it matters most.

This example includes:

* **100,000+ Happy Customers, r**einforce credibility and trust at checkout

You can customize the text, alignment, and styling to fit your brand’s voice and design system.

### When to use it

Use the Single Image Social Proof when you want to:

* Build trust and credibility at checkout
* Showcase social proof and customer validation
* Reassure first-time buyers with clear proof of brand reliability
* Strengthen checkout messaging without adding offers or promotions

**Pro Tip:** A Checkout Personalization can include multiple blocks. Combine a trust badge above your payment section with a social proof header or image block for maximum impact.

### Why it matters

Checkout is where hesitation peaks. A short, confident line of social proof can be the reassurance shoppers need to complete their purchase. It builds trust, confirms quality, and helps close the gap between “almost buying” and conversion.
