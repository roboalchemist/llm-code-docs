# Targeting

Intelligems offers four different categories of targeting. Targeting is available across all types of tests, though there are specific types of targeting that may not be available for every type of test due to technical reasons. See each of the articles below for more information on how that type of targeting works, what types of tests it is available for, and a few examples of how you can set the targeting up.
