## Introduction

The Intelligems Heatmap.com integration tags visitor sessions with experiment data, allowing you to analyze behavior patterns across different test groups.

## **How It Works**

Enable the Heatmap.com integration on the Integrations page in Intelligems. Once active, Heatmap.com sessions will include events tagged with test group information following this pattern: \<Experiment Name> - \<Test Group Name> allowing you to view/filter sessions in Heatmap.com by experiment name and test group name.

## **Benefits**

Filter and compare sessions in Heatmap.com by experiment to understand how different variations affect user behavior. See which test groups have higher engagement, where visitors drop off, or how different audiences interact with your site.
