# How to Set Up a Shipping Cutoff Message at Checkout

## Shipping Cutoff Message at Checkout

Creating a Shipping Reminder Callout is one of the simplest and most effective ways to set clear expectations at checkout. It lets shoppers know how quickly their order will ship, helping reduce hesitation and increase purchase confidence right before payment.

### Who is this for

This experience is designed for **all visitors** — it should display for 100% of checkout traffic.\
Every shopper benefits from knowing how fast your brand ships, especially first-time buyers who may be uncertain about delivery speed.

### What this Experience does

This experience adds a block to your Shopify checkout page. The block features a single, bold message that communicates urgency or clarity around shipping, fulfillment, or delivery timelines.

This example includes:

* **Orders placed before 2 PM EST ship same day!**

### When to use it

Use the Shipping Cutoff Reminder Callout when you want to:

* Reduce checkout hesitation by clarifying shipping timelines
* Reinforce fulfillment speed and reliability
* Set expectations for holiday or limited-time fulfillment windows
* Add urgency without using discounts or incentives

**Pro Tip:** A Checkout Experience can include multiple blocks. Combine a trust badge above your payment section with a social proof header or image block for maximum impact.

### Why it matters

Checkout is the most important touchpoint in the customer journey.\
Clear, proactive messaging helps shoppers feel confident and informed, reducing cart abandonment caused by uncertainty about shipping speed or delivery expectations.
