# Integration Guide using Duplicate Products

Before you can run a Price Test on your Shopify store, there is a small integration that needs to be done. There are five components to the integration:

1. Add Intelligems JavaScript
2. Tag product prices
3. Hide duplicate products from collections pages
4. Configure duplicate products
5. QA your integration, and publish your changes

If you have chosen to have Intelligems complete the integration, many of these steps will be done on your behalf.
{% endhint %}
