#### Conversion Metrics

* **View Collection Rate:** Percentage of visitors who viewed a collection page.
* **View Product Rate:** Percentage of visitors who viewed a product detail page (PDP).
* **ATC (Add to Cart) Rate**: Percentage of visitors who added at least one product to cart. If you have defined target products and have [filtered to “Orders with Target Products,”](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/filters#filters-pane) then only visitors who added at least one target product to cart would count in the numerator here.
* **Abandoned Cart Rate**: Percentage of visitors who added to cart but did not make a purchase.
* **Begin Checkout Rate:** Percentage of visitors who started checkout. If you have defined target products and have [filtered to “Orders with Target Products,”](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/filters#filters-pane) then only visitors who started checkout with at least one target product in cart would count in the numerator here.
* **Abandoned Checkout Rate**: Percentage of visitors who started checkout but did not make a purchase.
* **Conversion Rate**: Number of orders divided by number of unique visitors. Note the denominator is visitors, not sessions. Other tools, like Shopify reporting, may report conversion rate on a session basis. If you have defined target products and have [filtered to “Orders with Target Products,”](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/filters#filters-pane) then only orders with at least one target product would count in the numerator here.

#### Conversion Funnel

* **Checkout Stages**: You can view checkout stages as rates (i.e., percentage of visitors who reached the stage), or use them as filters (i.e., filter only to those visitors who reached the stage). Stages are sequential — if someone reached “Address Info Submitted,” for example, then they must have also reached “Started Checkout” and “Contact Info Submitted.” A visitor who made an order would have reached every stage. If you have defined target products and have [filtered to “Orders with Target Products,”](https://docs.intelligems.io/analytics/filters#filters-pane) then only visitors who reached checkout with at least one target product to cart would count
  * **Added to Cart:** Added at least one product to cart.
  * **Began Checkout**: Opened checkout page.
  * **Contact Info Submitted**: Entered email and/or phone number.
  * **Address Info Submitted**: Entered shipping address - a visitor who reached this stage saw shipping rate options.
  * **Converted:** Completed checkout.
