# Order and Revenue Accounting

## Refunds and Cancellations

Refunded, canceled, and voided orders are excluded from Intelligems analytics by default. If you would like to include these orders in your test results, please go to the [Intelligems settings page](https://app.intelligems.io/settings) → Analytics Settings → toggle on "Use Original Order Revenue".

## Partial Refunds and Order Updates

Intelligems analytics reflects the most recent data for each order, meaning that partial refunds and order updates (eg, post-purchase add-ons) are included by default. If you would prefer Intelligems to use the data about an order as it was when the order was placed, please go to the [Intelligems settings page](https://app.intelligems.io/settings) → Analytics Settings → toggle on "Use Original Order Revenue".

## Gift Cards

Like Shopify analytics, Intelligems excludes revenue from the sale of gift cards, and orders that contain only gift cards and no other items are excluded. Revenue from the use of gift cards is included and treated just like normal revenue.

## Currency

Intelligems displays all financial data in store default currency. If a sale is made in non- store default currency, the conversion is done by Shopify according to your settings (see [Shopify documentation here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/pricing/exchange-rates)) and will match Shopify’s reporting.

## Taxes & Duties

Intelligems includes product revenue and shipping revenue in its reporting. Other payments by customers, including duties, fees, or tips, are generally excluded. Taxes are generally not included, however, if pricing on an order is tax-inclusive, then taxes are included (see more in [Shopify's documentation here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/pricing/dynamic-tax-inclusive-pricing)).
