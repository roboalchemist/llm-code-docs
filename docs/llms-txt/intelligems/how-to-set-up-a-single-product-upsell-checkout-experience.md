# How to Set Up a Single Product Upsell Personalization at Checkout

## Adding a Single Product Upsell at Checkout

Adding upsells to your checkout page is easy with Intelligems. You have the power to not only show upsells to customers at checkout without needing another app, but you can measure the impact of product upsells with Personalizations. In this example, you'll learn how to set up a single product upsell at checkout via Personalizations. \
\
The goal is to offer a low-friction add-on that customers can add with one click before completing their purchase.

### Who is this for

This setup is best for:

* Brands with impulse add-on products that are complementary, one-size / color, and don't take any decision making to add
* Brands that know exactly which product they want to show, or have already tested and want to rollout their learnings

\
Checkout Personalizations require Shopify Plus.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro Tip:** Choose products that are one size, and are obvious add-ons. This should feel like a no-brainer add on, similar to gum in the checkout line at the supermarket. Minimal decision making for the customer.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### When to use this

Use this Personalization when you want to:

* Launch a checkout upsell without running a test
* Promote a single, obvious and complementary impulse item
* Increase average order value with minimal risk to conversion
* Keep checkout simple and free of choice overload

This is a strong default for merchants new to checkout upsells.

### What this Checkout Personalization does

This setup creates a Product Upsell Checkout Personalization that shows a single product upsell at checkout to 100% of your traffic, or the targeted audience you choose during setup.&#x20;

### Why it matters

Checkout is the highest-intent moment in the purchase journey, but too many choices can reduce conversion. A single-product upsell allows you to increase average order value while keeping checkout fast and focused.
