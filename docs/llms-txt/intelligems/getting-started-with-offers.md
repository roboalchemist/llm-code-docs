## Offers User Guide

## What are Offers?

Offers are powerful tools that help you create promotions and discounts for your online store. Think of them as digital coupons that work automatically when customers meet certain conditions.

With Offers, you can:

* Give discounts on specific products or entire orders
* Offer free shipping when customers spend enough
* Create volume discounts that reward bigger purchases
* Give free gifts to encourage more sales
* Test different promotions to see which works best

The best part? Offers work automatically. Once you set them up, customers get the deals without needing special codes or complicated steps.

### How to Access Offers

You can find the Offers feature in your Intelligems dashboard:

1. Log into your Intelligems account
2. Go to <https://app.intelligems.io/experiences/offers>
3. Click "Create New Offer" to get started

## Types of Offers

Intelligems gives you five different types of offers. Each one works best for different goals.

#### 1. Amount off Products

This offer gives customers money off specific products you choose.

**When to use it:**

* You want to promote certain items
* You have products that aren't selling well
* You want to clear out old inventory

**How it works:**

* Pick which products get the discount
* Choose how much money to take off (like $5 off or 20% off)
* Set any minimum requirements (like "buy 2 to get the deal")

**Example:** Take $10 off all winter coats when customers buy any coat.

#### 2. Amount off Order

This offer takes money off the customer's entire order total.

**When to use it:**

* You want to encourage bigger purchases
* You want to reward loyal customers

**How it works:**

* Set the discount amount (like $15 off or 10% off)

* The discount applies to the whole order

**Example:** Get $20 off your order when you spend $150 or more.

#### 3. Volume Discounts

These offers give bigger discounts when customers buy more items. You can create up to four different discount levels.

**When to use it:**

* You want customers to buy more items
* You sell products that work well together
* You want to increase your average order size

**How it works:**

* Create different discount tiers (like 10% off for 2 items, 20% off for 4 items)

* Customers automatically get the best discount they qualify for

**Example:**

* Buy 2 items: Get 10% off
* Buy 4 items: Get 20% off

#### 4. Free Shipping

This offer removes shipping costs when customers meet your requirements.

**When to use it:**

* You're competing with stores that offer free shipping

**How it works:**

* Set minimum requirements (like "free shipping on orders over $50")
* Choose which countries get free shipping

#### 5. Free Gift

This offer adds a free product to the customer's cart when they meet your requirements.

**How it works:**

* Choose which product to give away for free
* Set requirements for getting the gift (like "spend $100")

## Setting Up Your First Offer

Follow these simple steps to create any type of offer:

#### Step 1: Choose Your Offer Type

1. Go to the Offers page in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Offer"

1. **Set the discount amount** - Choose how much to discount (percentage or dollar amount)
2. **Pick eligible products** - Select which products the offer applies to (or leave blank for all products)
3. **Configure item mix settings** - By default, customers can mix and match eligible products to qualify for your discount. Enable "Require same item purchases" if customers must buy multiple units/subtotal of the *same* product to reach discount thresholds (useful for creating product-specific volume discounts)
4. **Set minimum requirements** - Decide if customers need to spend a certain amount or buy a certain number of items
5. **Choose stacking options** - Decide if this offer can combine with other offers

#### Step 3: Add Components (Optional)

You can add special features called components (via [**Global Styles**](https://docs.intelligems.io/general-features/global-styles)) to help customers understand and use your offer:

* **Quantity Buttons** - Help customers quickly add multiple items
* **Progress Bar** - Show customers how close they are to earning the discount
* **Offer Message** - Display promotional text on your website

#### Step 4: Set Up Targeting (Optional)

You can limit who sees your offer:

* **By location** - Only show to customers in certain countries
* **By device** - Only show to mobile or desktop users
* **By customer type** - Only show to new or returning customers

#### Step 5: Preview and Activate

1. Use the preview feature to see how your offer will look
2. Test the offer to make sure it works correctly
3. Click "Activate" to make it live on your website

* Mention offers in your marketing emails
* Add offer details to your website's announcement bar

#### Monitor Performance

* Check your analytics regularly to see how offers are performing

* Adjust offers based on what the data tells you

#### Time Your Offers Well

## Common Questions

**Can I run multiple offers at the same time?** Yes, but be careful about how they interact. You can choose whether offers "stack" (combine) or work separately.

**How do customers see the offers?** Offers appear automatically when customers meet the requirements. They'll see discounts in their cart and at checkout.

**Can I change an offer after it's live?** Yes, you can edit offers anytime. Changes take effect immediately.

**Do I need technical skills to set up offers?** Basic offers require no technical skills. Enabling components like progress bars and quantity buttons for the first time may need help from a developer, as you'll need to add some short code snippets to your theme.

**How do I know if my offers are working?** Check your Intelligems analytics dashboard to see offer performance, including how many customers used each offer and the impact on sales.
