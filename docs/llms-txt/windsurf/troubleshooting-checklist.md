# Troubleshooting Checklist

Running into issues with Codeium? Use this checklist of common debugging techniques to try and resolve the issue, otherwise file a support ticket on help.windsurf.com.

## 1. Make sure the Codeium plugin has been installed properly

If you are a Codeium Enterprise user, make sure to follow the instructions that are available at your enterprise portal URL (https\://\[YOUR\_PORTAL\_URL]/install). Furthermore, remember to install the Codeium Enterprise Updater plugin, not the standard Codeium plugin. Finally, ensure that the enterprise portal url that you set in the plugin's settings is correct and formatted correctly (https\://\[YOUR\_PORTAL\_URL])

If you are on Teams or Codeium's free tier, follow the instructions outlined at windsurf.com/download.

In either case, make sure that your current IDE version is supported by Codeium.

## 2. Check Codeium's Feature Reference guide

If a particular feature is unavailable, it could be because it is not yet supported in your IDE. You can check which features are available on which IDEs using the feature reference guides linked below. Codeium is constantly expanding our coverage and striving to bring all features to all IDEs.

## 3. Try some common troubleshooting techniques

Sometimes a good old restart does the trick. Some things we recommend trying:

* *Try reloading your IDE*. Sometimes reloading the IDE fixes the issue. On JetBrains IDEs, you can try and reset the Codeium extension by going to `Help` --> `Find Action` --> `Reset Codeium`.

* *Try logging in and out of Codeium*. Enterprise users can sign out by navigating to their Enterprise Portal URL in the browser, clicking on their Profile icon, scrolling down to the bottom and clicking "Sign Out". Teams and free tier users can sign out by navigating to windsurf.com, clicking on their Profile icon, and selecting "Sign Out" from the dropdown menu.

* *Try uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin*. Sometimes conflicting plugins or IDE settings can cause issues that are resolved by simply removing the plugin and reinstalling it.

## 4. Look through the help center articles with fixes to common issues
