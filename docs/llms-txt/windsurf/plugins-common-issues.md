> Common Windsurf plugin issues including subscription problems, cancellation, telemetry settings, account deletion, and chat panel troubleshooting.

### I subscribed to Pro but I'm stuck on the Free tier

First, give it a few minutes to update. If that doesn't work, try logging out of Windsurf on the website, restarting your IDE, and logging back into Windsurf. Additionally, please make sure you have the latest version of Windsurf installed.

### How do I cancel my Pro/Teams subscription?

You can cancel your paid plan by going to your Profile by clicking your icon on the top right of the [Windsurf website](https://windsurf.com/profile).

To cancel your Pro subscription, navigate to the `Billing` page in the navigation panel on the left and click "Cancel Plan".

To cancel your Teams subscription, navigate to the `Manage Team` page in the navigation panel on the left and click "Cancel Plan".

### How do I disable code snippet telemetry?

As mentioned in our [security page](https://windsurf.com/security), you can opt out of code snippet telemetry by going to your settings [account settings](https://windsurf.com/settings). For more information, please visit our [Terms of Service](https://windsurf.com/terms-of-service-individual).

### How do I delete my account?

You can delete your account by going to your settings [account settings](https://windsurf.com/settings), scrolling down and clicking on "Delete Account".
