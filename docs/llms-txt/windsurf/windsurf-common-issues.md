### I'm experiencing rate limiting issues

We're subject to rate limits and unfortunately sometimes hit capacity for the premium models we work with. We are actively working on getting these limits increased and fairly distributing the capacity that we have!

This should not be an issue forever. If you get this error, please wait a few moments and try again.

### Pylance or Pyright isn't working / Python syntax highlighting is broken or subpar

We've gone ahead and developed a [Pyright extension specifically for Windsurf](/windsurf/advanced/#windsurf-extensions). Please search for "Windsurf Pyright" or paste `@id:codeium.windsurfPyright` into the extension search.

### How do I download Diagnostic logs to send to the Windsurf support team?

You can download diagnostic logs by going to your Cascade Panel, tapping the three dots in the top right corner, and then clicking "Download Diagnostics".

### On MacOS, I see a pop-up: 'Windsurf' is damaged and cannot be opened.

This pop-up is due to a false positive in MacOS security features. You can usually resolve this by going to "System Settings -> Privacy & Security" and clicking "Allow" or "Open anyway" for Windsurf. If this fails or is not possible, try the following steps:

1. Ensure that Windsurf is placed under your `/Applications` folder and that you are running it from there.
2. Check your processor type: if your Mac has an Intel chip, make sure you have the Intel version. If it's Apple Silicon (like M1, M2 or M3), make sure you have the Apple Silicon version. You can select the processor type from the [Mac download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac).
3. Try redownloading the DMG and reinstalling from [the official download page](https://windsurf.com/windsurf/download_mac), as the failing security feature is usually triggered on download.
4. Make sure Windsurf (and the "Windsurf is Damaged" pop-up) is closed, and run `xattr -c "/Applications/Windsurf.app/"`.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

For example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### What domains should I whitelist for network filters/firewalls, VPNs, or proxies?

If you're using any network filtering, firewalls, VPN services, or working in environments with restricted network access, you may experience connectivity issues with Windsurf. To ensure smooth operation, please whitelist the following domains in your network configuration:

* \*.codeium.com
* \*.windsurf.com
* \*.codeiumdata.com

### On Linux, Windsurf quietly doesn't launch, or crashes on launch

This is usually due to an Electron permissions issue, which VSCode also has, and is expected when using the tarball on Linux.

The easiest way to fix it is to run the following:

```bash  theme={null}
sudo chown root:root /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
sudo chown 4755 /path/to/windsurf/chrome-sandbox
```

You should then be able to launch Windsurf. You can also just run `windsurf` with the flag `--no-sandbox`, though we don't encourage this.

If this fails, then try the below.

### I received an error message saying 'Windsurf failed to start'

<Warning>Warning: deleting these folders will remove your conversation history and local settings!</Warning>

Delete the following folder:

Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\.codeium\windsurf\cascade`

Linux/Mac: `~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`

and try restarting the IDE.

### I received an error message about updates on Windows, or updates are not appearing on Windows.

An example:

> Updates are disabled because you are running the user-scope installation of Windsurf as Administrator.

We cannot auto-update Windsurf when it is run as Administrator. Please re-run Windsurf with User scope to update.

### My Cascade panel goes blank

Please reach out to us if this happens! A screen recording would be much appreciated. This can often be solved by clearing your chat history (`~/.codeium/windsurf/cascade`).
