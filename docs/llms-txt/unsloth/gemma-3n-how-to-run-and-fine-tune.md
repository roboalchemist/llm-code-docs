### :gear: Official Recommended Settings

According to the Gemma team, the official recommended settings for inference:

`temperature = 1.0, top_k = 64, top_p = 0.95, min_p = 0.0`

* Temperature of 1.0
* Top\_K of 64
* Min\_P of 0.00 (optional, but 0.01 works well, llama.cpp default is 0.1)
* Top\_P of 0.95
* Repetition Penalty of 1.0. (1.0 means disabled in llama.cpp and transformers)
* Chat template:

  <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code><strong>&#x3C;bos>&#x3C;start_of_turn>user\nHello!&#x3C;end_of_turn>\n&#x3C;start_of_turn>model\nHey there!&#x3C;end_of_turn>\n&#x3C;start_of_turn>user\nWhat is 1+1?&#x3C;end_of_turn>\n&#x3C;start_of_turn>model\n

{% hint style="success" %}
Please re download Gemma 3N quants or remove the old ones via Ollama since there are some bug fixes. You can do the below to delete the old file and refresh it:

```
ollama rm hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL

ollama run hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL
```

{% endhint %}

1. Install `ollama` if you haven't already!

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install pciutils -y
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

2. Run the model! Note you can call `ollama serve`in another terminal if it fails! We include all our fixes and suggested parameters (temperature etc) in `params` in our Hugging Face upload!

```bash
ollama run hf.co/unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL
```

### 📖 Tutorial: How to Run Gemma 3n in llama.cpp

{% hint style="info" %}
We would first like to thank [Xuan-Son Nguyen](https://x.com/ngxson) from Hugging Face, [Georgi Gerganov](https://x.com/ggerganov) from the llama.cpp team on making Gemma 3N work in llama.cpp!
{% endhint %}

1. Obtain the latest `llama.cpp` on [GitHub here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). You can follow the build instructions below as well. Change `-DGGML_CUDA=ON` to `-DGGML_CUDA=OFF` if you don't have a GPU or just want CPU inference. **For Apple Mac / Metal devices**, set `-DGGML_CUDA=OFF` then continue as usual - Metal support is on by default.

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install pciutils build-essential cmake curl libcurl4-openssl-dev -y
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cmake llama.cpp -B llama.cpp/build \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
cmake --build llama.cpp/build --config Release -j --clean-first --target llama-quantize llama-cli llama-gguf-split llama-mtmd-cli
cp llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-* llama.cpp
```

2. If you want to use `llama.cpp` directly to load models, you can do the below: (:Q4\_K\_XL) is the quantization type. You can also download via Hugging Face (point 3). This is similar to `ollama run`

```bash
./llama.cpp/llama-cli -hf unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL -ngl 99 --jinja
```

3. **OR** download the model via (after installing `pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer` ). You can choose Q4\_K\_M, or other quantized versions (like BF16 full precision).

```python
# !pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer
import os
os.environ["HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER"] = "1"
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
    repo_id = "unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF",
    local_dir = "unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF",
    allow_patterns = ["*UD-Q4_K_XL*", "mmproj-BF16.gguf"], # For Q4_K_XL
)
```

4. Run the model.
5. Edit `--threads 32` for the number of CPU threads, `--ctx-size 32768` for context length (Gemma 3 supports 32K context length!), `--n-gpu-layers 99` for GPU offloading on how many layers. Try adjusting it if your GPU goes out of memory. Also remove it if you have CPU only inference.
6. For conversation mode:

```bash
./llama.cpp/llama-cli \
    --model unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF/gemma-3n-E4B-it-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf \
    --ctx-size 32768 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99 \
    --seed 3407 \
    --prio 2 \
    --temp 1.0 \
    --repeat-penalty 1.0 \
    --min-p 0.00 \
    --top-k 64 \
    --top-p 0.95
```

7. For non conversation mode to test Flappy Bird:

```bash
./llama.cpp/llama-cli \
    --model unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF/gemma-3n-E4B-it-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf \
    --ctx-size 32768 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99 \
    --seed 3407 \
    --prio 2 \
    --temp 1.0 \
    --repeat-penalty 1.0 \
    --min-p 0.00 \
    --top-k 64 \
    --top-p 0.95 \
    -no-cnv \
    --prompt "<start_of_turn>user\nCreate a Flappy Bird game in Python. You must include these things:\n1. You must use pygame.\n2.

## 🦥 Fine-tuning Gemma 3n with Unsloth

Gemma 3n, like [Gemma 3](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/tutorials/gemma-3-how-to-run-and-fine-tune/..#unsloth-fine-tuning-fixes-for-gemma-3), had issues running on <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Flotat16 GPUs such as Tesla T4s in Colab**</mark>. You will encounter NaNs and infinities if you do not patch Gemma 3n for inference or finetuning. [More information below](#infinities-and-nan-gradients-and-activations).

* Fine-tune Gemma 3n-E4B with our [free Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Gemma3N_\(4B\)-Conversational.ipynb)
* **Audio:** Fine-tune Gemma 3n-E4B with our [**Audio only notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Gemma3N_\(4B\)-Audio.ipynb)
* **Vision**: Fine-tune Gemma 3n-E4B with our [**Vision only notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Gemma3N_\(4B\)-Vision.ipynb)

We also found that because Gemma 3n's unique architecture reuses hidden states in the vision encoder it poses another interesting quirk with [Gradient Checkpointing described below](#gradient-checkpointing-issues)

<mark style="background-color:purple;">**Unsloth is the only framework which works in float16 machines for Gemma 3n inference and training.**</mark> This means Colab Notebooks with free Tesla T4 GPUs also work! Overall, Unsloth makes Gemma 3n training 1.5x faster, 50% less VRAM and 4x longer context lengths.

Our free Gemma 3n Colab notebooks default to fine-tuning text layers. If you want to fine-tune vision or audio layers too, be aware this will require much more VRAM - beyond the 15GB free Colab or Kaggle provides. You *can* still fine-tune all layers including audio and vision and Unsloth also lets you fine-tune only specific areas, like just vision. Simply adjust as needed:

```python
model = FastVisionModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    finetune_vision_layers     = False, # False if not finetuning vision layers
    finetune_language_layers   = True,  # False if not finetuning language layers
    finetune_attention_modules = True,  # False if not finetuning attention layers
    finetune_mlp_modules       = True,  # False if not finetuning MLP layers
)
```

## 🐛Fixes for Gemma 3n

### :sparkles:GGUF issues & fixes

Thanks to discussions from [Michael](https://github.com/mxyng) from the Ollama team and also [Xuan](https://x.com/ngxson) from Hugging Face, there were 2 issues we had to fix specifically for GGUFs:

1. The `add_shared_kv_layers` parameter was accidentally encoded in `float32` which is fine, but becomes slightly complicated to decode on Ollama's side - a simple change to `uint32` solves the issue. [Pull request](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/14450) addressing this issue.
2. The `per_layer_token_embd` layer should be Q8\_0 in precision. Anything lower does not function properly and errors out in the Ollama engine - to reduce issues for our community, we made this all Q8\_0 in all quants - unfortunately this does use more space.
   1. As an [update](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B-it-GGUF/discussions/4), [Matt](https://huggingface.co/WBB2500) mentioned we can also use Q4\_0, Q4\_1, Q5\_0, Q5\_1 for the embeddings - and we confirmed it does also work in Ollama! This means once again the smaller 2, 3 and 4bit quants are smaller in size, and don't need Q8\_0!

## :infinity:Infinities and NaN gradients and activations

{% columns %}
{% column %}
Gemma 3n just like Gemma 3 has issues on FP16 GPUs (e.g., Tesla T4s in Colab).

Our previous fixes for Gemma 3 is [discussed here](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/tutorials/gemma-3-how-to-run-and-fine-tune). For Gemma 3, we found that activations exceed float16's maximum range of **65504.**

**Gemma 3N does not have this activation issue, but we still managed to encounter infinities!**
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}

{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

To get to the bottom of these infinities, we plotted the absolute maximum weight entries for Gemma 3N, and we see the below:

<figure><img src="https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-e9b01a20a0a1cfcc41ef47cb29c5188d52d6a79d%2Foutput2.webp?alt=media" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We find that the green crosses are the Conv2D convolutional weights. We can see that the magnitude of Conv2D layers is much larger on average.

Below is a table for Conv2D weights which have large magnitudes. Our hypothesis is that during a Conv2D operation, large weights multiply and sum together, and **unfortunately by chance exceed float16's maximum range of 65504.** Bfloat16 is fine, since it's maximum range is 10^38.

| Name                                   | Max       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- |
| msfa.ffn.pw\_proj.conv.weight          | 98.000000 |
| blocks.2.21.attn.key.down\_conv.weight | 37.000000 |
| blocks.2.32.pw\_exp.conv.weight        | 34.750000 |
| blocks.2.30.pw\_exp.conv.weight        | 33.750000 |
| blocks.2.34.pw\_exp.conv.weight        | 33.750000 |

### :sparkler:Solution to infinities

The naive solution is to `upcast` all Conv2D weights to float32 (if bfloat16 isn't available). But that would increase VRAM usage. To tackle this, we instead make use of `autocast` on the fly to upcast the weights and inputs to float32, and so we perform the accumulation in float32 as part of the matrix multiplication itself, without having to upcast the weights.

{% hint style="success" %}
Unsloth is the only framework that enables Gemma 3n inference and training on float16 GPUs, so Colab Notebooks with free Tesla T4s work!
{% endhint %}

### :checkered\_flag:Gradient Checkpointing issues

We found Gemma 3N's vision encoder to be quite unique as well since it re-uses hidden states. This unfortunately limits the usage of [Unsloth's gradient checkpointing](https://unsloth.ai/blog/long-context), which could have reduced VRAM usage significantly. since it cannot be applied to Vision encoder.

However, we still managed to leverage **Unsloth's automatic compiler** to optimize Gemma 3N!

### :cactus:Large losses during finetuning

We also found losses are interestingly very large during the start of finetuning - in the range of 6 to 7, but they do decrease over time quickly. We theorize this is either because of 2 possibilities:

1. There might be some implementation issue, but this is unlikely since inference seems to work.
2. <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Multi-modal models always seem to exhibit this behavior**</mark> - we found Llama 3.2 Vision's loss starts at 3 or 4, Pixtral at 8 or so, and Qwen 2.5 VL also 4 ish. Because Gemma 3N includes audio as well, it might amplify the starting loss. But this is just a hypothesis. We also found quantizing Qwen 2.5 VL 72B Instruct to have extremely high perplexity scores of around 30 or so, but the model interestingly performs fine.

## 🛠️ Technical Analysis

### Gemma 3n : MatFormer

So what is so special about Gemma 3n you ask? It is based on [Matryoshka Transformer or MatFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707) architecture meaning that each transformer layer/block embeds/nests FFNs of progressively smaller sizes. Think of it like progressively smaller cups put inside one another. The training is done so that at inference time you can choose the size you want and get the most of the performance of the bigger models.

There is also Per Layer Embedding which can be cached to reduce memory usage at inference time. So the 2B model (E2B) is a sub-network inside the 4B (aka 5.44B) model that is achieved by both Per Layer Embedding caching and skipping audio and vision components focusing solely on text.

The MatFormer architecture, typically is trained with exponentially spaced sub-models aka of sizes `S`, `S/2, S/4, S/8` etc in each of the layers. So at training time, inputs are randomly forwarded through one of the said sub blocks giving every sub block equal chance to learn. Now the advantage is, at inference time, if you want the model to be 1/4th of the original size, you can pick `S/4` sized sub blocks in each layer.

You can also choose to **Mix and Match** where you pick say, `S/4` sized sub block of one layer, `S/2` sized sub block of another layer and `S/8` sized sub block of another layer. In fact, you can change the sub models you pick based on the input itself if you fancy so. Basically its like choose your own kind of structure at every layer. So by just training a model of one particular size, you are creating exponentially many models of smaller sizes. No learning goes waste. Pretty neat huh.
