# List User Events

> Retrieves a list of "events" generated by the User on Vercel. Events are generated when the User performs a particular action, such as logging in, creating a deployment, and joining a Team (just to name a few). When the `teamId` parameter is supplied, then the events that are returned will be in relation to the Team that was specified.

            The ID of the principal who generated the event. The principal is
            typically a user, but it could also be an app, an integration, etc.
            The principal may have delegated its authority to an acting party,
            and so {@link viaIds} should be checked as well.

            If the principal delegated its authority (for example, a user
            delegating to an app), then this array contains the ID of the
            current actor. For example, if `principalId` is "user123" and
            `viaIds` is `["app456"]`, we can say the event was triggered by -
            "app456 on behalf of user123", or - "user123 via app4556". Both are
            equivalent. Arbitrarily long chains of delegation can be
            represented. For example, if `principalId` is "user123" and `viaIds`
            is `["service1", "service2"]`, we can say the event was triggered by
            "user123 via service1 via service2".
