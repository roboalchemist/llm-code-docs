## How is pay-per-page billing calculated?

Unstructured calculates a page as follows:

* For these file types, a page is a page, slide, or image: `.pdf`, `.pptx`, and `.tiff`.
* For `.docx` files that have page metadata, Unstructured calculates the number of pages based on that metadata.
* For all other file types, Unstructured calculates the number of pages as the file's size divided by 100 KB.
* For non-file data, Unstructured calculates a page as 100 KB of incoming data to be processed.

The **Billing** tab shows your account's current billing rate per page.

To complete usage-related tasks in your account, see [Account usage](/ui/account/usage).
