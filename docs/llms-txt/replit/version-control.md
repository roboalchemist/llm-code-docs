# Version control

> Track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your code's evolution using Replit's integrated version control tools.

Version control on Replit enables you to track, manage, and collaborate on your codebase with confidence. With built-in Git integration and GitHub connectivity, you can:

* Track code changes and maintain a history of your development work
* Collaborate with team members without code conflicts or lost work
* Import, modify, and push code between Replit and GitHub
* Work with branches to experiment with new features safely

## What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. On Replit, version control is powered by Git—the industry-standard tool for tracking code changes—with a user-friendly visual interface that eliminates the need for command-line knowledge.

### How version control works on Replit

All four version control options interact with the same underlying Git repository:

1. **Agent Checkpoints** create commits automatically at important milestones when building with [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent). [Learn more about checkpoints and rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).
2. **Git Pane** provides visual access to the complete Git repository
3. **Git CLI** offers command-line access to all Git functionality
4. **File History** tracks granular changes within individual files

Choose the interface that best matches your needs, with the confidence that everything is backed by Git's robust version control system.

## Getting started

Access version control in your Replit App by adding the Git tool to your workspace:

1. Navigate to the Tools section in your Replit App
2. Select the **+** sign to add new tools
3. Select **Git** from the list of available tools

To import existing projects from GitHub, see [Import from GitHub](/getting-started/quickstarts/import-from-github).

## Version control options

Replit's version control is powered by Git at its core. You have multiple ways to interact with and benefit from version control:

## Use cases

**Tracking your personal projects**

Track changes to your code as you develop, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. The [Git pane](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/git-interface) shows your changes visually, making it easy to commit meaningful updates.

**Collaborating with a team**

Work with multiple developers on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes. Create branches for new features, then merge them back when ready. Learn more about [collaboration tools](/replit-app/collaborate).

## Agent checkpoints

When building applications with [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent), you benefit from an additional layer of version control through checkpoints. Checkpoints automatically capture the comprehensive state of your project—including workspace contents, AI conversation context, and connected databases—at key moments during AI-assisted development.

### How checkpoints work

Agent checkpoints function as comprehensive snapshots of your entire Replit App state:

* **Automatic creation**: Agent creates checkpoints at logical points during development
* **Complete state capture**: Each checkpoint preserves workspace contents, AI memory, and database states
* **Implementation plans**: Before making changes, Agent presents a plan for your review
* **Complex task tracking**: Multiple checkpoints may be created for larger tasks

### Benefits for AI-assisted development

Agent checkpoints provide unique advantages when building with AI:

* **Safety net**: Experiment confidently knowing you can easily restore previous states across your entire development environment
* **Progress tracking**: See exactly how Agent built your application step by step
* **Logical milestones**: Checkpoints represent complete features rather than arbitrary save points
* **Instant rollback**: Return to any previous state with a single click, including database and AI context restoration

<Info>
  For detailed information about what checkpoints capture and comprehensive rollback capabilities, see [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).
</Info>

<Tip>
  While Agent checkpoints are powerful for development with AI, consider using Git commits for long-term version tracking and collaboration, especially when working with external repositories.
