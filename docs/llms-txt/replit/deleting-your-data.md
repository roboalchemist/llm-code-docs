# Deleting your data

> Learn how to permanently delete your account and personal information from Replit using either the web browser or mobile app.

To delete your personal information from Replit, please follow these instructions.  If you are using a desktop web browser:

1. Log in to Replit and visit [https://replit.com/account](https://replit.com/account), or click your account name (next to your profile picture) then click Account.
2. Scroll down to the "Billing" section, click "Additional billing settings".
3. In the "Delete Account" section, click on "Request account deletion" then "Yes, Delete my Account" to confirm.

You can also perform the same process using our mobile app:

1. Click "Account" at the bottom of the screen.
2. Scroll down to "Manage Account".
3. Click "Delete Account" and then "Delete Account" again to confirm.

Deleting your account removes all of your content from Replit (including Replit Apps, templates, posts), and results in your personal information being purged from our systems. You will not be able to recover this data if you change your mind.
