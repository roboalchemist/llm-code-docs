## Team and Organization Themes

App Themes work differently depending on whether you're using a personal account or working within an organization.

### Personal themes

When using App Themes on a personal account, all themes you create are private to your account. You have full control over creating, editing, and deleting your custom themes.

### Organization themes

App Themes in organizations enable collaborative design across your team:

* **Shared access**: Themes created by any organization member are available to everyone in the organization
* **Collaborative editing**: All users with edit permissions can create and modify organization themes
* **Admin controls**: Only organization administrators can delete themes to prevent accidental removal of shared resources

<Note>
  Organization themes help maintain consistent branding and design standards across all apps built by your team.
