## Public Replit Apps

Content you create in a public Replit App in a team or personal context is automatically subject to an MIT license. The full text of the MIT license reads as follows:

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Specific Replit App Licenses

<Note>
  Adding a license file to a public Replit App does not prevent the Replit App from being made available under the MIT license. To make a license file effective, the Replit Apps must be made private as described below.
</Note>

For specific Replit Apps, we may offer features to allow users to change the default license. For example, we might enable the ability to earn or to pay in Cycles for rights in a Replit Apps, or for access to specific features or digital items.

## Private Replit Apps

Content in a private Replit Apps in a Team or personal context is licensed to Replit on a platform basis under the [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms).

If you would like to attach your own license to the code, we recommend you include the license as a (code) comment or a readme.txt file, as part of the Replit Apps.
