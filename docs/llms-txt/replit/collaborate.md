# Collaboration

> One of the great parts about Replit is that _everything_ you make can be shared with the world. Since your code is hosted in the cloud, it's as simple as one click!

There are a few ways to share your Replit App, we'll cover them here.

## Collaborate in real time (Join Links)

<Warning>
  * Join links **grant edit access** to your Replit App, so be careful who you share them with.
  * Join links **share secrets** stored in the "Secrets" pane.
    For sharing a Replit App as you would a Repo or other code, take a look at [making your Replit App public.](#make-your-repl-public)
</Warning>

To collaborate with your friends on your Replit App, you can create a Join Link. Join Links create a unique URL that you can share with others. When they click the link, they'll be taken to your Replit App and can start coding with you in real time.

Join Links are **private** by default, so only people with the link can access your Replit App.

If you accidentally share your link with someone you didn't mean to, you can always regenerate a new one. to create a new join link, click the "Invite" button in the top right corner of your Replit App.

Simply toggle the Join Link to "On" and copy the resulting URL. When your friends with an active Replit account navigate to that URL, they'll be able to edit your Replit App in real time.

You'll also receive a notification when someone joins your Replit App.

## Make your Replit App Public

<Note>
  Making your Replit App public *will not* expose any secrets you've saved in the "Secrets" pane. *However*, it will expose any code you've written, so be careful about sharing sensitive information.
</Note>

Head over to your Replit App and click the name in the top left corner. This will open up the settings for your Replit App.

Now, you can toggle the Replit App to be public or private.

Making your Replit App public will allow anyone to view your code and run your project. It creates a unique URL that you can share with anyone, like this: [https://replit.com/@replit/Python?v=1](https://replit.com/@replit/Python?v=1).

## Share your app in the Gallery

Once you've made your Replit App public, you can share it with the broader Replit community through the [Replit Gallery](http://replit.com/gallery). The Gallery is the perfect place to showcase your projects, get feedback from other developers, and discover amazing apps built by the community.

To share your app in the Gallery, simply make sure your Replit App is public (following the steps above) and visit [replit.com/gallery](http://replit.com/gallery) to submit your project. This will help others discover your work and potentially inspire new collaborations.
