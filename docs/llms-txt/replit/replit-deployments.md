Publishing lets you share your Replit App with the world using a simplified process.

<Note>
  The action of making your app live is called "Publishing." This page describes the different types of deployments available.
</Note>

## What is Publishing?

Publishing is a feature that saves a **snapshot** of your Replit App to the cloud,
where everyone can interact with it. A snapshot captures the current state of the files in your
Replit App.

When you publish your Replit App, you create a **published app**. A published app is a running instance
of your app on Replit's cloud infrastructure. This makes the app reliably available on the internet,
separate from the version in your workspace.

<Info>
  Replit's infrastructure is backed by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All
  published apps are hosted in the United States.

Publishing includes tools to monitor your published app status and view web analytics.

Replit offers the following deployment types:

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to publish your Replit App:

1. From your Replit App workspace, select <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=df3fa2573b451c54591523c9d9111db1" alt="Publish icon" data-og-width="16" width="16" data-og-height="16" height="16" data-path="images/icons/deploy-icon.svg" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=115e9383e0350a6ef201a41f78f8a19a 280w, https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=667b93ae66d0b69569409fb90d9fc280 560w, https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=ae927e5aadcb7a470ad726f0acb0f782 840w, https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=16ee8f7b3d9db6b4f74ea8c2ebb6730f 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=ad04a5984543c13895fd30182294ec0a 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=2449268bce371256727b17027eb180f3 2500w" /> **Publish** at the top.
2. In the **Publishing** tab, select your publishing option.
3. If **Add a payment method** appears, follow the prompts to add a payment method.

Replit automatically selects the best publishing option for your app based on the project type and your needs.

However, to choose a different deployment type, consider the following information.

## Choosing the right publishing option

The following video explains how to choose the right publishing option for your app:

## Key features

Publishing offers the following convenient features:

* **Multiple publishing options**: Select or update a deployment type that meets your needs in a few clicks.
* **Custom domains**: Serve your app from your web domain.
* **Analytics**: Track visitor data and other metrics for your published app.
* **Monitoring tools**: View your published app status and configuration.
* **Access controls**: Control who can see your app with a single click. Available only for **Teams** members.

## How it works

When you publish your Replit App, Replit creates a snapshot of your app's files and dependencies.
This snapshot is then sent to Replit's cloud infrastructure, where it runs as a separate instance of your app.
To update your published app with the latest changes, publish again to create a fresh snapshot.

<Warning>
  Avoid saving and relying on data written to a published app's filesystem. To
  store data, use a storage or database option such as Replit's [Storage and
  Database](/category/storage-and-databases) offerings.
</Warning>

## Use cases

The following examples show different types of published apps.

### Autoscale deployment: Typing speed assessment app

Let the cloud scale up resources when users take typing tests and reduce them when not in use.

### Static deployment: Solar system simulation

Learn about the planets in a solar system visualization app on the web.
This visualization renders in the browser and doesn't transfer any user input to a server.

### Reserved VM deployment: Discord bot

Run a Discord bot that helps you moderate and onboard members.
It's always online to chat with users and respond to commands with predictable pricing and performance.

### Scheduled deployment: Home automation triggers

Schedule API calls to start and stop your smart home devices at specific times and days.
