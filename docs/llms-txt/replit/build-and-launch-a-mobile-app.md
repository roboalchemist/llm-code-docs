<Tip>
  If your preview looks out of date, refresh in Expo Go. On your device, shake your phone to open the developer menu, then select **Refresh**.
</Tip>

## Part 3: Publish to Expo Go

Publishing to Expo Go makes your app available to anyone with the Expo Go app installed. This is the fastest way to share your app for feedback without going through Apple's review process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish from your Workspace">
    Open the publishing pane and select **Publish**. This deploys your app and backend to Replit's infrastructure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share your app">
    After publishing, anyone with Expo Go can open your app using the shareable link. No Apple Developer account is required at this stage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use Expo Go publishing to quickly share prototypes, gather early feedback, and iterate before committing to the App Store process.
</Tip>

## Part 4: Promote to TestFlight

After publishing to Expo Go, you can promote your app to TestFlight for more formal beta testing. TestFlight requires an Apple Developer account but provides a native app experience without Expo Go.

### Apple publishing prerequisites

Apple requires specific accounts and configurations before you can publish. Complete these steps before attempting to submit.

#### Join the Apple Developer Program

You need an Apple Developer Program membership to publish to TestFlight and submit to the App Store.

<Callout type="note">
  Apple requires two-factor authentication on your Apple Account.
</Callout>

#### Individual vs. organization enrollment

* **Individual accounts**: Publish under your legal name as the seller.
* **Organization accounts**: Publish under the organization name as the seller. Apple requires a D‑U‑N‑S Number for organizations, which can take time to obtain.

#### Typical enrollment steps

1. Sign in at `https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/`
2. Complete identity verification
3. Accept the Apple Developer Program license agreement
4. Pay the annual fee set by Apple
5. Wait for Apple approval (time varies by account type)

### Understand TestFlight vs. the App Store

TestFlight is Apple’s beta testing system. The App Store is the public marketplace where anyone can download your app.

| Aspect             | TestFlight                                        | App Store                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Audience**       | Invited testers (up to 10,000 external testers)   | Public                                   |
| **Purpose**        | Beta testing and feedback                         | Public release                           |
| **Review**         | First build of a version goes through beta review | Every submission goes through App Review |
| **Build lifetime** | Expires after 90 days                             | Permanent until you remove it            |

<Tip>
  TestFlight is the fastest way to catch crashes, performance issues, and device-specific problems before launch.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the publishing pane">
    With your app already published to Expo Go, open the publishing pane in your Workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select App Store publishing">
    Select **Publish to App Store** to promote your app to TestFlight.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Apple and submit">
    Sign in with your Apple Developer account when prompted. Replit builds a native app in the cloud and submits it to TestFlight.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The first build of a version typically requires a TestFlight beta review. After approval, you can usually push additional builds to testers faster.
</Note>

### Enable external testing

To share your TestFlight build with other people, configure external testing in App Store Connect:

1. In App Store Connect, open your app.
2. Go to **TestFlight**, then **External Testing**.
3. Create a testing group and add your build.
4. Submit for Beta App Review (required by Apple for external testers).
5. Share the public TestFlight link after approval.

## Part 5: Submit to the App Store

When your build is ready for release, submit it through App Store Connect:

1. In App Store Connect, open your app.
2. Go to the **App Store** tab.
3. Fill out required metadata (description, screenshots, category, pricing, and privacy details).
4. Select your TestFlight build to promote.
5. Submit for review.

### Complete your App Store Connect listing

Replit creates your app listing in App Store Connect, but you still need to complete required metadata before Apple will accept a submission. The following fields are commonly required:

* **App name and subtitle**
* **Category** (primary, optional secondary)
* **Pricing and availability** (free or paid, and regions)
* **Privacy policy URL** (publicly accessible)
* **App Privacy details** (data collection “nutrition labels”)
* **Screenshots** (required)
* **Support URL** (required)
* **App Review contact information** (required)

<Callout type="note">
  If your app requires sign-in, add demo credentials for App Review in App Store Connect so Apple can test your app.
</Callout>

### Privacy requirements

Apple requires you to:

* Provide a public **privacy policy URL**
* Declare your **App Privacy** data practices (including third-party SDKs and services you use)

If you use third-party services (analytics, payments, crash reporting, ads), review their privacy disclosures and include them in your App Privacy answers.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are required and strongly influence conversion on the App Store.

<Tip>
  Use real screenshots from your app. Make sure screenshots match the current build you’re submitting.
</Tip>

### Common rejection reasons

| Issue                             | How to avoid it                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Crashes or obvious bugs           | Test on TestFlight first and fix issues before submission   |
| Missing privacy policy            | Add a public privacy policy URL before submission           |
| Screenshots don’t match the app   | Upload screenshots from the current build                   |
| Reviewers can’t access the app    | Provide demo credentials and instructions in review notes   |
| Incomplete or placeholder content | Remove “coming soon” flows and incomplete screens           |
| Permission prompts lack context   | Explain why you need camera, location, or other permissions |

### Timelines to expect

| Stage                                             | Typical duration                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apple Developer Program approval                  | Varies (often 1–2 days for individuals; longer for organizations) |
| Build processing in App Store Connect             | Often 10–15 minutes                                               |
| TestFlight beta review (first build of a version) | Often about a day                                                 |
| App Store review                                  | Often 1–2 days                                                    |

### Updating your app after launch

* **UI and content updates**: Publish again to ship updates quickly.
* **Native changes** (for example, app icons or permissions): Submit a new App Store build.
