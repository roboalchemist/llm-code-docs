# Reporting Abuse on Replit

> At Replit, we strive to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all our users. If you encounter abusive, harmful, or inappropriate content, we encourage you to report it immediately. We have established multiple channels to address various types of concerns efficiently. Here's how you can help

## 1. Use the On-Site reporting feature

Use the on-site reporting feature for a quick and direct way to report content that violates our [Community Standards](https://blog.replit.com/community-standards). This method ensures that your report is immediately sent to our staff members for review. Here's how to use it:

* Navigate to the content you wish to report.
* Look for a report button or link. This is usually located near the content itself, such as under a post or within a user's profile options.
* Select the report button or link and describe the nature of the abusive content.
* Submit your report. Our team will review it as soon as possible and take appropriate action.

For more detailed instructions on using the reporting feature, please read [How to Make Reports](./trust-and-safety.md#how-to-make-reports).

## 2. Report Abuse via email

If you come across phishing attempts or suspect a piece of content is designed to deceive or harm others by pretending to be something it's not, please report it directly to our dedicated email address for abuse reports:

* **Email**: `abuse@replit.com`
* **Subject**: Briefly describe the issue (e.g., "Phishing Attempt Detected").
* **Body**: Include detailed information about the phishing attempt, such as URLs, user account names involved, and a description of the content. Attach any relevant screenshots if possible.

### Additional Resources
