Replit AI transforms how you build software with Agent, our AI-powered development assistant. Agent allows you to build entire applications in minutes, without knowing how to code.

<Tip>
  **New with Agent 3** - Extended autonomous builds with minimal supervision,
  App Testing for self-validation, two ways to start an app (design-first vs.
  full app first), and Agents & Automations for building your own autonomous
  systems.
</Tip>

## What you can build

With Agent, you can:

* **Transform ideas into apps:** Describe your vision in plain language and watch Agent build a complete application
* **Accelerate development:** Get instant code explanations, intelligent autocomplete, and contextual help
* **Debug efficiently:** Identify and fix issues with AI-powered analysis and suggestions
* **Learn as you build:** Receive detailed explanations and best practice recommendations

## Getting started

The fastest way to experience Replit AI is to create your first app with Agent:

1. **Start with Agent**: Follow the [Create with AI](/getting-started/quickstarts/ask-ai/) quickstart to build an app from scratch
2. **Choose how to start**: Try "Design & Iterate" for rapid prototyping or "Build Full App" to get a functional MVP on the first run
3. **Experience Agent 3's autonomy**: Customize Agent's **[Autonomy Level](/replitai/autonomy-level)** while it tests itself with **App Testing**
4. **Set up billing**: Configure [usage alerts and budgets](/billing/managing-spend) to control your AI spending

<Warning>
  Agent and Advanced Assistant are premium features that charge your Replit account
  based on usage. For pricing information and billing policies, see [Replit AI Billing](/billing/ai-billing/).
</Warning>

### Accessing Agent

You can access Agent from any Replit App:

* **Tools dock**: Find Agent in the left sidebar of your Workspace
* **Create new app**: Start with Agent directly from the "Create a new App" screen

<Note>
  Agent is now available on all projects. Use [General Agent](/replitai/general-agent) to work with any framework or project type, including existing apps and Developer Framework templates.
</Note>

### Key capabilities

Agent offers powerful features that revolutionize your development workflow:

**Complete app generation**

* Natural language descriptions become functional applications
* Intelligent architecture decisions and best practices
* Automatic environment setup and dependency management
* Seamless integration of databases, file storage, and third-party services

**Interactive development**

* Chat-based interface for complex requests
* File attachments and web content integration
* Rollback capabilities for safe experimentation
* Real-time progress tracking and feedback

**Autonomous development (New in Agent 3)**

* **App Testing**: Automated computer use testing for the Agent to spin up a browser and test its own work, just like a real user
* **Autonomy Level**: Customize how independently Agent works and reviews code, from hands-on control to extended autonomous development
* **Agents & Automations**: for building your own autonomous systems

## Use cases

### Build a complete app with Agent

Describe your app idea in natural language and let Agent handle the implementation:

**Agent**: Effort-based pricing that charges based on the complexity and scope of your requests

* Simple changes cost less than complex builds
* One meaningful checkpoint per request
* Extended autonomous builds with less supervision and self-testing capabilities
* Advanced capabilities like Dynamic Intelligence (High Power)
* Agent 3 features: App Testing, build modes, and Agents & Automations
