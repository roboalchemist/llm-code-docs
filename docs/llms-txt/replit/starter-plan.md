export const CoreCredits = '$25';

export const FreeDeployments = '1';

export const StarterWorkspaceStorage = '2GB';

## What you get

The Starter plan gives you everything you need to start building on Replit. Create apps, use AI integrations, and publish  your first project — all at no cost.

### Daily credits for Agent

Starter plan users receive daily credits for Agent usage, up to a monthly cap. These credits reset daily, giving you a fresh allowance to work with Agent each day.

### Monthly credits for cloud usage

You also receive monthly credits that can be used for:

* [Databases (Production)](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/production-databases)
* [Object storage](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage)
* [AI Integrations](/replitai/replit-ai-integrations)
* [Publishing (Autoscale, static)](/category/replit-deployments)

These credits reset each month.

### New faster Build Mode

Access to a newer, faster Build Mode that's improved over the previous version. This enhanced Build Mode delivers better results and faster responses when working with Agent.

### One free published app

Get {FreeDeployments} free published app whether you're using Build mode or Design mode. This published link will automatically go down after 30 days.

Your published app will include a "Made with Replit" badge that contains your unique referral link. If another user signs up with that link from your badge, you'll receive referral credits once you upgrade to a paid plan.

## Limitations

The following features require upgrading to Core:

### Autonomous Mode

Autonomous Mode, which allows Agent to work independently with minimal supervision and more power, is only available on our paid plans.

### Converting from a Design to a full app

Converting a Design to a full app requires Core. Starter plan users can create designs and deploy them, but converting to a full app with backend functionality requires an upgrade. If you want to build an app with backend functionality, you try that out by starting in Build Mode.

### Third-party connectors

External connectors require Core. This includes integrations with services like Google, Stripe, and other third-party APIs (See more info [here](https://docs.replit.com/replitai/integrations#connectors)).

### Remove "Made with Replit" badge

Removing the "Made with Replit" badge from your published apps requires Core. Starter plan users will have the badge displayed on their deployments.

### Additional published apps

Starter plan users get {FreeDeployments} free published app. Additional published apps beyond this require Core or Teams.

### Plan Mode

Using Plan Mode requires Core. Plan Mode allows you to brainstorm ideas, plan work, and collaborate with Replit Agent without editing your app's code or data.

### App Stacks

Building other kinds of apps requires Core. Choose from a variety of pre-configured technology stacks including mobile apps, automation apps, data apps, and more.
