# Earning with Replit Bounties
Source: https://docs.replit.com/additional-resources/bounties/bounty-hunting

Bounties on Replit allow you to request and pay for coding tasks or project work using a platform-specific currency called Cycles. When you have a specific need—such as developing a new product, needing coding help for a personal project, or requiring API integration—you can create a Bounty. This acts as a job posting that other members, known as Bounty Hunters, can accept to complete the specified task.

<Note>
  The Bounties program is deprecated. Replit is no longer accepting applications for Bounty Hunter.
</Note>

If you're interested in building projects and earning Cycles while doing it, you're in for a treat with Bounties.

## Browse Bounties

Each posted Bounty includes a reward in Cycles for successful completion and a description of the work they need.

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Apply to work on a Bounty

Once you find a Bounty you're interested in, select the "Apply to Work" button in the upper-right corner.

### Tips for Applying

The best Bounty applications explain to the Poster why you're a good fit for the job and include examples of your past work. Here are some additional tips for creating a quality application:

Here are some other tips on how to create a quality application:

* Add links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other social profiles to your Replit account. These links will also appear in your Bounty applications.
* Consider using a professional headshot as your Replit profile picture.
* If you'd like to start your Bounty application with a greeting, you can say something like `Hello [username]...` or `Hello, my name is [your first name]...`
* Include links to relevant projects in your application, such as a Replit App, GitHub repo, or hosted project.
* Describe the initial 1-2 milestones you plan to accomplish once accepted. This shows the Bounty Poster that you understand their problem and the technical requirements.
* If possible, provide time estimates for completing certain parts of the Bounty after you're accepted.

Here's an example application for a Bounty to create a space invaders game:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Apply a Bounty" />
</Frame>

## Do the work

If the Bounty Poster selects your application, you'll see the "Accepted" badge on your application:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Time to Do the Work!" />
</Frame>

Now it's time to do the work! Communicate with the Bounty Poster early and often - make sure you're both clear on requirements and expectations.

## Deliver the work

When you've completed your work, return to the Bounty page and select "Submit Work."

Add a description of the work (pro-tip: relate it to the acceptance criteria outlined in the Bounty) and link to the Replit App where you've written the code.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Submit a Solution" />
</Frame>

The Poster will review your work and may request changes. If these changes are within the scope of the original Bounty, simply make the updates in the Replit App and submit again.
Once the Poster accepts your work, you're awarded your well-earned Cycles.


# Bounty Templates
Source: https://docs.replit.com/additional-resources/bounties/bounty-templates

Learn how to communicate effectively during bounty projects with templates for both bounty hunters and posters to use throughout the process.

## Communication Expectations

Effective communication is vital throughout the bounty posting and hunting process. To help with this, we've provided templates that you can use to maintain professionalism and ensure everyone's expectations align. Keep in mind that these templates are starting points and can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.

## Bounty Hunter

### Upon Acceptance

After accepting a bounty, it's important to reach out to the Poster within 24 hours via email or Discord.

```
Hello there,
I'm very excited to begin working on this Bounty. I am located in <geoarea>. I usually work between the hours of <xyzxyz> and the best way to reach me is by email. I just wanted to take a moment to check in and outline my approach.
- <milestone 1> - <your expected date of delivery>
- <milestone 2> - <your expected date of delivery>
Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to working with you.
Best,
Your Name
```

### Check-ins

To ensure a smooth and successful Bounty experience, it is important to maintain regular communication with the Bounty Poster. This includes providing updates on progress every few days, as well as addressing any roadblocks, pain points, or questions that may arise. Lack of visibility into the progress of the project is a common cause of dissatisfaction among Bounty Posters. Keeping them informed will help to mitigate this issue and maintain a positive working relationship.

#### What to say when giving a status update:

```
I wanted to check-in and give you an update on my progress. Everything is going well, and I am still on target to meet <milestone 1> by <expected date of delivery>. Please reach out if you have any questions or need further information about this Bounty.
```

#### What to say when you need to change the timeline:

```
I wanted to give you an update on my timeline. <xyx> has taken longer than I expected due to <xyxyx> reasons. I have been able to determine next steps, but wanted to let you know my <milestone 1> date has changed to <new expected delivery day>. I have solved any current roadblocks and am on track to complete the Bounty.
```

### Upon Submission

Congratulations on successfully completing the Bounty! It is now important to promptly follow up with the bounty poster to allow them to review the completed work. This will provide an opportunity for them to provide feedback or request any necessary changes. Following up quickly will help ensure a smooth process and timely completion of the project.

```
Hi there,
I have submitted the completed Bounty at <link to the Bounty>. Please let me know if you request changes or have any questions about the submission. It has been a pleasure working with you.
```

### Changes are Requested

If the Bounty Poster requests any changes, it is important to respond within 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of their feedback. During this response, it is crucial to discuss a plan for the next steps and a timeline for implementing the suggested updates. It is important to approach any requested changes in a constructive manner. To assist with this process, the following are the two templates you can personalize

Example:

```
Thank you for <list the input or changes requested>. I value your feedback as it helps me become a better Bounty Hunter. I will have a revised version of this project ready for you to review by <date>.
One solution to the input you mentioned is <list the solution in a detailed, non-technical way>. Does this sound like an ideal solution for your Bounty? If so, I can have an updated version for you by <date>.
```

Example:

```
I know you are concerned about <list the concern in a polite way>. Including <list the suggestion in a detailed, non-technical way> may be an ideal solution.
I am open to revisions and willing to make changes to improve the quality of your work. If this solution works for you, I can get you an updated version by <date>.
```

## Poster

### Upon Acceptance

Once you accept a Bounty Hunter for your Bounty, you should reach out to them within 24 hours via email or Discord. Feel free to use this template if you are not sure how to start.

```
Hi <name>,
I am excited to work with you on this Bounty. You seem like a great fit for this project. Here is a little bit about me <share information that is helpful for the Bounty Hunter to know about you>.
I would like to chat with you soon to review requirements and set milestones.
Please let me know if you have any questions about the Bounty as you get started.
```

### Check-ins

Open and consistent communication with the Bounty Hunter is crucial, especially if the project is complex or has multiple milestones. This will help ensure that the project stays on track and is completed within the agreed-upon timeframe. Here are a few examples of what you can say to stay in touch with your Bounty Hunter:

```
Hi,
I wanted to check in and see how the Bounty was going. Do you have any questions about the requirements? I am happy to chat <via email or Discord> if you need further guidance.
```

```
Hello,
How is the Bounty going? Do you think you are still on track to complete it by <date>? Do you have any part of it completed that you can send to me as a sample? Please let me know if you have any questions.
```

### Upon Submission

Once your Bounty Hunter submits the Bounty, we recommend you review the submission within three days. If you’re happy with the submission, feel free to press the `Accept` button to complete the Bounty and release the Cycles to the Bounty Hunter. Send them a thank you or acknowledgment that the work has been received and the Cycles released.

```
Hi,
Just received your submission. It looks great. Thank you for all your hard work on this. <Mention what you liked about working with this Bounty Hunter. Would you like to work together again?>
```

### Changes Requested

You can request changes on your Bounty's Discussion tab. It is important that the changes you request are within the scope of the original project. Give clear expectations of what needs to be changed and ensure the Bounty Hunter has the correct resources or access to test projects if needed.

```
Hello,
Thanks for your submission! Would you be up for changing the following:
<Include specific details of what changes to make or information regarding testing/publishing of the project>.
```


# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Learn how to post and complete Bounties on Replit, including pricing guidelines, payment processes, and best practices for both Bounty Posters and Hunters.

<Note>
  The Bounties program is deprecated. Replit is no longer accepting applications for Bounty Hunter.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are Bounties?">
    Bounties are a simple way to trade Cycles for different types of tasks on Replit. If you have a new product idea, need coding assistance for a personal project, or want to integrate an API, create a Bounty! You'll be able to examine submissions and pick a developer, known as a Bounty Hunter, to complete the project, which is referred to as the "work." When you post a Bounty, Replit will deduct the required Cycles from your account and hold them until the project is finished.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bounty Posting">
    <Accordion title="How do I post a Bounty for others to complete?">
      You can publicly post a Bounty on the [Bounties page](https://replit.com/bounties). You will be asked to provide a title, description, and reward amount before posting. Your user account will also need enough Cycles to cover the reward amount before posting; you can reload Cycles [here](https://replit.com/cycles).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What types of projects are available for Bounties?">
      Anything you can think of or need for your own project. Some of the more popular Bounties we’ve seen are internal tools for your startup, features for existing Replit App (like chat moderation or API integration), websites, and bots (Discord, Slack, Telegram).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What should I name my Bounty?">
      Keep it simple and descriptive! The name should highlight what is distinctive about that particular Bounty. Try to think about what will catch a Bounty Hunter’s eye.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How many Cycles should I offer for a Bounty?">
      We offer suggestions within the Bounty creation form for certain categories, but ultimately, you decide based on your budget and the caliber of developer you want to work with.

      <ul>
        <li>
          &#x20;(250,000 Cycles) -  (350,000 Cycles) if your app needs:

          <ul>
            <li>1 external connection / API</li>
            <li>1-2 pages</li>
            <li>completion in 4-6 weeks</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          &#x20;(450,000 Cycles) -  (650,000 Cycles) if your app needs:

          <ul>
            <li>2-3 API connections</li>
            <li>2-3 pages</li>
            <li>a developer with 2+ years of experience</li>
            <li>user account creation</li>
            <li>ideal for 2-3 month projects</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          &#x20;(800,000+ Cycles) if your app needs:

          <ul>
            <li>unlimited API connections</li>
            <li>3+ pages</li>
            <li>the ability to handle your first 1000+ users</li>
            <li>ideal for 3+ month projects</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      If you can't put the full amount upfront for a large Bounty, indicate in your initial post the payment milestones that will be posted through other Bounties.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are there any fees for posting a Bounty?">
      Yes, Replit charges the Bounty Poster a 10% fee for posting a Bounty. Also, note that Replit will hold the entire number of cycles you’ve promised for the Bounty from your account when posting a Bounty.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I cancel a Bounty after it’s been accepted?">
      No, you can only cancel a Bounty *before* accepting an application. To cancel an accepted application for a Bounty, contact the Replit team through the "Contact Support" button in the "Having trouble?" section. If you want to make changes to the accepted Bounty, it's best to discuss the proposed revisions directly with the Bounty Hunter.
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bounty Hunting">
    <Accordion title="What if I want to complete Bounties and earn Cycles?">
      If you want to become a verified Bounty Hunter, you can apply [here](https://replit.com/bounties/join). However, being a verified Bounty Hunter is not required to apply for Bounties. Replit’s Bounty program is looking for experienced coders who can tackle Bounties and provide great customer service for Bounty Posters.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What workspace should Bounty Hunters use to create the work?">
      Replit provides access to private Replit App for coding the work, which is Replit’s recommended workspace for completing a Bounty. The completed work must be submitted on Replit with a valid Replit App link.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are there any fees for completing a Bounty?">
      No. Upon successful completion of the Bounty, the Bounty Hunter’s account will be credited with the full Bounty amount listed.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Am I able to cash out my Cycles into real money?">
      Yes. Cycles earned from Bounties are eligible for cash out. There is a minimum threshold of 35,000 Cycles (about  USD) per cash out. There is a 25% cash-out fee and additional fees based on your country of residence and chosen payment method. If you cash out more than 70,000 Cycles (about  USD) in a given request, then the cash-out fee is reduced to 15%.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I request a Cycles cash out?">
      Please note, a Replit staff member will **never** reach out to you in order to initiate a cash out. Only you can begin the process yourself following the instructions below. Once you have earned at least 35,000 Cycles ( USD) from Bounties, you can contact [cashout@replit.com](mailto:cashout@replit.com) with the subject line "Cycles Cash Out - username", replacing "username" with your Replit username. In the body of your email, write the number of Cycles that you wish to cash out.
      If this is your first cash out, we will send you an online form to verify your identity on [Persona](https://withpersona.com/). You will need a valid government ID and a device with a camera to complete this verification.
      After that, you will need to verify your payment information by completing the cash-out form on Replit's site [here](https://replit.com/cash-out).
      Once you have verified your identity and payment information on your Replit account, we will withdraw the requested amount of Cycles from your wallet and execute the payment. If you no longer have a payable balance of Cycles equivalent to the amount you requested, we will cancel the payment and ask you for a new desired amount to withdraw.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are [secrets](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets) included in my work to the Bounty Poster?">
      No, when the work is provided, contents in the `secrets` sidebar is not included. If the intent is to provide that information to the Poster, the parties should discuss how they would like to transfer that information.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What rights are transferred in the work upon completion?">
      All rights to the work are transferred from the Bounty Hunter to the Bounty Poster upon successful completion of the Bounty and Cycles are exchanged. By submitting a work for acceptance, the Bounty Hunter represents that they have all necessary rights in the content of the work to transfer to the Poster, as specified in our [terms](https://replit.com/site/cycles-terms).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What if I can't respond or deliver on time?">
      When accepting a Bounty, it's very important to set expectations around timelines and communication cadence with the Bounty Poster in one of your first exchanges. Some Posters would like an email or message check-in every week, and some prefer daily check-ins. Some Posters use the Bounties platform for critical time-sensitive work, and in this case, it's very important to set expectations for whether or not their intended deadline is possible. When a Hunter does not respond in a timely manner, it often causes harm to the Poster's project. Repeated failure to set and meet communication expectations with Bounty Posters may lead to suspension of your Bounty Hunter account. We understand that sometimes there are uncontrollable circumstances that cause a Hunter not to respond in a timely manner. If that is the case, we request you let us know by emailing [bounties@replit.com](mailto:bounties@replit.com).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What if I am unable to complete a Bounty?">
      If you are unable to complete a Bounty, please email [bounties@replit.com](mailto:bounties@replit.com) along with any mitigating circumstances so that we can assist you. Please note that if this happens more than once, you may be suspended from the Bounties platform.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is there a limit on how many Bounties I can work on at a given time?">
      We recommend that you don’t work on more than two Bounties at a given time. This is to prevent yourself from burning out by taking on too many Bounties simultaneously. This also enables you to give focused attention to a few clients at a given time.
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Support">
    <Accordion title="How do I contact the Bounty Poster or the Bounty Hunter about the Bounty?">
      If you have questions for the Bounty Poster, you can include them in the application form or reach out through any social media platforms linked in the user’s profile. The Poster will indicate a preferred communication channel (such as email or Discord) in the Bounty post for discussions throughout the project. If you are unable to contact the Poster or Bounty Hunter and need assistance with a Bounty, you can reach out to the Moderator via the “Contact Support” button under the “Having trouble?” section of the Bounties page.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What if I have a dispute with Poster or a problem with the work?">
      We encourage our Bounty Posters and Bounty Hunters to try and settle conflicts among themselves. If for any reason this fails, or if you encounter non-permitted usage, users can contact the Moderator via the “Contact Support” button under the “Having trouble?” section of the Bounties page. All decisions by Replit in case of a dispute are final and binding on both the Hunter and Poster.

# Posting and awarding a Bounty
Source: https://docs.replit.com/additional-resources/bounties/posting-a-bounty

Learn how to post a bounty, manage applications, and review work submissions on Replit's bounty platform to get help with your projects.

If you're familiar with other freelancing platforms, Bounties will feel familiar.

### Check Cycles

Before you post a Bounty, ensure you have enough [Cycles](/getting-started/intro-replit) to pay the Bounty. Once the Bounty is listed, Replit will hold the Cycles as a deposit until the Bounty is completed or closed.

### Post a Bounty

<Frame>
  <img alt="How to Post a Bounty" />
</Frame>

1. On the [Bounties page](https://replit.com/bounties), click the "Create a Bounty" button in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen.
2. Fill out the "Create a Bounty" form, adding as much detail as you can so Bounty Hunters know what they're applying to do.
   Write a clear title and *pay special attention defining acceptance criteria*, as this is going to guide your Bounty Hunter's decisions and will be referred to when settling disputes.
   Set the due date, your preferred method of communication, and the number of Cycles you're offering for the work.
3. Post your Bounty!

You are not allowed to circumvent Bounties by taking projects off-platform. This includes promising payments outside the Bounties system or any future promise of work outside Bounties. You could be banned permanently for attempting to do so.

### Wait for applications

Sit back and wait for Bounty Hunters to apply!

### Pick an applicant and communicate well!

Once you have a Bounty Hunter you'd like to work with, click the "Accept Application" button. This closes the Bounty to further applications.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Received an Application" />
</Frame>

Now it's your turn to reach out to the Bounty Hunter you've selected! (Be sure you're both clear on deliverables and timeline expectations)

### Review the work

When your Bounty Hunter has completed the work, you'll see the following screen that allows you to view the work. After checking out the work, you can request changes or accept the work.

<Frame>
  <img alt="View Submission" />
</Frame>

If you request changes, be sure to give your Bounty Hunter clear and actionable feedback within the bounds of the original Bounty.

*Please do not use this mechanism to add features or increase the project's scope - if you need another feature, make another bounty!*

<Frame>
  <img alt="Request Changes" />
</Frame>

Once you're happy with the work, Accept it, and the Bounty process is complete.
The code now belongs to you, and Replit will send the Cycles deposit to the Bounty Hunter.

# Google Authentication in Python and Flask
Source: https://docs.replit.com/additional-resources/google-auth-in-flask

Learn how to implement Google OAuth authentication in a Flask app on Replit, including user login and Google Sheets API integration.

Allowing your users to log in to your website using their Google account has these benefits:

1. You don't have to implement your own authentication scheme.
2. You can get users' name and contact information easily.
3. You can use the same credentials to access users' Google resources like Sheets and Drive.

This guide that will walk you through how to do that with Python and Flask on Replit.

First, we'll walk through how to setup basic OAuth authentication, then cover how to use the resulting credentials to access users' Google resources.

## Introduction to OAuth

Google authentication is based on the OAuth standard. The way OAuth works is as follows:

1. Somewhere on your website, you direct a user to a login page.
2. When they go to the login page, you don't implement the login form on your website, but instead redirect to Google's login service to login the user.
3. When Google's login service successfully logs in the user, it redirects back to your website at a predefined URL of your choosing, say `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/oauth2callback`, while sending some information pertinent to the user and the login session.
4. You use the user's login information to further obtain an access token, which is like a pass you can use to access the user's resources, like their profile information, their spreadsheets, documents and more.

## OAuth: Show me the code

If you are like me, the first thing you want is working code. The code below is what you need. However, you'll need to set up some things in your Google Cloud Console in order to get everything working. That will be covered in the next section. Create a new Replit App using the [Flask template](https://replit.com/@replit/Flask?v=1) and put the following in `main.py`. The comments in the code explains what the individual parts do:

```python theme={null}
from flask import Flask, redirect, session, url_for, request
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow
import json
import os
import requests

app = Flask('app')
# `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is used by sessions. You should create a random string
# and store it as secret.
app.secret_key = os.environ.get('FLASK_SECRET_KEY') or os.urandom(24)

# `GOOGLE_APIS_OAUTH_SECRET` contains the contents of a JSON file to be downloaded
# from the Google Cloud Credentials panel. See next section.
oauth_config = json.loads(os.environ['GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRETS'])

# This sets up a configuration for the OAuth flow
oauth_flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_config(
    oauth_config,
    # scopes define what APIs you want to access on behave of the user once authenticated
    scopes=[
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
        "openid",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
    ]
)

# This is entrypoint of the login page. It will redirect to the Google login service located at the
# `authorization_url`. The `redirect_uri` is actually the URI which the Google login service will use to
# redirect back to this app.
@app.route('/signin')
def signin():
    # We rewrite the URL from http to https because inside the Replit App http is used,
    # but externally it's accessed via https, and the redirect_uri has to match that
    oauth_flow.redirect_uri = url_for('oauth2callback', _external=True).replace('http://', 'https://')
    authorization_url, state = oauth_flow.authorization_url()
    session['state'] = state
    return redirect(authorization_url)

# This is the endpoint that Google login service redirects back to. It must be added to the "Authorized redirect URIs"
# in the API credentials panel within Google Cloud. It will call a Google endpoint to request
# an access token and store it in the user session. After this, the access token can be used to access
# APIs on behalf of the user.
@app.route('/oauth2callback')
def oauth2callback():
    if not session['state'] == request.args['state']:
        return 'Invalid state parameter', 400
    oauth_flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=request.url.replace('http:', 'https:'))
    session['access_token'] = oauth_flow.credentials.token
    return redirect("/")

# This is the home page of the app. It directs the user to log in if they are not already.
# It shows the user info's information if they already are.
@app.route('/')
def welcome():
    if "access_token" in session:
        user_info = get_user_info(session["access_token"])
        if user_info:
            return f"""
                Hello {user_info["given_name"]}!<br>
                Your email address is {user_info["email"]}<br>
                <a href="/logout">Log out</a>
            """
    return """
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <a href="/signin">Sign In via Google</a><br>
    """

# Call the userinfo API to get the user's information with a valid access token.
# This is the first example of using the access token to access an API on the user's behalf.
def get_user_info(access_token):
    response = requests.get("https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo", headers={
       "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
   })
    if response.status_code == 200:
        user_info = response.json()
        return user_info
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch user info: {response.status_code} {response.text}")
        return None

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.clear()
    return redirect('/')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

```

## Set up your OAuth App / Client

To get the above code working, you'll need to do these things in Google Cloud.

1. Create a Google Cloud project (if you don't already have one).
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen.
3. Create an OAuth client ID for your app.

### Create a Google Cloud project

If you already have a Google Cloud project you want to use for this exercise, you can skip this step.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on the project selector dropbox next to the Google Cloud logo:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Google Project Dropdown" />
</Frame>

3. Select an existing project or Click "New Project" and create an new project.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Select Project" />
</Frame>

4. If creating a new project, enter a project name, and click "Create".

<Frame>
  <img alt="New Project" />
</Frame>

If you see your new project show up in a popup, click "Select project" to make that the *active project*.

### Configure the OAuth consent screen

Now that you have a project, you can configure the OAuth consent screen for it:

1. Go to the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)

<Frame>
  <img alt="OAuth Consent Screen" />
</Frame>

2. Make sure the project in the project drop down is the one you want.
3. Select "External" to allow any user to log in to your app with a Google account. "Internal" will allow only people from your organization.
4. Click "Create".
5. Enter an app name and the email of the person supporting this app (you?)

<Frame>
  <img alt="OAuth Consent Screen" />
</Frame>

6. Enter an email address under "Developer contact information".

<Frame>
  <img alt="Developer contact information" />
</Frame>

7. Click "Save and continue".
8. In the Scopes screen, you can add the APIs you want your app to have access to. You already have access to the APIs for getting basic user information.

<Frame>
  <img alt="OAuth Scopes" />
</Frame>

For now, leave this as is and click "Save and continue".
9\. In Test Users, you need to add the email of the users you want to be able to test the app during its testing phase.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

Click "Add users"
10\. Add one or more email Google email addresses, and click "Add".

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

Then click "Save and continue".
11\. Review the summary screen. You can always go back and edit any of the steps.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

### Create an OAuth client ID for your app

This is the last part. To get OAuth working, you need to create an OAuth client ID for the app.

1. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

2. Click "Create credentials"

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

select "OAuth client ID".
3\.  Select "Web application" for Application type. Enter a name for this client ID.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

4. Now, go to your Flask Replit App. Open the shell, and enter: `echo https://$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN/oauth2callback`. The result will look something like: `https://81309e9b-c4df-48e0-a2c2-0a8d3c0e3162-00-35ppsa0tcuv6v.infra-staging.replit.dev/oauth2callback`. Copy this text and enter it as one of the "Authorized redirect URIs" in the bottom of the form

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

Later when you publish your app, you'll want to come back here to add another entry `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/oauth2callback`

5. Click "Create"
6. Click "Download JSON":

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

7. Go to your Replit App again, open the Secrets pane. Create a secret named `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRETS`, and paste of the contents of the downloaded file
   as the secret value.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Test Users" />
</Frame>

Phew! That was tedious. Congratulations if you made it through! Now you can run the Flask app and log in using a test user Google account. To make your app available to any Google user, you'll need to go back to the [consent page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) and click "Publish App". A verification process may be required if your app requires additional Google APIs like Sheets and Drive.

Next, we'll cover how to integrate with a Google API like Sheets. Follow along if you want to go further.

## Google Sheets API Setup

In order to add a Google API integration like Google Sheets, first you need to enable the API for the app. You can [browser the available APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). As an example, we'll use Google Sheets.

1. Go to the [Google Sheets API listing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com).
2. Click "Enable".

Done! That's all the Google Cloud setup you had to do for this part.

## Google Sheets Integration: Show me the code

First, in the oauth flow section of the original code, we leave everything the same, except add `"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly"` to the list of scopes:

```python theme={null}
# This sets up a configuration for the OAuth flow
oauth_flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_config(
    oauth_config,
    # scopes define what APIs you want to access on behave of the user once authenticated
    scopes=[
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
        "openid",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly"
    ]
)
```

Now, the way you access a Google API with the `googleapiclient.discovery` library is to first create a `Credentials` object using the access token, and then use the `build` function to create a callable API object. For the sheets API it looks like:

```python theme={null}
credentials = google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials(token=session['access_token'])
service = build("sheets", "v4", credentials=credentials)
sheets_api = service.spreadsheets()
```

As to how to actually use the Sheets API, I've created a couple of helper functions:

```python theme={null}
# fetch all sheets within a Google spreadsheet
def get_sheets(sheets_api, spreadsheet_id) -> list[str]:
    result = sheets_api.get(spreadsheetId=spreadsheet_id).execute()
    return [sheet["properties"]["title"] for sheet in result["sheets"]]

# fetch the data for a given sheet within a Google spreadsheet
def get_sheet_data(sheets_api, spreadsheet_id, sheet_title) -> list[list[str]]:
    result = (
        sheets_api.values()
        .get(spreadsheetId=spreadsheet_id, range=sheet_title)
        .execute()
    )
    return result["values"]
```

With the above help, we can create a POST handler endpoint that imports a Google spreadsheet like so:

```python theme={null}
@app.route("/import_spreadsheet", methods = ['POST'])
def import_spreadsheet():
    if 'access_token' not in session:
        return redirect('/signin')
    spreadsheet_id = request.form["spreadsheet_id"]
    credentials = google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials(token=session['access_token'])
    service = build("sheets", "v4", credentials=credentials)
    sheets_api = service.spreadsheets()
    try:
        sheets = get_sheets(sheets_api, spreadsheet_id)
        data_by_sheets = {}
        for sheet in sheets:
            data = get_sheet_data(sheets_api, spreadsheet_id, sheet)
            data_by_sheets[sheet] = data
    except googleapiclient.errors.HttpError as e:
        return f"upload failure"
    dirpath = os.path.join("static", "uploads", spreadsheet_id)
    filepath = os.path.join(dirpath, "data.json")
    os.makedirs(dirpath, exist_ok=True)
    with open(filepath, "w") as file:
        json.dump(data_by_sheets, file)
    return "upload success!"
```

Here is the full working code:

```python theme={null}
from flask import Flask, redirect, session, url_for, request
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow
import json
import os
import requests
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import googleapiclient.errors
import google.oauth2.credentials

app = Flask('app')
# `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is used by sessions. You should create a random string
# and store it as secret.
app.secret_key = os.environ.get('FLASK_SECRET_KEY') or os.urandom(24)

# `GOOGLE_APIS_OAUTH_SECRET` contains the contents of a JSON file to be downloaded
# from the Google Cloud Credentials panel. See next section.
oauth_config = json.loads(os.environ['GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRETS'])

# This sets up a configuration for the OAuth flow
oauth_flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_config(
    oauth_config,
    # scopes define what APIs you want to access on behave of the user once authenticated
    scopes=[
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
        "openid",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly"
    ]
)

# This is entrypoint of the login page. It will redirect to the Google login service located at the
# `authorization_url`. The `redirect_uri` is actually the URI which the Google login service will use to
# redirect back to this app.
@app.route('/signin')
def signin():

    # but externally it's accessed via https, and the redirect_uri has to match that
    oauth_flow.redirect_uri = url_for('oauth2callback', _external=True).replace('http://', 'https://')
    authorization_url, state = oauth_flow.authorization_url()
    session['state'] = state
    return redirect(authorization_url)

# This is the endpoint that Google login service redirects back to. It must be added to the "Authorized redirect URIs"
# in the API credentials panel within Google Cloud. It will call a Google endpoint to request

@app.route('/oauth2callback')
def oauth2callback():
    if not session['state'] == request.args['state']:
        return 'Invalid state parameter', 400
    oauth_flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=request.url.replace('http:', 'https:'))
    session['access_token'] = oauth_flow.credentials.token
    return redirect("/")

# Call the userinfo API to get the user's information with a valid access token.
# This is the first example of using the access token to access an API on the user's behalf.
def get_user_info(access_token):
    response = requests.get("https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo", headers={
       "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
   })
    if response.status_code == 200:
        user_info = response.json()
        return user_info
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch user info: {response.status_code} {response.text}")
        return None

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.clear()
    return redirect('/')

# fetch all sheets within a Google spreadsheet
def get_sheets(sheets_api, spreadsheet_id) -> list[str]:
    result = sheets_api.get(spreadsheetId=spreadsheet_id).execute()

Remember, if you publish the app. Make sure to:

1. Added the production `/oauth2callback` URI for to the "Authorized redirect URIs".
2. Go to the [consent page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) and "Publish App".

Hope you had a good experience, and hope you Enjoy your further advantures.


# Streaming native graphics using VNC
Source: https://docs.replit.com/additional-resources/streaming-native-graphics-vnc

Replit offers virtual network computing (VNC) functionality. VNC is a mature virtual desktop protocol that allows your Replit App to stream a native desktop to your web browser. This protocol allows native applications (developed in Python, Java, C++, etc.) to open desktop windows as they would on any physical computer.

This streaming technology allows you to work with legacy applications in your browser from any device! For example, you could run a Python-powered game designed for desktop right on your mobile phone or tablet without making any changes to the underlying code.

<a href="https://replit.com/@demcrepl/Tetris-in-Pygame">Tetris (powered by PyGame)</a>

<img alt="image of Tetris in a Replit App" />

## How Can I Use VNC?

Any Replit App – in any language – can use a virtual desktop. No changes are needed to execute native graphics programs on Replit. The VNC pane will appear when any application attempts to open a native desktop window.

## Securing Your Replit App

By default, your VNC connection does not have a password and can only be accessed from [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) since the connection relies on the same authentication used for the WebSocket. If you need to access your Replit App via the external [noVNC](https://novnc.com) client, you can set a VNC password.

Set a password in your Replit App [secrets](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets) configuration. `Secrets` is a secure place to store passwords without the fear of other users accessing your passwords. Setting `VNC_PASSWORD` will add enhanced security when connecting remotely.

## How Can I Use Fullscreen VNC?

You must have secured your Replit App as instructed above to proceed with these steps.

1. Execute the following command in your "Shell" tab:
   ```sh theme={null}
   echo $REPL_ID
   ```

<Frame>
  <img alt="image showing the echo command" />
</Frame>

2. Construct your connection URL by replacing `REPL_ID` in with the output from above: `<\REPL_ID\>.id.repl.co`
3. Open the [noVNC client](https://novnc.com/noVNC/vnc.html) in a separate browser tab.
4. Open connection settings.

<Frame>
  <img alt="open connection settings" />
</Frame>

5. Expand the WebSockets field. Enter your connection URL (`\<REPL_ID\>.id.repl.co`) in the `host` field, and leave the `path` field empty.

<Frame>
  <img alt="host" />
</Frame>

6. Change the `Scaling Mode` to `Remote Resizing`:

<Frame>
  <img alt="scaling" />
</Frame>

7. Use the `runner` username and the password configured above when asked for credentials.

# Publishing and Database Billing
Source: https://docs.replit.com/billing/about-usage-based-billing

Learn how Replit bills for publishing and databases, including outbound data transfer, compute units, requests, and PostgreSQL usage metrics.

There are three types of usage-based billing for publishing:

1. Outbound Data Transfer
2. Autoscale Compute Units
3. Requests

You can view your usage in your account [here](https://replit.com/account#resource-usage). Billing occurs monthly or once your accumulated costs exceed your monthly credits. Replit Core and Teams users receive monthly allowances for these resources.

If you need additional credits beyond your monthly subscription allowance, you can purchase credit packs on your billing page. See [Managing Your Spend](/billing/managing-spend) for more information about credit packs.

# Publishing

## 1. Publishing Outbound Data Transfer

This type of usage is billed per byte with Replit Core users receiving a monthly allowance. Only egress (outgoing) data is counted against this allowance, potentially leading to overages. In contrast, ingress (incoming) data is always free.

| Subscription | Allowance |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Replit Core  | 100 GiB   |

The allowances apply to [Static](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments), [Autoscale](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments), [Reserved VM](/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments) and [Scheduled](/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments) deployments.

See the [pricing page](https://www.replit.com/pricing) for the current price of outbound data transfer.

***

## 2. Compute Units

Autoscale Deployments are billed based on Compute Units, which take into account both CPU and RAM usage over time.

Overages are billed based on Compute Units. The granularity of the billing is down to each individual compute unit. See the [pricing page](https://www.replit.com/pricing) for the current price of compute units.

Here is a breakdown of how RAM and CPU seconds for an Autoscale Deployment translate into Compute Units:

| Resource     | Compute Units |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 1 RAM Second | 2 Units       |
| 1 CPU Second | 18 Units      |

Static Deployments don't consume Compute Units. Their billing is solely for Outbound Data Transfers beyond a [specified amount](#).

[Learn more about Autoscale Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments).

***

## 3. Requests

Autoscale Deployments also consider the number of requests made.

See the [pricing page](https://www.replit.com/pricing) for the current price of requests.

# Databases

Replit only charges for usage of [production databases](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/production-databases) -- development databases are always free and included with every Replit App. For details on development databases, see [Development Database](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database).

Replit PostgreSQL is fully managed and serverless, providing effortless high availability and zero maintenance. Billing for production databases is based on actual usage, which can lead to significant cost savings.

Production PostgreSQL databases are billed by two usage metrics:

* **[Compute Time](#compute-time)**: The amount of compute resources consumed per hour.
* **[Data Storage](#data-storage)**: The total volume of data (including historical data) stored.

You can view your current resource usage, including production database usage, in your account [here](https://replit.com/account#resource-usage).

## Compute Time

Compute time is determined by number of hours your database remains active during a given billing period. Databases are considered active when they receive requests and for an additional 5-minute period after the last request. If a database remains idle for 5 minutes, it will be suspended and enter an inactive state.

## Data Storage

Data storage is the total volume of data stored across all databases in your account, measured in gibibytes (GiB). Storage is calculated as the maximum amount of storage used per month. Each PostgreSQL database consumes 33MB of storage, even if it doesn't contain any data. This is the default storage footprint of the Postgres server.

<Note>The total storage limit for each database is 10 gibibytes (GiB).</Note>

# Additional Notes

If there's an issue with your payment method, we'll notify you. Continuous payment failures might lead to the suspension of your published apps. If this happens, please [contact support](https://replit.com/help) and update your payment details to regain access to our services.


# Replit AI Billing
Source: https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing

Learn how billing and credits work for Replit AI features including Agent usage, checkpoints, and managing your spend.

Replit AI features use usage-based billing to charge you based on what you build and how much you use our AI-powered tools. This ensures you only pay for the value you receive from Agent.

## Getting started

**All subscribers** receive one-time free Agent checkpoints.

Additional monthly credits automatically apply to AI usage:

* **Core subscribers**:  per month
* **Teams subscribers**:  per user per month

These credits cover Agent and other Replit cloud services like published apps, storage, and databases.

## Agent billing

<Frame>
  <img alt="Replit Agent interface showing chat and checkpoint system" />
</Frame>

Replit Agent uses **effort-based pricing** that scales with the complexity of your request. You pay based on the actual work Agent performs, ensuring fair pricing whether you're making small tweaks or building complex features. This same pricing applies to all Agent usage, including Plan Mode conversations.

**All Agent interactions are billable** - whether Agent responds with text guidance or makes code changes, there is always a charge, though smaller requests cost less.

### How effort-based pricing works

When you chat with Agent in "Build Mode", it creates **checkpoints** that capture completed work on your request:

* **Simple requests** (like bug fixes or small changes) typically cost less than the previous  fixed price
* **Complex builds** (like full features or integrations) are bundled into one checkpoint that may cost more than  but reflect the total effort involved
* **One checkpoint per request** eliminates intermediate checkpoints and reduces billing noise
* **Transparent pricing** shows you exactly what you're paying for each completed task

<Info>
  A checkpoint occurs when Agent completes work on your request and implements the requested functionality in your code.
</Info>

It's important to note, that in cases where the Agent performed work by answering a question or request, but didn't make code changes (e.g. in Plan Mode), there is still a charge associated with that work, even if there's not a checkpoint shown. Checkpoints are generally only shown to the user when there are code changes completed.

For detailed information about what checkpoints capture and how they work, see [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).

# Publishing costs
Source: https://docs.replit.com/billing/deployment-pricing

Flexible publishing costs that scale with your app's needs. Pay only for what you use with transparent, credit-based billing.

<Warning>
  The Teams plan is being replaced by the new Pro plan. These changes will take effect on February 20th, 2026. [Learn more about what's changing](https://blog.replit.com/pro-plan).
</Warning>

Replit's publishing costs are designed to scale with your app's needs. Choose from usage-based billing that charges only when your app serves requests, or predictable flat-rate options for consistent workloads.

## How billing works

All publishing costs are deducted from your monthly credits. You only pay usage-based fees after your monthly credits are fully used.

* **Starter Plan**: Includes 1 free published app. The deployment expires after 30 days but can be re-published. See [Starter Plan](/billing/plans/starter-plan) for details.
* **[Core Plan](/billing/plans/replit-core)**: Includes  in monthly credits
* **[Teams Plan](/category/teams)**: Includes  in monthly credits per member

<Note>
  Credits apply automatically to all publishing costs. Unused credits don't roll
  over to the next month. Learn more about [usage-based
  billing](/billing/about-usage-based-billing).
</Note>

For a hands-on understanding of publishing costs, explore our [interactive pricing calculator](https://deployment-pricing.replit.app/).

## Deployment types

Choose the deployment type that best fits your app's traffic patterns and resource needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Autoscale Deployments" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Perfect for apps with variable traffic. Pay only when your app serves requests—nothing when idle.

    **Best for:** Web apps, APIs, and services with unpredictable traffic patterns

    [Learn more about Autoscale Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reserved VM Deployments" icon="server">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Static Deployments" icon="globe">
    **Minimal costs for static content with global distribution**

    Publish static sites with CDN distribution and pay only for data transfer.

    **Best for:** Documentation sites, portfolios, and single-page applications

    [Learn more about Static Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding request-based billing

<Tip>
  With Autoscale Deployments, you only pay when your app is actively working.
  When no one visits your app, you pay nothing.
</Tip>

Autoscale Deployments use request-based billing—you're charged only when your app serves traffic. Here's how it works:

1. **App starts up** when the first request arrives (if idle)
2. **Processes the request** using compute resources
3. **Goes idle** after 15 minutes of inactivity

**Billing time:** Often just 1-2 seconds per request, even for complex apps.

### Request-based Billing Timeline

When no one visits your app, you pay nothing. When your app is busy, you pay for the compute resources used.

Here's a timeline of what happens when someone visits your app:

<p> Request-based Billing Timeline </p>

<div>
  <div>
    Instance
  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      Running
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>Requests</div>

  <div>
    <div />

    <div />

    <div />

    <div />

    <div />
  </div>

  <div>

  <div>
    <span>
      Started
    </span>

    <span>
      Stopped
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

First, the server starts up. Then, it processes the requests. Finally, it goes idle. You only pay for CPU and memory during request processing.

<Note>
  When multiple requests arrive simultaneously (like the stacked blue bars), they share the same compute resources.

  Your billing time extends to cover all concurrent requests, but you don't pay separately for each—just for the total time the server is working.
</Note>

The gaps between green bars represent cost savings during idle time. At the end of the session, the server shuts down.

### Compute units explained

Compute units measure the computational work your app performs:

* **CPU time**: Processing power used (1 CPU second = 18 compute units)
* **Memory time**: RAM consumed (1 GB-second = 2 compute units)
* **Duration**: How long your app works on each request

# Managing Your Spend
Source: https://docs.replit.com/billing/managing-spend

Control AI costs and monitor spending with usage alerts, budgets, Plan Mode, and autonomy settings. Learn strategies to optimize your Replit usage and reduce unnecessary token consumption.

You can control your costs on Replit by using built-in budget controls, optimizing how you work with [AI Agent](/replitai/agent), purchasing credit packs, and monitoring your usage patterns. Learn more about [AI billing](/billing/ai-billing).

## Optimize AI costs

AI features like [Agent](/replitai/agent) are powerful tools, but strategic use can help you maximize value while controlling costs. Here are effective ways to reduce AI spending.

### Use Plan Mode for cost-effective collaboration

[Plan Mode](/replitai/plan-mode) is one of the most effective ways to save on AI costs. When you enable Plan Mode, Agent creates a detailed plan without making any code changes. This approach offers several cost benefits:

* **Chat before committing**: Discuss and refine the approach with Agent before any work begins
* **Lower token costs**: Planning conversations use fewer tokens than code generation and editing
* **Precision targeting**: Review and adjust the plan to ensure Agent only works on what matters
* **Iterative refinement**: Get the scope right before spending tokens on implementation

Use [Plan Mode](/replitai/plan-mode) when you're exploring solutions, refining requirements, or want to understand the approach before implementation.

### Control costs with autonomy settings

[Agent's autonomy modes](/replitai/autonomy-level) give you direct control over how much automatic work is performed, which directly impacts your token usage:

* **Lower autonomy modes**: Give you more control over each change, reducing unnecessary edits and token consumption
* **Review before execution**: Monitor what Agent plans to do before it makes changes
* **Selective approval**: Choose which changes to apply, avoiding work that doesn't align with your goals
* **Reduced iterations**: More oversight means fewer correction cycles and wasted tokens

Consider using [lower autonomy settings](/replitai/autonomy-level) when working on critical code, during budget-conscious periods, or when you want to learn from Agent's approach while maintaining tight cost control.

<Tip>
  Combine [Plan Mode](/replitai/plan-mode) with [lower autonomy settings](/replitai/autonomy-level) for maximum cost control. Plan first, then approve changes step by step.
</Tip>

## Purchase credit packs

If you're on a Core or Teams plan and need additional credits beyond your monthly subscription allowance, you can purchase credit packs directly from your billing page. Credit packs have discounts when you buy larger amounts, making them ideal for covering temporary usage spikes or preparing for larger projects.

### Available credit packs

Credit packs are available in four sizes, with increasing discounts on larger purchases:

<CreditPackTable />

### How credit packs work

* **Purchase location**: Available on your billing page for Core and Teams plan customers
* **Expiration**: Credit packs expire six months after the purchase date
* **No renewal**: Credit packs do not automatically renew
* **No rollover**: Unused credits from a pack do not roll over after expiration
* **Automatic usage**: Credits are automatically used from the credit pack that expires earliest first, helping you maximize the value of your purchases

<Note>
  Your usage alerts and budgets will apply to usage after you use any credit packs you may have. If you want to limit your usage to just credits you've purchased in your pack, set any alerts or limits to \$0.01.
</Note>

## Set up alerts and budgets

You can establish monthly usage alerts and budgets for all usage-based billing services to monitor and control your costs.

### Usage alerts

Usage alerts notify you when you reach a specific spending threshold beyond your monthly credits. You'll receive notifications on Replit and via email when you hit your set amount.

For Core accounts, visit your [account page](https://replit.com/account#billing) to set up a usage alert. For organizations, you can set your usage alert via the [usage page](https://replit.com/usage) by selecting **Manage** under **Usage total**.

### Service shutdown limit

When this limit is reached, services will be suspended until the budget is increased or the next billing cycle begins. This will help prevent extra charges.

For Core accounts, visit your [account page](https://replit.com/account#billing) to set up a service shutdown limit.

### Organization budgets

For organizations, you can set your usage budget from the [settings page](https://replit.com/t/replit/settings/billing). Budgets must be in increments of .

<Note>You must have organization admin or owner permissions to enable a monthly usage limit. If you don't have access, contact your organization owner.</Note>

### Organization admin controls

Organization admins can manage AI model access and integrations from the [organization billing settings](https://replit.com/t/replit/settings/billing).

**Disable external AI model integrations**

Enable this setting to block all users in the organization from using external AI model integrations (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Perplexity through Replit's managed connectors).

Enable this setting to block all users in the organization from using Replit-managed AI integrations.

Your published app will include a "Made with Replit" badge that contains your unique referral link. If another user signs up with that link from your badge, you'll receive referral credits once you upgrade to a paid plan.

## Limitations

The following features require upgrading to Core:

### Autonomous Mode

Autonomous Mode, which allows Agent to work independently with minimal supervision and more power, is only available on our paid plans.

### Converting from a Design to a full app

Converting a Design to a full app requires Core. Starter plan users can create designs and deploy them, but converting to a full app with backend functionality requires an upgrade. If you want to build an app with backend functionality, you try that out by starting in Build Mode.

### Third-party connectors

External connectors require Core. This includes integrations with services like Google, Stripe, and other third-party APIs (See more info [here](https://docs.replit.com/replitai/integrations#connectors)).

### Remove "Made with Replit" badge

Removing the "Made with Replit" badge from your published apps requires Core. Starter plan users will have the badge displayed on their deployments.

### Additional published apps

  The Teams plan is being replaced by the new Pro plan. These changes will take effect on February 20th, 2026. You will no longer have to pay per seat on the Pro plan and it has a maximum of 15 seats. [Learn more about what's changing](https://blog.replit.com/pro-plan).
</Warning>

## Where to manage seats

Seats can be managed from the Organization's billing settings or the members page.

<Frame>
  <img alt="seat-management-members-page" />
</Frame>

## Adding Seats

Adding a seat happens immediately and you will pay a prorated value for the seat for the remainder of your billing period and get a prorated Monthly Credit. For example, if you are half way through the billing period, the seat will cost 50% of the full cost, and the Monthly Credit for the seat will be 50%. At the next billing period cycle, the seat will cost full value and the Monthly Credit will be the full amount.

<Frame>
  <img alt="seat-management-add-seat" />
</Frame>

## Removing Seats

To remove a seat from your organization, that seat must be empty. Any seat that is associated with a user cannot be removed. Removing a seat does not immediately take effect - you will have access to this seat until the end of your current billing period. At the start of the next billing period, your organization will have the updated number of seats.

### Adding members to seats scheduled for removal

If you have a seat scheduled to be removed at the start of the next billing period, you still can add a member to consume that seat. Adding a member will stop that seat from being removed at the start of the next billing period.

Learn about seat pricing and usage-based billing for Replit Teams, including how invoicing works and monthly credit allocations per team member.

<Warning>
  The Teams plan is being replaced by the new Pro plan. These changes will take effect on February 20th, 2026. [Learn more about what's changing](https://blog.replit.com/pro-plan).
</Warning>

## Replit Teams Billing

Replit Teams plans have two parts of their billing: Seats and Usage-Based costs. Both are charged at the same time on the same invoice. To see your historic and upcoming bills, visit the usage page.

An invoice will have:

* The upfront seat cost for the current billing period
* The usage-based costs for the previous billing period

## Seat pricing

Seats are a fixed fee per user per billing period. Each seat comes with a monthly spend credit, which is currently  per user per month.

## Usage-Based pricing

Visit our [Usage-Based](/billing/about-usage-based-billing) docs for more information.

## Credit packs

If your team needs additional credits beyond your monthly subscription allowance, you can purchase credit packs on your [billing page](https://replit.com/account#billing).

<CreditPackTable />

Credit packs expire six months after the purchase date and do not renew or roll over. Credits are automatically used from the credit pack that expires earliest first, helping you maximize the value of your purchases. They're perfect for covering temporary spikes in team usage or preparing for larger projects.


# Billing

Replit's billing system helps you optimize your spending on the platform.

<Warning>
  The Teams plan is being replaced by the new Pro plan. These changes will take effect on February 20th, 2026. [Learn more about what's changing](https://blog.replit.com/pro-plan).
</Warning>

Replit's billing system is designed to keep things simple and predictable. When you subscribe to a Replit plan, you receive monthly credits that are included in your subscription fee.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Starter Plan" icon="gift">
    Limited daily Agent and monthly cloud credits
  </Card>

  <Card title="Core Plan" icon="user">
    &#x20;in monthly credits to cover your development needs
  </Card>

  <Card title="Teams Plan" icon="users">
    &#x20;per user per month for collaborative development
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This means your usage up to your monthly credit allowance is covered by your subscription—no additional charges. Only when you exceed your monthly credits will you be charged for additional usage.

These credits cover all your usage across Replit's platform, including AI features like Agent, publishing, database operations, and more. Your subscription credits reset each month, giving you a fresh allowance to build and publish your projects.

Beyond the credit system, Replit provides comprehensive billing tools to help you monitor your spending patterns, set monthly budget limits, and receive alerts when you reach spending thresholds. You can configure alerts and budget limits to prevent unexpected charges and give yourself time to increase your budget if needed for uninterrupted access to your projects.

# Replit Apps
Source: https://docs.replit.com/category/replit-apps

Replit Apps help you transform your ideas into apps anyone can access, anywhere.

## What is a Replit App?

Replit Apps are cloud-hosted projects that contain code, data, and assets.
You can create, run, and publish them from a secure, isolated environment.

Replit Apps integrate with the following tools in your Replit workspace to provide
a seamless development experience:

* **AI-powered tools**: Use Agent to create, debug, and explain your code.
* **Collaboration**: Work with others in real time on the same app.
* **Publishing**: Publish your app to the cloud with a single click.
* **Templates**: Start your app quickly using preset configurations for various use cases.

## Getting started

<Tip>
  For step-by-step instructions on creating Replit Apps, see the following Quickstart guides:

  * [Remix an App](getting-started/quickstarts/remix-an-app)
  * [Create with AI](/getting-started/quickstarts/ask-ai)
  * [Build from Scratch](/getting-started/quickstarts/from-scratch)

  Storage](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage) to handle
  builder uploads and serve files and [Replit
  Database](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database) to store and
  retrieve data for your app and users.
</Info>

To learn more about Workspace tools that streamline Replit App creation, see [Workspace Overview](/category/replit-workspace/).

## How it works

When you create a Replit App, Replit sets up a private space for your project in the cloud.
As you add features and modifications to your app, Replit saves your changes
automatically so you can resume editing from any web browser.

Replit provides pre-configured environments with all the necessary components.
This lets you start creating your app immediately without worrying about
server configuration, database setup, or environment management.

Replit automatically assigns each Replit App a unique web address where you
can preview your app while you're working on it. When you're ready to share your
creation, you can publish it with just a few clicks to make it available 24/7.

## Storage Overview

Replit offers four primary types of storage to meet your application's data needs. Each storage type serves different use cases and has specific limits based on your plan.

<Info>
  Storage limits include all data stored by your app, including installed
  packages and dependencies.
</Info>

| Storage Type                                                             | Description                 | Use Cases                                            | Persistence                                | Plan Limits                                               |

# Overview
Source: https://docs.replit.com/category/replit-deployments

Share your Replit Apps with the world in just a few clicks.

Publishing lets you share your Replit App with the world using a simplified process.

<Note>
  The action of making your app live is called "Publishing." This page describes the different types of deployments available.
</Note>

## What is Publishing?

Publishing is a feature that saves a **snapshot** of your Replit App to the cloud,
where everyone can interact with it. A snapshot captures the current state of the files in your
Replit App.

When you publish your Replit App, you create a **published app**. A published app is a running instance
of your app on Replit's cloud infrastructure. This makes the app reliably available on the internet,
separate from the version in your workspace.

<Info>
  Replit's infrastructure is backed by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All
  published apps are hosted in the United States.
</Info>

Publishing includes tools to monitor your published app status and view web analytics.

Replit offers the following deployment types:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Autoscale Deployment" href="/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments" icon="layer-group">
    Automatically adjusts resources based on your app's usage.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Static Deployment" href="/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments" icon="files">
    Provides an affordable way to host websites that don't change based on user input.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reserved VM Deployment" href="/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments" icon="server">
    Provides a consistent amount of computing resources for your app to run continuously.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Scheduled Deployment" href="/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments" icon="clock">
    Runs your app at scheduled times that you choose.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to publish your Replit App:

1. From your Replit App workspace, select <img alt="Publish icon" /> **Publish** at the top.
2. In the **Publishing** tab, select your publishing option.
3. If **Add a payment method** appears, follow the prompts to add a payment method.

Replit automatically selects the best publishing option for your app based on the project type and your needs.

However, to choose a different deployment type, consider the following information.

## Choosing the right publishing option

The following video explains how to choose the right publishing option for your app:

<YouTubeEmbed />

Use the following decision tree featured in the video to help you choose:

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Key features

Publishing offers the following convenient features:

* **Multiple publishing options**: Select or update a deployment type that meets your needs in a few clicks.
* **Custom domains**: Serve your app from your web domain.
* **Analytics**: Track visitor data and other metrics for your published app.
* **Monitoring tools**: View your published app status and configuration.
* **Access controls**: Control who can see your app with a single click. Available only for **Teams** members.
* **Badge settings**: Core users can manage the "Made with Replit" badge in Publishing settings. If you published an app while on the Starter plan that include the badge, it may take a couple minutes to update your app to remove the badge after you upgrade.
* **Feedback collection**: Enable feedback on your published app to gather insights from your users.

## How it works

When you publish your Replit App, Replit creates a snapshot of your app's files and dependencies.
This snapshot is then sent to Replit's cloud infrastructure, where it runs as a separate instance of your app.
To update your published app with the latest changes, publish again to create a fresh snapshot.

<Warning>
  Avoid saving and relying on data written to a published app's filesystem. To
  store data, use a storage or database option such as Replit's [Storage and
  Database](/category/storage-and-databases) offerings.
</Warning>

## Use cases

The following examples show different types of published apps.

### Autoscale deployment: Typing speed assessment app

Let the cloud scale up resources when users take typing tests and reduce them when not in use.

### Static deployment: Solar system simulation

Learn about the planets in a solar system visualization app on the web.
This visualization renders in the browser and doesn't transfer any user input to a server.

### Reserved VM deployment: Discord bot

Run a Discord bot that helps you moderate and onboard members.
It's always online to chat with users and respond to commands with predictable pricing and performance.

### Scheduled deployment: Home automation triggers

Schedule API calls to start and stop your smart home devices at specific times and days.

# About Publishing
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/about-deployments

Publishing is a way to release a snapshot of your Replit App, ensuring that changes made within the editor don't disrupt the production build. Customize run and build commands, and connect your published app to a `<app-name>.replit.app` or a custom domain.

Replit offers Publishing for all use cases:

* [Autoscale Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments): scale down to save costs, and scale up to multiple instances to handle high traffic
* [Static Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments): fast static sites, free for subscribed users
* [Reserved VM Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments): a single VM for cost certainty and special use cases
* [Scheduled Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments): a service that allows you to schedule your applications to run at predetermined time intervals seamlessly

Want to learn more about publishing? Struggling to choose the right type?

Here's a comprehensive overview:

<Frame>
  <iframe title="YouTube video player" />
</Frame>

## What is Publishing?

A published app saves your Replit App's current state as a "snapshot" and runs it on a shared or dedicated machine. This allows you to share your Replit App with others or host a website or Discord bot with minimal downtime. Unlike publishing to the community, which doesn't host your Replit App under a domain and has a wake-up phase when accessed via the cover page, the publishing options offer different specs and capabilities for your Replit App in production.

## Why publish?

Published apps are useful for a variety of reasons. For example, you can use them to:

* Host a website or Discord bot with minimal downtime
* Separate your development environment from your production environment
* Share a snapshot of your Replit App with others

## How to publish?

Publishing is initiated from the Replit App editor. Select the **Publish** button or open the **Publishing** tool to get started.

### Environment variables

When publishing your applications on Replit, you can customize your published app behavior by using environment variables. These variables provide information about the published app environment, helping you adapt your application's behavior accordingly.

**REPLIT\_DEPLOYMENT**: This environment variable is set to `1` when your application is published on Replit. You can use this variable to determine whether your code is running in a published environment.

For example, in a Node.js application, you can check if your application is published using:

```javascript theme={null}
if (process.env.REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT) {
  // Your code specific to the published app environment
}
```

## Which publishing option should I choose?

Replit offers several types of publishing to serve different use cases. [Matt](https://youtube.com/@mattpalmer) made a flow chart to help you choose the right one (click to open in new tab):

<Frame>
  <img alt="Choosing an option" />
</Frame>

Still curious? Read on to learn more about each publishing option.

### Autoscale Deployment

[Autoscale Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments) is our most commonly recommended option. It offers both flexible machine sizing and horizontal scaling.

Autoscale can scale to as many instances as required. You're charged in proportion to traffic, and you can scale up horizontally to handle high load when needed.

It is our recommended choice for websites, web applications, APIs, or microservices.

Autoscale is the right choice if:

* Your application is a server using HTTP, HTTP/2, WebSockets, or gRPC to handle requests.
* You want to try multiple ideas without spending on applications that don't receive traffic.
* You want to be able to scale up quickly to handle large amounts of requests.
* You need our highest reliability (99.95% uptime).

Your app may not be suitable for Autoscale if:

* Your application runs background activities outside of request handling.
* Your application can't run multiple instances in parallel.
* Your application can't handle multiple requests in parallel.
* Restarts are disruptive to your application.

### Reserved VM Deployment

[Reserved VM Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments) runs exactly one copy of your application on a single VM. It offers flexible machine sizing with cost certainty.

It is our best choice for long-running or compute-intensive applications and jobs. If your application is not suitable for Autoscale, consider Reserved VMs instead.

Reserved VM is the right choice if:

* You want cost certainty.
* Your application is not a server.
* Your application does not tolerate being restarted easily.
* You require a long-running connection (e.g., bots).
* You run background activities outside of request handling.
* You require the host VM to always run (99.9% uptime).

### Static Deployment

[Static Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments) serves static content such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. There is no server involved.

This is a cost-effective way to share simple websites such as portfolios, personal sites, or company landing pages. For more information, refer to the [billing section](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments) of the Static Deployment document.

### Scheduled Deployment

[Scheduled Deployment](/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments) helps you schedule your app to run at specific times effortlessly. You can easily specify execution times using natural language, eliminating the need for complex setup procedures. As a Replit Core member, you receive  per month in credits to offset expenses, enhancing your accessibility. The specifications include a 1vCPU/2 GiB RAM configuration, an 11-hour timeout duration, and no concurrency limits.

### Persistent storage

Please note that Autoscale, Static, and Reserved VM deployments do not have persistent storage. Any data saved to the filesystem will not persist after republishing.

We currently offer three persistent storage options for your applications: Object storage, a [SQL database](../storage-and-databases/sql-database), and [ReplDB (KV)](../storage-and-databases/replit-database).


# Autoscale Deployments
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments

Autoscale Deployments publish your Replit App to cloud servers that adjust automatically to handle your app's traffic and workload.

Autoscale Deployments run on cloud computing resources that scale up and down to efficiently handle the
network traffic and workload of your Replit App. When your app is busy, autoscaling adds servers to
manage the load. When your app is idle, it reduces the number to as low as zero to save you money.

Autoscale Deployments are ideal for the following use cases:

* Web applications that handle variable workloads and traffic such as ecommerce sites
* APIs and services

<Frame>
  <img alt="Autoscale Deployment" />
</Frame>

## Features

Autoscale Deployment include the following features:

* **Automatic resource scaling**: Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic patterns to optimize costs.
* **Custom domains**: Configure a custom domain or use a `<app-name>.replit.app` URL to access your app.
* **Configurable limits**: Set the maximum number of instances your published app can scale to.
* **Flexible machine power**: Choose the CPU and RAM configuration that meets your app's needs.
* **Monitoring**: View logs and monitor your published app's status.

## Usage

You can access Autoscale Deployment in the Publishing workspace tool.

<Accordion title="How to access Autoscale Deployment">
  From the left **Tool dock**:

  1. Select <img alt="All tools icon" /> **All tools** to see a list of workspace tools.

A compute unit is a measurement of cloud computing resources based on the memory and CPU configuration of the machine.

To learn more about calculating the cost based on Compute Units, see [Compute Units](/billing/about-usage-based-billing#2-compute-units).

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the machine power configuration" />
</Frame>

## Max number of machines

Use the slider to adjust the maximum number of machines. This number is the upper limit of server
instances the autoscaling feature can assign when it determines your app is busy.

The bottom row shows the equivalent compute units, calculated by the following formula:

`Number of machines * compute units per machine`

# Custom Domains
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains

Use your domain name for your Replit published apps to showcase your app from a professional, branded web address.

Custom domains let you assign your domain name, such as `www.my-incredible-app.com` to your Replit published app.
While Replit provides a free subdomain in the format `<your-live-app-subdomain-name>.replit.app`, using
a custom domain lets you create a more memorable address.

A custom domain name can help brand recognition and trust with your app's users.

Watch the following video for a quick overview of setting up Custom Domains:

<Frame>
  <iframe title="Custom Domains with Publishing" />
</Frame>

## Features

Custom Domains are available for the following Deployment types:

* [Autoscale](/cloud-services/deployments/autoscale-deployments/)
* [Reserved VM](/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments/)
* [Static](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments/)

## Usage

<Accordion title="How to access Custom Domains">
  1. After publishing your app, navigate to the <img /> **Deployments** tab.
  2. Select the <img /> **Settings** tab.
  3. Select **Link a domain** or **Manually connect from another registrar** as shown in the following screenshot.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="Settings tab" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

Follow the steps below to set up your custom domain:

<Warning>
  You might experience setup issues if you have one of the following: - Multiple
  `A` records for the same domain name that point to different servers. - `A`
  and `AAAA` records co-exist for the same domain since Replit only supports `A`
  records. - Cloudflare proxied domain records since Replit cannot automatically
  renew security certificates for that type.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your custom domain">
    Enter your custom domain name in the text field. You can use a registered domain or include a subdomain.

    For example, `hat-tip.cc` is the registered domain and `my.hat-tip.cc` includes subdomain `my`.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="screenshot of the DNS settings" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the DNS records to your domain registrar">
    Replit generates DNS records that you must provide to your **domain registrar**.
    A domain registrar is the service that manages your domain name, such as GoDaddy or Namecheap.

    Copy the `A` and `TXT` record values from Replit and paste them into your domain registrar's
    DNS management section. If your domain registrar does not support `@` as a hostname, use your registered domain name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Add a subdomain">
    To add a subdomain to your published app, add a new `A` record with the same IP address
    in your provider's DNS management section.
    For example, if you want to add `my-subdomain.hat-tip.cc`, you must:

    * Copy the `A` and `TXT` record values from Replit to your registrar
    * Add a new `A` record with a hostname value of `my-subdomain` using the same IP address as your primary domain
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for DNS propagation to complete">
    After adding the records, you must wait for them to propagate online.
    This can take between a few minutes and 48 hours.

    When the propagation completes, your Domains tab should show the "Verified" status next to the domain name as shown below:

    <Frame>
      <img alt="screenshot of the verified domain status" />
    </Frame>

    Load the domain in your browser to verify that it works.
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Domain Purchasing
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/domain-purchasing

Purchase and connect domains for your Replit published apps directly within the platform to make your apps accessible with custom URLs.

Turn your apps into live, professional websites with custom domain names.

Domain Purchasing lets you search, buy, and connect domains for your Replit published apps—all from within the platform. Go from published app to professional web presence in minutes.

That means you can buy a site, like `my-app.com`, and have it automatically point to your app.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Domain search interface showing available domains with extensions like .com and .ai" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Domain Purchasing is available as an early beta feature. We're eager to hear
  your feedback on how we can improve the experience!
</Note>

## Features

Domain Purchasing streamlines the process of giving your apps professional web addresses. Instead of juggling multiple services, you can complete your entire web presence setup within Replit.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Domain management interface showing purchased domains and their connection status" />
</Frame>

Key capabilities include:

* **Domain search and availability**: Check domain availability across popular extensions like `.com`, `.ai`, and more
* **One-click purchasing**: Buy domains directly through Replit using your account's default payment method
* **Automatic configuration**: Your domain instantly points to your Replit app without manual DNS setup
* **WHOIS privacy protection**: Your personal information stays private in public domain records—included by default with every domain purchase
* **Custom DNS records**: Add custom A, TXT, and MX records to configure email providers and other services
* **Instant publishing**: Your app becomes accessible at your custom domain immediately after purchase
* **Automatic renewals**: Domains renew automatically so your apps stay published without interruption

## Usage

### Purchasing domains

1. Publish your app and navigate to the <img alt="Publish icon" /> **Publishing** tab
2. Select the **Domains** tab
3. Choose **Buy a domain** to start the search process
4. Enter your desired domain name in the search bar
5. Review available options across different extensions
6. Select your preferred domain and complete the purchase

When you purchase a domain, it automatically configures to point to your Replit app. Your app becomes accessible at the custom domain instantly, with no additional setup required.

You will be billed for the domain purchase through your Replit account, deducted from your account balance then applied to your usage.

### Managing purchased domains

Your domains integrate seamlessly with your published apps:

* **Automatic renewals**: Domains renew automatically to keep your apps published
* **Integrated billing**: Domain costs appear on your Replit billing alongside other services
* **Transfer support**: Move domains between Replit accounts or to external registrars when needed

### Custom DNS records

For domains purchased through Replit, you can add custom DNS records to configure additional services like email providers. The following DNS record types are supported:

* **A records**: Point your domain or subdomain to a specific IP address
* **TXT records**: Add text-based verification records for services like email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
* **MX records**: MX (Mail Exchange) records tell email servers where to deliver email for your domain. Setting up MX records allows you to use your custom domain for email addresses like `hello@yourdomain.com`.

To manage DNS records for your purchased domain:

1. Navigate to the **Domains** tab in your Publishing <img alt="Publish icon" />
2. Find the domain you want to configure
3. Select the **Edit** <img alt="pencil icon" /> icon

* **[Reserved VM Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments/)**
* **[Static Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments/)**

Currently, you can purchase domains for your personal account published apps. Domain purchasing for Replit Teams is coming soon.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    Domain purchasing includes two costs:

    * **Registration fee**: The initial cost for one year of domain ownership (two years for `.ai` domains)
    * **Renewal price**: Automatically charged after the initial registration period

    Replit doesn't charge additional fees for domain purchases. Domain registration fees are non-refundable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I renew my domain?">
    Replit automatically renews your domain to keep your app accessible. If you
    prefer not to renew, contact Replit Support during the beta period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I want to leave Replit?">
    You can transfer your domain to another registrar by contacting Replit
    Support. ICANN rules require a 60-day waiting period after purchase before
    domains can be transferred to external registrars.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I transfer domains between Replit accounts?">
    Yes, contact Replit Support to transfer domains between Replit accounts. This
    process doesn't require the 60-day waiting period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I buy domains for my organization?">
    Domain Purchasing for Replit Teams and Enterprise plans is coming after the
    initial beta period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add custom DNS records to my domain?">
    Yes! You can add custom DNS records to domains purchased through Replit. Currently supported record types include:

    * **A records**: Point your domain or subdomain to specific IP addresses
    * **TXT records**: Add text-based verification records for email authentication and other services
    * **MX records**: Configure mail servers to handle email for your domain

    Navigate to the Domains tab in your Publishing to configure these records. For detailed instructions on setting up MX records for email, see the [Custom DNS records](#custom-dns-records) section above.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What domain extensions are supported?">
    We support all common top-level domains (TLDs). We cannot support TLDs with
    special geographic or other restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is WHOIS privacy protection?">
    When you register a domain, your contact information (name, address, phone number, and email) is normally published in a public database called WHOIS that anyone can search. WHOIS privacy protection replaces your personal details with generic information from the registrar, keeping your information private while still meeting legal requirements.

    All domains purchased through Replit include WHOIS privacy protection by default at no extra cost. This means your personal information stays hidden from spammers, marketers, and anyone else who might search for domain owner details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I already have a domain?">
    To connect an existing domain to your Replit app, see our [Custom Domains](/cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains/) documentation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Scheduled Deployments
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments

Scheduled deployments run your Replit App tasks on a schedule with minimal setup.

Define a command-line operation and a schedule, and Replit runs it automatically
in your Replit App's environment. After completion, the operation terminates until the
next scheduled run.

Scheduled deployments, also known as scheduled jobs, work best for handling periodic tasks
such as checking status, sending notifications, and starting backups. They are not designed
for continuous or long-running tasks such as web applications.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Scheduled Deployments" />
</Frame>

## Features

Scheduled deployments include the following features:

* **Automatic scheduling**: Schedule your task, and Replit runs it automatically.
* **Natural language scheduling**: Enter a human-readable description of the schedule, and AI converts it into a cron expression, a computer-readable schedule format.
* **Error alerts**: Receive notifications when your scheduled task fails.
* **Monitoring**: View logs and monitor your scheduled deployment's status.

## Usage

You can access scheduled deployments in the Deployments workspace tool.

The following sections guide you through setting up and managing your scheduled deployments.

<Accordion title="How to access Scheduled Deployments">
  From the left **Tool dock**:

  1. Select <img alt="All tools icon" /> **All tools** to see a list of workspace tools.

* **Schedule description**: Enter a natural language description of the schedule, such as "Every Monday and Wednesday at 10 AM" or "March 24th, 2024 at 3 PM."
* **Cron expression**: Optionally, enter a computer-readable string that defines when the task should run.
* **Timezone selection**: Select the timezone for the schedule from the dropdown menu.

When you enter a value in the **Schedule description** or **Cron expression** field, AI translates it automatically to match.
To learn more about cron expressions, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> Wikipedia page.

### Job timeout

Enter the maximum amount of time the job can run before the scheduler terminates it. Select either "minutes" or "hours from the time unit dropdown.

<Tip>
  Scheduled jobs may run slower than in the Replit App workspace. Test the
  deployment and adjust the timeout accordingly.
</Tip>

### Build command

Enter the shell command that compiles or sets up your app before running the Run command in the **Build command** field.
For example, to install your Node.js app dependencies, you might add the `npm install` build command.

The build command time does not count toward your usage and is not counted against the job timeout.

### Run command

Enter the shell command that launches your task in the **Run command** field.
For example, to run a Python script, you might add `python app.py` as the run command.

The Replit scheduler executes the run command at the scheduled times.
The time it takes to run the command counts toward your usage. For more information on usage billing,
see the [Scheduled Deployments section](/billing/deployment-pricing#scheduled-deployments) in our pricing documentation.

### Deployment secrets

Select **Add deployment secret** to add environment variables or secrets your app needs to run securely.

If your Replit App has environment variables or secrets, the Deployment tool adds them to the list automatically.

</Accordion>

<Frame title="Static Deployment configuration screen in the Deployments tool">
  <img alt="Static Deployment options screen" />
</Frame>

### Primary domain

Specify the subdomain part of the hostname for your published app. After you publish, you can access your published app at `https://<subdomain>.replit.app`.

To learn how to use a custom domain, see [Custom Domains](cloud-services/deployments/custom-domains/).

### Private deployment

<Info>
  The private published app feature is available for Teams and Enterprise plans
  only.
</Info>

Private published apps grant permission to your app only to members of your team or organization.
This control lets you toggle whether to make your published app private.

To learn how to set up a private deployment, see [Private Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/private-deployments/).

### Public directory

Specify the base directory path in your Replit App that contains the static files you want to serve publicly.
After you deploy, the cloud host serves all pages and assets in that directory.

The default value, `/`, is the root directory of your Replit App.

### Build command

Specify a build command to run in your Replit App's shell when you create your Deployment.

For example, if you generate a static site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>,
you might use the command `hugo --minify` to generate the files and optimize asset file sizes.

### Deployment secrets

Select **Add deployment secret** to add environment variables or secrets your build command needs to run securely.

For example, if your site generator requires an API key to create your static site, you might pass it
`API_KEY=<your secret name>`.

# Static Deployment Configuration
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments-advanced

Static deployments let you control the HTTP headers, routing rules, and URL rewrites for your static website.

This guide covers the following web server-level configurations:

* [Add response headers](#add-response-headers)
* [Create a custom 404 page](#create-a-custom-404-page)
* [Define URL path rewrites](#define-url-path-rewrites)

## Add response headers

Custom **response headers** let you add HTTP header instructions to requests that match specific paths.
A response header is a name-value pair that provides instructions to browsers on how
to interact with the requested content.

For example, you can specify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to specify which domains the browser can access for that page.
To create this entry, add the following to the `.replit` file in your Replit App's root directory:

```
[[deployment.responseHeaders]]
path = "/*"
name = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
value = "origin"
```

This response header includes the following parameters:

* **path**: URL path pattern that matches requested resources
* **name**: HTTP header name
* **value**: Value of the HTTP header

You can add multiple `deployment.responseHeaders` entries to the `.replit` file.

To apply configuration updates, republish your Replit App.

#### Reserved headers

Replit reserves the following HTTP headers and does not allow you to configure them.

```text [expandable] theme={null}
Accept-Ranges
Age
Allow
Alt-Svc
Connection
Content-Encoding
Content-Length
Content-Range
Date
Location
Server
Set-Cookie
Trailer
Transfer-Encoding
Upgrade
```

<Tip>
  To learn more about HTTP headers, see

  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers">
    HTTP headers
  </a>

  in the MDN web documentation.
</Tip>

## Create a custom 404 page

A custom 404 page displays when users request URL paths that don't match any files or rules in your published app.

To add a custom 404 page, create the page content in a file named `404.html` in the root directory of your Replit App.

When users attempt to access a URL path that doesn't exist, they see the rendered HTML of the custom 404 page.

## Define URL path rewrites

You can define URL rewrites to change the URL path of a request before your Replit App processes it.
The original URL remains visible in the browser, but the server loads the resource defined in the rewrite rule.

For example, you can specify all requests that start with `/app` load the contents of the `/app/index.html` file.
To create this entry, add the following to the `.replit` file in your Replit App's root directory:

```
[[deployment.rewrites]]
from = "/app/*"
to = "/app/index.html"
```

* **from**: URL path pattern that matches requested resources
* **to**: Rewritten path, which corresponds to a file in your Static Deployment.

You can add multiple `deployment.rewrites` entries to the `.replit` file.
The server interprets the entries in the listed order and ignores duplicates.

To apply configuration updates, you must republish your Replit App.

The following sections describe URL rewrite rule constraints.

### Path matching

The following constraints apply to the `from` and `to` parameters in rewrite rules:

* Matches must be exact unless a `*` is present
* A `*` matches the remainder of a path
* A `*` is only valid at the end of the path
* When including `*` in the `from` parameter, you can include it in the `to` parameter to represent the matching section of the path

For example, if your `.replit` file contains the following rewrite:

```
[[deployment.rewrites]]
from = "/v1/*"
to = "/v2/*"
```

When a user visits the path `/v1/about-us.html`, the rewrite serves the file located at `/v2/about-us.html`.

### Shadowing

Shadowing occurs when a rewrite matches a URL path that also matches a file in your Static Deployment.
When this occurs, the cloud server ignores the rewrite and serves the file directly.

For example, suppose your published app contains the following files:

* `index.html`
* `about.html`

The `.replit` file contains the following rewrite:

```
[[deployment.rewrites]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
```

When a user visits `/register.html`, the server rewrites the request to `/index.html` and serves that file.
However, if a user visits `/about.html`, the server ignores the rewrite and serves the `about.html` file since it exists in your Static Deployment.

### Domain restrictions

Rewrites only work for requests to your Static Deployment's primary domain and can
only redirect to files within your Static Deployment.


# App Storage
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/object-storage

App Storage is Replit's built-in file storage that lets your app easily host and save uploads like images, videos, and documents.

App Storage is Replit's built-in object storage that lets your app easily host and save uploads like images, videos, and documents.
Buckets are containers for storing objects such as files. They include access policies to limit what actions users or applications can perform on their contents.

<Info>
  We've renamed <strong>Object Storage</strong> to <strong>App Storage</strong>. Functionality has not changes and your existing buckets, permissions, and programmatic access should continue to work.
</Info>

With App Storage, you can build apps like:

* **Photo sharing platforms**: Let builders upload, store, and display images
* **Video streaming services**: Handle video uploads and serve content to viewers
* **Document management systems**: Store and organize builder files with secure access
* **Portfolio sites**: Showcase work with media files that load reliably
* **File backup services**: Provide builders with cloud storage for their important files

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the App Storage tool" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Ask **Agent** to add App Storage to your app with details on what types of files your app should handle. Agent will set up the integration, create the necessary buckets, and update your app to upload, store, and retrieve files with advanced features like authentication and access controls.
</Note>

The App Storage tool lets you seamlessly share data between your
development and production environments or with other Replit Apps.

## Features

<Info>
  App Storage is powered by Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
  This means you receive the benefits of industry-leading uptime,
  availability, and security.
</Info>

App Storage provides the following features for your Replit Apps:

* **Persistent cloud storage**: Store files that remain accessible to your published app and users
* **Scalable file handling**: Handle growing data needs without worrying about storage limits
* **Cross-app data sharing**: Share buckets across multiple Replit Apps for distributed architectures
* **Programmatic access**: Upload, download, and manage files using intuitive APIs
* **Enhanced Agent integration**: Let Agent set up App Storage with advanced configurations, inspect existing setups, and generate complete backend and frontend code with authentication and access controls

Here are a few ways you can use App Storage in your Replit Apps:

* Store builder profile pictures and media uploads
* Serve product images for e-commerce sites
* Handle document uploads for form submissions
* Create file sharing and collaboration features
* Build content management systems with media libraries

<Tip>
  **Enhanced Agent Integration**: You can prompt [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent) to automatically add App Storage to your apps! Agent can now set up object storage, inspect configurations, and generate complete backend and frontend code with advanced features like authentication and access controls. Simply mention "App Storage" or "file storage" in your prompt.

  <AiPrompt>Add App Storage to my app to store files</AiPrompt>
  <AiPrompt>Create a photo gallery app with App Storage for images</AiPrompt>
  <AiPrompt>Set up App Storage with authentication for user file uploads</AiPrompt>

# Production Databases
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/production-databases

Learn how to safely manage and publish database changes in production environments.

Production databases are dedicated for your live data that powers your published Replit Apps. Unlike development databases where you experiment and build features, production databases keep your real-world data safe while you continue building, ensuring reliability, and performance.

Understanding how to work with production databases is essential for building robust applications that can evolve and scale without disrupting your users.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Production database management interface" />
</Frame>

## What are Production Databases?

Production databases are the live, operational databases that serve real users and their data. They differ significantly from development databases in several key ways:

### Production vs Development Databases

| Aspect          | Development Database                     | Production Database                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Experimentation and feature development  | Serving real users and storing business data                         |
| **Data**        | Test data, dummy records, small datasets | Real user data, business-critical information                        |
| **Performance** | Optimized for development speed          | Optimized for reliability and user experience                        |
| **Changes**     | Frequent schema changes, rapid iteration | Careful, planned changes via data migrations and rollback strategies |
| **Downtime**    | Acceptable during development            | Must be minimized or eliminated                                      |
| **Backup**      | Optional for testing                     | Critical for business continuity                                     |

<Note>
  Agent is not able to modify the production database, this restriction is in place so that your production database stays safe.

  Agent can make edits to your development database. At the time of publishing, any changes you’ve made with the agent to the structure of your development database (i.e. adding and deleting columns / tables) will be applied over to your production database.

  You are manually able to edit your production data at anytime by going to database pane > production database > My data and toggling **Edit**
</Note>

## Database Technology and Infrastructure

Production databases in Replit are built on the same robust foundation as our standard [SQL Database](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database) offering. They use PostgreSQL 16 hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech), providing enterprise-grade reliability and performance.

### Relationship to Replit SQL Database

Production databases share the same core technology stack as Replit's SQL Database:

* **PostgreSQL 16**: Industry-standard relational database with advanced features
* **Neon Infrastructure**: Serverless database platform that provides automatic scaling and cost optimization
* **Built-in Tools**: Access to SQL runner, Drizzle Studio, and visual data management tools
* **Environment Variables**: Secure connection management through automatically generated credentials

<Info>
  For detailed information about database features, connection setup, and
  technical specifications, see the [SQL
  Database](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database) documentation.
</Info>

## Making safe changes to your production database

When you publish updates to your Replit App that include database changes, you may encounter scenarios where careful planning is essential to avoid downtime or data loss.

### Non-Backward Compatible Changes

Some database changes can break compatibility with your existing application code. These changes require special handling to ensure smooth deployments.

<Info>
  You may notice a brief downtime for your published app during publishing. This downtime occurs because database changes sometimes require stopping your app temporarily to prevent conflicts and ensure safe updates. Stopping the app during these updates helps protect your data from loss or corruption while the changes are applied.
</Info>

### Common Non-Backward Compatible Changes

The following types of changes typically require careful publishing strategies:

* **Removing database columns** that your application code still references
* **Changing column data types** in ways that existing code cannot handle
* **Adding required fields** without default values to existing tables
* **Renaming tables or columns** that break existing queries
* **Modifying constraints** that could reject existing application logic

## Deployment Previews

Before publishing database changes to production, Replit provides tools to test your changes safely in a preview environment.

A deployment preview is a temporary, isolated copy of your production environment where you can test database changes and application updates before they affect real users.
This preview environment mirrors your production setup but operates independently.
It can help you catch potential issues early and ensure your changes work correctly before going live.

Testing your deployment in the preview environment is crucial for identifying issues before they impact your users. Follow these steps to ensure your database changes work correctly:

**1. Functional Testing**

* Verify that your app still works properly with the database changes applied
* Test all major user flows to ensure functionality remains intact
* Check that data displays correctly after the schema modifications

**2. Data Integrity Verification**

* Confirm that existing data has been properly migrated or transformed
* Verify that new fields contain expected values or appropriate defaults
* Test edge cases where data might not conform to new constraints

**3. Performance Validation**

* Monitor query response times in the preview environment
* Check that new indexes are being used effectively
* Verify that the changes don't introduce performance regressions

## Point-in-time restore

For production databases, you can restore your database to a specific point in time using the point-in-time restore feature.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Database rollbacks interface showing rollback options" />
</Frame>

Note that this will only restore your production database to the state it was at the time of the checkpoint. It will not restore your app to the state it was at the time of the checkpoint.

To restore your app to the state it was at the time of the checkpoint, you will need to roll back to the checkpoint using the [rollback feature](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks/) and republish your app.

## Billing and resource usage

Production databases are billed based on usage through Neon, a serverless database provider.

Neon's serverless capabilities include the following:

* Zero infrastructure setup or maintenance
* Automatic scaling to handle your usage needs
* Compute time billing only when the database is active

The database enters an idle state after five minutes of inactivity, pausing compute time billing.
It instantly reactivates when it receives a query.

<Tip>
  To learn more about this serverless database technology, see the
  <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle">Neon Compute lifecycle</a> documentation.
</Tip>

Replit provides real-time tracking of your database usage.
You can view the breakdown of compute time and storage usage for the current Replit App
or for each Replit App on your account.

<Accordion title="How to access database usage">
  To view your database compute time and storage usage for the current billing period, follow the steps below:

  From the **Replit Database** tool:

  1. Navigate to the <img alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Replit Database** tool in your workspace
  2. In the database dropdown menu, select **Production**
  3. Select the <img alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab
  4. The **Storage Used** section shows the total storage used by your database for the current billing period.

  To view for every Replit App on your account from the **Account resource usage** section, follow the steps below:

  1. Select **View account resource limits** to open the **Usage** page
  2. Scroll to **Resource usage** section
  3. Expand the **PostgresSQL Storage** and **PostgresSQL Compute** rows for details on each Replit App
</Accordion>

To learn how Replit charges for database usage, see [Deployments and Database Billing](/billing/about-usage-based-billing#databases).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Publishing Failures

If your publishing fails due to database issues:

1. **Check the publishing logs** for specific error messages about database connectivity or schema conflicts
2. **Verify your database connection credentials** are correct and accessible from the published app environment
3. **Review recent schema changes** for potential conflicts with existing application code
4. **Test your changes in a preview environment** before attempting to republish

## Removing a production database

<Warning>
  The remove action is irreversible after a retention period of 7 days. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.
  Databases have a 7 soft delete period where databases can be restored. Reach out to support if you need assistance. After 7 days, the database is hard deleted and will be unrecoverable.
</Warning>

If you no longer need a database for your Replit App, you can remove it and all its data.

<Accordion title="How to remove a database">
  From the **Replit Database** tool:

  1. Select the <img alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab
  2. Select **Remove database** and confirm by selecting **Yes, Remove database**
</Accordion>

  ```

  ```javascript importing.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you encounter publishing errors in Python, ensure you're using `replit` version 3.3.0 or above. Check your version with `pip show replit`. Upgrade with `upm add 'replit>=3.3.0'`.

  For Node.js, make sure to install the package with `pnpm add @replit/database`.
</Note>

## Using the key-value store

### Creating and storing data

The Key-Value Store works similar to a dictionary in Python or an object in JavaScript. Here's how to add data:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python basic_storage.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Add a key and value to the database
  db["key1"] = "value1"
  ```

  ```javascript basic_storage.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  // Add a key and value to the database
  db.set("key1", "value1").then(() => {
    console.log("Value stored successfully");
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Storing different data types

<CodeGroup>
  ```python data_types.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Store different data types
  db["string_key"] = "text value"
  db["integer_key"] = 100
  db["float_key"] = 9.99
  db["list_key"] = [1, 2, 3]
  db["dict_key"] = {"name": "user", "role": "admin"}
  db["none_key"] = None
  ```

  ```javascript data_types.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  // Store different data types
  async function storeData() {
    await db.set("string_key", "text value");
    await db.set("integer_key", 100);
    await db.set("float_key", 9.99);
    await db.set("array_key", [1, 2, 3]);
    await db.set("object_key", {"name": "user", "role": "admin"});
    await db.set("null_key", null);
    
    console.log("All values stored successfully");
  }

  storeData();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Use 2D arrays/lists to create table-like structures:

  <CodeGroup>
    ```python table_structure.py theme={null}
    from replit import db

    db["users"] = [["id", "name"], [1, "James"], [2, "Angel"]]

    for row in db["users"]:
        print(row)
    ```

    ```javascript table_structure.js theme={null}
    const Database = require("@replit/database");
    const db = new Database();

    const users = [["id", "name"], [1, "James"], [2, "Angel"]];

    db.set("users", users).then(() => {
      db.get("users").then(users => {
        users.forEach(row => {
          console.log(row);
        });
      });
    });
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Tip>

### Reading data

Retrieve data by referencing the key:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python reading_data.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create example data
  db["username"] = "developer123"
  db["user_info"] = {"email": "dev@example.com", "plan": "Pro"}

  # Read the data
  print(db["username"])                   # Outputs: developer123
  print(db["user_info"]["email"])         # Outputs: dev@example.com
  ```

  ```javascript reading_data.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  // First store some example data
  async function setupAndRead() {
    await db.set("username", "developer123");
    await db.set("user_info", {"email": "dev@example.com", "plan": "Pro"});
    
    // Read the data
    const username = await db.get("username");
    console.log(username);  // Outputs: developer123
    
    const userInfo = await db.get("user_info");
    console.log(userInfo.email);  // Outputs: dev@example.com
  }

  setupAndRead();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For safer access that won't raise an error if the key doesn't exist:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python safe_access.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create example data
  db["count"] = 42

  # Access with get() method
  print(db.get("count"))                  # Outputs: 42
  print(db.get("missing_key", "Not found")) # Outputs: Not found
  ```

  ```javascript safe_access.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function safeAccess() {
    await db.set("count", 42);
    
    // Safe access with error handling
    try {
      const count = await db.get("count");
      console.log(count);  // Outputs: 42
      
      const missing = await db.get("missing_key");
      console.log(missing || "Not found");  // Outputs: Not found
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error retrieving data:", error);
    }
  }

  safeAccess();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Listing and searching keys

Access all keys in the database:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python list_keys.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create some sample data first
  db["user1"] = "Alice"
  db["user2"] = "Bob"
  db["setting1"] = "enabled"

  # Print all keys
  print(db.keys())  # Outputs something like: {'user1', 'user2', 'setting1'}

  # Loop through keys and print values
  for key in db:
      print(f"{key}: {db.get(key)}")
  ```

  ```javascript list_keys.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function listAllKeys() {
    // Create some sample data first
    await db.set("user1", "Alice");
    await db.set("user2", "Bob");
    await db.set("setting1", "enabled");
    
    // Get and print all keys
    const keys = await db.list();
    console.log(keys);  // Outputs: ["user1", "user2", "setting1"]
    
    // Loop through keys and print values
    for (const key of keys) {
      const value = await db.get(key);
      console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
    }
  }

  listAllKeys();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Find keys with a specific prefix:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python prefix_search.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create data
  db["user_id"] = 1001
  db["user_name"] = "Alex"
  db["item_id"] = 5001

  # Find all keys starting with "user"
  user_keys = db.prefix("user")
  print(user_keys)  # Outputs: ('user_id', 'user_name')
  ```

  ```javascript prefix_search.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function searchByPrefix() {
    // Create data
    await db.set("user_id", 1001);
    await db.set("user_name", "Alex");
    await db.set("item_id", 5001);
    
    // Find all keys starting with "user"
    const userKeys = await db.list("user");
    console.log(userKeys);  // Outputs: ["user_id", "user_name"]
  }

  searchByPrefix();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Updating data

Update stored values by assigning new values to existing keys:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python update_data.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create and display data
  db["score"] = 95
  print(db["score"])  # Outputs: 95

  # Update the value
  db["score"] = 98
  print(db["score"])  # Outputs: 98
  ```

  ```javascript update_data.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function updateData() {
    // Create initial data
    await db.set("score", 95);
    let score = await db.get("score");
    console.log(score);  // Outputs: 95
    
    // Update the value
    await db.set("score", 98);
    score = await db.get("score");
    console.log(score);  // Outputs: 98
  }

  updateData();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Perform operations on stored values:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python modify_values.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create numeric data
  db["counter"] = 10

  # Increment the value
  db["counter"] += 5
  print(db["counter"])  # Outputs: 15
  ```

  ```javascript modify_values.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function incrementValue() {
    // Create numeric data
    await db.set("counter", 10);
    
    // Increment the value (requires get, modify, set pattern)
    let counter = await db.get("counter");
    counter += 5;
    await db.set("counter", counter);
    
    console.log(await db.get("counter"));  // Outputs: 15
  }

  incrementValue();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Deleting data

Remove key-value pairs:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python delete_data.py theme={null}
  from replit import db

  # Create data
  db["temporary"] = "will be deleted"

  # Delete the data
  del db["temporary"]

  # Verify deletion
  if "temporary" not in db:
      print("Value deleted successfully.")
  ```

  ```javascript delete_data.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function deleteData() {
    // Create data
    await db.set("temporary", "will be deleted");
    
    // Delete the data
    await db.delete("temporary");
    
    // Verify deletion
    const value = await db.get("temporary");
    if (value === null) {
      console.log("Value deleted successfully.");
    }
  }

  deleteData();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Complete example

Here's a complete example of using the Key-Value Store for a simple task list:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python task_list.py theme={null}
  from replit import db
  import time

  def add_task(title, description=""):
      task_id = int(time.time())  # Use timestamp as ID
      db[f"task_{task_id}"] = {
          "id": task_id,
          "title": title,
          "description": description,
          "completed": False,
          "created_at": time.time()
      }
      return task_id

  def complete_task(task_id):
      key = f"task_{task_id}"
      if key in db:
          task = db[key]
          task["completed"] = True
          db[key] = task
          return True
      return False

  def list_tasks(show_completed=True):
      tasks = []
      for key in db.prefix("task_"):
          task = db[key]
          if show_completed or not task["completed"]:
              tasks.append(task)
      return tasks

  # Usage example
  add_task("Buy groceries", "Milk, eggs, bread")
  add_task("Call dentist")
  task_id = add_task("Finish project", "Complete documentation")

  # Mark a task as complete
  complete_task(task_id)

  # List all tasks
  all_tasks = list_tasks()
  for task in all_tasks:
      status = "✓" if task["completed"] else "☐"
      print(f"{status} {task['title']}: {task.get('description', '')}")
  ```

  ```javascript task_list.js theme={null}
  const Database = require("@replit/database");
  const db = new Database();

  async function addTask(title, description = "") {
    const taskId = Date.now();  // Use timestamp as ID
    await db.set(`task_${taskId}`, {
      id: taskId,
      title: title,
      description: description,
      completed: false,
      createdAt: Date.now()
    });
    return taskId;
  }

  async function completeTask(taskId) {
    const key = `task_${taskId}`;
    try {
      const task = await db.get(key);
      if (task) {
        task.completed = true;
        await db.set(key, task);
        return true;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error completing task:", error);
    }
    return false;
  }

  async function listTasks(showCompleted = true) {
    const tasks = [];
    const keys = await db.list("task_");
    
    for (const key of keys) {
      const task = await db.get(key);
      if (showCompleted || !task.completed) {
        tasks.push(task);
      }
    }
    
    return tasks;
  }

  // Usage example
  async function runTaskManager() {
    // Add some tasks
    const taskId1 = await addTask("Buy groceries", "Milk, eggs, bread");
    const taskId2 = await addTask("Call dentist");
    const taskId3 = await addTask("Finish project", "Complete documentation");
    
    // Mark a task as complete
    await completeTask(taskId3);
    
    // List all tasks
    const allTasks = await listTasks();
    allTasks.forEach(task => {
      const status = task.completed ? "✓" : "☐";
      console.log(`${status} ${task.title}: ${task.description || ''}`);
    });
  }

  runTaskManager();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Use cases

The Key-Value Store is ideal for:

* **User preferences**: Store user settings and preferences
* **Game state**: Save game progress and high scores
* **Caching**: Store temporary data to speed up your application
* **Simple configuration**: Maintain configuration values across app restarts
* **Session data**: Track user sessions without complex database setup

## FAQs

### Where can I find my store?

<Accordion title="Finding your Key-Value Store">
  When viewing your Replit App:

  1. Look for the Key-Value Store icon toward the bottom of the sidebar (second from last)
  2. Select it to open the database interface
</Accordion>

### How can I access my store programmatically?

Replit provides official clients for multiple languages:

* [Python](https://pypi.org/project/replit/)
* [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database)
* [Go](https://github.com/replit/database-go)

<Accordion title="Basic usage in different languages">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python basic_usage.py theme={null}
    from replit import db
    db["key"] = "value"
    print(db["key"])
    ```

    ```javascript basic_usage.js theme={null}
    const Database = require("@replit/database");
    const db = new Database();

    db.set("key", "value").then(() => {
      db.get("key").then(value => {
        console.log(value);
      });
    });
    ```

    ```go basic_usage.go theme={null}
    package main

    import (
      "fmt"
      "github.com/replit/database-go"
    )

    func main() {
      database.Set("key", "value")
      value, _ := database.Get("key")
      fmt.Println(value)
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

### What if my language doesn't have a client?

If your Replit App is in a language without an official client, you can use HTTP requests to interact with the database:

<Accordion title="HTTP API usage for custom clients">
  **Set a key-value pair:**

  ```bash theme={null}
  curl $REPLIT_DB_URL -d '<key>=<value>'
  ```

  **Alternative set method (for safe characters):**

  ```bash theme={null}
  curl -XPOST $REPLIT_DB_URL/<key>=<value>
  ```

  **Get a value:**

  ```bash theme={null}
  curl $REPLIT_DB_URL/<key>
  ```

  **Delete a key:**

  ```bash theme={null}
  curl -XDELETE $REPLIT_DB_URL/<key>
  ```

  **List keys with a prefix:**

  ```bash theme={null}
  curl "$REPLIT_DB_URL?prefix=<key>"
  ```
</Accordion>

### What is REPLIT\_DB\_URL?

`REPLIT_DB_URL` is an environment variable created with your Replit App. It's the connection string that enables database access.

<Warning>
  `REPLIT_DB_URL` provides full access to your database. Never expose it publicly or share it with untrusted parties.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="How to access REPLIT_DB_URL">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python get_db_url.py theme={null}
    import os
    print(os.getenv("REPLIT_DB_URL"))
    ```

    ```javascript get_db_url.js theme={null}
    console.log(process.env.REPLIT_DB_URL);
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  **In Deployments:**
  For published apps, the URL is stored in `/tmp/replitdb` instead of the environment variable.
  If writing a client, first check `/tmp/replitdb` and fall back to the environment variable.
</Accordion>

### What are the storage limits?

<Info>
  The Key-Value Store has the following limits:

  * 50 MiB per store (sum of keys and values)
  * 5,000 keys per store
  * 1,000 bytes per key
  * 5 MiB per value
</Info>

Rate limits apply to all operations. If exceeded, you'll receive an HTTP 429 response. Implement exponential retry with gradual delays to handle rate limiting.

### How can I check my storage usage?

<Accordion title="Checking storage usage">
  1. Open the Key-Value Store tool from the sidebar
  2. At the top of the interface, you'll see your current usage:
     * Number of keys in your store
     * Total storage used by keys and values
</Accordion>

### Is my store private?

Yes, each store is private and isolated. Every Replit App has its own database that is not shared with other Replit Apps.

### How do I share a database across multiple Replit Apps?

<Accordion title="Creating a shared database service">
  To share data between Replit Apps:

  1. Designate one Replit App as the primary database service
  2. Create an API in this app that allows other apps to interact with its database
  3. Have other Replit Apps send requests to this API

  [View an example Replit App in Python](https://replit.com/@util/Replit-Database-proxy)

# Database
Source: https://docs.replit.com/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database

Replit Database is a SQL database built-in to your Replit App. It allows you to store and retrieve data for your app and users.

Replit Database uses a fully-managed SQL database that lets you add persistent data storage to your Replit App from the Workspace.

<Note>
  The fastest way to get started is to ask **Agent** to add a database to your app. Agent will set up the integration, create the database schema, and update your app to store and retrieve data.
</Note>

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the database editor" />
</Frame>

## Features

The Replit Database tool provides the following features:

* **Database tools**: Run queries, manage database schema, and visualize data with the built-in SQL tools
* **Time travel**: Restore your database to any **Agent** checkpoint using the [rollback feature](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks/)
* **Free storage**: Includes 10GB of free storage for every Replit App.
* **Environment variables**: Use environment variables in your Replit App to securely access the database

<Info>
  Prior to December 4th, 2025, the development database was hosted on Neon and has a few crucial differences.
  See the [Legacy Neon Development Database](#legacy-development-database) section for more details.
</Info>

## Usage

<YouTubeEmbed />

You can access the Replit Database tool directly in your Replit App Workspace.
The following sections guide you through setting up and managing your Database.

<Accordion title="How to access the Replit Database tool">
  From the left **Tool dock**:

  1. Select <img alt="All tools icon" /> **All tools** to see a list of workspace tools.
  2. Select <img alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Database**.

  From the **Search bar**:

  1. Select the <img alt="magnifying glass icon" /> magnifying glass at the top to open the search tool
  2. Type "Replit Database" to locate the tool and select it from the results.
</Accordion>

### Add a database

All Replit Apps come with a database by default. You can access it by selecting the <img alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Database** tool in your workspace.

You can integrate the database with your Replit App by asking the **Agent** to add a PostgreSQL database to your Replit App,
including details on what data your Replit App should store. The Agent will create the database schema
and update your app to communicate with the database.

### Restore your database to a previous state

You can revert your app and database to a previous state using the [rollback feature](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks/).
This feature allows you to restore your database to any checkpoint created by **Agent**.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Checkpoint rollback interface showing rollback options" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Make sure to select "Database" under "Additional rollback options" when restoring to the state of a checkpoint. This will restore your database to the state it was at the time of the checkpoint.
</Info>

### Run database commands

The SQL runner is a Workspace tool that lets you run SQL commands on your database and view the results.

<Accordion title="How to access SQL runner">
  From the **Replit Database** tool:

  1. Select the **My Data** tab
  2. Select <img alt="SQL runner icon" /> **SQL runner**
</Accordion>

To run a query, enter the SQL statement in the text area and select the
adjacent <img alt="sql run icon" /> run button
as shown below:

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the SQL runner and run button" />
</Frame>

### Browse and modify data visually

The Replit Database tool includes <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview">Drizzle Studio</a>,
a tool that lets you browse and modify data visually.

These visual tools help you avoid syntax errors and offer the following functionality:

* Filter and sort data to focus on specific information
* Export data to a file for external use
* Insert or modify row data
* Create and manage schema, tables, views, and enums

You can access these tools in the **My Data** tab in the **Replit Database** tool.

The following image shows a view from the Drizzle Studio builder interface:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image of the table structure editor" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can connect to your database using any PostgresSQL-compatible SQL client using the connection string
  found in your [environment variables](#environment-variables).
</Tip>

### View connection credentials and usage

Your database connection credentials are stored as environment variables in your Replit App.
These credentials are used by your app to securely connect to the database and run commands.

<Accordion title="How to access your database connection credentials">
  1. Navigate to the <img alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Replit Database** tool in your workspace
  2. Select either the Development or Production database
  3. Select the <img alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab (the gear icon). This tab shows the connection credentials and storage usage for your database.
</Accordion>

#### Environment variables

The following environment variables are available:

* `DATABASE_URL`: how to connect and authenticate to the database
* `PGHOST`: database hostname
* `PGUSER`: database username
* `PGPASSWORD`: database password
* `PGDATABASE`: database name
* `PGPORT`: database port

This `DATABASE_URL` can only be used by your app and even if leaked, it cannot be used by anyone else to access and modify your database.

To learn how to use these credentials in your code, see [Connect your app to a SQL database](/getting-started/quickstarts/database-connection/).

<Info>
  Because this `DATABASE_URL` is scoped to your app, your development database cannot be accessed by other apps, even ones you own or external database viewers.
  This separation follows security best practices and prevents unauthorized access to your database.

  If you need multiple Replit Apps to share a single database, you can expose it as a REST API. See the tutorial on [sharing a database across multiple apps](/tutorials/share-database-across-apps) to learn how to set up a secure database API service.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If you are still on the [legacy Neon development database](#legacy-development-database), do not share your `DATABASE_URL`.
  It contains your database credentials which could be used by anyone to access and modify your database.
  Never paste it in public places or support tickets.
</Warning>

### Security features

When you add a database integration using **Agent**, it adds an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)
that handles all database communications with built-in security.

This ORM layer, combined with Agent's security best practice implementation, protects your app from
exploits through the following features:

* **Schema validation**: Verifies data conforms to expected formats
* **Data sanitization**: Automatically cleans up builder input to prevent SQL injection attacks

## Legacy Development Database

Prior to December 4th, 2025, the development database was hosted on <a href="https://neon.com/">Neon</a>.
This database is now deprecated and all new development databases are hosted on Replit's own database infrastructure.

You can see if your development database is hosted on Neon by checking the `DATABASE_URL` [environment variable](#view-connection-credentials-and-usage).

<Info>
  If `DATABASE_URL` contains `neon.tech/neondb`, then your development database is still hosted on Neon.
  Otherwise if it contains `helium/heliumdb` then your development database is now hosted on Replit.
</Info>

The following are the key differences between the legacy Neon development database and the new Replit development database:

| **Feature**             | **Replit (current)**                                                                                                                                              | **Neon (legacy)**                                                                                                          |

# Build your first App
Source: https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/quickstarts/ask-ai

Create an interactive piano app using Replit Agent in just a few minutes.

⏰ *Estimated time: 5 minutes*

This guide will help you create your first app in just a few minutes, no coding experience required. You'll use Agent to build an interactive piano from a simple prompt.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Interactive piano app with white and black keys" />
</Frame>

## Before you begin

You'll need:

* A free Replit account ([sign up at replit.com](https://replit.com))
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

<Note>This tutorial uses Agent, which is included in the free Starter plan with daily credits. No credit card required.</Note>

## Build your piano

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with an idea">
    **Agent** is Replit's AI that builds apps from natural language. You describe what you want, and Agent writes the code, designs the interface, and creates a working app.

    To communicate with Agent, you write a **prompt** - a text instruction describing what you want to build. Be specific about what you want to build, how you want it to look, and how it will work.

    <PromptAnatomy />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    Select **Start** below to open [Replit](https://replit.com) and start building.

    <AgentInput />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent builds your piano">
    Agent will set up your app and start building. You'll see real-time updates in the **Progress** tab as Agent creates your piano.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Progress tab showing Agent building the piano in real-time" />
    </Frame>

    When Agent finishes, it will show you what it built. The process takes about five minutes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Play your piano">
    Once Agent completes, navigate to the **Preview** tab to see and interact with your piano.

    Click the keys to hear them play and see the realistic press-down animation.

    <Frame>
      <video />
    </Frame>

    <Note>Your piano design might look slightly different since Agent can generate varied results from the same prompt.</Note>

    ### Try playing a tune

    Use the note names shown on your piano to play "Mary Had a Little Lamb":

    ```
    E D C D E E E
    D D D
    E G G
    E D C D E E E D D E D C
    ```

    Click the keys labeled with these note names to play the tune.

    ### Stretch goal: Add recording

    Want to take it further? Ask Agent to add a record button so you can capture your melody and play it back. Try prompting: "Add a record button that lets me record what I play and a play button to hear it back."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Continue your journey

Now that you've built your first app, here's what to try next:

* **Build something new**: Try creating a game, drawing app, or anything you can imagine with [Agent](/replitai/agent)
* **Share with friends**: Publish your piano so others can play it. Learn how in [Replit Deployments](/category/replit-deployments)
* **Keep learning**: Learn about [App Mode vs Design Mode](/tutorials/design-vs-build-mode#design-vs-build-mode) to understand when to use each


# Replit App in ChatGPT
Source: https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/quickstarts/build-in-chatgpt

Learn how to build a Replit App directly from ChatGPT.

⏰ *Estimated time: 5 minutes*

Learn how to build Replit Apps directly from ChatGPT using the Replit integration. This integration brings Replit's development environment into your ChatGPT workflow, letting you:

* Create full-stack applications from natural language descriptions
* Bootstrap projects without leaving ChatGPT
* Seamlessly transition to Replit for further development

## ChatGPT Apps

Replit is the fastest way to turn your ideas into a live app, and now you can do it without leaving ChatGPT.

Apps in ChatGPT let you connect external tools and services directly into the conversation. Instead of switching between tabs or copying context around, you can ask ChatGPT to take action inside the tools you already use.

The Replit app allows you to create and bootstrap real applications directly from ChatGPT, with the code living in your Replit Workspace.

Follow the steps below to build your first Replit App in ChatGPT, or try it now by clicking the button below.

<Card title="Try it now" icon="rocket" href="https://chatgpt.com?prompt=build+me+a+cool+app+with+%40replit">
  Build an app with Replit directly in ChatGPT
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a conversation in ChatGPT">
    Start a new conversation or continue an existing one in ChatGPT.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe what you want to build and invoke @Replit">
    In the chat input, describe your app idea and mention `@Replit` to invoke the Replit app.

    Example prompt:

    ```text theme={null}
    Create a beautiful app to split my restaurant bill @Replit
    ```

    <Frame>
      <img alt="ChatGPT conversation with a prompt to create a bill splitting app using @Replit" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="ChatGPT creates the project directly in Replit">
    ChatGPT will use the Replit app to create your project. You'll see the app being generated in real-time.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="ChatGPT planning the app structure" />
    </Frame>

    <Frame>
      <img alt="ChatGPT executing and building the app in Replit" />

## Share a database across multiple Replit Apps

If you need multiple Replit Apps to share a single database, you can expose it as a REST API. This approach allows other applications or services to securely access and manipulate database data through standardized HTTP requests.

See the tutorial on [sharing a database across multiple apps](/tutorials/share-database-across-apps) for a complete guide on setting up a secure database API service using the Database API Example template.

## Explore

Try the tasks in the following sections to learn how **Agent**,
Replit's AI-powered tool, can help you build your app.

Agent specializes in building projects from scratch and making changes to a Replit App. Use [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) for quick, targeted edits.

<Note>
  Agent relies on popular AI models and occasionally produces
  results that don't fulfill your request. If you encounter issues, follow up
  with a prompt that describes the error messages or the incorrect behavior.
  Alternatively, you can use the Rollback feature to restore your Replit App to
  a previously known working state.
</Note>

The following sections show examples of using Agent to enhance this Remix.

### Add a feature using Agent

<Tip>
  Agent is now available on all projects, including Remixes. Use [General Agent](/replitai/general-agent) to work with any framework or project type.
</Tip>

Follow these steps to add a complex feature to your Remix using Agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Craft a prompt">
    Navigate to the **Agent** tab.

    Enter the following prompt in the text area:

    ```text theme={null}
    Add a button that toggles an autopilot flyby mode.
    ```

    After you submit the prompt, Agent might pause and ask for clarification or confirmation. Respond in the text area.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the feature">
    Navigate to the **Preview** tab to see Agent's updates to the visualization.

    Try toggling the added autopilot button.

    Since the initial prompt excluded information such as speed and position of the flyby, the result might not
    match your expectations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine the feature">
    If the feature differs from your expectations, continue the conversation by entering the following prompt
    in the **Agent** text area:

    ```text theme={null}
    Change the autopilot to slowly and continuously fly between planets.
    ```

    After Agent completes the feature, the **Preview** might resemble the following image:

    <Frame>
      <img alt="image of the Remix button on the Replit App page" />
    </Frame>

    To undo these changes, select **Rollback to here** in the Checkpoint created immediately
    after starting the plan for the change in the **Agent** tab.

    Learn more about [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add a feature using Fast mode

Follow these steps to add a quick enhancement to your Remix using [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Craft a prompt">
    Switch to [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) and enter the following prompt:

    ```text theme={null}
    Add a button that changes the planet orbit speeds to 0.5x, 1x, and 2x.
    ```

    After you submit the prompt, Agent describes the changes it wants to make and lets you review the code changes before proceeding.

## Billing and credits

Work done by Replit in ChatGPT is billed as Replit Agent usage in your Replit account.

<Accordion title="How billing works">
  * **Core** and **Teams** plans include monthly credits that cover Agent, publishing, and databases up to your allowance
  * You can buy **credit packs** ($100, $300, $500, $1,000 with discounts on larger packs) that expire after six months and do not auto‑renew—ideal for launch spikes or experiments
  * Use **usage alerts** and **budget limits** in Replit's billing settings to cap spend

  Learn more in the [AI billing documentation](/billing/ai-billing).
</Accordion>

## Current limitations

Currently, the Replit app in ChatGPT:

* Can only work on the app created in that specific conversation
* Cannot open or modify:
  * Apps created in other ChatGPT threads
  * Apps you built directly in Replit

Feature parity with the full Replit experience (databases, secrets management, more advanced workspace controls) is coming later.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Replit not appearing in Browse apps">
  If you don't see Replit in **Browse apps**, check:

  * Whether apps are available in your region
  * Whether your workspace admin has enabled the Replit app (Business/Enterprise/Edu)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build failures">
  If builds fail, open the app in Replit:

  * Check usage and billing
  * Use checkpoints and rollbacks to revert
  * Ask Agent for help directly in the Workspace
</Accordion>

# App Storage Python SDK
Source: https://docs.replit.com/reference/object-storage-python-sdk

The Replit App Storage Client is the official Python SDK for managing interactions with Replit App Storage. This lets you programmatically copy, delete, upload, and download objects within Replit App Storage buckets.

This reference guide explains the `Client` class from the `replit-object-storage-python` package and provides code examples for its class methods.

## Client

The `Client` class manages interactions with Replit App Storage. This class features methods for performing operations on objects in a bucket.

To import the class from the `replit.object_storage` package, add the following line to your Python code:

```python theme={null}
from replit.object_storage import Client
```

Use the following code to create a `Client` instance that interacts with Replit App Storage:

```python theme={null}
client = Client()
```

<Tip>
  If your app uses multiple buckets, create one `Client` instance per bucket.
</Tip>

### \_\_init\_\_

The `init` method initializes an instance of the Client class.

```python theme={null}
def __init__(bucket_id: Optional[str] = None)
```

**Argument**:

* `bucket_id` (Optional\[str]): The ID of the bucket the client manages. When omitted, the Client uses the default bucket associated with the Replit App or Deployment.

### copy

The `copy` method copies an object within the same bucket. If an object exists in the same location, it overwrites the original.

```python theme={null}

# Collaboration
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-app/collaborate

One of the great parts about Replit is that _everything_ you make can be shared with the world. Since your code is hosted in the cloud, it's as simple as one click!

There are a few ways to share your Replit App, we'll cover them here.

## Collaborate in real time (Join Links)

<Warning>
  * Join links **grant edit access** to your Replit App, so be careful who you share them with.
  * Join links **share secrets** stored in the "Secrets" pane.
    For sharing a Replit App as you would a Repo or other code, take a look at [making your Replit App public.](#make-your-repl-public)
</Warning>

To collaborate with your friends on your Replit App, you can create a Join Link. Join Links create a unique URL that you can share with others. When they click the link, they'll be taken to your Replit App and can start coding with you in real time.

Join Links are **private** by default, so only people with the link can access your Replit App.

If you accidentally share your link with someone you didn't mean to, you can always regenerate a new one. to create a new join link, click the "Invite" button in the top right corner of your Replit App.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create a Join Link" />
</Frame>

Simply toggle the Join Link to "On" and copy the resulting URL. When your friends with an active Replit account navigate to that URL, they'll be able to edit your Replit App in real time.

You'll also receive a notification when someone joins your Replit App.

## Make your Replit App Public

<Note>
  Making your Replit App public *will not* expose any secrets you've saved in the "Secrets" pane. *However*, it will expose any code you've written, so be careful about sharing sensitive information.
</Note>

Head over to your Replit App and click the name in the top left corner. This will open up the settings for your Replit App.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Click Replit App Name" />
</Frame>

Now, you can toggle the Replit App to be public or private.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Make Replit App Public" />
</Frame>

Making your Replit App public will allow anyone to view your code and run your project. It creates a unique URL that you can share with anyone, like this: [https://replit.com/@replit/Python?v=1](https://replit.com/@replit/Python?v=1).

## Share your app in the Gallery

Once you've made your Replit App public, you can share it with the broader Replit community through the [Replit Gallery](http://replit.com/gallery). The Gallery is the perfect place to showcase your projects, get feedback from other developers, and discover amazing apps built by the community.

To share your app in the Gallery, simply make sure your Replit App is public (following the steps above) and visit [replit.com/gallery](http://replit.com/gallery) to submit your project. This will help others discover your work and potentially inspire new collaborations.


# Replit App Configuration
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-app/configuration

Learn how to configure your Replit App using .replit and replit.nix files to manage dependencies, run commands, environment variables, and deployment settings.

Replit App are configured with two files: the `.replit` and `replit.nix`. They affect how your Replit App behaves, from code execution to development tools and languages.

These configuration files are hidden by default. Show them in your Replit App by selecting "Show hidden files" from the filetree menu.

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

## `replit.nix` file

Replit uses `Nix` to manage packages and environments. The `replit.nix` file is used for:

**Specifying system dependencies:** Define exactly what software packages your Replit App requires, managed through Nix, a package manager.

**Creating reproducible environments:** Ensure your development environment is consistent and reproducible, ideal for collaborative projects and testing across multiple systems.

You can manage Nix packages visually through the `Dependencies` tool. Learn more in the [System Dependencies](/replit-workspace/dependency-management#system-dependencies) guide.

To configure packages with the `replit.nix` file, you can list [Nix packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages) in the `deps` array, prefixed with `pkgs.`. Any changes will be synced after your shell is reloaded.

```nix theme={null}
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.nodejs-19_x
    pkgs.nodePackages.typescript-language-server
    pkgs.yarn
    pkgs.replitPackages.jest
  ];
}
```

## `.replit` file

The `.replit` file controls your Replit App's behavior. It uses the `toml` [configuration format](https://toml.io/en/). Here are some of the key aspects that can be configured:

**Run command:** Specify the command that executes when the Run button is selected. Each template has a default run command to allow code execution immediately. For more customized and complex apps, use [Workflows](../replit-workspace/workflows.md).

**Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Provides features like auto-complete, code navigation, code highlighting, and real-time linting and errors.

**Environment variables:** Set and manage environment variables essential for your applications to run correctly.

**Dependencies and packages:** Manage package installations and configurations directly through the `.replit` file, ensuring your Replit App has all the necessary tools ready upon startup. You can manage dependencies visually through the `Dependencies` tool. Learn more in the [System Modules](../replit-workspace//dependency-management.md#advanced-configuration) guide.

For Python applications, the default `.replit` file looks like:

```toml theme={null}
entrypoint = "main.py"
modules = ["python-3.10:v18-20230807-322e88b"]

[nix]
channel = "stable-23_05"

[unitTest]
language = "python3"

[gitHubImport]
requiredFiles = [".replit", "replit.nix"]

[deployment]
run = ["python3", "main.py"]
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
```

The following table provides a view of each setting within the `.replit` file, explaining what each configuration does and its impact on the Replit App environment.

Now that you have an idea of the default configurations of the `.replit` file use the next sections to understand how to configure basic and advanced settings for your Replit App.

## Configuring basic settings

### Entrypoint

This is the main file of your project. If you do not define a `run` property, `entrypoint` is the file that gets executed by the runtime.

```toml theme={null}
entrypoint = "<file-name>.py"
```

### `Run` command

The `run` property in the `.replit` file is a key feature that determines the initial command or series of commands executed when the `Run` button is selected in a Replit environment. The `Run` command can be specified either as a string representing the command to execute, or an array of strings representing the command and individual arguments to that command.

Some common ways to configure the `Run` command:

* **Single command:**
  This example shows how to pass single command to execute directly in the Replit App. With this in your `.replit` file, pressing the `Run` button will display a greeting in the `Console` pane:
  **Example:** `run = "echo 'Hello, Replit!'"`

* **Explicit arguments:**
  In some situations it may be beneficial to be more explicit, avoiding the need for parsing quotes or shell interpolation rules. We can rewrite the above example to separate the arguments.
  Note, we no longer need both `'` and `"`, since we are explicitly passing the greeting as the first and only argument to `echo`:
  **Example:** `run = ["echo", "Hello, Replit!"]`

* **Multiple commands:**
  This example shows how to run multiple processes, such as a frontend and a backend, simultaneously. This could be useful if developing a python backend and a typescript frontend, where each server binds to a different port:
  **Example:** `run = "python -m app & npm run start & wait"`

#### Process management

While multiple commands can be simultaneously run with `&`, you may want a better experience distinguishing logs between services. You can [add system dependencies](/replit-workspace/dependency-management#system-dependencies) like [`process-compose`](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose) to better orchestrate multiple processes.

#### `Build` phase

For some languages or runtimes, there is a separate compilation phase before code can be `run`. This covers both compiled languages like TypeScript, Golang, or Java, or offering a parameter you can use to reset your environment, data, or configuration before the next `run` is invoked.

* **Compiling:**
  In a TypeScript repository, you may find yourself needing to run `tsc` prior to executing your code.
  **Example:**

```toml theme={null}
build = "tsc app.ts"
run = "node app.js"
```

#### Including environment variables

To supply environment variables to your service before execution, you can expand the `run` property into a [table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#table).

This is a more involved change, and likely requires moving where your `run = "..."` property is located inside your `.replit` file.

The following diff shows supplying the command by way of `[run]`'s `args`, as well as the variable `NAME` supplied in `[run.env]`:

```diff theme={null}
-run = ["bash", "-c", "echo \"Hello, $NAME!\""]

 modules = ["nodejs-20"]

 hidden = [".pythonlibs"]

+# We need to move our new [run] down past all the
+# top-level properties that do not start with a `[`!
+[run]
+args = ["bash", "-c", "echo \"Hello, $NAME!\""]
+
+[run.env]
+NAME="Replit"

 [nix]
 channel = "stable-23_11"
```

#### Interactivity

Interactive programs can also be launched by way of the `Run` button, offering a way to distinguish your development environment from the terminal where your program is running.
Consider the following tally script:

**Example**

```toml theme={null}
[run]
args = ["bash", "-c", """
count=0
while read -p "$PROMPT" -r next && [ -n "$next" ]; do
    count=$((count+next))
done
echo "The numbers you entered sum to $count!"
"""]

[run.env]
PROMPT = "Next number ([Enter] to end): "
```

## Advanced configuration options

Explore the detailed configuration options available for your Replit App. You can customize your development environment, manage run commands, integrate language services, and handle dependencies.

| **Configuration** | **Key**                             | **Value/Example**                           | **Description**                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onBoot            | <a name="onBoot" />`onBoot`         | `onBoot = "npm install"`                    | Command that executes when the Replit App boots up.                              |
| compile           | <a name="compile" />`compile`       | (No default example)                        | Command that runs before the `run` command, used in compiled languages like C++. |
| language          | <a name="language" />`language`     | `language = "javascript"`                   | Specifies the language during a GitHub import or when creating a Replit App.     |
| entrypoint        | <a name="entrypoint" />`entrypoint` | `entrypoint = "index.js"`                   | Main file to run and display when opening the editor.                            |
| hidden            | <a name="hidden" />`hidden`         | `hidden = [".config", "package-lock.json"]` | Files or folders to hide by default in the side file tree.                       |
| audio             | <a name="audio" />`audio`           | `audio = true`                              | Enables System-Wide Audio when set to `true`.                                    |

### Notes about System-Wide Audio

When setting `audio = true` in your `.replit` file, you may need to run `kill 1` in a shell to force the new setting to take effect.

When running a graphical application, you will see a pair of headphones with a checkbox in the lower right of the `Output` pane.
Due to browser restrictions, this will need to be enabled every time you refresh.

```toml theme={null}
# Ensure this is at the top of your `.replit` file, outside of any `[`-bracketed section
audio = true
```

## Packager configuration

| **Configuration** | **Key**                                           | **Value/Example**                             | **Description**                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

* **Enhanced validation**: Improved compatibility checking for complex projects

## Error handling

If an import fails, you'll receive specific error messages indicating the issue:

* **Compatibility errors**: The project structure may have issues that need to be resolved
* **Access errors**: Unable to access the source project or repository
* **Processing errors**: Technical issues during conversion

<Info>
  If you encounter persistent import issues, check that your source project is
  publicly accessible or that you have proper permissions.
</Info>

## Best practices

### Preparing for import

* **Clean project structure**: Ensure your source project has a clear, organized structure
* **Remove sensitive data**: Remove API keys, credentials, and sensitive information before import
* **Document dependencies**: Include clear documentation of external dependencies
* **Test functionality**: Verify your source project works correctly before importing

### After import

* **Review generated code**: Check the imported code for accuracy and completeness
* **Test functionality**: Thoroughly test all features in the Replit environment
* **Check secrets**: Agent will help you add secrets, but be sure to double check them and add any missing ones using [Replit's Secret](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets) management.
* **Recreate databases**: If your project uses databases, recreate them using the [Database tool](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/sql-database) or by asking Agent to help you.

## Billing

<Note>
  Import processing may consume Agent credits depending on the complexity of the
  migration and Agent involvement.
</Note>

Imports that require Agent assistance for migration or setup will consume credits based on the amount of processing required. Simple imports may complete without more charges beyond your standard Replit usage.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Import validation fails**

* Verify your source project uses supported frameworks and technologies
* Check that all required files are present and accessible
* Ensure your project follows standard conventions for your platform

**Import takes too long**

* Large or complex projects may require extended processing time
* Monitor the progress screen for status updates
* Contact support if processing exceeds expected time frames

**Generated code doesn't work as expected**

* Review the imported code for missing dependencies or configurations
* Use Agent to help debug and resolve any issues
* Check that all external services and APIs are properly configured

# Dependency Management
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/dependency-management

Replit supports a variety of languages and dependency management systems through the Dependencies tool. This section will cover the different types of dependencies and how to manage them in your Replit App.

## Imported Packages

Packages imported directly from your code are managed in the `Imports` tab. This tab allows you to view and manage the packages grouped by language. Links are also provided to the appropriate packager file, such as `package.json` for Node.js.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Imports tab for a project using Node.js and Python" />
</Frame>

### Search and add packages

Clicking on `Add new package` will allow you to search for and install new packages. The language dropdown provides quick access between packagers.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Node.js package search for 'React'" />
</Frame>

You can view installation progress and relevant errors in the `Console` tab.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Example console output for an uninstalled package" />
</Frame>

### The Universal Package Manager

Replit will install most packages using [the universal package manager](https://blog.replit.com/packager). To see which languages and package managers are supported, please check out [UPM: Supported Languages](https://github.com/replit/upm/#supported-languages).

If you prefer using the CLI, you can still use language-specific package managers such as `poetry` or `npm`. Any changes to the packager files will be reflected in the `Dependencies` tool, but require the respective CLI command or using the **Run** button to properly update.

### Import guessing

As your code evolves, we analyze your project for missing dependencies and automatically guess what needs to be installed to get your code to run. For example, if you add `import flask` to `main.py`, the next time you select **Run**, you'll see a section in the **Console** indicating that the latest version of **Flask** is being installed:

<Frame>
  <img alt="upm output showing packages being installed" />
</Frame>

### Guessing failures

This section helps you with the command to run a particular version of your package. If there's a particular version that you need, or we guessed the wrong package entirely, you can run `upm` in the shell to resolve the conflict:

```bash theme={null}
upm add 'flask==2.3.3'
```

To install additional packages in your Workspace, open a new tab by selecting the **+** sign and searching for **Packages**. Select the packages of your choice and select **Install**. Additional options for package guessing can be configured in the [.replit](/replit-app/configuration#replit-file) file.

### Python package managers

When you create a Python Replit App, your package manager will be **poetry** by default. This means that you will not be able to use `pip install` to manage dependencies manually. Instead of running `pip install <package>`, you can instead run `poetry add <package>` or `upm add <package>`, which will do the same thing.

`pip` is one of the earliest, and consequently most popular, package managers for Python. You can use `pip` as your Replit App's package manager instead of `poetry`.
Follow the steps below:

1. In the Tools pane, select the **Shell** tab to add the common `requirements.txt` file using the following command:

```bash theme={null}
touch requirements.txt
```

2. Delete the `poetry.lock` file.

3. Move your dependencies from `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` to `requirements.txt`. Note that the `flask = "^3.0.2"` in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section would become `flask>=3.0.2,<4` in `requirements.txt`.

4. Finally, delete the other `[tool.poetry...]` sections from `pyproject.toml`.

After the above changes, the packaging infrastructure will use `pip` for all future operations.

Now, as you add code to your `main.py` file, any time you select **Run**, [upm](https://github.com/replit/upm/) will determine whether there are any missing packages for your imports, find the latest versions of packages that provide those imports, and install them automatically.

## Advanced Configuration

Replit supports all programming languages through integration with [Nix](https://nixos.org/). Nix is a tool for managing software packages and system configurations. The **System (Advanced)** tab provides quick access to Nix support for your Replit App.

<Frame>
  <img alt="System (Advanced) tab for a project using Node.js and Python" />
</Frame>

### System Modules

Modules combine support for programming languages, formatters, and packagers. These provide the foundation for your Replit App. If you create a Replit App from a template or GitHub repository, we will automatically install the modules that are required for the languages used.

If you want to start with a blank Replit App, you will need to install a module under **System Modules** before you can use the **Imports** tab. You can also add more modules to support additional languages.

You can further customize modules and other Nix settings using the [.replit](replit-app/configuration#replit-file) file.

### System Dependencies

If you need more specific support for a language or other system-level dependencies, you can add [Nix packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages) under **System Dependencies**. These can also be managed in your [replit.nix](/replit-app/configuration#replit-nix-file) file.


# Keyboard Shortcuts
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/keyboard-shortcuts

Learn how to view, add, and modify keyboard shortcuts that can boost your productivity in Replit.

Keyboard shortcuts let you run commands, modify text, and navigate the workspace
using configurable key combinations. You can set and use keyboard shortcuts in
the Replit.com web app and desktop app.

## Viewing keyboard shortcuts

<Info>
  The Replit.com web app and desktop apps keep separate shortcut preferences. Changes in one environment don't affect the other.
</Info>

To view your keyboard shortcut settings, follow these steps:

1. Open a Replit App to navigate to the workspace.
2. Open the <img alt="gear icon" /> **User Settings** tab from <img alt="all tools icon" /> **All tools** in the dock.
   Alternatively, search for "User Settings" using the <img alt="magnifying glass icon" /> magnifying glass.
3. Select the **Keyboard shortcuts** tab to view the list of commands and their assigned shortcuts.

## Customizing keyboard shortcuts

To add or modify a keyboard shortcut, follow these steps:

1. Select <img alt="plus icon" />**Add shortcut**, located next
   to the unassigned command, or the <img alt="pencil icon" /> pencil icon for assigned commands.
2. When "Recording..." appears next to the command, press the key combination you want to assign.
   To cancel recording, click an empty area inside the tab.
3. To revert the shortcut, select the <img alt="rollback icon" /> rollback icon.

## Removing keyboard shortcuts

To remove a keyboard shortcut, select the <img alt="trash icon" /> trash icon next to the command.

## Tab navigation

You can use the browser **Tab** key navigation to navigate between the interactive elements
on a page. However, the File Editor, Console, and Shell tools capture the **Tab** key as
input for purposes including indentation.

To continue  cycling through page elements while in these tools, follow these steps:

1. Press **Esc** to release focus from the tools
2. Press **Tab** to move to the next element


# Ports
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/ports

Learn how ports work in Replit's cloud environment, including port forwarding, configuration, and troubleshooting for your web applications.

Because Replit runs your projects on a cloud environment, ports work differently on Replit than on your local computer. (If you need a more basic explanation of what TCP ports are, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1t9s5a/eli5_what_are_ports_ex_tcp_port/).)

On a computer, you only have one layer of port management: your programs define a port that they listen to, and when traffic hits that port on your computer from the internet, they get routed to the appropriate process.

<Frame>
  <img alt="computer" />
</Frame>

The `0.0.0.0` part is the address, or host. If a process is listening on `0.0.0.0`, that means it should listen on every network interface — which means that if another computer (on the internet) sends a request to your computer’s IP address, it will see it. So, listening on 0.0.0.0 means those processes are accessible to the public internet (if your computer is connected.)

Most programming frameworks will *not* listen on `0.0.0.0` when you’re developing, because you don’t necessarily want your work exposed to the public while you’re working on it, for privacy & security. Instead, they’ll listen on a different address — `127.0.0.1`, otherwise known as `localhost`. This means only that computer can make requests to that port.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Localhost ports are only visible on the computer that is hosting them." />
</Frame>

On Replit, for a process you’re running to be accessible in the webview or via an external request, it has to have an **external port** defined. This is because the “internal port” that processes typically use is only visible from inside the sandboxed cloud environment that Replit provides. We have to connect that internal port to an externally accessible port to send the right traffic to your programs. Even if your process listens on a port typically available to the public like 0.0.0.0, we still need to bind that port to an external port.

<Frame>
  <img alt="External ports forward traffic to internal ports, which programs listen to." />
</Frame>

We do this by binding external ports to specific internal ports — for example, in the diagram above, the external port `:80` is bound to the internal port `:3000`. That means any traffic that Replit App gets on port 80 will go to the internal port 3000.

This configuration is captured in the \[\[ports]] section of the .replit config file.

By default, we will bind the first port you open to the default external port 80, which will allow that process to be available at the domain without a port address (e.g. customdomain.com/ instead of customdomain.com:3000/). Additional internal ports that are opened will be bound to other available external ports (see a full list below.)

## Preview

In the Preview tool, you can change which external port the webview is rendering by clicking the domain and selecting a different port. You can also open the networking tool from the “gear” icon for more details.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Clicking the domain in the webview will let you choose what port to view." />
</Frame>

## Default port

Port :80 is the “default port” for http traffic, so http traffic sent to the root domain will automatically be routed to port 80. We don’t show the port path in the url for port 80 for that reason. Ports other than :`80` will show up in the domain path (e.g. customdomain.com:4200/). (We provide TLS by default, so it will technically be over port 443, which is the default port for https. For all intents and purposes, you can treat them as interchangeable.)

## Networking tool

For more details about port config and networking, you can open the networking tool. It shows the status of ports open in your Replit App, what external port they’re bound to, and lets you add or remove configuration.

<Frame>
  <img alt="The networking tool shows your port configuration." />
</Frame>

## Publishing

Autoscale and Reserved VM deployments only support a single external port being exposed, and for the corresponding internal port not to be using `localhost`. If you expose more ports, or expose a single port on localhost, your published app will fail. An easy way to make sure your Autoscale deployments work as expected is to remove all the `externalPort` entries for the ports in your config *except* the port for the service you want to interact with from the internet.

## Debugging

A common reason something might not be working as you’d expect is that while your port config looks right, your program is actually looking at a different port. For example, if your config is:

```
[[ports]]
internalPort = 3000
externalPort = 80
```

Then internet traffic to port 80 will go to internal port 3000. However, if your program is actually not listening on port 3000, but rather something else (like 8080), it will appear as if no traffic is getting through. This can happen if you switch the port in your code without switching the corresponding port in your config, or copy-paste config from one project to another.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Programs can change the ports they listen to." />
</Frame>

Each framework has different default ports it listens to — for example, Flask is 5000, react is 3000, and laravel is 8000. Make sure the right port is configured!

## Preferences

We will automatically bind ports that are opened in your Replit App to available external ports when they are opened, and record that binding in the .replit config file.

However, we don’t do this by default for internal ports that open on localhost, because services that usually run on localhost typically assume that they will only be accessible on the same computer as the process that’s running (localhost ports are only visible to the same computer running the process.) This means those services are often not as secure as services built under the assumption that they’ll be available to the public internet.

You can always override this by setting the `exposeLocalhost` config option to `true` for the port you want to expose.

If you want to *always* expose localhost ports by default, you can set your “automatic port forwarding” setting in the User Settings tool to “All ports”.

If you want to *never* create config for ports that are opened, and manually control the port config for all your Replit App, you can set that to “never”.

## Supported ports

Replit App will define port 80 as the external port by default when the first port opens. A Replit App can expose 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 4200, 5000, 5173, 6000, 6800, 8000, 8008, 8080, 8081, as extra external ports.

Ports 22 and 8283 are not forwardable, as they are used internally.

## `[[ports]]` .replit config

Type: `{localPort, externalPort, exposeLocalhost}`

The `[[ports]]` config Allows you to configure which HTTP port to expose for your web output. By default, any exposed HTTP port with host 0.0.0.0 will be exposed as your Replit App's web output.

Extra ports can be served without overriding the default port by adding a new \[\[ports]] entry to your .replit file. You are required to specify both a localPort and externalPort entry. You can add multiple extra ports by adding multiple \[\[ports]] entries to your .replit file as defined below.

### localPort

Determines which port Replit will bind to an external port.

### externalPort

Determines which port should be exposed for that local port’s publicly accessible port.

```toml theme={null}
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80
```

If you want to *never* expose a particular port, you can leave the `localPort` config but just not add an `externalPort`:

```toml theme={null}
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
```

### exposeLocalhost

Determines whether an internal port using `localhost` can be bound to an external port. Can be `true`, `false`, or null.

```toml theme={null}
[[ports]]
localPort = 3000
externalPort = 80
exposeLocalhost = true
```


# Replit Auth
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/replit-auth

Add user accounts, personalized experiences, and secure access control to your app. Enterprise-grade authentication that works with a single Agent prompt.

Replit Auth lets you create personalized user experiences in your app. With user accounts, you can save user preferences, create custom dashboards, build social features, control access to premium content, and track user activity—all the features that make apps engaging and valuable.

Instead of spending months building authentication from scratch, Replit Auth gives you enterprise-grade capabilities with a single Agent prompt. Powered by the same infrastructure as Fortune 500 companies—Firebase, Google Cloud Identity Platform, reCAPTCHA, Stytch, and Clearout—you get professional-level security, fraud prevention, and global scale built in.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Auth configuration" />
</Frame>

## Why use Replit Auth

Authentication is a challenging problem that entire companies dedicate themselves to solving. Your app's primary purpose likely isn't authentication - it's whatever unique idea or solution you're building.

Replit Auth offers:

* **Zero setup** - Add authentication with a single prompt in Agent
* **Built-in security** - Uses Replit's infrastructure with protections against common attacks
* **User management** - Simplified user administration through the Auth pane
* **Database integration** - Automatic user entries in your database
* **Customizable login page** - Personalize the login experience for your app
* **Password reset** - Replit sends password reset emails for you, so you don't need to set up your own email delivery provider
* **Development and Published Apps** - Replit Auth works seamlessly across development (replit.dev), and published apps (replit.app, and custom domains)

## Enterprise-grade infrastructure

Replit Auth is more than simple user management—it's a fully managed authentication solution built on enterprise-grade infrastructure. This powerful combination gives your app the same authentication capabilities used by Fortune 500 companies:

* **Firebase & Google Cloud Identity Platform** - Enterprise-tier SLA with Google's battle-tested authentication infrastructure
* **Advanced security scanning** - Automatic protection against bots and malicious actors with reCAPTCHA integration
* **Fraud prevention** - Email verification and validation powered by Clearout to prevent fake accounts
* **Multi-factor authentication** - Secure login options backed by Stytch's enterprise authentication platform
* **Global scale** - Built to handle millions of users with automatic scaling and reliability

This enterprise foundation means you can focus on building your app's unique features while knowing your authentication is powered by the same infrastructure that secures billion-dollar companies. Instead of spending months integrating multiple services, you get all these capabilities with a single Agent prompt.

## Getting started with Replit Auth

The only way to implement Replit Auth is by using Agent. Simply include a request for Replit Auth in your prompt:

```
Help me create an app that [your app idea] and should feature Replit Auth.
```

Agent will set up all the necessary code and configurations for authentication. Manual implementation is not supported, as Agent handles all the complexity for you.

<Frame>
  <iframe />
</Frame>

To learn more about Agent capabilities, see the [Replit Agent documentation](/replitai/agent) and [Agent integrations](/replitai/integrations).

For tips on writing effective prompts, check out [Effective prompting with Replit](/tutorials/effective-prompting).

## Managing users

Replit Auth provides a built-in user management interface accessible through the Auth pane in your Replit workspace.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Auth management pane" />
</Frame>

From this interface, you can:

* View all authenticated users
* Ban users from your application
* View user details
* Track user activity

## Customizing the login page

<Frame>
  <img alt="Auth configuration" />
</Frame>

You can customize the login page to match your app's branding:

1. Navigate to the Auth pane in your Replit workspace
2. Click on **Configure**
3. Customize the following elements:
   * App name
   * App icon
   * Login methods (Google, GitHub, X, Apple, Email)

Your changes will immediately appear on your app's login page.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Auth configuration" />
</Frame>

## Connecting user data with your database

Replit Auth automatically creates user entries in your database. This makes it easy to store user-specific data. Agent will guide you on properly connecting user data with your database.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Auth database" />
</Frame>

For more information on databases, see the [Replit Database Documentation](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/replit-database).

## Security considerations

Replit Auth leverages Replit's infrastructure, providing built-in protections against common security threats. However, you should still follow these best practices:

* Always validate user authentication server-side before performing sensitive operations
* Never store sensitive information like passwords in your code
* Use environment variables for any API keys or secrets
* Implement proper access controls for user data

For more information on security, check out:

* [Replit's built-in security features](/tutorials/vibe-code-securely)
* [Security checklist for vibe coding](/tutorials/vibe-code-security-checklist)
* [Secrets management](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets)

## Referrals

To encourage applications that teach people about Replit, any user that signs up via Replit Auth will automatically be added to your pending Replit Referrals. If they later upgrade to Replit Core, you will receive any referral bonus you are entitled to according to the current terms of the referral program.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

1. **User not recognized after login**
   * If you're experiencing issues, ask [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent) for help debugging your authentication implementation.

2. **Custom icon not displaying**
   * Make sure the icon URL is accessible and in a supported format (PNG or JPG).

3. **Newly linked custom domain isn't working**
   * Republish to refresh the domain list (REPLIT\_DOMAINS environment variable).

## Theme design best practices

Create visually appealing and functional themes by following these guidelines:

### Color and contrast

* **Balance contrast**: Ensure sufficient difference between background and foreground elements
* **Create cohesive palettes**: Choose colors that complement each other rather than clash
* **Maintain consistent brightness**: Keep a similar brightness level across syntax elements
* **Design for accessibility**: Consider users with visual impairments by avoiding low-contrast combinations

<Warning>
  Common theme design issues to avoid:

  * Excessive brightness differences between syntax elements
  * Poorly matched colors that create visual discord
  * Insufficient contrast between code and background
</Warning>

## Managing your themes

Access and manage all your installed themes from your [account settings](https://replit.com/account) under the **Themes** section.

Learn how to set up and use SSH to connect your local development environment to Replit Apps for secure remote access and file synchronization.

## What is SSH?

SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a secure protocol that facilitates remote access to your Replit App's command line interface. With SSH, you can seamlessly transfer files and leverage your preferred local Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for editing code on Replit, enhancing collaboration and productivity in your development workflow.

SSH functionality is available for Core, Teams, and all other paid plans.

Here's an overview of the process:

* Generate an SSH keypair on your local machine
* Add that SSH key to the **SSH** pane inside any Replit App
* Connect using an SSH client or an editor which can work over SSH (like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/))

<Note>
  SSH keys are associated with your account, not a particular Replit App. This means that you only need to add a public key once, after which you can connect to any Replit App you have access to.
</Note>

## Why use SSH?

* **Automatic updates between Replit App and editor**: Any changes made in the Replit App are reflected in your editor instantly, and any modifications in the editor are updated in the Replit App. This seamless synchronization ensures that your codebase is always up-to-date across platforms.

* **File management synchronization**: Whether you add, delete, or update files, these changes are synchronized in real time between your editor and the Replit App. This feature ensures that your project structure remains consistent, regardless of where the changes are initiated.

* **Folder management and file moving**: Moving files across folders is also synchronized between your editors and the Replit App. This ensures that organizational changes made in one environment are accurately reflected in the other, maintaining the integrity and structure of your project.

## Find or create a keypair

To configure SSH for your account, you'll need your SSH public key.

### Figuring out if you already have a keypair

You can check if you already have a public key by running the following command in a Terminal on your local computer:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
    ```sh theme={null}
    ls -l ~/.ssh
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```sh theme={null}
    dir %HOMEPATH%\.ssh
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you get an error, that's OK, proceed to [Generating a new keypair](#generating-a-new-keypair).
If you see a file called `replit.pub`, please proceed to [Get the contents of your public key](#get-the-contents-of-your-public-key).

### Generating a new keypair

On your machine, open a Terminal (or Command Prompt) window and paste the following command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
    ```bash theme={null}
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/replit -q -N ""
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```sh theme={null}
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f %HOMEPATH%\.ssh\replit -q -N ""
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This command checks if a specific SSH public key file already exists. If not, it creates a new SSH key with some sensible parameters.

### Get the contents of your public key

Once you have either confirmed you have a keypair or created one, display the contents of the public key (one of the two similarly named files, suffixed with `.pub`), as we'll need that for later.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
    ```sh theme={null}
    cat ~/.ssh/replit.pub
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```sh theme={null}
    notepad %HOMEPATH%\.ssh\replit.pub
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Save the contents of `replit.pub` to use later in this article and proceed to [add the SSH key to your account](#add-the-ssh-key-to-your-account).

## Add the SSH key to your account

### Add the public key directly in a Replit App, using the SSH pane

1. In your Replit App on any window, select the **+** button, then search for **SSH**.

<Frame>
  <img alt="SSH tool button in the Replit interface" />
</Frame>

2. Navigate to the **Keys** tab and select **New SSH key**.
3. In the popup window, enter a **Label** for your key (e.g., my-ssh-key) and paste the public key you copied into the **Key** section.
   Select the **Add SSH Key** button. Your key has been added and authorized for use.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Add SSH key dialog with label and key fields filled in" />
</Frame>

### Add the public key directly in your Account

You can also add an SSH key by navigating to your [**Account**](https://replit.com/account#ssh-keys) and selecting **SSH keys**.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Account settings showing SSH keys option" />
</Frame>

Select the **Add SSH key** button and paste in the contents of `replit.pub` that we obtained from the previous section, [Find or create a keypair](#find-or-create-a-keypair).

<Frame>
  <img alt="SSH keys management interface in account settings" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  When you have multiple public keys on your machine, it's important to ensure that you use the correct combination of private and public keys for your SSH configuration.
</Note>

## Connecting to your Replit App

### Configure your SSH config

1. In a terminal, ensure the `~/.ssh` directory and `~/.ssh/config` file exist:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux">
    ```sh theme={null}
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/config && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
    open -a 'TextEdit' ~/.ssh/config || nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```sh theme={null}
    if not exist %HOMEPATH%\.ssh mkdir %HOMEPATH%\.ssh && type \NUL > %HOMEPATH%\.ssh\config
    notepad %HOMEPATH%\.ssh\config
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Add a configuration block to use the `replit` keypair for all \*.replit.dev domains:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac/Linux/Windows">
    ```
    Host *.replit.dev
        Port 22
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/replit
        StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Connect from VSCode or Cursor

1. From a Replit App, open the **SSH** pane

2. In the SSH pane, navigate to the **Connect** tab and select **Launch VS Code**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Connect with VSCode">
    <img alt="SSH connect tab showing Launch VS Code option" />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

3. If you are prompted to fill out `~/.ssh/config`, enter the following:

   ```
   Host *.replit.dev
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/replit
       StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
   ```

   <Note>
     Adding SSH configuration is only prompted the first time you are trying to connect to VS Code or another editor. To return to the configuration file, you will need to select **Configure SSH Hosts...**.
   </Note>

4. If prompted by an external application warning, select **Yes** to confirm you want to open your project in your preferred editor or VS Code.

5. You may be asked to install or update SSH extensions periodically. Replit will endeavor to be compatible with the latest versions of these IDEs, and you may get important security updates as well.

### Connect manually

At the bottom of the **SSH** pane's "Connect" tab, you will find "Connect manually".

Copy that command, paste it into either a local Terminal (Mac or Linux) or local Command Prompt (Windows) in order to connect directly.

This is also a good way to debug connection issues with IDEs, as well as to collect valuable "verbose" connection information when reporting bugs to Replit Support.

**An error indicating we are attempting to connect with a nonexistent private key**:

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/replit -p 22 c96b6ade-d5e4-4f7a-bc5b-52334509b2a3@c96b6ade-d5e4-4f7a-bc5b-52334509b2a3-00-16nh2hskw3ql8.riker.replit.dev
Warning: Identity file /Users/user/.ssh/replit not accessible: No such file or directory.
```

**Full debug logs of an SSH connection attempt, to include with a bug report**:

```

### Connect via a tool not listed here

There are many SSH clients available for different platforms and operating systems, many offering different features or integrations.

You can always break down the command displayed in "Connect Manually" into its constituent components to determine how to configure each client:

```sh theme={null}
ssh -i ~/.ssh/replit -p 22  c96b6ade-d5e4-4f7a-bc5b-52334509b2a3@c96b6ade-d5e4-4f7a-bc5b-52334509b2a3-00-16nh2hskw3ql8.riker.replit.dev

```

**Hostname**: `<your_hostname>.<cluster>.replit.dev`
**Port**: `<port_number>`
**User**: `Username`
**Private Key**: Path to the private key file on your computer. Usually next to `replit.pub`.


# Developer Frameworks
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/templates

If your Replit App can be used as a good starting point for other project, you might want to submit it as a developer framework! Let's learn what a Replit developer framework is and how to make a good one.

## What is a developer framework?

Developer frameworks are published Replit Apps that can be used to build upon. The official developer frameworks, made by Replit, have a checkbox next to the name of the framework:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Official Replit developer frameworks" />
</Frame>

The [HTML, CSS, JS framework](https://replit.com/@replit/HTML-CSS-JS?v=1#index.html) framework is very popular and can be used as a starting point for creating a vanilla JavaScript project. You can fork the framework to use it.

Other developer frameworks have been created by community members, like this one:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Community developer frameworks" />
</Frame>

## Creating a developer framework

Public Replit Apps can be published by checking the "Publish as Developer Framework" box in the last step of the Publish this Replit Apps flow.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Publish button" />
</Frame>

Before you publish your developer framework, make sure it's as easy to use as possible. It should include all the boiler plate code that is needed to get a project started, and it should work right away when the "Run" button is pressed.

A good developer framework should always include well-commented code, easily editable variables, and a README file. It's always important to comment your code, but it's even more important when others will be using your code for their own projects. In the `README.md` file, add descriptive details about your developer framework, and information about the variables that the user can change. READMEs help users understand how your developer framework works, and if there are any requirements, licensing, or other factors they should be aware of.

The `.md` in `README.md` stands for Markdown, which is a basic text language. READMEs can be written in any text format, but we'll use Markdown as it's the best practice.

Here's an example outline for a README - feel free to use this for your own developer frameworks!

```md theme={null}
# Developer Framework Name

Choose a self-descriptive name, you can also add a simple description about your developer framework.

# Usage

Explain how you can install / use this developer framework. Make sure to provide a detailed explanation and make it easy for people to read. Also, add any code snippets if needed.

# License

This will define how people can use your developer framework. You can visit https://opensource.org/licenses to choose a license.
```

You can also edit your submitted developer framework and share update messages to show how your project has changed over time.


# Workflows
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workflows

A Workflow is a easily configurable 'Run' button that can run any command(s) you'd like.

It is a reusable, customizable sequence of steps that can be executed within your replit app. They can be as simple as running `python main.py` or as complex as executing a multi-step procedure.

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

Example Use Cases:

* Run multiple services in parallel (e.g., frontend + backend)
* Execute files or commands sequentially (e.g., run linter → run tests, compile → execute code)

To start [creating workflows](#creating-workflows), go to the Workflows pane by using the tools sidebar menu, or search for the Workflows pane using `Command + K`.

<YouTubeEmbed />

## Available Task Types

There are current 3 type of tasks available, `Execute Shell Command`, `Install Packages`, and `Run Workflow`.

### Execute Shell Command

`Execute Shell Command` stores a shell command and executes it using the same environment as the Shell pane. This task type offers a wide range of use-cases, from running individual files:

```text theme={null}
python main.py
```

to executing complex stored database query commands:

```text theme={null}
psql -h 0.0.0.0 -U your_username -d your_database -c "SELECT * FROM your_table;"
```

Example use case:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

### Install Packages

`Install Packages` utilizes Replit's built-in dependency management system, automatically detecting your project dependencies and installing the necessary packages for your project. See [Dependency Management](../replit-workspace/dependency-management.md#the-universal-package-manager) for more details on how UPM guesses packages to install for your project under the hood.

Example use case:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

### Run Workflow

`Run Workflow` allows you to run another workflow from the current workflow. This allows for reusing workflows and combining them to create more complex workflows.

Example use case:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

By using this task type for creating dependencies between workflows, you can edit one workflow and have other workflows referencing it automatically use the latest changes. Note that there is a depth limit placed on deeply nested workflow calls.

## Workflow Execution Mode

Workflows offer two different modes of execution: sequential and parallel.

### Sequential

Sequential execution will run each task in the defined order, waiting for each task to finish before moving on to the next step, and stopping execution of the sequence if a task within the workflow failed.

An example of using this mode is for defining commands that are logically connected, such as git commands for fetching the latest changes from your main branch, then rebasing your current branch on the main branch:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

### Parallel

Parallel execution will run each task in parallel, such that each task is started and runs independently of other tasks within the workflow. One task failing does not stop the execution of other tasks.

An example of using this mode is running a fullstack project that needs to start both the frontend and the backend server:

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

## Creating Workflows

Workflows can be created using the workflows pane by clicking on the `+ New Workflow` button. Start by giving your workflow a descriptive name, chose a suitable mode of execution, and start adding tasks. Tasks can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

## Assign Workflow to Run Button

A workflow can also be assigned to the run button to replace the default run button behavior (see [Configure a Replit App](/replit-app/configuration)). To keep the default run command configured within `.replit`, select the default "Run Replit App" option within the dropdown.

The selected workflow within the dropdown menu next to the run button will be run when the run button is clicked. Click on your desired workflow within the dropdown menu to change which workflow should be run by the run button.

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>

## Viewing Workflow Outputs

Workflow outputs will be displayed in the `Console` pane. You can toggle the display to only display latest outputs and clear the console altogether.

<Frame>
  <img alt="image" />
</Frame>


# Console
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/console

Console shows the output of running your Replit App code, informing you of activity and errors.

Console lets you monitor and review logs printed by your running Replit App in real time.
You can use information from current and past runs to understand your app's behavior,
troubleshoot errors, and optimize performance.

<Tip>
  When debugging using Agent, include console logs in your prompt to provide context.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the Console workspace tool" />
</Frame>

## Features

Console provides the following tools to help you understand your app's behavior:

* **Real time logging**: View your app's output as it happens
* **AI assistance**: Receive suggestions to fix errors reported in the logs
* **Run history**: Show logs from prior runs to track changes

## Usage

You can access the Console tool directly in your Replit App workspace.

<Accordion title="How to access Console">
  From the left **Tool dock**:

  2. Type "Console" to locate the tool and select it from the results.
</Accordion>

Each time you use the **Run** button in your Replit App, Console displays a new entry that includes the following information:

* The Command that executed your code
* Timestamp information
* Standard output and error logs

The following screenshot shows the `npm run dev` command used to start the app and log messages from the run:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Console log entry showing the command run" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Client-side logs, such as those generated from HTML, CSS, and JS code, appear only in the Developer tools in the [Preview](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/preview) tool.
</Note>

### AI-powered debugging

When you encounter errors or other information in the logs that you want to understand, select the
**Ask AI** button at the top of the entry. This automatically opens the **Agent** tab and
submits the log content for analysis.

### Log entry commands

Console provides the following tools to manage your logs:

* **Show Only Latest**: Toggle this control to the **on** position to display only the most recent run.
* **Collapse entry**: Select the <img alt="downward arrow icon" /> downward arrow to the left of the command name to hide the logs.
* **Clear past runs**: Select this to delete logs of prior runs. This action is irreversible.

### Network availability

You can control the development version of your app's availability online.

To stop serving requests to the development URL, select the <img alt="network off icon" /> globe with slash icon
on the right side of the network information line.

# File History
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/file-history

To make sure you never lose any of your work, Replit auto-saves your code as you write. If you ever lose an edit to your code that you'd like to recover, rewind back in time with File History.

Get started by opening a text file in the Workspace and pressing the **History** button in the bottom-right corner.

<Frame>
  <img alt="opening history" />
</Frame>

## Viewing previous versions of a file

Once you've opened up File History, you can view previous versions of a file by using the scroll bar, the arrow buttons, or the **left** and **right** arrow keys.

<Frame>
  <img alt="scroll bar demo" />
</Frame>

## Comparing previous versions to the current file

Press the Compare Latest toggle in the bottom left hand of the File History pane to see in-line comparisons of your file at that point in time and the latest version.

<Frame>
  <img alt="compare latest image" />
</Frame>

## Restoring a previous version of a file

If you want to restore a file to a previous version, just press the `Restore` button, which will restore. Don't worry, you won't erase any history. When you restore to a previous version, it is added as a new version to the file's history.

<Frame>
  <img alt="restore history image" />

</Tip>

If you prefer using Git through the command line:

* **Command synchronization**: Any Git commands executed in the Shell will automatically sync with the Git pane
* **Full Git functionality**: Access advanced Git features not available in the Git pane
* **Seamless switching**: Switch between using Shell commands and Git pane as needed

<Info>
  **GitHub and GitLab CLI Support**: In addition to standard Git commands, you can also use the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli) (`gh`) and [GitLab CLI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/gitlab_cli/) (`glab`) in the Shell to manage and connect to external Git repositories. These tools provide enhanced functionality for working with GitHub and GitLab repositories, including pull requests, issues, and other platform-specific features.
</Info>

#### Repository operations

* **Clone repository**: `git clone <url-to-repository>`
* **Initialize repository**: `git init`
* **Add remote**: `git remote add origin <url-to-repository>`

#### Making changes

* **Check status**: `git status` (shows modified, added, and deleted files)
* **Stage files**: `git add <filename>` or `git add .` (for all files)
* **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "your commit message"`
* **Push changes**: `git push origin <branch-name>`
* **Pull changes**: `git pull origin <branch-name>`

#### Authentication

When working with private repositories, you'll need to authenticate:

* For GitHub repositories, use a personal access token instead of your password
* To avoid re-entering credentials, you can store them using Replit Secrets:
  1. Create a new secret with key `GIT_URL`
  2. Set the value to `https://<username>:<token>@github.com/<user-or-org>/<repository>`
  3. Use `git push $GIT_URL` to push without typing credentials

<Note>
  When using credential secrets, anyone with access to your Replit App can potentially access your Git credentials. For sensitive repositories, consider manually entering credentials each time.
</Note>


# Multiplayer
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/multiplayer

Multiplayer lets you collaborate in real time with other users on your Replit App.

Multiplayer transforms your Replit workspace into a collaborative environment where up to

# Secrets
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets

The Secrets workspace tool lets you securely store sensitive information your app needs as encrypted environment variables.

The Secrets tool stores and encrypts **secrets**, your Replit App's sensitive information, such as API keys, authentication tokens, and database connection strings.

When you add a secret, the tool automatically encrypts the data and makes it available to your Replit App as an environment variable.
This approach lets you eliminate hard-coding secrets in your code and reduce the risk of exposing them.

<Frame>
  <iframe title="Secrets workspace tool" />
</Frame>

Hard-coding secrets in your codebase can lead to accidental exposure in the following scenarios:

* Sharing your code with others through a public Replit App or copy-paste
* Checking your code into version control in a public repository
* Live streaming or screen sharing your code

Use the Secrets tool to confidently share your code without worrying about exposing credentials.

<Frame>
  <img alt="screenshot of the Secrets tool" />
</Frame>

## Features

Secrets include the following features:

* **End-to-end encryption**: Automatically protect your data using AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS encryption in transit
* **App-level secrets**: Store and manage secrets that are specific to a Replit App
* **Account-level secrets**: Store and manage secrets that you can make available across all your Replit Apps
* **Environment variable access**: Access your secrets from your code using environment variables

### Managing secrets visibility

Secrets visibility depends on your access to a Replit App and whether you authored it.

You can use one of the options to share your Replit App:

* **Multiplayer**: Invite Replit users to collaborate in real-time
* **Cover page**: Show a preview of your Replit App with the option to remix it
* **Remix**: Make your individual or organization's Replit App public so others can create their version

The following table shows secret name and value visibility in the different scenarios:

| Access Method      | Who                                        | Can See Names | Can See Values |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Multiplayer        | Multiplayer collaborator                   | ✓             | ✓              |
| Multiplayer        | Organization member (Owner role)           | ✓             | ✓              |
| Multiplayer        | Organization member (Non-owner)            | ✓             |                |
| Cover Page         | Any visitor                                |               |                |
| Remix              | Owner/collaborator remixing own Replit App | ✓             | ✓              |

| Organization Remix | Organization member without Owner role     | ✓             |                |

<Warning>
  Organization members without the Owner role cannot view secret values in a Replit App, but can access their values by printing the environment variables.
</Warning>

## Database and storage related secrets

When you add Replit's database or object storage, the workspace automatically creates the following secrets:

| Secret         | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQL database connection string |
| `PGHOST`       | PostgreSQL hostname            |
| `PGUSER`       | PostgreSQL username            |
| `PGPASSWORD`   | PostgreSQL password            |
| `PGDATABASE`   | PostgreSQL database name       |
| `PGPORT`       | PostgreSQL port                |

To view all environment variables in your Replit App, run `printenv` in the Shell workspace tool or print them from your code.

## Predefined environment variables

Replit automatically sets the following environment variables that you can access from your app:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REPLIT_DOMAINS`     | Comma-separated list of all domains associated with your Replit App                    |
| `REPLIT_USER`        | Username of the current editor, which may vary in Multiplayer sessions                 |
| `REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT`  | Set to `1` if the code is running in a published app, unset otherwise                  |
| `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`  | Development URL on the `replit.dev` domain, which is different from the Deployment URL |

These are not listed in the Secrets tool, but you can access them in your code using the `os.environ` object or running `printenv` in the Shell.


# Security and Privacy Scanner
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/security-scanner

Scan your Replit App for high-impact security and privacy vulnerabilities, then fix them before you publish.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Security and Privacy Scanner interface showing vulnerability scan results" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  The scanner is currently in beta. It is powerful, but it may occasionally
  report false positives or miss some issues. Review results carefully, and use
  your own judgment before changing code or updating dependencies.
</Note>

## What is Security and Privacy Scanner?

Security and Privacy Scanner helps you find and fix high-impact risks in your Replit App before you ship it.

It focuses on issues that are most likely to affect the safety of your application or your data:

* **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Known issues in the packages your Replit App depends on
* **Static analysis issues (SAST)**: Dangerous patterns in your source code
* **Malicious or unsafe files**: Files that match known-bad or risky signatures
* **Privacy issues**: Potential leaks of sensitive or personal data in your code

Scans run on Replit infrastructure and are powered by partners like **Semgrep Community Edition** and **HoundDog.ai**. Your code and data are **not** sent to these partners or any other third parties.

## Types of vulnerabilities

### Dependency vulnerabilities

These come from a dependency audit of your project’s packages:

* Supports many popular ecosystems (including **Node.js/npm**, **Python**, **Go**, **Rust**, **PHP**, and **Ruby**)
* Captures whether the dependency is direct or transitive
* Includes metadata about the vulnerable package and any available fixes

Examples include:

```json theme={null}
"express": "4.18.2" // version with a known vulnerability
```

Some dependency issues can be updated automatically, while others may require manual changes or may not have a fix available.

### Static analysis (SAST) issues

Static analysis scans your source files for insecure patterns, like:

```javascript theme={null}
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}'`;
```

SAST findings include:

* File path and exact location (line and column)
* Rule or check name
* A message describing the issue

These are the issues you’ll typically fix directly in your code.

### Malicious or unsafe files

Malicious file detection looks for files that match known-bad or high-risk signatures, such as:

```bash theme={null}
# malicious setup script from a known supply-chain attack
setup_bun.js
```

For these findings, the scanner shows:

* Why the file is risky
* The paths where it appears
* Suggested mitigation text

You should either remove or carefully inspect these files before continuing.

### Privacy issues

In addition to security issues, the scanner also surfaces potential privacy issues powered by **HoundDog.ai**, especially when sensitive data flows into risky sinks like logs, files, or third-party SDKs and APIs:

* Locations where sensitive data may be exposed
* Rules that describe the privacy concern
* Suggested remediation strategies (for example, deletion vs. sanitization)

For example, the scanner might flag code that logs an entire user profile (including contact details) to an application log:

```javascript theme={null}
logger.info("New signup", {
  email: user.email,
  phoneNumber: user.phoneNumber,
  address: user.address,
});
```

These findings are powered by **HoundDog.ai** and are labeled as privacy or HoundDog vulnerabilities in the pane.

## Getting started

You can open Security and Privacy Scanner in a few ways:

<Steps>
  <Step>Open the **Security Scanner** pane.</Step>

  <Step>
    Use the workspace search/tool palette and search for "Security Scanner".
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once open, the pane will automatically run an initial scan if no previous results exist.

Scans usually complete in minutes, but may take longer for large codebases or dependency graphs.

## Understanding scan results

<Tip>
  The results are organized into two tabs:

  * **Active issues**: Issues that are currently considered in scope
  * **Hidden issues**: Issues you have explicitly hidden
</Tip>

Within **Active issues**, you may see:

* **Automatic dependency vulnerabilities**: Dependency issues that can be fixed by updating packages.
* **Static analysis issues**: Code-level vulnerabilities with file and line references.
* **Malicious file issues**: Known-bad or risky files in your project.
* **Privacy issues**: Locations where sensitive or personal data might be at risk.

### Severity

Each issue has a severity:

* **Critical**
* **High**
* (Lower severity level like moderate/low/info may be present in underlying data but are not prioritized in this pane.)

The scanner focuses on **high** and **critical** issues so you can address the most impactful problems first.

### Hiding and re-activating issues

You can:

* **Hide** a non-critical issue you understand and are willing to accept.
* **Move to active** to bring a previously hidden issue back into the Active issues tab.

## Fixing issues

The scanner integrates with both dependency tooling and Replit AI Agent to help you fix problems quickly.

### Automatic dependency updates (Node.js)

For supported Node.js projects, you’ll see an **Update automatically** button for certain dependency vulnerabilities.

If your project or ecosystem is not supported, you may still see dependency vulnerabilities, but the automatic update button might be disabled for your Replit App.

### Fix with Agent

Most vulnerability cards include a **Fix with Agent** button:

* Opens or attaches to a Replit Agent session.
* Sends the vulnerability details to Agent.
* Agent proposes and applies fixes in your Replit App, while you stay in control.

After fixes are applied, run the scanner again to confirm the issues are resolved.

### Viewing existing Agent sessions

If you already started fixing vulnerabilities with Agent, you may see a **View Agent Session** button on an issue:

* Select it to jump back into the associated Agent chat.
* Continue iterating on the fix or ask follow-up questions about the vulnerability.

## Privacy and data handling

Security and privacy scanning are powered by **Semgrep** and **HoundDog.ai**, but:

* All scanning runs **locally on Replit infrastructure**.
* Your code and data are **not sent** to Semgrep, HoundDog.ai, or other third parties.
* Scan configuration and results stay attached to your Replit App.

## Limitations and best practices

Keep in mind:

* **Beta**: The scanner may occasionally report false positives or miss issues.
* **Language support**:
  * Dependency scanning supports many popular ecosystems (including **Node.js/npm**, **Python**, **Go**, **Rust**, **PHP**, and **Ruby**).
  * Automatic dependency fixing is currently focused on **Node.js/npm**.
* **Not a full security review**: Use it alongside code review, tests, and live app checks.
* **Re-run after changes**: Re-run the scanner after:
  * Adding or updating dependencies
  * Making major code changes
  * Before publishing a new version

For best results, treat the scanner as part of your normal development workflow, not a one-time check.

## Next steps

* Learn more about [Publishing](/category/replit-deployments) and how to publish your Replit App once scans are clean.
* Explore [Replit AI Agent](/replitai/agent) to fix security and privacy issues directly from the workspace.

# Version control
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/version-control

Track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your code's evolution using Replit's integrated version control tools.

Version control on Replit enables you to track, manage, and collaborate on your codebase with confidence. With built-in Git integration and GitHub connectivity, you can:

* Track code changes and maintain a history of your development work
* Collaborate with team members without code conflicts or lost work
* Import, modify, and push code between Replit and GitHub
* Work with branches to experiment with new features safely

## What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. On Replit, version control is powered by Git—the industry-standard tool for tracking code changes—with a user-friendly visual interface that eliminates the need for command-line knowledge.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent checkpoints in the Git pane" />
</Frame>

### How version control works on Replit

All four version control options interact with the same underlying Git repository:

1. **Agent Checkpoints** create commits automatically at important milestones when building with [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent). [Learn more about checkpoints and rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).
2. **Git Pane** provides visual access to the complete Git repository
3. **Git CLI** offers command-line access to all Git functionality
4. **File History** tracks granular changes within individual files

Choose the interface that best matches your needs, with the confidence that everything is backed by Git's robust version control system.

| Feature              | Agent Checkpoints             | Git Commits                   | File History             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Creation**         | Automatic at logical points   | Manual or scheduled           | Automatic for user edits |
| **Granularity**      | Feature-level changes         | Any change size               | Character-level changes  |
| **Description**      | AI-generated summaries        | User-written messages         | Automatic timestamps     |
| **Rollback**         | One-click restore             | Requires Git knowledge        | One-click restore        |
| **Git capabilities** | Full Git capabilities         | Full Git capabilities         | No Git capabilities      |

# Replit Agent
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/agent

Replit Agent uses AI to set up and create apps from scratch. Describe your app in everyday language, and it can set up and create your Replit App in minutes.

Agent uses powerful AI technology to transform your ideas into applications
and seamlessly add new features by describing what you want.

<Tip>
  **New with Agent 3** - Extended autonomous builds with minimal supervision,
  App Testing for self-validation, Fast and Full build modes, and Agents & Automations
  for building your own autonomous systems.
</Tip>

<YouTubeEmbed title="Now Available: Replit Agent 3" />

## Features

<Info>
  Agent uses powerful AI technology to create your apps, leveraging
  industry-leading models to deliver the best results.
</Info>

Chat with Agent in your Replit App to receive the following support:

* Create full-stack apps from scratch
* Add advanced features and integrate complex APIs
* Design, create, and modify database structures
* Streamline environment setup and dependency management

## Creating Apps

When starting a new project on Replit, you have two options on the homepage:

* **App**: Build full-stack applications, websites with backends, AI-powered apps, and more
* **Design**: Create slides, static websites, prototypes, and visual designs (see [Design Mode](/replitai/design-mode))

<Frame>
  <img alt="Replit homepage showing App and Design tabs for creating new projects" />
</Frame>

This section covers building Apps with Agent.

### Stack selection

When you type your prompt in the App tab, Agent automatically suggests an app type based on your description:

* **Web App**: Most common—full-stack web applications with frontend and backend
* **Data App**: Data-focused applications with visualization and analysis
* **Other types**: Agent may suggest other specialized technology stacks based on your needs

After auto-classification, you can change the App type using a dropdown if the suggested one doesn't match your vision.

<Info>
  Most projects are classified as Web Apps. If you're unsure, start with the Replit-suggested App type.
</Info>

### Build modes

After entering your prompt, you have two key choices which affect how Agent builds your app:

#### Fast build vs. full build

Choose your build speed based on your needs. Select the ⚡ lightning bolt icon in the prompt box to enable Fast build, or leave it off for Full build.

| Mode           | Duration      | Best For                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast**       | \~3-5 minutes | Quick prototypes, lightweight apps                          |
| **Full build** | 10+ minutes   | Complex apps, comprehensive features, hands-off development |

**Key differences:**

* **Fast build**: Select the ⚡ icon in the prompt box. Agent works quickly to create a working version. Great for rapid prototyping and when you want to stay engaged with the build process.
* **Full build**: Leave the ⚡ icon unselected. Agent uses more autonomy from the first build and tests its own work. Results in more polished, comprehensive applications but takes longer.

<Note>
  **Web Apps only**: Fast is currently only available for Web Apps.
</Note>

#### Build vs. Plan

Choose when Agent starts building:

* **Build**: Agent immediately starts building your app based on your prompt
* **Plan**: Agent creates an initial plan that you can review and iterate on before building begins

**When to use Plan mode:**

* You want to refine requirements before committing to a build
* You're exploring different approaches to a complex problem
* You need to align on scope with stakeholders before development

Agent's self-testing feature that validates your app's functionality using an actual browser, with visual feedback and automatic issue resolution.

**App Testing is a powerful new feature in Agent 3** that allows Agent to test itself using an actual browser. Agent tests the apps it builds by navigating through your application like a real user would, clicking around and validating functionality. This self-testing capability helps ensure your app works correctly and allows Agent to catch and fix issues automatically.

<Info>
  **New in Agent 3**: App Testing represents a major advancement in Agent's autonomous capabilities, enabling more reliable and higher-quality app development.
</Info>

## How App Testing works

Watch App Testing in action as Agent navigates through your app:

<Frame>
  <video />
</Frame>

When App Testing is enabled, Agent will periodically decide to test itself when it thinks enough has changed to deem it necessary. Agent doesn't test after 100% of user messages, but intelligently determines when testing would be most valuable.

<Note>
  At this time, App Testing is available for Full Stack JavaScript and Streamlit Python web applications.
</Note>

### Key Benefits

* **Extended Autonomy**: Enables Agent to work for longer periods without requiring human intervention
* **Higher Quality**: Produces apps with fewer mistakes by identifying and addressing issues early
* **Cost Efficiency**: Prevents the need for additional debugging sessions by catching problems during development
* **Interactive Review**: Provides video replays and section-by-section navigation for thorough result analysis

### The Testing Process

When Agent decides to test itself, here's what happens:

1. **Browser Preview**: You'll see a browser preview within the Agent pane
2. **Visual Testing**: Watch Agent's cursor as it clicks around your app, testing functionality
3. **Real User Simulation**: Agent navigates through your application just like a real user would, entering mock data when necessary
4. **Automatic Analysis**: Agent analyzes the test results and identifies any issues
5. **Self-Correction**: Agent reports back with a summary of its tests and automatically fixes any issues that crop up

## Key capabilities

Agent intelligently tests your application by navigating through it like a real user would, covering:

* **User interface validation**: Buttons, forms, navigation, and visual elements
* **Functionality verification**: Core features and user workflows
* **Integration testing**: API calls, database interactions, and third-party services
* **Performance and accessibility**: Load times, responsiveness, and accessibility standards

## Usage

App Testing can be toggled on/off within the "Agent Tools" section of the input box within your Repl. When enabled, Agent intelligently decides when to test based on the changes made to your app.

<Note>
  App Testing is part of Agent 3's autonomous capabilities. Learn more about [Autonomy Level settings](/replitai/autonomy-level) and other [Agent
  features](/replitai/agent).
</Note>

## Take over

Sometimes the Agent will encounter a roadblock during testing that it needs your help with to continue. Most commonly this involves logging in to a user account (e.g. Gmail). In these cases, the Agent will pop up with a button to "Begin take over."

<Frame>
  <img alt="App Testing take over interface showing Skip and Begin take over buttons with instructions for handling errors and CAPTCHAs" />
</Frame>

Pressing "Begin take over" enables you to click into the testing preview, complete the requisite steps, then allow the Agent to continue. You can also press "Skip" to skip take over, ending the App Testing if the Agent cannot proceed without your help. If you do not respond within 10 minutes, the Agent will continue as if you pressed "Skip."

### What to expect

* **Skip option**: Use the skip button to bypass testing if needed and continue with development
* **Interactive video replay**: After testing, click the video to replay the entire testing session
* **Section navigation**: Use the sliders at the bottom to jump to specific sections of the test

The interactive replay interface allows you to review the complete testing session:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Interactive video replay interface showing the testing session with navigation controls" />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting

**Tests failing unexpectedly**

* Try skipping then prompting again to test
* Check for dynamic content that might affect test timing
* Review test scenarios for accuracy

**Missing test coverage**

* Provide more detailed descriptions of your app's functionality
* Explicitly mention critical user flows that should be tested

**App Testing not working at all?**

* App Testing only works with web applications[\*](#how-app-testing-works) at this time

## Pricing and usage

App Testing is included as part of Agent's effort-based pricing model with important cost considerations:

* **Usage-based**: Testing is charged based on the effort spent (simpler tests are less expensive)
* **Cost vs. Benefit**: While testing costs money, it can save costs by avoiding additional prompts and extra work from Agent by catching mistakes earlier
* **Efficient Development**: Automated approach reduces the need for manual debugging and rework

<Tip>
  **Cost-Effective Testing**: Although App Testing adds to your usage costs, it often saves money overall by preventing the need for additional Agent sessions to fix issues that could have been caught during testing.
</Tip>

# Autonomy Level
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/autonomy-level

Control Agent's level of autonomy (how often it reviews its code & makes changes without intervention).

Autonomy Level lets you customize how independently Agent works on your project and how frequently it reviews its own code. Available in Agent Tools, this setting helps you balance speed, accuracy, and control based on your specific needs and project type.

<Tip>
  **New with Agent 3** - Autonomy Level gives you granular control over Agent's
  autonomy level, from hands-on guidance to extended autonomous development with
  comprehensive code review.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Autonomy Level settings in Agent Tools showing four levels: Low, Med, High, and Max Autonomy" />
</Frame>

## Features

Autonomy Level offers four distinct levels of Agent behavior, each designed for different use cases and workflows:

* **Low autonomy**: Minimal code review with hands-on control, similar to Agent v2
* **Medium autonomy**: Targeted code review on Agent's recent changes with improved accuracy (recommended for legacy projects & imports)
* **High autonomy**: Comprehensive code review on every change with broader context analysis (recommended for all new projects)
* **Max autonomy**: (Beta) Extended autonomous development with detailed task planning and execution

## Usage

Access Autonomy Level setting through Agent's tools interface when working on any project. The setting applies to your current conversation and affects how Agent approaches subsequent tasks.

<Accordion title="How to access Autonomy Level">
  1. Open Agent in your project workspace
  2. Look for the Agent tools dropdown in the bottom right of the input box
  3. Locate Autonomy Level control
  4. Select your preferred autonomy level
</Accordion>

### Autonomy Levels

<YouTubeEmbed title="Autonomy Levels overview" />

#### Low

**Best for**: Simple prompts and when you want maximum control over changes.

* No AI code review on Agent's work
* Most hands-on experience requiring your guidance
* Fastest execution for straightforward tasks
* Most similar to the Agent v2 experience

#### Medium (Default for existing projects)

**Best for**: Balanced workflows where you want some quality assurance without extended wait times.

* AI code review on specific changes Agent just made
* Helps improve code accuracy and catch common mistakes
* Moderate execution time with quality improvements
* Good balance of speed and reliability

#### High (Default for new projects)

**Best for**: Complex projects where code quality is critical and you want thorough analysis.

* AI code review on every change Agent makes
* Reviews adjacent files to find interconnected issues
* Longer execution time but higher code quality
* Works best on projects created with Agent v3
* May not work as well for imported existing projects or pre-Agent v3 projects with technical debt

#### Max Autonomy (Beta)

**Best for**: Extremely detailed prompts where you want Agent to work extensively with minimal supervision.

* Same code review frequency as High autonomy
* Agent creates more detailed task lists autonomously
* Finds and executes adjacent tasks without user input
* Can work for extended periods (up to 200 minutes)

### Choosing the Right Level

Consider these factors when selecting your autonomy level:

* **Project history**: New Agent v3 projects work better with higher autonomy than imported legacy projects
* **Time constraints**: Lower autonomy provides faster results for simple changes
* **Code quality**: Higher autonomy offers more thorough review and error detection

### Tips for Effective Use

* **Start conservative**: Begin with **Medium** or **High** autonomy and adjust based on results

# Native mobile apps
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/building-mobile-apps

Go from idea to App Store. Build a native mobile app with Agent, test on your phone, and publish with a guided flow.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Mobile app running in the Replit Workspace preview with the Preview on device panel and QR code" />
</Frame>

Build iOS and Android apps with Agent, preview them on your phone, and publish through a guided flow—without setting up local toolchains.

## Getting started

You can get to a working mobile app in a few steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a mobile app">
    On the Replit home screen, describe your app idea and select **Mobile app** as the app type.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Replit home screen prompt with Mobile app selected as the app type" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on your phone">
    Install Expo Go on your phone, then open a native preview:

    * **Desktop**: In your Workspace, select **Preview on mobile device**, then scan the QR code shown next to the preview.
    * **Mobile**: In the Replit Mobile App, tap **Open in Expo Go** at the top of the preview.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Replit Workspace showing the app preview and the Preview on mobile device option" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate with Agent">
    Ask Agent to add features, connect data sources, or integrate services. Keep testing on your phone as you iterate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The preview pane shows the web version of your app. Native features like haptics, glass effects, or platform-specific styling may only appear when you test on your phone with Expo Go.
</Tip>

## Why build a mobile app?

Build a mobile app when you want:

* **A native experience**: Fast performance, smooth interactions, and platform-native UI.
* **Device capabilities**: Camera, push notifications, location, and more.
* **App Store distribution**: A shareable listing that people can discover and install.

## Key features

* **AI-first creation**: Describe your app, and Agent scaffolds a working mobile app.
* **Device preview**: Test on your phone with Expo Go for a native experience.
* **Full-stack by default**: Add server routes, a Database, App Storage, Connectors, and AI integrations as your app grows.
* **Guided publishing**: Publish to App Store and submit builds without managing local iOS toolchains.

## Development workflow

There are three stages for accessing your app, each with different audiences and capabilities:

| Stage           | Who can access      | How to access                    | Best for               |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Development** | You                 | QR code in the Workspace console | Building and iterating |
| **Deploy**      | Anyone with Expo Go | Public URL with QR code          | Prototyping and demos  |
| **App Store**   | Anyone              | Download from App Store          | Production release     |

**Development**: When you click **Start App**, a QR code appears in the console. Scan it with Expo Go to preview on your device. The preview pane in your Workspace shows a web version, which may look slightly different from the native version on your phone.

**Deploy**: When you click **Publish**, Replit creates a public URL with a QR code. Anyone with Expo Go can scan it and run your app. This is ideal for prototyping—show investors, gather feedback, or test with friends before committing to the App Store.

**App Store**: When you submit to the App Store, users can download and install your app permanently. This requires an Apple Developer account and goes through Apple's review process.

## Publishing overview

When you publish for iOS, the flow typically goes:

* Publish from your Workspace
* Submit a build to TestFlight
* Promote a TestFlight build to the App Store in App Store Connect

<Note>
  To publish to TestFlight and submit to the App Store, Apple requires an Apple Developer Program membership.
</Note>

For a complete walkthrough, see the [Build and launch a mobile app](/tutorials/build-and-launch-a-mobile-app) tutorial.

## Build on the go

Your Replit environment runs in the cloud, not on your local machine. This means you can build mobile apps from anywhere—including from the [Replit Mobile App](/platforms/mobile-app). Open your project, prompt Agent, and tap **Open in Expo Go** to preview your changes on your phone.

## How the technology works

Your mobile app is built with a stack of technologies that work together. This section explains what powers your app and how the pieces fit together.

### The technology stack

<MobileStackDiagram />

* **React Native** is an open-source framework that lets you write one codebase and compile it to iOS, Android, and web. It renders platform-native UI components, not a webview.
* **Expo** simplifies React Native development by handling builds, managing native modules, and providing tools like Expo Go for previews.
* **Expo Go** is a free app you install on your phone. It runs your development preview so you can test on a real device without building a full native binary.

When you run your app, the Metro bundler compiles your code and pushes it to your device. The first build takes longer because there's no cache. Subsequent builds are faster.

### Architecture: server and client

When you publish a mobile app, you're deploying two things:

1. **A server** that runs on Replit in the cloud. This handles your database, API routes, AI integrations, and backend logic.
2. **A client app** that runs on the user's phone. This is the native app distributed through the App Store or Expo Go.

<MobileArchitectureDiagram />

This separation gives you flexibility. You can run complex logic on the server (where you have access to Replit's Database, Object Storage, and Connectors) and keep the client lightweight. As you build, think about what should happen on the phone versus what should happen in the cloud.

## Considerations

* **Publishing requirements**: Apple sets the requirements for TestFlight and the App Store.
* **Android publishing**: You can build cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Publishing to Google Play is not supported through a guided experience yet, but can be accomplished manually.
* **Native changes**: Changes like app icons or permissions usually require a new store build.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while developing your mobile app, see [Mobile app troubleshooting](/tutorials/mobile-app-troubleshooting) for common problems and solutions.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Expo?">
    Expo is what Agent uses to build your mobile app on Replit. It is an open-source platform and toolchain for building, running, and deploying cross-platform native apps with React Native. Learn more at [https://expo.dev](https://expo.dev).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is React Native?">
    React Native is an open-source framework from Meta for building native iOS and Android apps using React and JavaScript or TypeScript. It renders platform-native UI components (not a webview), so your app looks and feels native.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Expo Go?">
    Expo Go is a free app you install on your phone from the App Store or Google Play. It lets you preview your mobile app during development without building a full native binary. When you scan the QR code in your Workspace, Expo Go downloads and runs your app code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Expo Go and a dev build?">
    **Expo Go** is a pre-built app that runs your code. It's fast to set up but only supports modules included in the Expo SDK.

    **Dev builds** are custom native binaries that can include any native module. They require more setup (EAS Build or local Xcode/Android Studio) but offer more flexibility.

    Replit uses Expo Go for development previews. If you need native modules not supported in Expo Go, you may need to explore dev builds through [Expo's documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from a mobile-responsive web app?">
    A mobile-responsive web app is a website that adapts its layout in the browser. A React Native app is a native application installed on the device that uses platform APIs (camera, haptics, push notifications), offers better access to hardware and offline capabilities, and is distributed via app stores. Responsive web can be great for reach and zero-install; native is best when you need device features, performance, or App Store distribution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need a Mac or Xcode?">
    No. Replit and Expo manage the build process for you in the cloud.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I preview without an Apple Developer account?">
    Yes. You can preview with Expo Go. You only need an Apple Developer account when you're ready to publish to TestFlight or the App Store.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Android supported?">
    Yes. You can build cross-platform apps for iOS and Android from the same codebase. Preview on Android devices with Expo Go. Publishing to Google Play can be done manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about servers and databases?">
    Use Replit's built-in PostgreSQL, Object Storage, Connectors, and AI integrations—no separate infrastructure required. Your server runs on Replit and your mobile app connects to it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my app look different in the preview pane vs. on my phone?">
    The preview pane shows the web version of your app. Native iOS and Android features—like platform-specific styling, glass effects, or haptic feedback—only appear when you test on a real device with Expo Go. Always test on your phone for the most accurate preview.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Checkpoints and Rollbacks
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks

Learn how checkpoints automatically save your work and how rollbacks let you undo changes.

With Replit, you never have to worry about losing your work.

Replit's checkpoint and rollback system provides comprehensive version control and state management for your entire development environment.

When you use Replit Agent, checkpoints automatically capture your complete project state. This includes not just your code changes, but workspace contents, AI conversation context, and connected databases.

## What are checkpoints?

A **checkpoint** is a complete snapshot of your Replit App state created automatically by Agent at key development milestones. Unlike traditional version control that only tracks code changes, Replit checkpoints capture your entire development context.

Think of checkpoints as save points in a video game - you can always go back to a working version of your app.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent checkpoint interface showing rollback options" />
</Frame>

### Complete state capture

Each checkpoint preserves:

* **Workspace contents**: All files, directories, installed packages, and project configuration
* **AI conversation context**: The complete conversation history and context that led to current state
* **Environment configuration**: Runtime settings and publishing configurations
* **Agent memory**: The AI's understanding of your project architecture, preferences, and patterns
* **Database contents**: The data and schema of your database at the time of checkpoint creation

This comprehensive approach means you can confidently experiment with changes, knowing you can restore not just your code, but your entire development context.

## How rollbacks work

**Rollback** functionality allows you to restore your Replit App to any previous checkpoint state with a single click. This is far more powerful than traditional Git revert operations.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Checkpoint rollback interface showing rollback options" />
</Frame>

Rollbacks are designed to be safe and predictable:

* **Non-destructive preview**: Some interfaces allow you to preview checkpoint states before rolling back
* **Clear boundaries**: Each checkpoint represents a logical development milestone
* **Conversation continuity**: AI context is preserved, so you can continue building from the restored state
* **Immediate effect**: Rollbacks apply instantly across your entire development environment

### Rolling back

When you roll back to a previous checkpoint, your project returns to that earlier state, including:

1. **Complete workspace state**: All files in your workspace return to their exact state at the selected checkpoint
2. **AI conversation context**: Agent conversations are restored to the point of the checkpoint, maintaining context continuity
3. **Project configuration**: Dependencies, packages, and runtime configurations
4. **Development environment**: Tool configurations and workspace settings
5. **Database contents (optional)**: When selected, your database will be restored to the state it was at the time of the checkpoint

<Info>
  By default, rollbacks do not change your database. To include your development database in a rollback, select "Database" in "Additional rollback options."

  Note that restoring your **[production database](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/production-databases)** is not performed automatically through this rollback feature.
  To learn how to restore your production database to an earlier moment in time, see [the documentation for how to perform a point-in-time restore](/cloud-services/storage-and-databases/production-databases/#point-in-time-restore).
</Info>

<Warning>
  When you use the rollback feature, you restore the Replit App to a previous state. This removes all changes made after that point, including code edits. Database changes are also reverted if you choose to restore your database.
</Warning>

### Rolling forward

Checkpoints in Replit work bidirectionally—you can move both backward and forward through your project's history.
This gives you complete flexibility to navigate your development timeline without fear of losing work.

If you've rolled back too far or want to recover changes from a later checkpoint, you can **roll forward** to move ahead in your checkpoint history. This allows you to navigate freely through your project's timeline without losing work.

To roll forward, access the history view in the Agent tab by clicking the history icon <img alt="history icon" />, then select a checkpoint that occurs after your current position.

<Info>
  Rolling forward is only possible if you have checkpoints ahead of your current position in the timeline. Once you make new changes after a rollback, those future checkpoints become part of an alternate branch of history.
</Info>

This bidirectional navigation gives you complete control over your project's timeline, ensuring your work is always recoverable.

## Checkpoint creation

Checkpoints are created automatically by Replit's AI tools at strategic moments during development.

### Agent checkpoints

[Replit Agent](/replitai/agent) creates checkpoints when:

* **Feature completion**: After successfully implementing a requested feature or functionality
* **Major milestones**: When significant progress is made on complex tasks
* **Stable states**: After testing and validation of implemented changes
* **Error recovery**: Before attempting fixes for critical issues

### Checkpoint characteristics

Every checkpoint includes:

* **AI-generated descriptions**: Clear, descriptive summaries of what was accomplished
* **Timestamp information**: Precise creation time for easy identification
* **Change scope**: Indication of files, features, or systems modified
* **Billing information**: For Agent, transparent cost tracking per checkpoint

## Using checkpoints and rollbacks

### Finding checkpoints

Checkpoints appear in multiple locations throughout your Replit workspace:

**Agent tab**: View all Agent-created checkpoints with descriptions and rollback options
**Git pane**: See checkpoints as Git commits with full version control integration
**History view**: In Agent chat, click the history icon <img alt="history icon" /> to access a complete timeline of all checkpoints and their progression

### Performing rollbacks

The rollback process varies slightly depending on where you initiate it:

#### From Agent tab

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent">
    Open the **Agent** tab in your workspace to view all Agent-created checkpoints.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select checkpoint">
    Locate the checkpoint you want to restore and select **Rollback to here**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm rollback">
    Review the rollback warning and confirm to restore your app to the selected state.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify restoration">
    Check that your workspace, database, and AI context match the restored checkpoint state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best practices

**Use checkpoints strategically**:

* Test your app after each major checkpoint to ensure stability
* Create manual Git commits for long-term version tracking alongside automatic checkpoints
* Review checkpoint descriptions to understand what changed

**Rollback considerations**:

* Always verify the scope of changes before rolling back
* Consider the impact on your database and external integrations
* Communicate rollbacks to collaborators to maintain team awareness

**Iterative development**:

* Build incrementally to take advantage of frequent checkpoints
* Use rollbacks to explore different implementation approaches safely
* Leverage AI context preservation to continue conversations after rollbacks

## Integration with version control

Checkpoints work seamlessly with Replit's broader version control ecosystem:

### Git integration

* **Git commit generation**: Each checkpoint creates a corresponding Git commit
* **Branch compatibility**: Checkpoints respect branch structure and merging workflows
* **Remote sync**: GitHub integration maintains checkpoint synchronization
* **Command line access**: Full Git functionality remains available alongside checkpoints

### Collaboration features

* **Team visibility**: Checkpoints are visible to all project collaborators
* **Merge conflict prevention**: Checkpoint timing reduces likelihood of conflicts
* **Shared context**: AI conversation context helps team members understand changes
* **Real-time updates**: Collaborators see checkpoint creation in real-time

## Advanced features

### Checkpoint previews

Some interfaces support checkpoint preview functionality:

* **Visual comparison**: See your app's appearance at different checkpoint states
* **Non-destructive exploration**: Preview without actually rolling back
* **Progress tracking**: Understand how your app evolved over time
* **Iteration comparison**: Compare different implementation approaches

### Cross-session rollbacks

For advanced builders and team administrators:

* **Extended history**: Access checkpoints across multiple development sessions
* **Administrative control**: Team admins can perform rollbacks across user sessions
* **Audit trails**: Complete history of checkpoint creation and rollback actions

## Use cases

### Experimental development

Checkpoints enable fearless experimentation:

* Try new features knowing you can easily revert
* Test different architectural approaches
* Explore alternative UI designs or user flows
* Implement complex integrations with safety nets

### Debugging and recovery

When issues arise, checkpoints provide reliable recovery:

* Roll back to working states when bugs are introduced
* Isolate problems by comparing checkpoint states
* Restore database integrity after data corruption
* Recover from accidental deletions or modifications

### Learning and iteration

Checkpoints support educational development:

* Compare different implementation strategies
* Learn from AI decision-making process through checkpoint progression
* Build understanding by exploring how features evolved
* Practice new techniques with rollback safety

# Connectors for Organizations
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/connectors-for-organizations

Centralize and manage app connectors across Teams and Enterprise Workspaces with admin controls, scoped permissions, and audit tracking.

Connectors for Organizations bring centralized, admin-managed connections to Teams and Enterprise Workspaces. Admins set up and manage connections once, then make them available to apps across the organization. This removes repetitive setup for builders, improves security for IT, and standardizes access to tools like Notion, GitHub, Google, Outlook, Dropbox, Salesforce, and more.

## Key capabilities

* **Centralized management**: Admin setup and approval for organization-wide connections
* **Role-based access controls**: Enforce scoped, least-privilege permissions
* **Visibility and audit tracking**: Track which apps use which services
* **Bring your own OAuth** (Enterprise only): Use organization-owned OAuth clients with custom scopes
* **Per-app consent and easy revocation**

Design Mode creates interactive front-end designs and websites in under 2 minutes. Powered by Gemini 3, it delivers better design quality than ever before on Replit, and in less time.

<Tip>
  **New: Powered by Gemini 3** - Design Mode uses Google's latest Gemini 3 model, delivering superior visual quality and faster results than ever before on Replit. Experience the best-looking designs we've ever produced.
</Tip>

<YouTubeEmbed />

## What is Design Mode?

Design Mode is built for two primary use cases:

### 1. Visual design & rapid prototyping

**Perfect for:** PMs, designers, and product teams

Create beautiful interactive front-end prototypes to speed up product development and improve handoff between product, design, and engineering. Show stakeholders clickable demos instead of static mockups or lengthy PRDs.

### 2. Simple websites & landing pages

**Perfect for:** Entrepreneurs, local businesses, professionals who need a personal site

Build beautiful, professional websites in under 2 minutes. Deploy on a custom domain and iterate quickly without technical complexity.

## Why Design Mode?

Design Mode addresses key pain points that made Replit too slow or not good enough for rapid visual work:

* **Faster first results**: Get to your first visual checkpoint in under 2 minutes (previously \~10 minutes for full apps)
* **Faster iteration**: Make visual changes instantly without rebuilding backend logic
* **Better design quality**: Built with Gemini 3 for superior visual output—better looking than previous Replit designs and competitive with dedicated design tools
* **Purpose-built for visuals**: No backend overhead means rapid prototyping that was previously too slow on Replit

## Key capabilities

* **Under 2 minutes**: Go from prompt to live interactive design
* **Powered by Gemini 3**: Optimized for speed and superior visual quality
* **Instant deployment**: Publish as a static site with zero build time
* **Quick iteration**: Make visual changes without backend complexity
* **One-click conversion**: Upgrade to a full app when you need backend functionality

<Info>
  Design Mode creates front-end only designs—no backend, databases, or integrations. If you request functionality (like login), Agent will mock up the visuals without building the backend, keeping you focused on fast design iteration.
</Info>

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from the homepage">
    Navigate to the Replit homepage and select the **Design** tab.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Replit homepage showing App and Design tabs with text input for creating designs" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your design">
    Enter a description of what you want to create. Be specific about visual style, layout, and content.

    Example prompts:

    * "Create a modern landing page for a fitness app with a hero section, features, and pricing"
    * "Design a portfolio site with a project gallery and contact form"
    * "Build a personal website for a local bakery with menu and contact info"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent builds your design">
    Agent creates your interactive design in under 2 minutes, focusing on visual quality and user experience. No backend functionality is built—just beautiful front-end design.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and iterate quickly">
    Make visual changes instantly by chatting with Agent or using Visual Editor. Refine colors, layouts, content, and styles without backend rebuild delays.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Convert to full app">
    If you request functionality (like login or a database), Agent will mock up the visuals and show a **"Convert to App"** button. Click it to add backend capabilities to your design in the same Repl. You can also start converting your app by pressing the "Design" text that appears on the top of the Agent pane.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Convert to App button shown by Agent when functionality is requested" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      **Core and Teams only**: Converting a Design to a full app (graduating from Design to Build) requires a Core or Teams subscription. Starter users can create and deploy Designs but cannot convert them to full apps with backend functionality.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What's included vs. not included in Design Mode

**Included:**

* Beautiful, responsive UI components (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
* Professional styling and visual polish
* Fast-loading static pages
* Mock visuals for any feature (e.g., login screens without actual authentication)

**Not included (front-end only):**

* Backend logic, APIs, or server-side processing
* Databases or data storage
* Functional user authentication
* Server-side functionality

<Tip>
  When you ask for functionality, Agent will mock up the visuals (e.g., a login screen) and show a **"Convert to App"** button to upgrade when you're ready.
</Tip>

## Sharing and deploying designs

### Deploying and sharing

Deploy your design instantly as a static site:

1. Click **Deploy** in your workspace
2. Your design deploys in seconds
3. Share the URL with stakeholders, users, or on social media

<Info>
  Designs use [static deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments)—extremely fast and cost-effective. If you convert to a full app with backend features, you'll need to switch to autoscale deployments.
</Info>

Perfect for user testing, stakeholder presentations, and gathering feedback before investing in full development.

# Fast Mode
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/fast-mode

Make targeted changes in seconds with Agent's Fast mode. Up to 5x faster and typically cheaper per prompt than autonomous mode.

Fast mode is a lightning-quick version of Replit Agent optimized for targeted changes. Get visual tweaks, bug fixes, and reasonable-sized features in 10-60 seconds instead of waiting minutes. Perfect for rapid iteration and pair programming.

## What is Fast Mode?

Fast mode is a specialized Agent experience designed for speed and precision. While the full Agent excels at creating comprehensive applications and implementing complex features, Fast mode focuses on quick, scoped changes that don't require extensive planning or testing.

<Note>
  **Fast mode requires an existing app or project.** Use Fast mode to make changes within apps you've already created. To build a new app from scratch, use the full Agent experience.
</Note>

Think of Fast mode as your pair programming partner for those moments when you need focused changes within your existing app. It's built to keep you in flow without having to step away from your computer while waiting for longer builds to complete.

Fast mode is primarily accessed via the lightning bolt (⚡) icon in the Agent prompt box, and can also be toggled through the Autonomy level control in Agent Tools.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent input box showing the lightning bolt Fast mode icon available for selection" />
</Frame>

## When to Use Fast Mode

Fast mode is ideal for:

* **Visual tweaks**: Adjusting colors, spacing, fonts, or layout elements
* **Reasonable-sized features**: Adding search bars, creating loading states, building form validation, or adding sorting functionality
* **Quick fixes**: Correcting typos, fixing broken links, or addressing minor bugs
* **Rapid iteration**: Making a series of focused changes while actively developing
* **Scoped updates**: When you know exactly what you want changed and don't need extensive planning

Fast mode may not be suitable for:

* **Creating new apps**: Fast mode only works within existing apps—use full Agent to start from scratch
* **Complex features**: Multi-file changes that require architectural decisions
* **Large-scale refactoring**: Restructuring code across multiple components
* **New integrations**: Adding third-party APIs or services
* **Database schema changes**: Modifying data structures or relationships

For these larger tasks, use the full Agent experience which includes comprehensive planning, testing, and validation.

## Features

Fast mode delivers a streamlined development experience with the following capabilities:

* **Lightning-fast execution**: Complete most changes in 10-60 seconds
* **Targeted modifications**: Makes only the changes you request without expanding scope
* **Cost-effective development**: Typically cheaper per prompt than autonomous mode
* **Real-time pair programming**: Stay at your computer and keep building without long waits
* **Predictable results**: Focused changes mean fewer surprises and more control

## How to Use Fast Mode

### Primary Access: Lightning Bolt Button

The quickest way to toggle Fast mode is using the lightning bolt (⚡) icon in the Agent prompt box:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent input box with Fast mode enabled, showing 'Quick, lightweight changes' text and highlighted lightning bolt icon" />
</Frame>

1. Open Agent in your Replit App
2. Click the ⚡ icon in the prompt box to enable Fast mode
3. Make your request—keep it focused and specific
4. Toggle off when you need full Agent for complex tasks

### Alternative Access: Agent Tools

You can also access Fast mode from Agent Tools:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent Tools panel showing Fast mode option with 'Make lightweight changes, quickly' description and Autonomous option below with autonomy level controls" />
</Frame>

Open the Agent Tools panel and select **Fast** from the options. Fast mode and Autonomous mode are two distinct approaches: choose Fast when you want quick results while staying at your computer, or Autonomous when you prefer more reliable, longer builds and can step away for a few minutes or more.

### Example Prompts

**Good for Fast mode:**

* "Change the submit button text from 'Send' to 'Submit Application'"
* "Increase the padding in the card component to 24px"
* "Add email validation to the signup form"
* "Make the sidebar background color darker"
* "Add a search bar to filter the product list"
* "Create a loading spinner when data is fetching"

**Use full Agent for:**

* "Build a new todo app from scratch"
* "Redesign the entire user dashboard"
* "Add user authentication with Replit Auth"
* "Integrate Stripe payment processing"
* "Add a Linear connector"

## How Fast Mode Works

Fast mode uses a streamlined version of Agent's AI technology that's optimized for speed and scoped changes:

1. **Focused analysis**: Fast mode analyzes only the relevant files for your specific request
2. **Direct implementation**: Makes changes immediately without extensive planning phases
3. **Streamlined execution**: Skips comprehensive testing and architecture review for faster results
4. **Quick validation**: Performs basic checks to ensure changes don't break existing functionality

This approach allows Fast mode to deliver results up to 5x faster for scoped requests while maintaining quality for the types of focused, well-defined changes it's designed to handle.

### What's Different in Fast Mode

To achieve faster speeds, Fast mode disables certain features:

**Disabled in Fast mode:**

* **Autonomy levels**: Fast mode and Autonomous mode are mutually exclusive—choose Fast for speed or Autonomous for reliability
* **App Testing**: No automated browser testing
* **Architect**: No architectural analysis

**Still available:**

* **Web search**: Access real-time information
* **Other Agent tools**: File operations, code editing, image generation, and more

<Note>
  **Starter plan users can only use Fast Mode**: To try the full Autonomous mode, you will need to be on a paid plan.
</Note>

## Pricing

Fast mode offers cost-effective pricing that's typically cheaper per prompt than using autonomous mode. The exact cost depends on the complexity and scope of your request, but Fast mode's streamlined approach means you'll generally pay less for focused, scoped changes.

<Note>
  **Effort-based pricing**: Fast mode uses the same effort-based pricing model as full Agent. Because Fast mode completes tasks more quickly and with a more focused scope, the total cost per request is typically lower than using autonomous mode for the same change.
</Note>

For detailed information about AI pricing and how effort is calculated, see [AI billing](/billing/ai-billing).

## Use Cases

**Visual iteration**: Quickly try different colors, spacing, and layouts while actively designing

**Reasonable-sized features**: Add scoped functionality like search filters, form validation, or loading states

**Bug fixes**: Polish details rapidly before launch

## Comparison: Fast Mode vs. Full Agent

| Feature         | Fast Mode                      | Full Agent                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Speed**       | 10-60 seconds                  | 3-10+ minutes                     |
| **Best for**    | Targeted, scoped changes       | Complex features and full apps    |
| **Scope**       | Focused, well-defined requests | Multi-file, architectural changes |
| **Testing**     | Basic validation               | Comprehensive App Testing         |

# General Agent
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/general-agent

General Agent is a powerful variant of Replit Agent designed to work with any project type or framework, offering enhanced flexibility and broader workflow support

<Frame>
  <img alt="General Agent hero illustration" />
</Frame>

General Agent is an advanced feature that allows you to use *any* framework with Replit Agent. That means you can build with your favorite projects or workflows. This comes with some risk: not all projects will work on the first try, but it means that you can now use Agent on any new or existing project that runs on Replit.

## How to access General Agent

You can get General Agent for your project in three ways:

1. **Select "General" before writing a prompt** on the Replit main page
2. **Choose any [Developer Framework](https://replit.com/templates)** - All Developer Frameworks now automatically include General Agent (including historical Apps made from Developer Frameworks)
3. **[Import](/replit-app/import-to-replit) from GitHub** - Projects imported from GitHub that aren't previous Replit, Lovable, or Figma projects automatically get General Agent (including historical GitHub imports)

## What makes General Agent different

<YouTubeEmbed />

General Agent has three key differences from the standard Replit Agent:

### Flexible guardrails

General Agent doesn't have the specialized technology rules that act as guardrails on standard Agent behavior. When you ask for something, General Agent makes its best effort to fulfill your request.

### Enhanced toolset

General Agent has access to more tools for configuring your Replit environment and project setup, allowing it to handle:

* Complex workflows
* Custom run configurations
* Environment setup
* Dependency management
* And much more

### Manual publishing configuration

<Note>
  Unlike the regular Replit Agent with pre-configured environment, publishing, and run commands:  General Agent will setup its own environment and run commands based on your request and it will require you to ask it to configure publishing. While more powerful, this means your experience may vary.
</Note>

## Supported workflows

General Agent can handle a wide variety of workflows, including:

* **Alternative web frameworks** like Angular or Vue
* **Different programming languages** like Rust, C#, or Go
* **Alternative databases** (Note: Database rollbacks for non-Replit Databases are not supported, so proceed carefully)
* **Command-line tools** including Rust CLIs or terminal-based user interfaces (TUIs)
* **Desktop applications** using Python tkinter or Godot games

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or import your project">
    Use one of the three methods above to get a project with General Agent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe what you want to build">
    Tell General Agent about your project goals in natural language
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate and refine">
    Work with General Agent to configure your environment and setup exactly how you want it
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to expect

The setup process with General Agent varies depending on your project's tech stack, complexity, and requirements:

* **Single-shot setup**: Sometimes General Agent configures everything in one go
* **Iterative collaboration**: You may need to work with General Agent through multiple rounds to get the setup exactly right
* **Technology limitations**: Under the hood, Replit uses Nix for managing packages. Some technologies may not be supported in the Nix environment or may be difficult to work with modern LLM agents.

Your milage may vary, but you have the power to try out whatever you like!  General Agent offers significantly more power and flexibility, making it ideal for builders who want to work with diverse technologies and complex project requirements, and are comfortable with occasional debugging.


# Image generation
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/image-generation

Generate AI images directly in Replit and seamlessly integrate them into your projects with Agent's image generation capabilities.

Create visual content for your applications using Agent's image generation <img alt="Image generation icon" /> capabilities.

| **Marketing visuals**   | "Generate a hero image for my landing page"                   |
| **Product mockups**     | "Create mockup images of my app running on different devices" |

### Best practices for image generation

Follow these guidelines to get the best results from Agent's image generation:

**Be specific and descriptive**

* Include details about style, colors, composition, and mood
* Specify dimensions or aspect ratios when relevant
* Mention the intended use (icon, background, illustration, etc.)

**Iterate and refine**

* Start with a basic description and refine based on results
* Ask Agent to modify specific aspects of generated images
* Request variations to explore different creative directions

**Consider your project's style**

* Maintain visual consistency across your app
* Specify style preferences that match your brand or design system
* Ask for images that complement your existing visual elements

### Example prompts

Try these example prompts to get started with image generation:

<AiPrompt>
  Generate a clean, modern icon for my task management app.
  The icon should be circular with a gradient background from blue to purple,
  featuring a simple checkmark symbol in white.
  Make it suitable for use as an app icon.
</AiPrompt>

<AiPrompt>
  Create a hero illustration for my coding tutorial website.
  Show a friendly cartoon character sitting at a computer with code on the screen.
  Use a warm color palette with blues and oranges.
  The style should be approachable and encouraging for beginners.
</AiPrompt>

<AiPrompt>
  Generate a set of pixel art enemies for my retro-style platformer game.
  I need a flying bat, a walking mushroom, and a jumping slime.
  Each should be 32x32 pixels with a limited color palette of 8 colors.
  Make them cute but slightly menacing.
</AiPrompt>

### Project integration

Agent seamlessly integrates generated images into your codebase:

* **Automatic file creation**: Generated images are saved directly to your project files
* **Code updates**: Agent updates your code to reference the new image files
* **Asset organization**: Images are placed in logical directories within your project structure

This streamlined workflow means you can generate and implement visual content without leaving your development environment.

<Note>
  Replit's image generation is powered by [Google's Imagen 4](https://deepmind.google/models/imagen/), a state-of-the-art text-to-image model that excels at creating high-quality, photorealistic images with fine details and improved text rendering capabilities.

# Agent integrations
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/integrations

Agent supports numerous integrations enabled automatically when your prompt contains specific keywords.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent logo with integration connections illustrated around it" />
</Frame>

Agent supports three types of integrations so you can go from idea to app, fast:

* **Replit managed**: Built-in integrations that work automatically. Create an app and your Agent can start using these right away.
* **Connectors**: First-party integrations Replit supports. Sign in once, then build with them across your apps.
* **External integrations**: Trusted third-party services you can build with. Ask Agent to set them up; you'll provide API keys.

<Note>
  **Core and Teams only**: Third-party connectors require a Core or Teams subscription. Starter plan users can use Replit-managed integrations like databases, authentication, etc.
</Note>

## Getting started

To use an integration, mention the service or functionality you need. For example:

<AiPrompt>
  Create a web app that uses Stripe to accept payments and SendGrid to send confirmation emails
</AiPrompt>

Agent automatically detects these keywords and implements the necessary code and configuration.

## Replit managed integrations

These built-ins require no setup. Just ask Agent to use them.

# Figma MCP integration
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/mcp/figma

Connect Agent to your Figma files via MCP to explore layers, extract design data, capture screenshots, and generate starter code from designs.

Use Agent with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to work with your Figma designs directly in chat. Paste a Figma link to explore layers, extract variables and components, capture screenshots, and generate code from selected frames.

<Note>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> A Figma <strong>Dev</strong> or <strong>Full</strong> seat is required for Agent chat features. The import flow at <a href="/getting-started/quickstarts/import-from-figma">replit.com/import</a> does not require a seat.
</Note>

<Callout>
  Want to turn a Figma design into a new app? See the <a href="/getting-started/quickstarts/import-from-figma">Import from Figma quickstart</a>.
</Callout>

<Note>
  The Figma MCP integration uses a <strong>remote server</strong>—you do not need the Figma desktop app running or installed to use this feature in Agent.
</Note>

## Features

* **Generate starter code**: Turn selected frames into production-ready code to bootstrap features or iterate faster.
* **Extract design data**: Access variables, components, and layout specifications defined in your file.
* **Capture frame screenshots**: Create visual references from any frame to guide implementation.
* **Inspect MCP activity**: Expand chat events to view raw requests and responses.

## Demo

Watch a quick walkthrough of the workflow from link detection to code generation:

<Frame>
  <video />
</Frame>

## Usage

### Connect in Agent chat

1. Open Agent chat in your workspace.
2. Paste a valid Figma file or prototype link into the message box.
3. When a valid link is detected, a <strong>Figma design</strong> card appears. Click <strong>Log in with Figma</strong> to authorize.

After pasting a supported link, Agent shows a Figma design card for quick authorization:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Connect Figma card appears in Agent chat when a valid Figma link is pasted" />
</Frame>

### Work with Figma links

Use link-based workflows to act on precise parts of your design:

1. In Figma, copy the link to any frame or layer.
2. Share the URL with Agent in the chat box and describe what you want.

In Figma, copy a link to the exact frame or layer you want Agent to work with:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Selecting a frame in Figma" />
</Frame>

Then paste the link into Agent along with a short instruction (for example, “generate React for this frame”):

<Frame>
  <img alt="Sharing the URL with Agent in the chat box" />
</Frame>

### View MCP calls

Open the timeline event labeled <strong>Used Figma MCP (Beta)</strong> to see the underlying requests and responses.

Here is where to expand the timeline event to inspect MCP calls:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Expanded chat event showing MCP calls to the Figma integration" />
</Frame>

<Callout>
  MCP access to Figma is read‑oriented and respects your Figma permissions. If a file is private or you lack access, the integration cannot fetch content.
</Callout>

### Manage connections

Manage or disconnect the Figma integration at <a href="https://replit.com/integrations">replit.com/integrations</a>.

Find and manage connections from your workspace integrations:

# MCP install links
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/mcp/install-links

Generate direct install links for Model Context Protocol servers.

Install links let users add your MCP server to Replit with a single click. Share these links in your documentation, README files, or anywhere you want to promote your integration.

## Generate a link

Use this form to generate an install link and badge for your MCP server:

<McpLinkGenerator />

## Link format

Install links use a base64-encoded JSON payload containing your server configuration:

```
https://replit.com/integrations?mcp={payload}
```

The payload includes:

* **displayName**: The name shown to users during installation
* **baseUrl**: Your MCP server's HTTPS endpoint
* **headers**: Optional authentication headers

```json theme={null}
{
  "displayName": "My MCP Server",
  "baseUrl": "https://example.com/mcp",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Authorization",
      "value": "Bearer your-token"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using badges

Add a clickable badge to your README or documentation that installs your MCP server when clicked.

```markdown theme={null}
[![Install My MCP](https://replit.com/badge?caption=Install%20My%20MCP)](https://replit.com/integrations?mcp={payload})
```

<Frame>
  ![Install MCP Badge](https://replit.com/badge?caption=Install%20MCP%20Server)
</Frame>

You can customize the badge caption (maximum 30 characters) by URL-encoding the text in the `caption` parameter.


# MCP Servers Overview
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/mcp/overview

Learn how to connect Replit Agent to external tools with the Model Context Protocol.

Replit Agent can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>, an open standard for integrations between AI tooling providers. MCP servers let Agent leverage context and tools from external services, databases, and APIs.

Use the **MCP servers** section in the Integrations pane to connect any remote MCP server. Once connected, Agent automatically loads the tools each server makes available and will use them when appropriate.

## MCP servers section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the MCP servers section">
    Go to <a href="https://replit.com/integrations">Integrations Page</a>, then scroll down to <strong>MCP Servers for Replit Agent</strong> to view existing servers or add a new one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an MCP server">
    Click <strong>Add MCP server</strong> and provide a recognizable name so Agent can reference the server in chat logs.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="showing the MCP servers section in the integrations pane" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test & Save">
    Enter the server URL and authentication details, then select **Test & Save**. This will attempt to connect to the server and guide you through the authentication flow if required.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="showing the MCP server setup" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once saved, the connection appears under <strong>MCP servers</strong> with its connection status. You can remove it at any time from the same pane by clicking the "Manage" button.

## Use MCP tools in Agent

After a connection is active, Agent automatically fetches the server's tool list and makes its capabilities available in chat for all your projects. To get started, just ask the agent to use the MCP server by mentioning the display name you configured during setup.

<Frame>
  <img alt="showing the MCP server being used" />
</Frame>

## Security protections

All custom MCP traffic passes through Replit's security scanner. The scanner evaluates tool definitions and planned executions, blocking suspicious or unsafe tools before they run. If a tool is rejected, Agent will inform you about it.

## Authentication options

* **OAuth dynamic client registration**: If the server supports OAuth DCR, Replit automatically detects and registers the client for you.
* **Custom headers**: Define one or more header name and value pairs (for example, `X-API-Key`). Replit includes these headers in every MCP request so your server can verify the caller.

## Explore MCP resources

* [Browse the MCP directory](/replitai/mcp/directory) for featured server integrations.
* [Grab install links](/replitai/mcp/install-links) to quickly share tested MCP server connections.


# Message Queue
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/message-queue

Schedule follow-up tasks for Replit Agent while it's working. Queue messages to be executed in order after each Agent work loop completion.

The Message Queue is a new way of interacting with Replit Agent while it's working.
Instead of interrupting ongoing work, you can schedule follow-up tasks that will be executed in
order after every completion of an Agent work loop.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Message Queue interface showing queued messages in the chat UI" />
</Frame>

## How it works

When the Agent is actively handling a request, you can schedule a follow-up task by adding
messages to the Queue. These tasks or requests will be processed in order after every completion of
an Agent work loop. The queue is automatically cleared when Agent finishes all tasks.

All message options are available with the Queue, such as [Visual Editor](/replitai/visual-editor)
and file attachments.

<Info>
  Queued messages will only be processed automatically while you have an active
  workspace connected to the Agent (either on desktop or mobile).
</Info>

## Using the Message Queue

### When the Queue appears

The Message Queue appears automatically as a drawer above the chat input when you submit a message
while Agent is working. It closes once all queued messages are processed.

### Managing queued messages

When the queue drawer is open, you can:

* **Edit messages**: Click the edit icon to modify a queued message before it's processed
* **Delete messages**: Remove unwanted tasks from the queue
* **Reorder items**: Drag and drop to change the execution order of queued messages
* **Add more messages**: Continue adding new tasks to the queue via the chat input

<Frame>
  <img alt="Message Queue edit interaction" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Message Queue reordering interaction" />
</Frame>

### Immediate interruption

If you need to interrupt Agent and send a message immediately, you can use the **Pause** button
in the status bar. This will stop the current Agent work loop and allow you to send an immediate
message, bypassing any queued messages (if any exist).

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent status bar showing the Pause button for immediate interruption" />
</Frame>

## Best practices

### When to use the Message Queue

* **Multi-step workflows**: Queue a series of related tasks that build upon each other
* **Batch operations**: Group similar requests together for efficient processing
* **Follow-up requests**: Add clarifications or additional requirements after the initial task
* **Non-urgent tasks**: Queue lower-priority requests while Agent works on critical tasks

### When to use immediate interruption

* **Urgent changes**: When you need to stop current work immediately
* **Critical errors**: If you notice an issue that needs immediate attention
* **Change of direction**: When you want to completely change what Agent is working on

## Queue behavior

* **Ordered execution**: Messages are processed in the order they were added to the queue
* **Work loop completion**: Each queued message is processed after Agent completes its current work loop
* **Context preservation**: Agent maintains context between queued messages in the same conversation


# Open in Replit
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/open-in-replit

Build a new Replit App with a link from your app or website.

<Frame>
  <div>
    <a href="https://replit.com/?stack=Build&prompt=A4Jw9gtsAuQ&referrer=replit-docs">
      <img alt="Open in Replit" />
    </a>
  </div>
</Frame>

## Building a link

To build a link, use the format below.

```
https://replit.com/?stack=Build&prompt=A4Jw9gtsAuQ&referrer=replit-docs
```

### URL parameters

Make sure to include the following parameters in your URL.

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             | Required/Optional |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `stack`    | string | The build mode to use. Must be either `Design` or `Build`. `Design` opens [Design Mode](/replitai/design-mode) for visual prototyping. `Build` opens [Agent](/replitai/agent) for full app development. | Required          |
| `prompt`   | string | Text describing the application to build, **compressed using [LZ-string](https://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/lz-string/index.html)**. The uncompressed prompt can be up to 50,000 characters.                | Required          |
| `referrer` | string | The name or URL of the page containing this link. Used for attribution.                                                                                                                                 | Optional          |

<Note>
  The `prompt` parameter must be compressed using LZ-string compression before
  being added to the URL. This helps URLs remain within browser length limits
  and parse correctly.
</Note>

### Interactive link builder

Use the tool below to generate your **Open in Replit** link. Enter your prompt, select the stack mode, and the link will be generated automatically with LZ-string compression applied.

<CreateUrlLinkBuilder />

### Compressing prompts

To create a valid **Open in Replit** link, you must compress your prompt using LZ-string compression. Here's how:

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript theme={null}
import LZString from 'lz-string';

const prompt = 'Create a todo app with a clean, modern design';
const compressed = LZString.compressToEncodedURIComponent(prompt);
const url = `https://replit.com/?stack=Design&prompt=${compressed}`;
```

#### Python

```python theme={null}
import lzstring

prompt = "Create a todo app with a clean, modern design"
compressed = lzstring.LZString().compressToEncodedURIComponent(prompt)
url = f"https://replit.com/?stack=Design&prompt={compressed}"
```

<Tip>
  Use `compressToEncodedURIComponent` to ensure the compressed string is
  URL-safe.
</Tip>

### Examples

**Design Mode with basic prompt**

```
https://replit.com/?stack=Design&prompt=AoUwTgzg9gdghgGwAQAcpgC4DMoIJZRIR4YgB0QA
```

**Build Mode with detailed prompt**

```
https://replit.com/?stack=Build&prompt=LIQw1gpgBCUE4HsQBMC2IAOUMBsQDt8BLfAcygBcEEcoB3ACwjmg0WQFcBjCqdfEKWYBnKFwJiWICtALIoANyLCOIHEQBe0AI6q4MuDgCe2dt16IU6DMIB0UAJL4uODsmjI4g0iABGOaHE4ZFEAMwQ4KBIiCiJpIgUIYQAaUyIImJMKQRSYfHkuGgixBGQScl8siBBUewARJKJSfCjeOhiGGFMEUKThdIFaWNQIdXxoJQg6PIKAglTUUuYWgFUHWyA&referrer=replit%20docs
```

## Stack modes

### Design Mode

Use `stack=Design` to open your prompt in [Design Mode](/replitai/design-mode), which is optimized for:

* Visual design and UI prototyping
* Rapid iteration on layouts and styling
* Creating design mockups
* Frontend-focused development

### Build Mode

Use `stack=Build` to open your prompt in [Agent](/replitai/agent), which is optimized for:

* Full-stack application development
* Backend logic and APIs
* Database integration
* Complex functionality and features

## Best practices

* Keep prompts concise and focused on core features for best generation results.
* Use clear, descriptive language that explains what you want to build.
* Choose the appropriate `stack` mode for your use case (Design for UI/UX, Build for full apps).
* Test your compressed URLs to ensure they parse correctly before sharing.
* Consider your audience's technical level when crafting prompts.

### User authentication

Regardless of your Replit authentication state, you'll need to provide input before creating the app. Usually this means submitting the prompt.

### Error handling

If the URL is malformed or parameters are invalid, Replit won't fill the prompt. Possible causes include:

* Missing required parameters (`stack` or `prompt`)
* Invalid `stack` value (must be `Design` or `Build`)
* Failed decompression of the `prompt` parameter
* Browser "URL too long" errors (though compression helps mitigate this)

### Security considerations

<Warning>
  **Open in Replit** links could be used to create apps with unintended behavior
  or security vulnerabilities. Only click links from trusted sources.
</Warning>

When sharing **Open in Replit** links:

* Review prompts carefully before sharing publicly
* Consider the security implications of the apps being generated
* Avoid including sensitive information in prompts
* Be transparent about what the link will create

# Plan Mode
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/plan-mode

Plan mode allows you to brainstorm ideas, plan work, and collaborate with Replit Agent without editing your app's code or data.

Plan mode introduces a new way of chatting with Replit Agent that focuses on asking questions, brainstorming, and planning your work.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent chat interface in Plan mode" />
</Frame>

## What is Plan Mode?

Plan mode enables you to:

* **Brainstorm ideas** and explore different approaches to your project
* **Plan development work** with structured task lists
* **Collaborate with AI** on project architecture and feature planning
* **Get strategic guidance** and ask questions without modifying your project's code or data
* **Transition seamlessly** to Build mode when you're ready to implement

The default mode is now referred to as **Build** mode.

Unlike Build mode, Plan mode focuses on planning and ideation, helping you think through projects before writing code.

## Getting Started

### Accessing Plan Mode

Plan mode is available in any Replit App that has Agent enabled. To access it:

1. **Open your Replit App** workspace
2. **Look for the mode selector** at the bottom left of the chat input box
3. **Choose Plan mode** from the dropdown

<Frame>
  <img alt="Mode selector showing Plan mode and Build mode options" />
</Frame>

## Key Features

### Task Planning

Plan mode excels at breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks. Provide the Agent some requirements and it will generate an ordered task list of the development tasks necessary to complete your request.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Generated task list with priorities and dependencies" />
</Frame>

### Collaborative Brainstorming

Work together with AI to explore different approaches:

* **Multiple solution paths** for complex problems
* **Pros and cons analysis** of different approaches
* **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies

## Workflow: From Planning to Building

### 1. Planning Phase (Plan Mode)

Start your development process in Plan mode:

* **Define your project scope** and objectives
* **Break down requirements** into specific features
* **Plan your architecture** and technology stack
* **Create a development roadmap** with milestones

### 2. Task Approval

When Agent generates a task list:

* **Review** the proposed tasks
* Select **Start building** to approve the plan

or, keep chatting to refine the plan.

### 3. Transition to Build Mode

When you're ready to start implementing:

* **Click "Start building"** to approve the plan
* **Agent automatically switches** to Build mode
* **Agent begins implementation** of approved tasks
* **Track progress** through the development phase

Plan Mode usage follows the same effort-based pricing as other Agent interactions. You are charged for all Agent work in Plan Mode, including answering questions, providing guidance, and generating task lists. Charges scale up for more complex requests, or requests in longer context conversations.

**All Agent interactions are billable** - whether Agent responds with text guidance or makes code changes, there is always a charge, though smaller requests cost less.

## Use Cases

### Feature Planning

Ideal for adding new functionality:

* **Break down complex features** into implementable tasks
* **Plan database changes** and API modifications
* **Design user interface** and user experience flows
* **Consider edge cases** and error handling

<Frame>
  <img alt="Planning phase showing project scope and requirements discussion" />
</Frame>

### Learning and Exploration

Excellent for educational purposes:

* **Understand different approaches** to solving problems
* **Learn about new technologies** and frameworks
* **Explore design patterns** and best practices
* **Get guidance** on development methodologies

<Frame>
  <img alt="Asking questions to Agent in Plan mode" />
</Frame>

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

To get the most out of Plan mode:

* **Be specific** about your project requirements
* **Ask follow-up questions** to clarify AI suggestions
* **Request examples** when discussing complex concepts
* **Discuss trade-offs** between different approaches
* **Iterate on ideas** before committing to implementation
* **Save important decisions** by referencing them in follow-up conversations


# Replit AI Integrations
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/replit-ai-integrations

Use AI models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenRouter without requiring your own developer account or API key.

Replit AI Integrations makes it easy to build AI-powered applications. Get started with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and OpenRouter immediately—no developer account setup, no API key management. Replit handles everything for you.

## What is Replit AI Integrations?

Replit AI Integrations provides managed access to AI models from leading providers. Build chat apps, content generators, and AI-powered tools without leaving Replit. No need to create external developer accounts, find your API credentials, or manage separate billing.

When you use Replit AI Integrations, Replit manages the provider credentials and bills you at the public API price. Your usage is billed to your Replit credits and appears on your [usage page](/billing/managing-spend), broken down by Existing Replit App.

## Features

Replit AI Integrations streamlines AI development with built-in access and transparent billing:

* **Zero setup required**: No developer accounts or API keys needed to get started
* **Managed credentials**: Replit handles provider authentication and credential management
* **Transparent billing**: Pay public API prices, billed to your Replit credits
* **Usage tracking**: View your usage per Existing Replit App on your usage page
* **Cross-stack support**: Works across all programming languages and frameworks
* **Optional BYOK**: Bring your own API key if you prefer to use your own credentials

## Getting started

### Using Replit-managed credentials

When you mention AI functionality or specific providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or OpenRouter) in your prompt, Agent defaults to using Replit AI Integrations:

<AiPrompt>
  Create a web app that uses OpenAI to summarize articles
</AiPrompt>

You can tell which integration is being used by looking for **"OpenAI (Replit managed)"**, **"Anthropic (Replit managed)"**, **"Google (Replit managed)"**, or **"OpenRouter (Replit managed)"** in your initial prompt response. This indicates Agent will use Replit's credentials instead of requiring your own API key.

**For initial builds**: When you submit an initial prompt to create a new app with AI functionality, Replit AI Integrations is matched automatically. Agent will start building with Replit's managed credentials right away.

**For existing Replit Apps**: When Agent detects you want to add AI functionality to an existing Replit App, Agent will explicitly tell you in the Workspace that it's asking to use Replit AI Integrations instead of your own API key. You'll see a confirmation prompt:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Confirm OpenAI Integration dialog showing message about adding OpenAI using Replit's managed service with no API keys required, with Dismiss and Approve buttons" />
</Frame>

Click "Approve" to continue with Replit-managed credentials, or "Dismiss" if you prefer to use your own API key.

Your usage is automatically tracked and billed to your Replit account at the public API price.

### Bringing your own API key

If you prefer to use your own credentials from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or other providers instead of Replit AI Integrations, you have a few options:

**For initial builds**: Include in your prompt that you want to use your own API key:

<AiPrompt>
  Create a web app that uses OpenAI to summarize articles. Use my own OpenAI API key.
</AiPrompt>

You'll see the provider name (without "Replit managed") in the response, indicating Agent will request your API key.

**For existing Replit Apps**: When Agent tells you it wants to use Replit AI Integrations and shows the confirmation prompt, click "Dismiss" instead of "Approve."

In both cases, Agent will build through the first checkpoint before requesting your API key. This allows Agent to set up your project structure first, then pause to collect your credentials.

When you use your own API key, you're billed directly by the provider rather than through Replit credits.

## Viewing your usage

All Replit AI Integrations usage appears on your [usage page](/billing/managing-spend) alongside your other Replit usage. Usage is broken down by Existing Replit App so you can see exactly where your AI spend is going.

## Supported providers

Replit AI Integrations currently supports:

* **OpenAI**: Multimodal models for text generation, reasoning, and audio. Supports chat completions, responses, image generation, audio transcription (`gpt-4o-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-transcribe-mini`), and audio output (`gpt-4o-audio`, `gpt-4o-audio-mini`).
* **Anthropic**: Multimodal models for reasoning, writing, and coding. Supports the Messages API and interactions with web search.
* **Google (Gemini)**: Multimodal models for text generation and reasoning. Supports text and image generation.
* **OpenRouter**: Access to models from providers such as Microsoft (Phi series), Meta (Llama series), Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, Nvidia, Amazon, and more.

<Note>
  Replit AI Integrations supports **text, image, and audio output**. Video output is not supported. If you need video generation capabilities, you'll need to use your own API key from a provider that offers them.
</Note>

## OpenRouter privacy and availability

When you use OpenRouter through Replit AI Integrations, your requests are sent with specific privacy settings to protect your data. Understanding these settings is important because they may affect which models are available to you.

### Privacy settings for self-serve users

For individual and team users, Replit configures OpenRouter requests with the following privacy defaults:

* **Paid endpoints training disabled**: Your data will not be used for training by paid model providers
* **Free endpoints training enabled**: Free model providers may train on your prompts and completions
* **Free endpoints publishing enabled**: Free providers may publish your prompts and completions to public datasets
* **Input/output logging disabled**: Your requests and responses are not logged by OpenRouter for the 1% billing discount
* **Analytics cookies disabled**: Analytics cookies are not used

These settings prioritize your privacy while enabling access to the widest range of models. However, **some models may not be available** if they require different privacy settings than those configured above.

### Privacy settings for Enterprise

For Enterprise organizations, Replit enforces stricter privacy controls:

* **Zero Data Retention (ZDR) endpoints only**: Only models with a Zero Data Retention policy are available
* All privacy settings listed above for self-serve users also apply
* This ensures that Enterprise requests are only routed to endpoints that do not retain any data

Because Enterprise enforces ZDR endpoints only, **the selection of available models will be more limited** compared to self-serve users. This trade-off ensures the highest level of data privacy for enterprise workloads.

## Teams and Enterprise

For Teams and Enterprise organizations, Replit AI Integrations access is disabled by default. Organization admins can control access from the organization settings page:

1. Navigate to your organization settings
2. Find the Replit AI Integrations section
3. Toggle access on or off for your organization

When enabled, organization members can use Replit AI Integrations in their apps. All usage is tracked and billed to the organization account. When disabled, members will need to provide their own API keys to use AI model providers.

## Use cases

Build powerful AI applications across any stack:

* **Content generation**: Summarize articles, generate descriptions, create content
* **Analysis and insights**: Extract key information, analyze sentiment, classify text
* **Conversational interfaces**: Build chatbots and AI assistants
* **Text transformation**: Translate, rewrite, or format content
* **Code assistance**: Generate code snippets, explain algorithms, review code

# replit.md
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/replit-dot-md

`replit.md` is a special file that customizes Agent's behavior in your project. Define your preferences, coding style, and project context to help Agent build exactly what you want.

Agent automatically creates this file in your project's root directory using proven best practices. Agent includes its contents in the context to help it understand your preferences, project structure, and coding style.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent using replit.md to build a project" />
</Frame>

## How `replit.md` works

Agent first creates a `replit.md` file in your project's root directory using proven best practices. This file includes:

* Basic project information
* Recommended coding patterns
* Common preferences for your project type

<YouTubeEmbed />

When Agent processes your requests, it automatically reads your `replit.md` file and uses its contents to:

* Understand your project's architecture and conventions
* Follow your preferred coding patterns and style
* Use your specified package managers and dependencies

Agent can also update your `replit.md` file as it learns more about your project and makes changes to your application.

<Note>
  You can edit the `replit.md` file to customize Agent's behavior.
</Note>

## Setting up `replit.md`

### Automatic generation

When you create a new project with Agent, it automatically generates a `replit.md` file using proven best practices. This file appears in your project's root directory and includes:

* Basic project information
* Recommended coding patterns
* Common preferences for your project type

### Manual creation

You can create your own `replit.md` file by adding a new file named `replit.md` in your project's root directory. Agent will automatically detect and use this file in future conversations.

<Note>
  `replit.md` must be located in your project's root directory to work properly.
</Note>

### Regenerating `replit.md`

If your `replit.md` file becomes corrupted or you want to start fresh:

1. Delete the existing `replit.md` file from your project root
2. Start a new conversation with Agent
3. Agent will automatically generate a new `replit.md` file based on your current project

## Best practices

### Be specific and clear

Write clear, specific instructions that help Agent understand exactly what you want:

```markdown theme={null}
## Coding Style

- Use TypeScript for all new JavaScript files
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, avoid inline styles
- Always include TypeScript types for function parameters and return values
```

For a more detailed guide on prompt formatting, check out the [Anthropic prompt engineering guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags).

### Use examples

Examples help Agent understand your preferences better than abstract descriptions:

````markdown theme={null}
## API Error Handling

When creating API endpoints, always use this error handling pattern:

```javascript
app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await getUsersFromDatabase();
    res.json({ success: true, data: users });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching users:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: 'Failed to fetch users' 
    });
  }
});
````

### Define communication preferences

Tell Agent how you prefer to receive information and updates:

```markdown theme={null}
## Communication Style

- Before implementing changes, explain what you're going to do and why
- Break down complex tasks into clear steps
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Provide brief explanations for technical decisions
```

### Specify project context

Help Agent understand your project's purpose and constraints:

```markdown theme={null}
## Project Context

This is a social media app for book lovers where users can:
- Create reading lists and share book recommendations
- Follow other readers and see their updates
- Rate and review books they've read

Target audience: Casual readers aged 25-45

```

## Advanced usage

### Dynamic project guidance

Update your `replit.md` file as your project evolves to provide current context:

```markdown theme={null}
## Current Development Phase
The team is currently focused on implementing user authentication.
Priority features:
1. User registration and login
2. Password reset functionality  
3. Email verification

## Recent Decisions
- Switched from local authentication to OAuth with Google
- Added Redux for state management
- Decided to use Material-UI for consistent styling
```

### Integration with external tools

Reference external documentation and tools in your `replit.md`:

```markdown theme={null}
## External Resources
- Design system: Follow the Figma design system at [link]
- API documentation: Reference our internal API docs
- Coding standards: Follow the team style guide in our wiki

## Deployment Process
- Test changes in development environment first
- Use the CI/CD pipeline for staging published apps
- Require code review before production releases
```

## Combining web search with `replit.md`

Agent can perform web searches to find current information, libraries, and solutions. When combined with your `replit.md` file, you get both up-to-date knowledge and project-specific guidance.

### Best practices for web search integration

**Be specific about what you want Agent to research:**

```markdown theme={null}
## Research Preferences
- Always check for the latest versions of dependencies before suggesting updates
- Research current best practices for security implementations
- Look up recent performance optimization techniques for our tech stack
```

**Guide Agent on how to apply external knowledge:**

```markdown theme={null}
## External Research Guidelines
- When suggesting new libraries, ensure compatibility with our existing stack
- Adapt external examples to match our coding standards and project structure  
- Verify that suggested solutions work with our publishing environment
```

**Example request that leverages both:**
"Research the latest React 18 performance optimization techniques and implement them following the component patterns defined in `replit.md`"

This approach gives you solutions that are both current and tailored to your specific project needs.

## Limitations

### File size and content limits

While there's no strict character limit for `replit.md`, extremely large files may not be fully processed. Keep your `replit.md` focused and concise for best results.

### Root directory requirement

`replit.md` must exist in your project's root directory. Agent won't automatically detect files in subdirectories.

### Context scope

`replit.md` provides context for Agent conversations but doesn't automatically apply to other AI tools.

## Next steps

Ready to customize Agent for your project?

1. **Start simple**: Create a basic `replit.md` with your key preferences
2. **Iterate and improve**: Update your `replit.md` as you work with Agent
3. **Share patterns**: Use successful `replit.md` configurations across similar projects
4. **Monitor effectiveness**: Pay attention to how well Agent follows your guidelines and adjust accordingly

# Agent Skills
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/skills

Extend Agent with reusable capabilities that automate tasks and add specialized functionality to your projects.

Teach Agent how you want to build. Skills let you share your preferences, patterns, and expertise with Agent—whether you're starting a new project or building on existing work.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent Skills pane showing installed skills" />
</Frame>

## What are skills

Skills teach Agent how you work. As you build together, you create useful context about your project, but that context normally disappears when the chat ends. Skills preserve what you've learned so Agent can apply it consistently. Tasks that were previously inconsistent become more reliable, producing better results each time.

For example, a design system skill ensures Agent uses your exact colors and spacing rules. A bug fix skill captures solutions so Agent remembers them for next time.

## When to use skills

You can create skills for anything, from how you structure your code to how you write your docs. Here are some examples to get you started:

| Use Case                        | Example Scenario                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design systems**              | Create a skill for your design system so Agent uses consistent colors, spacing, and components                        |
| **New frameworks**              | Add a skill for Remotion when building video features or other specialized libraries                                  |
| **Media creation**              | Teach Agent photography principles for AI-generated images                                                            |
| **Learning how your app works** | After fixing a complex bug together, create a skill that captures what you both learned about your app's architecture |

## Adding skills to your project

Skills become part of your project once they're added to the `/.agent/skills` directory. You can create skills naturally through conversation with Agent, install pre-built skills from the community, or write custom skills for specialized needs.

### Create with Agent

The most natural way to create skills is through conversation. After solving a problem together, ask Agent to capture what it learned. The skill writes itself from shared context.

```
Create a skill for my design system using these color palettes and spacing rules
```

You can also ask Agent to research and create skills for new domains:

```
Research best practices for video generation with Remotion and create a skill
```

### Upload and manage custom skills

You can upload and manage skills directly through the Workspace. Open the Skills pane to view installed skills, upload custom skill files, or remove skills you no longer need.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Agent Skills pane showing installed skills" />
</Frame>

For advanced use cases, write your own skills following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). This gives you complete control over Agent's behavior for specific scenarios.

### Install from the skills directory

The [Agent Skills directory](https://skills.sh) offers community-contributed skills you can install directly. Replit supports installation via the [npx skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash theme={null}
npx skills <skill> -a replit
```

This installs the skill into your project's `/.agent/skills` directory.

<Warning>
  Skills contain arbitrary content and code. Always review the source before
  installing a skill from external sources.
</Warning>

## Technical reference

Skills are stored in your project's `/.agent/skills` directory. Each skill follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), which defines the structure and format for skill files.

Agent reads all skills in this directory and considers them when working on tasks. Skills persist in your project, so they remain available across Agent sessions and can be committed to version control for team sharing.

Skills can be scoped to different levels:

* **Project-level**: Specific to one codebase, versioned with your code in `/.agent/skills`
* **User-level**: Your personal toolkit that follows you across projects
* **Enterprise** (coming soon): Company-wide standards and shared knowledge

<Note>
  Skills work best when they capture specific, repeatable patterns rather than
  general guidance. Focus on concrete workflows, established conventions, and
  proven solutions from your project.
</Note>

## Working with other AI coding tools

<Accordion title="Import skills from other AI coding tools">
  If you work across multiple AI coding tools, [rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) has Replit support and helps you maintain consistent configurations.

  You can import skills from other AI coding assistants:

  ```bash theme={null}
  npx rulesync init
  npx rulesync import --targets claudecode --features skills
  npx rulesync generate --targets replit --features skills
  ```

  This allows you to maintain a single set of skills that work across different development environments.
</Accordion>

Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/stripe-payments

Add payments and subscriptions to your app with Stripe using Agent, test safely in a sandbox, then go live with your own Stripe account.

<Note>
  The Stripe Connector is only supported for Replit Free and Core users. It is not available in Teams workspaces at this time.
</Note>

## What you can build

Use Agent to add Stripe to your app in one click—no setup required. Build a storefront, accept one‑time payments, or create subscriptions. Agent wires up the integration, data models, and test environment.

## How it works

Agent starts with a Stripe sandbox so you can safely test payments without moving real money. You can build and try flows immediately. When you are ready, switch to your live Stripe account to publish and accept real payments.

<Info>
  A Stripe sandbox is an isolated test environment where you can simulate
  payments, subscriptions, and events. Learn more in
  [Stripe's docs on sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes).
</Info>

## Get started

* **Ask Agent to use Stripe**
  * Use a slash command on the home screen and select Stripe, or ask directly:
    <AiPrompt>Build a storefront and integrate Stripe for payments</AiPrompt>

<Note>
  Stripe integration requires an App with backend functionality. Select **App** from the homepage to get started.
</Note>

## Test payments in the sandbox

1. Open your app’s **Preview** in a new tab.
2. Make a test purchase from your storefront or payment page.
3. Use Stripe’s standard test card:

```text theme={null}
Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: any future date
CVC: any 3 digits
Name, address: any mock values
```

<Tip>
  Sandbox purchases don’t process through real networks or move money. They’re
  safe for testing end to end.
</Tip>

## Manage products and pricing

You have two options:

1. From your app, select **Publish**, then choose to claim your Stripe sandbox.
   * If you don’t have a Stripe account yet, create one to claim the sandbox.
2. In the Stripe Dashboard, open **Products** to add or edit products and prices.
   Changes you make in the Stripe sandbox reflect in your Replit app automatically
   and sync to your app’s database.

### View synced Stripe data

* In your Workspace, open **Database**.
* Select **MyData**.
* Change the schema selector to **Stripe** to see payment objects and related
  records.

## Go live

To accept real payments:

<Warning>
  Before you publish:

  * Install the [Replit Integrated Payments](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/replit-integrated-payments) app in your live Stripe account
    (required for sandbox‑to‑live synchronization)
  * Complete Stripe’s KYB verification and add your live API keys

  Your sandbox integration is not production‑ready. It cannot accept real
  payments until you complete these steps.
</Warning>

1. In Stripe, switch from sandbox to your live account.
2. Complete Stripe’s KYB (Know Your Business) verification if prompted.
3. Copy your live Publishable and Secret keys from Stripe.
4. In Replit, open the **Publish** pane, then add your live keys.
5. Publish your app.

## Manage the integration

* Go to **Integrations > Stripe** to open the Stripe connector.
* From there, you can test the connection, view status, and manage settings.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I update the prices of my products?

* Ask Agent: Describe the change and Agent updates your app and Stripe objects.
* Use the Stripe Dashboard: Open **Products** to edit prices and product details.
  * In sandbox, changes sync back to your app and database automatically.
  * For production, switch to your live account first, then update prices. Publish again if your app needs to pick up new configuration.

### How do I test transactions on Replit?

Open your app’s **Preview** in a new tab. Run the Stripe Checkout flow with the
standard test card (4242 4242 4242 4242), any future expiry, and any CVC. See
[Test payments in the sandbox](#test-payments-in-the-sandbox) above for details.

### What is a live Stripe account?

A live Stripe account is an activated and verified account that can process real
payments using your business details. See Stripe’s guidance on account creation
and activation: [Create and manage your Stripe account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account).

### How do I find my live keys?

1. In the Stripe Dashboard, switch to your live account using the account picker (top left).
2. From the bottom left, select **Developers** > **API keys**.
3. Reveal your live keys or create new ones. For step‑by‑step instructions on creating new keys, see
   [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key).

## Update or remove the Stripe connection

If you're not ready to publish with your Stripe live keys, you have three options:

### Option A: Use placeholder API keys

You can use Stripe placeholder keys that you can replace later.

<Warning>
  Placeholder keys will not process real payments. The catalog and checkout will not function on your published URL until you add your live Stripe keys. Use this option only for testing purposes.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the publishing tab">
    Open the **Publish** pane in your Workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter placeholder keys">
    Use these values:

    **Publishable Key:**

# Warehouse Connectors
Source: https://docs.replit.com/replitai/warehouse-connectors

Connect Replit Agent to BigQuery, Databricks, and Snowflake to build data-driven applications.

Warehouse Connectors allow Replit Agent to securely access and query your organization's data warehouses. This Enterprise-only feature enables builders to create powerful, data-driven applications using natural language, with centralized admin control and role-based access.

## Supported warehouses

Replit supports connections to:

* **BigQuery**
* **Databricks**
* **Snowflake**

These connectors allow Agent to write and execute SQL queries against your data. You can build internal dashboards, data visualization tools, reporting systems, and applications that integrate directly with your warehouse data.

## Admin setup

Administrators must configure warehouse connectors before team members can use them. The setup process involves configuring an OAuth application in your warehouse provider and adding those credentials to Replit.

### Prerequisites

* Enterprise plan
* Admin access to your Replit organization
* Ability to create OAuth applications in your warehouse provider (or access to credentials from your IT/Data team)

### Configuration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to your organization's settings and select the **Integrations** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Connector">
    Select the warehouse you want to connect (BigQuery, Databricks, or Snowflake).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Provide the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for the OAuth application you created in your warehouse provider.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Access">
    Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to specify which members or groups can use this connector.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Warehouse-specific configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Databricks">
    Admins can configure Databricks connections using one of two methods: **User-OAuth** or **Service Account**.

    **Option 1: User-OAuth**

    This method involves minting OAuth application tokens within Databricks.

    <Warning>
      With User-OAuth, the credentials of the user who authenticates the connection are used for all subsequent access. This means that anyone using an application created with this connection will effectively have the same permissions as the authenticating user. Ensure the authenticating user has the appropriate scope of access intended for all application users.
    </Warning>

    **Option 2: Service Account**

    This method involves creating a service account (Service Principal) in Databricks to connect to Replit.

    The service account is shared among everyone given permission to use that integration. The permissions granted to the service account in Databricks will flow to all users enabled for the integration. Scope service accounts to READ-only access on the data when possible.

    **Managing Access Granularity**

    To differentiate access levels (for example, restricting specific tables to different teams):

    1. Create multiple Service Principals in Databricks
    2. Assign specific permissions to each Service Principal
    3. Create separate integrations in Replit for each Service Principal
    4. Open access to each integration only for the allowed individuals or groups
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Builder access and login

Once an admin has enabled a connector and granted you access, you can connect to the warehouse.

### Connecting to a warehouse

When you ask Agent to use a warehouse (for example, "Query the Snowflake database..."), or when you manually add the integration, you receive a login prompt.

Each warehouse requires specific information during the login or connection process:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="BigQuery">
    **Required at login:**

    * **Project ID**: You must specify the Google Cloud Project ID you want to access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Databricks">
    **Required information:**

    * **SQL Warehouse**: The specific SQL Warehouse compute resource to use.
    * **Account URL**: Your Databricks account URL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Snowflake">
    **Required information:**

    * **Account ID**: Your Snowflake Account ID.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Building with warehouse data

After connecting, you can ask Agent to build applications that use your data. Agent can:

* Build internal tools that fetch and display live data
* Create dashboards with charts and visualizations backed by your warehouse
* Generate SQL queries to power your application's backend
* Explain schema and table structures to help you understand what to build

<Note>
  While Agent can answer ad-hoc questions about your data, the primary purpose of Warehouse Connectors is to enable Agent to build functional applications that leverage your organization's data. Warehouse queries are executed directly against your instance, so make sure your OAuth scopes and database user permissions allow the necessary read and write operations.
</Note>

# Roles, Groups and Access
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/groups-and-permissions

Control team member access with roles and groups. Roles provide default access levels (Admin, Member, Guest, Viewer), while custom groups offer fine-grained access control for specific team members.

Manage your team's access to resources and applications through a comprehensive system built on default roles and custom groups. This approach provides granular control over who can access what, while maintaining organizational security and structure.

## Features

Replit Teams and Enterprise provides comprehensive access control through two complementary systems that work together to manage access across your organization.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="shield-check">
    Full administrative access to organization settings and all resources
  </Card>

  <Card title="Member" icon="users">
    Can see all other members and create Apps and Projects
  </Card>

  <Card title="Guest" icon="user-plus">
    Limited access to only shared apps and resources
  </Card>

  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only access to apps and deployments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Key capabilities include:

* **Default roles**: Four built-in access levels that provide baseline access control for all team members
* **Custom groups**: Create specialized groups for fine-grained access control beyond default role limitations
* **Flexible access control**: Use roles and groups to grant precise access for different Apps and resources
* **Easy member management**: Add, remove, and transfer members between groups with simple administrative controls

## Usage

### Roles

Every team member must have a role that defines their baseline access level within your organization. Admins assign roles when adding new members to ensure proper access control from day one.

The four default roles provide different levels of access:

* **Admins**: Have access to every action available in Replit Teams, including organization settings, billing, and member management
* **Members**: Can create and edit Replit Apps and see all other team members, but cannot perform sensitive administrative actions
* **Guests**: Have the lowest access level and can only edit apps specifically shared with them. This role is useful for external contractors or interview candidates
* **Viewers**: Have read-only access to apps and deployments, making them ideal for stakeholders who need visibility without editing capabilities

### Custom groups

Custom groups provide more access control beyond default roles. Create groups to grant specific access to selected team members while maintaining their base role access.

<Note>
  For information on syncing IdP groups to Replit for easier bulk user access management, see [SCIM](https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim).
</Note>

The list of groups is available via the "Groups" tab in the sidebar. Each group card shows the name of the group, an icon with its color, and the number of group members. Members will only see groups to which they have at least viewer access.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Viewing groups" />
</Frame>

#### Creating a group

Admins can create unlimited custom groups from the groups page. Select the **Add** button in the top right corner to open the creation modal where you can:

* **Name your group**: The group name is the only required field
* **Add visual identifiers**: Choose colors and icons to distinguish groups
* **Assign members**: Add team members to groups individually or in bulk
* **Grant access**: Groups can later receive access to specific apps through each app's **Access** button

<Frame>
  <img alt="Creating a custom group modal with name field and color picker" />
</Frame>

After creating the group, the group details view loads where you can add members and configure organizational permissions.

#### Managing groups

Select any group card to access its management interface. Group management includes member addition, removal, and permissions configuration.

<Frame>
  <img alt="View group members" />
</Frame>

**Adding members to groups:**

To add a member to a group, select the **Add** button in the top right corner. This action becomes disabled if the person you're adding is not part of the organization and there are insufficient seats available.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Adding a group member dialog with search field for username or email" />
</Frame>

You can search for new members by username or email. If the new member is not part of the organization, a warning appears to confirm the action.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Warning dialog for adding non-organization members to groups" />
</Frame>

After adding the new member, they appear in the group member list. They immediately gain access to Replit Apps and other resources available to the group.

**Removing members from groups:**

To remove a group member, select the trash icon on the right side of the member row. You can also open the actions menu using the three-dot button and select **Remove from group**. This opens a confirmation modal.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Group member removal confirmation dialog" />
</Frame>

When removing members from custom groups, they retain their base role access but lose their group-specific access.

#### Setting group permissions

Assign organizational permissions to groups to define what level of access group members must have in your organization. To set group permissions, select the created group and choose the **permissions** tab in the left navigation.

The available permissions levels are:

* **Owner**: Can perform all organization actions, including deleting the organization
* **Billing manager**: Can update the organization's payment information, add and remove seats, and set spending limits
* **Manager**: Can create and manage groups, add and remove organization members, and view billing information
* **Editor**: Can create new Apps and view usage information
* **Viewer**: Can see basic information about the organization

These group permissions are separate from app-specific access, which you manage through individual apps using the Access feature.

You can see which apps groups have access to by selecting a group. Select **permissions** in the left navigation, and then go to **Apps**.

### App access control

Control who can access and collaborate on your apps using Replit's Access feature. Assign access to roles and groups to share specific apps with the right team members while maintaining security across your organization.

#### Setting app access

<Accordion title="How to manage app access">
  From any app, select **Access** in the upper right corner (to the left of **Publish**) to open the Access panel.
</Accordion>

The Access panel displays all available roles and allows you to search for custom groups:

* **Default roles**: Admin, Members, Guests, and Viewers appear automatically in the Access panel
* **Custom groups**: Use the search functionality to find and grant app access to specific custom groups

#### Access levels

You can assign different access levels to each role and group for fine-grained control:

* **Owner**: Full access including app deletion and administrative control
* **Publisher**: Can edit code, republish apps, and manage app resources, and settings
* **Editor**: Can edit code and view app resources without publishing capabilities
* **Viewer**: Read-only access to code with the ability to fork apps for their own use
* **None**: No access to search, view, or edit the app

Select the appropriate access level for each role or group based on collaboration requirements and security needs.


# Managing Members
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/managing-members

You can manage members on your Replit team to control access, collaboration, and permissions across your organization's apps and projects.

Managing members is one of the most important functions of Replit Teams, allowing you to add collaborators to your organization and control who has access to your team's resources.

## Features

The **Members** tab displays a list of current organization members, showing their default group and recent activity. From this view, you can manage your team through several key capabilities:

* **Add Members**: Invite new collaborators to join your organization and assign them appropriate permissions
* **Remove Members**: Remove people from your organization when they no longer need access
* **Assign Roles**: Set member permissions with Admin, Member, Guest, or Viewer roles
* **Manage Invitations**: Send email invitations to non-Replit users and track invitation status
* **Seat Management**: Control billing capacity and monitor available seats

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Add Members" icon="person">
    Add team members so you can share apps and ideas.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Remove Members" icon="trash">
    Remove members or change who's on your team.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage

### Adding members

<Note>
  For automated user management and bulk operations, see [SCIM](/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim) instead.
  *Note: SCIM is available for enterprise customers only.*
</Note>

Selecting the **Add** button in the corner of the Members page opens a modal with a search input. The **Add** button may become disabled if there are not enough seats available or if you don't have permissions to add new organization members.

You can find existing Replit members via username or email, while you can add non-Replit members by email. After selecting someone or entering an email address, you can set the member's group with the following options:

* **Admin**: Admins have full administrative access to organization settings and all resources.
* **Member**: Members can see all other members, and can create Apps and Projects.
* **Guest**: Guests can only edit and access apps shared with them.
* **Viewer**: Viewers have read-only access to apps and deployments in your organization.

Existing members join immediately, and the seat becomes active immediately. Non-Replit members join the organization after creating an account. The seat won't become active until this happens. The invitation sent via email expires after seven days.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Invitation email" />
</Frame>

* [SCIM](/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim)
* [SAML](/teams/identity-and-access-management/saml)
* [Viewer Seats](/teams/identity-and-access-management/viewer-seats)

### Removing members

Eligible members can remove people from the organization using the trash can icon. You can also use the context menu opened from the triple dot to the right of each member row.

Removing someone from the organization requires a confirmation step. After you remove them, a seat becomes available immediately and you can use it to invite a new organization member.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Removing a member" />
</Frame>

### Managing seats

Managing seats is different from managing members. While member management involves adding or removing people from your team, seat management controls your billing capacity—how many seats you're paying for.

For detailed information on adding seats and removing seats, see [Managing Seats](/billing/teams-billing/managing-seats).


# Access Management
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/repl-access-management

Learn how to control access and visibility settings for Replit Apps through the workspace interface, including group permissions and user roles.

Replit App access may be managed either from the [group permissions interface](/teams/identity-and-access-management/groups-and-permissions#repl-permissions), or from the workspace using the “Access” button in the header. Users with edit access can change the role for existing groups or individuals, or add roles to new groups or users. All users with access to the Replit App workspace are able to see who has access to the Replit App, even if they can't manage it.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Access popover" />
</Frame>

To grant access to a group or member, use the search to locate them by name or username.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Access popover search" />
</Frame>

After selecting the result, a dropdown for the role selection will appear. After choosing the role, the group or user will be added to the "Groups with access" or "People with access" sections below.

This popover also controls whether the Replit App is private or public, using selector in the bottom left corner. If the Replit App is marked as internal, it is private within the organization. Only users with access can see that it exists. If the Replit App is public, anyone on Replit (regardless of whether they are logged in) can see, but not edit, the Replit App.

<Frame>

# SAML
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/saml

Learn how to set up and manage SAML single sign-on authentication for your Replit Enterprise Team, including domain configuration and Identity Provider setup.

## Introduction

<Note>
  Only organizations with an Enterprise plan are able to use SAML SSO. [Contact us](https://replit.com/teams#inlineForm) to get started with Enterprise.
</Note>

[SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) SSO allows you to use your Identity Provider to authenticate users logging into replit.com. Your Organization's users will be directed to your Identity Provider to authenticate, and your Identity Provider will provide an response back to Replit verifying the user's identity, which Replit uses to log the user into replit.com.

Setting up SAML requires communication with the Replit team. Once you’re familiar with what’s required below, [contact us](https://replit.com/teams#inlineForm) to get started.

## Set up SAML SSO

### Choose your email domains

You can claim multiple email domains and subdomains for your Organization. Any user that attempts to sign up with an email domain that matches your claimed domain will be required to use SAML SSO. Your claimed domains should match what your Identity Provider will report for your users. If you use email domain aliases, you should provide them to Replit as well to prevent your users from signing up without using SAML.

For example, if your company uses email domains matching `acmeco.com`, `foo.acmeco.com`, and `acmebiz.com` you should provide all of these to Replit.

Replit must be able to verify that your organization owns these domains. If you need to add additional domains in the future you can contact us at [support@replit.com](mailto:support@replit.com).

### Setup Replit in your Identity provider

Create a new application or service in your Identity Provider using the following

* **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Your Replit representative will provide this.
* **SSO URL**: `https://replit.com/__/auth/handler`

### Replit enables your SAML SSO

Once you've setup Replit in your Identity Provider, please provide your Replit representative with the following:

* **Identity Provider (IdP) entity ID**: This identifies your IdP to Replit
* **IdP SSO URL**: This is the URL Replit will send users to when authenticating with your IdP
* **Signature Certificate**: An X509 certificate that Replit uses to verify authentication responses from your IdP.

Once we have confirmed setup completion, your Organization is ready to use SAML SSO.

## Using SAML SSO

<Note>
  Signing up in with SAML will not automatically invite users to your organization. For automated user management and bulk operations, see [SCIM](/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim) instead.
</Note>

Once SAML SSO is configured, your users can log in to [replit.com](http://replit.com) using the "Continue with SSO" button.

## FAQ

### What happens to users who already have accounts on replit.com before SAML SSO was setup?

SAML SSO is opt-in for existing users, meaning they can continue to use their existing authentication methods (email or social login). They will not be automatically added to your Organization.

### Are users automatically deprovisioned in Replit when my IdP removes access?

No, SAML SSO only handles authentication. For automated user provisioning and deprovisioning, you can use [SCIM](/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim) integration, which is available for Enterprise customers. SCIM allows you to sync your IdP's directory to automatically manage user roles and provisioning.

### Are Organization seats automatically consumed when users are given access in our IdP?

No, seats are only consumed once a user accepts the invitation to your Organization.

# SCIM
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/scim

Learn how to set up and manage SCIM to simplify provisioning and managing user roles within your Replit Enterprise Team.

## Introduction

<Note>
  SCIM is available exclusively for Enterprise customers. Contact our sales team at [sales@replit.com](mailto:sales@replit.com) to enable this feature for your organization.
</Note>

System for Cross-domain Identity Management ([SCIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management)) is a standardized protocol that automates user provisioning and deprovisioning between your enterprise identity provider (IdP) and Replit.

The SCIM integration is built on the [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) platform, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and security.

## Key Features

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Automated User Management" icon="user-plus">
    Automatically provision and deprovision users based on your IdP's directory
  </Card>

  <Card title="Role Synchronization" icon="shield">
    Keep user roles and permissions in sync with your organizational structure
  </Card>

  <Card title="Bulk Operations" icon="users">
    Efficiently manage large teams with bulk user operations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Major IdP Support" icon="plug">
    Direct integration with Azure AD, Okta, and other leading identity providers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Benefits

SCIM integration provides several advantages for Enterprise teams:

* **Enhanced Security**: Leverage your existing identity management systems for robust access control
* **Simplified Administration**: Automatically manage team members through your identity provider
* **Efficient Onboarding**: Seamlessly provision large teams without manual intervention
* **Consistent Access Control**: Maintain uniform access policies across your organization

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable SCIM">
    Go to your **Organization Settings** > **Authentication** tab to enable SCIM for your Enterprise organization
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your IdP">
    Access the SCIM onboarding portal directly from the Authentication settings page. The onboarding portal provides step-by-step instructions specific to your identity provider for synchronizing your user directory
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Integration">
    Verify the connection by provisioning a test user
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go Live">
    Begin using SCIM for automated user management
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

* Document role allocations for existing Replit users before enabling SCIM
* Configure groups for each Replit role, keeping in mind that users without a group will default to the **Viewer** role
* Test your configuration by provisioning a small group of users before enabling bulk provisioning
* After initial sync, review and configure permissions for custom groups based on your organization's access control needs
* Dedicate role-control groups to control access levels of provisioned users in Replit and use other push groups for user categorization and bulk permission management
* Document your SCIM configuration for future reference

## Role Assignment

All provisioned accounts are created in your Replit organization as "Viewers", which grants the most limited set of permissions and no ability to create apps.

You can bulk edit member roles within your organization by selecting "Assign roles" in your SCIM portal and specifying which role to assign to each push group. For example, you can use this to assign the "Admin" role to the synced "Managers" group, and the "Guest" role to the synced "Contractors" group.

To learn more about viewer access, see [Viewer Seats](/teams/identity-and-access-management/viewer-seats).

## Group Synchronization

All pushed groups from your IdP will be synchronized to Replit with the same members. For example, if you start pushing an "Engineering" group via SCIM, a corresponding "Engineering" group will be created in Replit that includes the same members.

Group membership will be automatically updated to reflect the group membership in your IdP. You can use these synchronized groups for bulk editing member permissions, such as sharing an app with everyone in the "Engineering" group.

For detailed information about groups, see [Groups & Permissions](/teams/identity-and-access-management/groups-and-permissions).

## FAQs

### What happens to users who already have accounts on replit.com before SCIM was setup?

When SCIM is enabled, existing users are handled in two ways:

1. **Users provisioned through SCIM**:
   * Their roles will be updated to match those provided by your IdP
   * These users can only be added, removed, or have their roles changed through your IdP
   * To ensure permissions remain synchronized, admins will no longer be able to edit roles or invite new users within Replit

2. **Users not provisioned through SCIM**:
   * These users remain unchanged and are considered "legacy" users
   * Access is not automatically revoked to prevent accidental deprovisioning
   * Legacy users can be removed through the Replit interface by organization admins if needed

<Warning>
  After implementing SCIM, all users provisioned through your IdP must be managed through your identity provider to maintain synchronization. Only legacy users (those not provisioned through SCIM) can be deprovisioned directly in Replit.
</Warning>

### What roles can be provisioned with SCIM?

SCIM users can be assigned to three roles:

* **Admin**: Full access to organization settings and resources
* **Member**: Standard access to create and edit Replit Apps
* **Viewer**: Read-only access to published applications

During the SCIM onboarding process, you configure the mapping between your IdP groups and Replit roles. For example, you might map your "Engineering" group to the Member role and your "Stakeholders" group to the Viewer role.

### What if I need to edit the role mapping later?

Organization admins can edit SCIM configuration at any time by navigating to **Organization Settings** > **Authentication** > **SCIM**. Here you can access the SCIM portal to update group mappings and manage your integration settings.

# Transfer App to Teams
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/transfer-app-to-teams

Move personal apps to team workspaces for collaboration

Transfer your personal Replit Apps to team workspaces to enable collaboration and centralized project management. This process allows you to:

* Share apps with team members instantly
* Centralize project management within your organization
* Maintain deployment uptime and URLs during transfer

## What is app transfer?

App transfer moves ownership of a Replit App from your personal workspace to a team workspace. Once transferred, the app becomes accessible to team members according to workspace permissions and is managed under the team's resources and billing.

The transfer process is immediate and irreversible, but maintains all deployment configurations and URLs.

## Getting started

You must be a member of the target team workspace before transferring apps. Verify your team membership by selecting your profile or workspace selector in the upper-right corner to view available teams.

<Note>
  * Transferring a Replit App to a team workspace is irreversible
  * Published apps experience zero downtime during transfer
  * Deployment URLs remain unchanged
  * You must be a member of the team you want to transfer the app to before initiating transfer
</Note>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your Apps">
    Navigate to your personal Apps by selecting the **Apps** tab from your Replit home page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the app">
    Locate the application you want to transfer in your Apps list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open transfer options">
    Select the **three dots (•••)** menu next to the app name.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Three dots menu next to app name showing transfer options" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose transfer option">
    Select **Transfer To Organization** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select destination">
    Choose the target team workspace from the available organizations dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm transfer">
    Select **Transfer To Organization** to confirm the action.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify completion">
    You'll see a "Transfer success" notification in the bottom-right corner of the page. Refresh your Apps page to verify the app no longer appears in your personal workspace, then navigate to your team workspace to confirm the app appears there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk transfer options

For transferring multiple applications, use CLUI commands:

* **Core to team workspace**: Use `org transfer-repls`
* **Team to team workspace**: Use `org transfer-repls-org-to-org`

# Viewer Seats
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/identity-and-access-management/viewer-seats

Learn how to set up and manage viewer seats for your Replit Team.

## About viewer seats

Viewers get read-only access to your team's apps and deployments. This makes it easier to share your work with stakeholders and collaborators who don't need edit permissions or a full team license.

Viewer seats are perfect for:

* Internal tool users who are not creating applications
* Stakeholders who need to review project progress
* Teammates who are exploring capabilities of Replit

Teams get 50 viewer seats included in their plan, allowing you to scale your collaboration efficiently.

If you would like to add more than 50 viewers, contact our sales team at [sales@replit.com](mailto:sales@replit.com) regarding an Enterprise plan.

## Inviting a viewer

1. Navigate to the **Members** tab in your Organization
2. Select **+ Add**
3. Choose the Viewer option
4. Enter the email addresses of viewers you would like to add in a comma-separated list
5. Select **Send invites**

<Frame>
  <img alt="Send invites to viewers" />
</Frame>

Invited users without a Replit account will receive an email with instructions to create an account and join your team. Users who already have a Replit account will be added automatically.

## Viewer access

<Note>
  **Updated Default Access Behavior (Effective June 9, 2025)**: Apps created in organizations will now be **private by default**. Viewers will need to be explicitly granted access to new apps through the Access panel.
</Note>

Viewers will need to be explicitly granted access to new apps through the Access panel. For existing apps created before this change, viewers may still have access based on previous settings.

# Projects Overview
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/projects/overview

Learn how to use Projects in Replit Teams for collaborative development, version control, and managing multiple Replit Apps with git-based workflows.

<Frame>
  <div>
    <iframe title="YouTube video player" />
  </div>
</Frame>

## Introduction

Projects are currently a beta feature available to Teams. A Project is a set of connected, Replit Apps for better collaborative development and versioning. Within a Project, you can:

* "Fork" a Replit App (i.e. make a copy) to work on a feature in isolation, and merge your changes back in when ready
* View all ongoing development in one place

Projects leverage a technology called [git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage version control, but you don't need to know anything about git to use Projects!

## Advantages of Projects

Projects are a great option:

* When you are collaborating with a team where you each need your own copy of the code when working on features
* When you want an easy way to leverage version control. Using a version control system has many advantages: you can trace the history of all files in your codebase to see what changed and why, you experiment and collaborate using branching & merging, you can rollback to a previous version easily when something breaks, etc.

## Project Structure

Every Project is organized around having a main Replit App that is the source of truth. In this example Project, "AnvilWebServer" is the main Replit App. Each team member has their own fork where they can work, e.g. "MadisonFitch-07-03" is a fork off of the main Replit App.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Project Dashboard" />
</Frame>

The best practice for working within a Project is to:

* Make changes in a fork, e.g. "MadisonFitch-07-03"
* Use the Project tool in the workspace to preview your changes
* Use that tool to merge your changes into the main Replit App when they are ready

## Creating a Project

To get started, fork any Replit App in your organization and you'll be prompted to turn it into a Project:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create Project Fork" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create Project Prompt to Convert" />
</Frame>

If you choose the "Fork & start a Project" option, the Replit App you are in will become your main Replit App for the Project and you will be moved to a new fork where you can work on a feature.

## Previewing and merging changes

When you open the fork in the workspace, you'll see a Project tool open which informs you that you have no changes from the main Replit App yet:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create Project No Changes" />
</Frame>

If you were to make some changes, you would see them previewed in the Project tool. You can create a basic express server and see the changes:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create Project Changes in Workspace" />
</Frame>

You can run your Replit App and test your changes. When you are ready, you can click the "Merge changes..." button, and your changes will be pulled into the main Replit App. In the main AnvilWebServer Replit App, you would be able to now see the express server changes, and you can run the Replit App to see the server in action:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Run Main Replit App" />
</Frame>

## Using `git`

In the previous section, the "Merge changes..." button did some magic by executing a few git commands. You don't need to know anything about git to use Projects, but if you are familiar with git, you can take more control over how changes are made in a Project.

If you modify you fork again to add a joke endpoint, you'll see changes in the Project tool:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Git Changes" />
</Frame>

Instead of hitting "Merge," you can use the git tool (or use the `git` command in the shell) to commit specific changes when merging:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Git Staging" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Git Committed" />
</Frame>

If you switch back to the Projects tool, you will see "Committed" changes and now can click the "Merge" button to pull only your committed changes into the main Replit App.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Git Merging" />
</Frame>

## Project Navigation in the Workspace

When in the workspace, the header bar will provide some extra navigation options and controls:

* Switch to other Replit Apps in the Project
* Go to the dashboard
* Create a new fork

<Frame>
  <img alt="Workspace Header" />
</Frame>

## Project Dashboard

You can visit the Project's dashboard from the sidebar, or via the workspace header link. You'll see:

* The main replit app
* All forks
* Everyone who is online currently in the Project
* Settings

<Frame>
  <img alt="Project Dashboard" />
</Frame>


# Conflict Resolution in Projects
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/projects/resolving-conflicts

Learn how to handle and resolve merge conflicts when multiple team members make changes to the same files in a Replit Project.

## Overview

When two teammates make changes to the same files in a Project, it is possible to end up with a [merge conflict](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts).

## Resolving a merge conflict

In this example, the main Replit App has a change to the joke endpoint. In your Replit App, if you also change the joke endpoint and attempt to sync or merge your changes, you'll hit a merge warning:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Merge Conflict on Pull" />
</Frame>

If you click the "resolve manually" button, the git tool will open up in conflict resolution mode to help you resolve the conflict:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Merge Conflict View Conflict" />
</Frame>

You will see conflict markers `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======` and `>>>>>>> dd936daa...`. This is git's way of showing you the conflict it encountered and the two different version of the code it found. The bit between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is the version of the joke endpoint found in the main Replit App (which was merged in between the time when you created your fork and the time you attempted to merge your fork), and the bit between `=======` and `>>>>>>> dd936daa...` is your change to the joke endpoint.

Resolving a merge conflict simply means editing the file to remove the conflict markers. Sometimes this means picking one change or the other. Other times this means picking parts of each version to create a blended version. In this situation, you can pick your version of the change:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Merge Conflict Resolve Conflict" />
</Frame>

The "Complete merge and commit" button will be enabled when you have resolved all the conflicts. When you click it, you'll end up with a new commit that resolves the conflict:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Merge Conflict Commit" />
</Frame>

You will now be able to merge your changes back into the main Replit App.


# Public Profiles
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/public_profiles

Learn how to create and customize your organization's public profile on Replit to showcase your brand, products, and public Replit Apps to the community.

## Overview

Public profiles on Replit enable Organizations to showcase their brand, products, libraries, or templates to a broader audience. Here are some key use cases for public profiles:

* **Developer Relations**: Developer-centric companies can share documentation, examples, demos, and self-hosted solutions.
* **Pre-Sales and Sales Flows**: Organizations can share content with clients or customers to demonstrate how something works during introductory calls.
* **Building Brand Awareness**: Companies can tap into Replit’s community by promoting their content and increasing visibility.

## Creating a public profile

Each Organization has a public profile, which will not have any information other than the Organization name by default.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Private Profile" />
</Frame>

To enable the profile page, an Organization admin needs to navigate to the Organization profile settings page and switch the profile visibility to public. This allows them to manage the contents of the public profile.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Private Profile Settings" />
</Frame>

Once the profile visibility is set to public, admins can update the contents of the public profile.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Public Profile Settings" />
</Frame>

## Profile page content

* **Avatar** - Upload your brand logo image to represent your organization.
* **Social Links** - Promote your website and cross-link to your social profiles.
* **Bio** - Describe your organization to give visitors a clear understanding of who you are.
* **Public Replit Apps** - Showcase all the Replit Apps your organization has made public to the Replit community.

## Accessing the profile

Once you create public Replit Apps, each Replit App has its own cover page, which is publicly accessible.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Replit App Cover Page" />
</Frame>

Users can navigate to your Organization's public profile by hovering over the organization name and selecting the logo or name. This is how the finalized public profile will appear.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Public Profile" />
</Frame>

## Creating public Replit Apps

In the Replit App creation modal, you will find two options:

* **Internal to (Organization Name)** - Creates a private Replit App that is accessible only within the organization, based on the defined access rules.
* **Public to Replit** - Creates a public Replit App that is accessible to anyone.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Public Replit App Creation" />
</Frame>

* Public visibility can also be managed from the Access modal within the workspace.

# Replit Core Sponsorships
Source: https://docs.replit.com/teams/replit-core-sponsorships

Learn how to gift Replit Core subscriptions to developers outside your organization through sponsorships for hackathons, bootcamps, and other events.

# Replit Core sponsorships

## Overview

Sponsorships allow you to gift Replit Core to users outside of your Organization. Sponsorships can be a great fit for situations like Developer Relations teams and coding bootcamps. Example use cases:

* hosting a hackaton or contest and giving away Replit Core as a prize for participants
* running a bootcamp where each student should get their own Replit Core account

Sponsored users will not have any direct access to your Organization, and you won't have any direct access to the sponsored user's content. A sponsorship is simply a way to gift Replit Core to users and give them [the benefits of Replit Core](https://replit.com/pricing) (e.g. more powerful workspaces, private Replit Apps and monthly credits).

## Sponsorships flow

### Purchasing sponsorships

[Contact us](https://replit.com/teams#inlineForm) to enable this feature for your Organization.

### Granting a sponsorship

Once sponsorships have been enabled for your Organization, you can grant sponsorships from the settings page:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Sponsorships page" />
</Frame>

Click the "Add" button, enter an email (or multiple emails) and choose how many months of Replit Core you would like to grant (e.g. in this case, we are granting 2 months):

<Frame>
  <img alt="Sponsorships Invite Page" />
</Frame>

They will receive an email with a link to claim the sponsorship:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Sponsorships Email Page" />
</Frame>

The sponsorship invite link will expire after 7 days. If the recipient claims the sponsorship, they will receive Replit Core automatically. When the sponsorship ends (e.g. in our example, after 2 months), the recipient can decide whether or not they want to pay for Replit Core or not.

# Build a Notion-powered website
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/build-a-notion-powered-website

Learn how to build a website that uses Notion as a Content Management System (CMS) with Replit Agent.

## Build a Notion-powered blog with Replit Agent

Notion is a powerful tool for organizing information, and it excels as a Content Management System (CMS). By integrating Notion with Replit, you can manage your website's content—like blog posts, portfolio items, or product listings—directly from your Notion workspace.

Replit, powered by [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent), handles the coding, hosting, and deployment, letting you go from idea to a published application quickly. Effective prompting is key to guiding Agent; for a comprehensive guide, see [Efficient prompting with Replit AI](/tutorials/effective-prompting) and [How to vibe code effectively](/tutorials/how-to-vibe-code).

<YouTubeEmbed />

This tutorial guides you through building a minimalistic blog that pulls its posts from a Notion table. You will:

* Use Replit Agent to generate the initial application
* Connect your Replit app to a Notion database
* Learn to guide the AI and troubleshoot common issues using effective prompting techniques
* Publish your blog for the world to see

<Frame>
  <img alt="Screenshot of the final Notion-powered blog application with minimalist design" />
</Frame>

The tutorial will follow largely from the video above, but with some additional context and steps to help you understand the process.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you'll need:

* A Replit account
* A Notion account
* Familiarity with basic Replit Agent interactions. If you're new to Agent, check out the [Replit Agent documentation](/replitai/agent).

## Step 1: Prepare your Notion database

Before prompting Agent, set up your content source in Notion. This involves thinking procedurally about what your blog needs, similar to planning a product.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Notion integration">
    1. In Notion, go to **Settings & members** (usually in the top-left sidebar).
    2. Navigate to **Connections** (previously "Integrations").
    3. Select **Develop or manage integrations**.
    4. Select **+ New integration**.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion developer portal showing the New integration button" />
    </Frame>

    5. Name your integration (e.g., "My Replit Blog Integration").
    6. Associate it with your desired workspace.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion integration configuration screen with name and workspace selection" />
    </Frame>

    7. For "Integration type," choose **Internal Integration**.
    8. Select **Submit**.
    9. Copy your **Internal Integration Secret** (token) and save it securely. This is your Notion API key.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion integration secrets page showing the integration token" />
    </Frame>

    10. Under **Capabilities**, ensure "Read content" is enabled. For this tutorial, reading is sufficient. If you later want to write data to Notion, enable "Insert content" and "Update content."

    <Info>
      Create a new integration for each project to manage permissions granularly. This is a security best practice.
    </Info>

    For more detailed instructions, refer to [Notion's official documentation on creating an integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration).

    You can directly access Notion's integrations dashboard at [notion.so/my-integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Notion page with a database">
    1. Create a new page in Notion for your blog content.
    2. On this page, add a new **Table** database.
    3. Name your table (e.g., "Blog Posts").
    4. Define columns for your posts. **Specify** these clearly in your mind, as you'll soon tell Agent about them:
       * `Title` (Text, default title property)
       * `Body` (Text, for main post content)
       * `Slug` (Text, for URL-friendly identifiers)
       * `PublishedDate` (Date, or use "Created time" / "Last edited time")
       * `ReadingTime` (Text or Number, e.g., "5 min read")
       * `Description` (Text, short summary for previews)

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion database configured with columns for blog posts" />
    </Frame>

    5. Add a few sample posts. You can use Notion's AI features to help generate content!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your integration to the page">
    1. Open the Notion page containing your database.
    2. Click the **•••** (three dots) menu in the top-right corner.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion connections menu showing how to add your integration to the page" />
    </Frame>

    3. Select **+ Add connections**.
    4. Search for and select the integration you created (e.g., "My Replit Blog Integration").

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Notion page showing the three dots menu to add integrations" />
    </Frame>

    5. Confirm the connection. This allows Replit (via the integration token) to access this page and its database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Prompt Replit Agent

With Notion set up, let's get Replit Agent to build our blog's foundation. **Plan before you prompt**: a clear outline of features leads to more focused prompts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Replit Agent">
    Navigate to the Replit homepage and open **Agent**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write your prompt">
    Provide Agent with a detailed prompt. **Simplify** your language, but be **specific** about requirements, constraints, and desired outputs. Here's an example:

    ```text theme={null}
    Help me create a hyper-minimalistic blog using Notion as a CMS.
    The blog should pull posts from a Notion page.
    The table on the Notion page has the following columns: Title, Body, Slug, PublishedDate, ReadingTime, Description.
    You should generate a slug for each post based on its title if the Slug column is empty.
    Make the blog theme black with white text. Keep it extremely minimal.
    The posts should be listed on the homepage, and clicking a post should navigate to a page displaying the full post content.
    ```

    <Tip>
      For more tips on writing effective prompts, see our guide on [Efficient prompting with Replit AI](/tutorials/effective-prompting).
      You can also **show** Agent what you mean by providing a URL to scrape for initial styling or content ideas (e.g., your personal portfolio) by adding: `Scrape the content of [URL] for initial design inspiration and placeholder text.`
    </Tip>

    Agent will generate a plan. Review it to ensure it aligns with your expectations, then approve it. This is your first **checkpoint** in the AI-assisted building process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the initial preview">
    Agent will then generate a visual preview. Check if the basic layout and styling are heading in the right direction. Refinements will come later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Connect Replit to Notion with Secrets

Agent will likely need your Notion integration details to fetch data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Secrets in Replit">
    Typically, you'll need:

    1. `NOTION_API_KEY`: Your Internal Integration Secret from Step 1.
    2. `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`: The ID of your Notion database.

    **How to find your Notion Database ID:**

    * Open your Notion page with the database in a browser.
    * The URL might be `https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/PAGE_TITLE-PAGE_ID?v=DATABASE_VIEW_ID`. The `PAGE_ID` is often the database ID if the database is the page's main element.
    * **More reliably**: Click the **•••** menu on your database view, select **Copy link to view**, and paste it. The link `https://www.notion.so/your-workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=VIEW_ID` contains the `DATABASE_ID` before `?v=`.

    Go to the **Secrets** tool (🔒 icon) in your Replit Workspace. Add these:

    * Key: `NOTION_API_KEY`, Value: `[Your_Notion_Integration_Secret]`
    * Key: `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`, Value: `[Your_Notion_Database_ID]`

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Replit Secrets tool with Notion API key and Database ID added" />
    </Frame>

    Agent should automatically use these secrets and attempt to connect. The app will likely restart.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Debugging and refining with Agent

Building with AI is iterative. Expect errors or imperfections. This is where guiding the AI effectively—often called "vibe coding"—is key. For a deeper dive into this skill, check out our tutorial on [How to vibe code effectively](/tutorials/how-to-vibe-code). **Master context** by providing only relevant information for each debugging step.

<Tip>
  Keep the **Console** in your Replit Workspace open. It provides valuable error messages and logs.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Replit Console showing error messages while debugging the Notion integration" />
</Frame>

Here are common scenarios and how to address them by **debugging methodically**:

### Scenario 1: "Failed to load posts" or property errors

#### Symptom

The app runs but doesn't display posts. Console errors might mention "Could not find sort property with name ID created\_time" or other column mismatches.

#### Cause

Agent might assume column names or properties (e.g., `created_time` for sorting) that don't exist or are named differently in your Notion database.

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Verify Notion Database**: Ensure column names in your database exactly match Agent's expectations or your prompt. If Agent seeks `created_time` and you have `PublishedDate`, it's a mismatch.
2. **Prompt Agent with error (Debug principle)**: Copy the *exact* console error and **select** relevant code snippets if you've identified them. Provide this focused context to Agent:
   ```text theme={null}
   There's an error fetching posts. Console: "Could not find sort property with name ID created_time".
   My Notion database uses 'PublishedDate'. Please use this for sorting/fetching. Here's the suspected code from `services/notion.js`: [code snippet]
   ```
3. **Iterate (Experiment principle)**: If Agent's fix fails, provide more specifics. "Posts still not loading. Error persists. Show me the code for fetching/sorting Notion posts." If you added a column like `created_time` in Notion as a quick fix, you can later ask Agent: "Remove reliance on 'created\_time', use 'PublishedDate' instead." Remember to use Agent's **Checkpoints** to save working states.

### Scenario 2: Incorrect data display or formatting

#### Symptom

Data appears, but incorrectly (e.g., reading time wrong on homepage but right on post page; Markdown rendering issues).

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Be specific (Specify principle)**: Describe the issue and location clearly:
   ```text theme={null}
   On the homepage, post reading time is incorrect, but it's correct on individual post pages.
   Also, display 'PublishedDate' on the homepage for each post summary.
   ```
2. **Markdown issues (Show principle)**: If Notion "Body" Markdown renders incorrectly (e.g., extra spaces, formatting errors):
   * Inspect raw content in Notion; its formatting can introduce subtle characters.
   * Prompt Agent clearly. You can even **show** an example:
     ```text theme={null}
     Markdown rendering issue: In post X, bold text like '**this**' appears as ' ** this **' and fails to render. Ensure Markdown parsing handles such cases or trims whitespace. Example of correct rendering for bold: **This is bold**.
     ```
   * Testing with known good Markdown (e.g., from ChatGPT pasted into Notion) can isolate if the issue is source data or rendering logic.

### General debugging flow

1. **Observe**: Note the error or incorrect behavior.
2. **High-level prompt (Simplify)**: Describe the problem to Agent clearly.
3. **Check Console/DevTools (Debug)**: Look for detailed errors.
4. **Iterate & provide context (Select, Show)**: If Agent's fix fails, provide more context (error message, relevant code, your goal, attempts made).
5. **Incremental changes (Checkpoint)**: Ask Agent to fix one thing at a time. Use **Checkpoints** in Agent to save progress.
6. **Rollback**: If prompts worsen things, roll back to a working **Checkpoint** and try a new approach.

<Note>
  Don't hesitate to examine Agent-generated code. Even without expertise in the language, you can often spot logical issues or understand data flow, helping you write better prompts. Files like `notionService.js` usually handle Notion API calls.
</Note>

## Step 5: Further enhancements

Once core functionality works, ask Agent to add features. Use positive, direct language (**Instruct** principle). Here are ideas:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement caching and prefetching">
    Ask Agent: "Implement post caching and prefetching from Notion for a super-fast site."
    This reduces Notion API calls and speeds up page loads.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enhance styling">
    Ask Agent: "Add a hover effect to homepage blog post links." or "Improve post typography for readability."
    Small visual tweaks significantly improve user experience. You can **show** Agent examples of styles you like.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure data refresh strategy">
    Consider how often to fetch new Notion data. For simple blogs, on page load or server restart might be enough.
    For dynamic content, ask Agent: "Explore options to auto-refresh Notion posts hourly." This might involve background polling (adds complexity but keeps content current).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 6: Publish your website

Happy with your site? Time to share it!

1. Select **Publish** in the Replit Workspace (top right).
2. Review publishing settings (project name, tier). For more details, see [About Deployments](/cloud-services/deployments/about-deployments).
3. Select **Publish**.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Replit publishing interface showing how to publish your Notion-powered website" />
</Frame>

Replit builds, bundles, and publishes your app to a public URL.

## What you've learned

By following this tutorial, you've learned to:

* Set up Notion as a CMS with an integration and structured database
* Prompt Replit Agent to build a web app connected to Notion, applying principles like **planning, specifying, and simplifying**
* Securely manage API keys using Replit Secrets
* Iteratively debug and refine an AI-generated app using techniques like **providing context, showing examples, and using checkpoints**
* Publish your Notion-powered website on Replit

For detailed information about checkpoints and rollbacks, see [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).

Building with AI like Replit Agent is collaborative. Procedural thinking, clear instructions, and methodical debugging are crucial for turning ideas into reality, fast.

## Next steps

Continue developing your Notion-powered website:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Experiment with content types">
    Try adding diverse content from Notion: image galleries, embedded videos, or categorized items.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage advanced Notion features">
    Explore Notion's formulas, rollups, and relations for complex data structures. Work with Agent to display this rich data on your Replit site.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine with other Replit integrations">
    Enhance your app by merging Notion data with other [Replit AI](/category/replit-ai) tools or [Agent integrations](/replitai/integrations). For example, use Replit Auth for private content or OpenAI for AI-generated summaries from Notion data within your app.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Happy building! We can't wait to see what you create.

#### Typical enrollment steps

1. Sign in at `https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/`
2. Complete identity verification
3. Accept the Apple Developer Program license agreement
4. Pay the annual fee set by Apple
5. Wait for Apple approval (time varies by account type)

### Understand TestFlight vs. the App Store

TestFlight is Apple’s beta testing system. The App Store is the public marketplace where anyone can download your app.

| Aspect             | TestFlight                                        | App Store                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Audience**       | Invited testers (up to 10,000 external testers)   | Public                                   |
| **Purpose**        | Beta testing and feedback                         | Public release                           |
| **Review**         | First build of a version goes through beta review | Every submission goes through App Review |
| **Build lifetime** | Expires after 90 days                             | Permanent until you remove it            |

<Tip>
  TestFlight is the fastest way to catch crashes, performance issues, and device-specific problems before launch.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the publishing pane">
    With your app already published to Expo Go, open the publishing pane in your Workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select App Store publishing">
    Select **Publish to App Store** to promote your app to TestFlight.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Apple and submit">
    Sign in with your Apple Developer account when prompted. Replit builds a native app in the cloud and submits it to TestFlight.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The first build of a version typically requires a TestFlight beta review. After approval, you can usually push additional builds to testers faster.
</Note>

### Enable external testing

To share your TestFlight build with other people, configure external testing in App Store Connect:

1. In App Store Connect, open your app.
2. Go to **TestFlight**, then **External Testing**.
3. Create a testing group and add your build.
4. Submit for Beta App Review (required by Apple for external testers).
5. Share the public TestFlight link after approval.

## Part 5: Submit to the App Store

When your build is ready for release, submit it through App Store Connect:

1. In App Store Connect, open your app.
2. Go to the **App Store** tab.
3. Fill out required metadata (description, screenshots, category, pricing, and privacy details).
4. Select your TestFlight build to promote.
5. Submit for review.

### Complete your App Store Connect listing

Replit creates your app listing in App Store Connect, but you still need to complete required metadata before Apple will accept a submission. The following fields are commonly required:

* **App name and subtitle**
* **Category** (primary, optional secondary)
* **Pricing and availability** (free or paid, and regions)
* **Privacy policy URL** (publicly accessible)
* **App Privacy details** (data collection “nutrition labels”)
* **Screenshots** (required)
* **Support URL** (required)
* **App Review contact information** (required)

<Callout type="note">
  If your app requires sign-in, add demo credentials for App Review in App Store Connect so Apple can test your app.
</Callout>

### Privacy requirements

Apple requires you to:

* Provide a public **privacy policy URL**
* Declare your **App Privacy** data practices (including third-party SDKs and services you use)

If you use third-party services (analytics, payments, crash reporting, ads), review their privacy disclosures and include them in your App Privacy answers.

### Screenshots

Screenshots are required and strongly influence conversion on the App Store.

<Tip>
  Use real screenshots from your app. Make sure screenshots match the current build you’re submitting.
</Tip>

### Common rejection reasons

| Issue                             | How to avoid it                                             |

# Design vs. App Mode
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/design-vs-build-mode

Learn the difference between Design and App modes in Replit, and when to use each for your projects.

Replit offers two ways to create apps: **Design Mode** and **App Mode**. The best part? You can use them together—start with a beautiful design, refine it, then convert to a fully functional app when you're ready.

## What is Design Mode?

[Design Mode](/replitai/design-mode) lets you create beautiful, interactive websites and app designs in just a few minutes. Simply describe your idea and Replit builds it for you.

Design Mode is perfect for:

* **Testing your ideas quickly**: Visualize your app's design before building functionality
* **Creating polished websites**: Landing pages, portfolios, restaurant menus, event pages
* **Fine-tuning your design**: Adjust colors, layouts, and content instantly

<Info>
  Design Mode apps look and feel like real apps, but they don't store data or connect to external services yet. When you're happy with how everything looks, you can convert your design into a full app with one click. The steps below show you how.
</Info>

## What is App Mode?

App Mode creates real, working applications that can save data, let people sign in, and connect to other services.

Use App Mode when your app needs to:

* **User accounts**: Let people create accounts and log in
* **Save information**: Store data like orders, messages, or user preferences
* **Connect to other services**: Process payments, send emails, or pull in data from other apps
* **Handle complex tasks**: Run an online store, manage bookings, or power a dashboard

## See the difference in action

This comparison shows the same restaurant menu built in both modes using an identical prompt. Switch between tabs to see what each mode created:

<Card>
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Design Mode">

      * Beautiful, polished design
      * Elegant typography and layout
      * Perfect for showcasing your vision
      * Static menu (no ordering functionality)
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="App Mode">
      <Frame>
        <video aria-label="App Mode restaurant menu example showing fully functional ordering system with database built in seven minutes" />
      </Frame>

      <Info>
        **App Mode** — Built in 7 minutes
      </Info>

      * Simple design
      * Fully functional ordering system
      * Database for orders and inventory
      * Ready for production use
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

## Using both modes together

**Design Mode and App Mode are built to work together**. You don't have to choose one or the other. You can start with design and evolve into a full app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design first">
    Start in Design Mode to quickly visualize your idea. Focus on how your app looks and feels—the layout, colors, buttons, and user experience.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine and iterate">
    Use the [Visual Editor](/replitai/visual-editor) to click directly on elements and adjust them, or chat with Agent to describe changes you want. The changes will appear immediately.

    <Frame>
      <video aria-label="Demonstration of using the select element tool to click and adjust design elements" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert to a full app">
    When you're happy with your design and ready to add real functionality, click the **Design** button on the top left, then click **"Convert to App"** in the menu. Agent will add the ability to save data, handle user accounts, and connect to services—all while keeping your design intact.

    <Frame>
      <video aria-label="Demonstration of converting a Design Mode project to App Mode by clicking Design button and selecting Convert to App" />
    </Frame>

    <Note>
      Agent will prompt you to convert to App Mode when you try to add a database or advanced features.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once your app is built, publish it so anyone can access it online. Replit handles all the technical infrastructure so your app works reliably for your audience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to use each mode

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Start with Design Mode" icon="paintbrush">
    * You want to see your idea quickly
    * You're creating a simple website
    * You want to test different designs
    * Speed is your priority
  </Card>

  <Card title="Go straight to App Mode" icon="cube">
    * You know exactly what you need
    * Your app must save data from day one
    * People need to log in
    * You're connecting to other services
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Not sure which to pick?** Start with Design Mode. It's faster, and you can always convert to App Mode later. Your work is never wasted—it carries over when you upgrade.
</Tip>

## Key differences

| Feature                    | Design Mode                 | App Mode                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Speed**                  | A few minutes               | About 10 minutes for complete apps |
| **Data storage**           | Visual only (no saving)     | Saves and retrieves real data      |
| **User accounts**          | Shows what login looks like | Actual login functionality         |
| **Connecting to services** | Not available               | Payments, emails, external data    |
| **Hosting**                | Simple static hosting       | Scales with your audience          |

# Efficient prompting with Replit AI
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/effective-prompting

Learn principles and see examples for writing effective prompts when using Replit Agent.

Clear, concise, and context-rich prompts are the foundation of effective vibe coding with Replit Agent. Think of prompting as giving precise instructions to a very capable—but literal-minded—assistant like [**Replit Agent**](/replitai/agent). Guiding Agent effectively helps you go from idea to app, fast.

## Examples of bad and good prompts

Here are some examples of bad and good prompts:

| Bad Prompt            | Good Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Fix my code."        | "My script fails when processing user input. The error seems to be in the validation function. Can you help debug the `validate_input` part? Here's the relevant error message: \[details]" | **Specificity & Context (Debug, Select, Show)**: The good prompt identifies the problem area and the suspected function. It also offers specific context like code and error details, unlike the vague request. |
| "Make a website."     | "Create a simple portfolio website. It needs sections for Home, About Me, and a Contact Form. Use a clean, modern design theme and placeholder content."                                    | **Clarity & Constraints (Simplify, Specify, Test)**: The good prompt defines the purpose, core features (sections), desired aesthetic, and initial content state.                                               |
| "Don't make it slow." | "Refactor the data processing function to handle larger inputs more efficiently. Could we use a different algorithm or data structure?"                                                     | **Positive Instruction & Goal (Instruct, Specify)**: Tells the AI *how* to improve (efficiency) and suggests *what* to consider (algorithm, data structure) rather than a negative constraint.                  |
| "Add animation."      | "Animate the main image on the landing page so it gently fades in when the page first loads to create a welcoming effect."                                                                  | **Specificity & Outcome (Specify, Show)**: The good prompt identifies the specific element, desired visual effect (fade in), timing (page load), and the intended user experience.                              |
| "Build the backend."  | "Set up the server-side logic. Implement user authentication (signup/login) and create an API endpoint to retrieve user profile data securely."                                             | **Breaking Down Tasks (Checkpoint, Test, Specify)**: The good prompt breaks down a large task ("backend") into specific functionalities (authentication, data retrieval API).                                   |

Just like leading a team, providing clear direction, the right resources, and constructive feedback to your AI partner yields the best results. Mastering the art of the prompt unlocks the full power of AI-assisted development.

## Core prompting principles

<YouTubeEmbed />

Effective prompting isn't about complex linguistic tricks; it's about clarity, context, and iteration. Here are the key principles to remember when interacting with **Agent**:

| Tip            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checkpoint** | Structure development iteratively. Break large goals into smaller, testable steps, using [**Checkpoints**](/replitai/agent#checkpoints) in **Agent** to save progress and enable safe experimentation. |
| **Debug**      | Assist the AI in troubleshooting by providing detailed context, including exact error messages, relevant code snippets, and the steps taken.                                                           |
| **Discover**   | Leverage the AI's knowledge by asking for suggestions on appropriate tools, libraries, frameworks, or general programming approaches for your task.                                                    |
| **Experiment** | Treat prompting as an iterative process. Refine your requests by adjusting wording, adding detail, or simplifying instructions to improve AI responses.                                                |
| **Instruct**   | Guide the AI effectively by stating clear, positive goals and desired actions, rather than focusing on negative constraints or what to avoid.                                                          |
| **Select**     | Provide focused, relevant context using features like file mentions. Avoid overwhelming the AI with unrelated information; start new chats for distinct tasks.                                         |
| **Show**       | Reduce ambiguity by providing concrete examples, such as code snippets, desired output formats, sample data, or even UI mockups via image uploads.                                                     |
| **Simplify**   | Communicate clearly and directly. Use concise language, break down complex ideas, and avoid jargon, as if instructing a new team member.                                                               |
| **Specify**    | Ensure the AI understands the exact requirements by defining expected outputs, necessary constraints, data formats, and edge case handling.                                                            |
| **Test**       | Plan your application's structure and features *before* prompting. Break down requirements like a PM/engineer to guide the AI effectively.                                                             |

Let's explore how to apply each of these principles.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Ten tips for effective prompting with Replit Agent" />
</Frame>

### Checkpoint: Build incrementally

Instead of asking the AI to build your entire application at once, break the project down into smaller, logical steps. Approach development iteratively, confirming each piece works before moving on. This mirrors traditional development cycles and makes the process more manageable for both you and the AI.

* **Why it matters**: Building step-by-step makes debugging easier and allows the AI to focus its capabilities.
* **How to apply**: Prompt for one feature or component at a time. After each successful step, use **Replit Agent**'s [**Checkpoint**](/replitai/agent#checkpoints) feature (like a `git commit`) to save your progress. If a subsequent step fails, you can easily **Rollback** to a working state and try a different prompt.

  * **Less Effective**: "Build a complete e-commerce platform."
  * **More Effective**: "Set up a basic full-stack project for an e-commerce site. Include user sign-up and login functionality using a Replit Database." (Followed by prompts for product listings, cart, etc.)

### Debug: Provide contextual clues

When errors pop up, treat the AI like a collaborator who needs information to help. Go beyond saying "it's broken" and provide specific details about the problem, including error messages and the relevant code sections, so the AI can effectively assist in troubleshooting.

* **Why it matters**: The AI needs context to understand the error and suggest a correct fix.
* **How to apply**: Include the *exact* error message, the relevant code snippet(s), the file name(s) where the error occurs, what you were trying to achieve, and any steps you've already tried.

  * **Less Effective**: "My login page is broken."
  * **More Effective**: "When I try to log in with correct credentials on the `/login` page, I get a 'User not found' error in the browser console. It seems like the check against the database isn't working. Here's the relevant login handling code in `auth.js`."

### Discover: Ask about possibilities

Don't hesitate to ask **Agent** for advice. If you're unsure about the best library for a task or different ways to approach a feature, swicth to Plan mode and ask! This is a great way to learn about new tools or techniques relevant to your project.

* **Why it matters**: You can quickly learn about relevant technologies or techniques you might not be aware of.
* **How to apply**: Frame questions openly. Ask about options, trade-offs, or common practices.

  * **Less Effective**: "Add payments."
  * **More Effective**: "What are some good options for accepting credit card payments in a web app built on Replit? I need something relatively simple to integrate."

### Experiment: Iterate and refine

Your first prompt might not yield the perfect result, and that's okay. Prompting is a conversation. If the AI's response isn't quite right, try rephrasing your request, adding more detail, or simplifying the language. Small adjustments can lead to significantly better outcomes.

* **Why it matters**: Iteration helps you converge on the desired outcome and learn what prompts work best for specific tasks.
* **How to apply**: If the first response isn't quite right, rephrase your request. Add more detail, provide an example, or simplify the instruction. Try different ways of explaining the same goal.

  * **Initial Prompt**: "Create a header for my website."
  * **Refined Prompt**: "Create a sticky header component for my website. It should include the site logo on the left and navigation links (Home, About, Contact) on the right."

### Instruct: Use positive and direct language

Clearly state what you want the AI *to do*, rather than listing things to avoid. Positive, direct instructions are easier for the AI to understand and act on, leading to more predictable and useful results.

* **Why it matters**: Positive instructions are less ambiguous and guide the AI more effectively toward the desired action.
* **How to apply**: Frame your requests as clear commands or descriptions of the desired state.

  * **Less Effective**: "Don't make the user profile page confusing."
  * **More Effective**: "Design a clean user profile page. Display the username prominently, followed by the user's email and join date. Include an 'Edit Profile' button."

### Select: Curate relevant context

Give the AI the specific information it needs for the task at hand, but avoid flooding it with irrelevant details. Use features like file mentioning to focus the AI's attention. If switching to a completely different task, starting a **New chat** can prevent confusion.

* **Why it matters**: Helps the AI focus on the specific problem without getting sidetracked by unrelated details. **Agent** has features to help manage context, like mentioning specific files or scraping URLs.
* **How to apply**: When asking for changes to specific files (`profile.js`, `profile.html`), mention or attach only those key files. Supplement with specific external context like documentation URLs or design mockups instead of attaching the entire codebase.

  * **Less Effective**: (Attaching the whole project) "Implement the user profile page based on our design system."
  * **More Effective**: "Create the user profile page. Fetch user data from the server endpoint. Style the page according to the guidelines in the design system documentation: \[URL to design system docs] and match the layout shown in this mockup: \[attach image `profile_mockup.jpg`]."

### Show: Provide examples and demonstrations

Sometimes, the best way to explain what you want is to show an example. Provide code snippets illustrating a style, sample data structures, or even upload screenshots of a UI element you want the AI to replicate. This helps eliminate ambiguity.

* **Why it matters**: Examples reduce ambiguity and give the AI a clear target to aim for. Replit AI supports multimodal input like images.
* **How to apply**: Include code snippets of the desired style, sample input/output data, links to documentation, or even UI mockups/screenshots (which **Agent** can often interpret).

  * **Less Effective**: "Make the product cards look better."
  * **More Effective**: "Redesign the product cards on the shop page. Each card should display the product image, name, price, and an 'Add to Cart' button, similar to this layout: \[link to example site or attach screenshot]. Use a light gray border for each card."
  * **Alternatively**: "Use this JSON structure for representing product data: \[example JSON snippet]. Generate display logic based on this."

### Simplify: Be clear and concise

Communicate with the AI using clear, straightforward language. Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentences. Breaking down your request into simple steps or bullet points can greatly improve the AI's understanding.

* **Why it matters**: Simple, direct language reduces the chance of misinterpretation.
* **How to apply**: Break down complex requests. Use bullet points for lists of requirements. State the primary goal clearly upfront.

  * **Less Effective**: "Implement the necessary server-side infrastructure to facilitate the dynamic generation and retrieval of user-generated content artifacts."
  * **More Effective**: "Create the backend functionality for users to submit blog posts. Users should be able to enter a title and body content. Store these posts in the Replit Database."

### Specify: Define outputs and constraints

Be explicit about your requirements and expectations. Define the desired output format, specify any constraints (like using a particular library), and mention important edge cases the AI should consider. The more specific you are, the better the AI can meet your needs.

* **Why it matters**: Reduces ambiguity and ensures the AI's output meets your specific needs.
* **How to apply**: Detail the expected function signature, return types, data formats, error handling behavior, or specific technologies to use.

  * **Less Effective**: "Add a contact form."
  * **More Effective**: "Create a contact form page at `/contact`. The form should include fields for Name (required), Email (required, must be valid format), and Message (required, min 10 characters). On submit, send the form data to `contact@mydomain.com`."

### Test: Plan before you prompt

Before you start prompting, take a moment to plan. Think through the application's structure, key features, and user flow, much like a product manager or engineer would. Having a clear plan will help you write more targeted and effective prompts.

* **Why it matters**: A clear plan leads to more focused prompts and a more coherent final application.
* **How to apply**: Outline the features, data structures, and user flows before you start prompting **Agent**. Break the overall goal into logical development stages.

  * **Less Effective**: "Build a task manager app."
  * **More Effective**: (After planning) "1. Create the basic HTML structure for a task manager with an input field and a task list. 2. Add JavaScript to allow users to add tasks to the list. 3. Use Replit Database to store tasks so they persist. 4. Add functionality to mark tasks as complete..." (Then prompt for each step).

## Summary

Apply these principles: build incrementally, provide clear context, be specific, show examples, and plan ahead. This approach significantly improves collaboration with **Replit Agent**. This allows developers to leverage the power of AI to build and publish applications faster and more effectively.


# Building Mobile Apps with Expo and Replit
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/expo-on-replit

Replit is the fastest way to create and publish cross-platform mobile apps using Expo, without any setup or configuration.

Apps are the new websites, and everyone should be able to create them. By combining Replit's browser-based development environment [with Expo](https://expo.dev/blog/from-idea-to-app-with-replit-and-expo), mobile app creation is now as simple as building a website.

<Note>
  This tutorial will guide you through creating a mobile app using Replit and Expo, from setting up your environment to publishing your app to your device.
</Note>

Watch Replit's two-part video series to learn how to create and publish a mobile app using Replit and Expo.

## Part 1: Create a mobile app in five minutes

# How to vibe code effectively
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/how-to-vibe-code

Learn essential skills to effectively guide Replit Agent, turning your ideas into functional applications faster.

## How to think about vibe coding

Replit Agent is incredibly powerful, capable of generating code, configuring environments, and even building entire applications.

However, they work best when guided effectively. "Vibe coding" is about developing the intuition and skills to steer these AI partners efficiently.

Think about yourself like a manager, or rather, a *leader* your job is to guide your "team" to success—that's done by providing direction, resources, and feedback.

Replit is your team, and you're the leader.

<Frame>
  <iframe title="5 Skills for Vibe Coding" />
</Frame>

Without vibe coding skills, you might find yourself:

* Stuck in unproductive loops with the AI.
* Building features that don't quite meet your vision.
* Unsure how to debug when things inevitably break.
* Overwhelmed by the possibilities and unsure where to start.

Mastering these five skills helps you provide the right guidance at the right time, enabling you to leverage AI to go from idea to app, fast.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a practical approach to prompt engineering focused on application development. It involves a blend of technical understanding, clear communication, and iterative refinement.

It's less about knowing every programming language feature and more about understanding how to break down problems, ask the right questions, and guide an AI collaborator.

<Frame>
  <iframe title="What is Vibe Coding?" />
</Frame>

The five key skills are:

1. **Procedural Thinking**: Planning your app like a product manager and engineer combined.
2. **Leveraging Frameworks**: Knowing which tools to use and asking the AI for help.
3. **Building in Checkpoints**: Making incremental progress and using AI snapshots.
4. **Debugging Methodically**: Systematically finding and fixing errors with AI assistance.
5. **Mastering Context**: Giving the AI the right information (and only the right information).

## The Skills

Let's break down each skill with practical steps you can apply when building with Replit Agent.

See our guide on [Effective Prompting](/tutorials/effective-prompting) for detailed tips and examples.

### Think Procedurally

<Frame>
  <img alt="Procedural Thinking" />
</Frame>

Before writing a single prompt, think through the entire application. This goes beyond basic logical thinking (like knowing the rules of chess) or even computational thinking (like programming a computer to enforce those rules).

Procedural thinking is about understanding how to *excel*—like programming an AI to play chess competitively. It means deeply understanding the problem space, the desired outcome, and the steps to get there.

* **Define the problem space**: What core problem does the app solve? What makes a *successful* app in this context?
* **Plan the MVP**: What are the absolute essential features for the first version? Start small.
* **Break it down**: Define the high-level goals, then break them into smaller, actionable steps or features. Think like both a product manager (defining requirements) and an engineer (planning implementation).
* **Anticipate edge cases**: What could go wrong? How should the app handle unexpected inputs or situations?
* **Consider the User Experience**: What makes a *good* app for this purpose? What data needs to be stored? How should users interact with it?
* **Example**: If building a tip-splitting app, don't just ask for "a tip splitter." Specify how users add friends, input the bill amount, handle taxes/discounts, and share the results. Procedural thinking defines these requirements clearly for the AI.

This might involve drawing a wireframe, writing a doc about the requirements of the app, or even just a list of features.

Use the screenshot from your wireframe to help Agent understand the app. Here's a sample screenshot and prompt from a question asking app.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Question Asking App" />
</Frame>

### Leverage Frameworks

You don't need to build everything from scratch, and often, you shouldn't. Countless frameworks and libraries exist to solve common problems (UI components, animations, data handling, etc.).

* **Ask the AI**: You don't know what you don't know. Ask Agent on Plan mode: "What are good options for building a user interface with drag-and-drop features?" or "What's the best way to handle user authentication?"
* **Check Compatibility**: Newer frameworks might not be in the AI's training data. Ask the AI about compatibility or provide documentation links directly in your prompt. Agent can often scrape web content for context.
* **Provide Specifics**: If you find a relevant library or code snippet, include it in your prompt. Giving the AI concrete examples of *how* to use a framework is highly effective.

<Info>
  LLMs have training data cutoffs. Very recent frameworks might require you to provide documentation or examples as context for best results.
</Info>

### Build in Checkpoints

AI doesn't always get it right on the first try. Building large features in one go increases the risk of complex errors. Work incrementally.

* **Define Small Goals**: Prompt the AI to build one small piece of functionality at a time.
* **Test Each Step**: After the AI completes a task, run the code. Does it work as expected?
* **Use Checkpoints**: Replit Agent automatically creates **Checkpoints** that capture your complete development state—workspace contents, AI conversation context, and connected databases. If something breaks, don't keep prompting with the same request. Select **Rollback to here** on a previous checkpoint and try a different approach or prompt.
* **Version Control Principles**: Think of Checkpoints like comprehensive commits that preserve your entire development environment. They provide safe points to return to if you go down the wrong path.

<Frame>
  <iframe title="Checkpoints" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Using **Rollback** allows you to explore different implementation paths without losing progress on what already works. Rollbacks restore your entire development environment, including workspace contents and AI conversation context. Connected databases can also be restored when you select "Restore databases" under "Additional rollback options."
</Note>

<Info>
  Learn more about comprehensive checkpoint and rollback capabilities in [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).
</Info>

### Debug Methodically

<Frame>
  <img alt="Debug Methodically" />
</Frame>

Errors are inevitable. Instead of just pasting the error message back to the AI, approach debugging systematically.

* **Understand the Error**: Read the error message carefully. Where did it occur (`Console`, browser, specific file)? What does it say?
* **Gather Clues**: Look at the code around the error. Check the `Console` for logs. Use Agent to explain parts of the code you don't understand.
* **Isolate the Problem**: Try to reproduce the error reliably. What specific action triggers it?
* **Provide Contextual Clues**: When asking the AI for help, provide:
  * The exact error message.
  * The relevant code snippet(s).
  * What you were trying to do.
  * What you've already tried.
* **Turn it into a Game**: Think of debugging as solving a puzzle. Each clue gets you closer to the solution.

### Master Context

The information (context) you provide the AI dramatically influences the quality of its response. More context isn't always better; *relevant* context is key.

* **Be Selective**: Include only information directly relevant to the current task. Exclude unrelated code, files, or previous instructions if they aren't needed. Think about the AI's limited attention span (context window).
* **Use Multimodal Inputs**: Provide code snippets, file attachments, error messages, URLs for documentation, or even screenshots if they help clarify the request.
* **Structure Prompts Clearly**: State the goal first, then provide supporting context.
* **Start Fresh for New Features**: When starting a significantly new feature, consider using **New chat** in Agent to ensure the AI isn't confused by previous, unrelated context.

<Tip>
  Imagine explaining a task to a human expert. You wouldn't start by telling them your life story if you just need help fixing a specific bug. Give the AI the focused information it needs.
</Tip>

## Putting It All Together: The Vibe Coding Loop

Mastering these skills enables an effective iterative loop for building with AI:

<Frame>
  <img alt="Vibe Coding Loop" />
</Frame>

1. **Think**: Define the next small feature or fix (Procedural Thinking).
2. **Prompt**: Clearly ask the AI, providing relevant frameworks and context (Leveraging Frameworks, Mastering Context).
3. **Test**: Run the code. Does it work?
4. **Error?**:
   * **Yes**: Debug systematically, gather clues, and prompt the AI again with specific details. If stuck, consider rolling back to a previous **Checkpoint** and trying a different approach (Debugging Methodically, Building in Checkpoints).
   * **No**: Success! Save a **Checkpoint** (Building in Checkpoints).
5. **Repeat**: Move on to the next feature or refinement.

This loop turns AI from a magic black box into a powerful, steerable collaborator.

## What you've learned

Developing these skills transforms how you build software with AI:

* **Build Faster**: Go from idea to functional app more quickly and efficiently.
* **Overcome Roadblocks**: Systematically navigate errors and AI limitations.
* **Tackle Complexity**: Build more sophisticated applications by breaking them down effectively.
* **Improve Clarity**: Enhance your own understanding of the project by thinking procedurally.
* **Unlock Creativity**: Spend less time fighting the tools and more time bringing your vision to life.

<Note>
  Vibe coding isn't just about interacting with AI; it enhances your fundamental skills in problem-solving, planning, and critical thinking.

# Learn about MCP in 3 minutes
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/mcp-in-3

Learn how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give AI models access to tools, data sources, and real-world capabilities in just 3 minutes.

## Why AI models need MCP to connect with the real world

AI models like Claude and GPT are powerful but limited to what they were trained on. Without access to external tools and data sources, they can't:

* Access up-to-date information
* Interact with external systems
* Perform actions in the real world
* Work with your private data

## What MCP does: The universal connector for AI apps

Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves this by creating a universal way for AI to connect to tools and data sources - similar to how USB-C standardized device connections.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

MCP is a standardized protocol that allows AI models to:

* Access specialized tools and APIs
* Work with private data sources
* Perform actions in the real world
* Connect to other systems seamlessly

## How MCP works: Understanding the key components

The MCP architecture has three main components:

1. **The Client Side**: AI models like Claude or applications that need to access external tools
2. **The Communication Layer**: The protocol itself that standardizes how requests and responses are formatted
3. **The Server Side**: Programs that provide access to tools, data sources, and specialized capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's an MCP client?">
    An MCP client is something like Claude or a command-line interface that connects to a large language model (LLM). It's the device that needs to plug into external tools or data sources.

    Examples of MCP clients:

    * Claude in the browser
    * Command-line interfaces for AI
    * Custom applications built with AI SDKs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's an MCP server?">
    An MCP server provides tools and capabilities to AI models. Think of it like giving AI a set of specialized tools to solve problems.

    Examples of what MCP servers enable:

    * Accessing specific data sources to answer questions
    * Connecting AI to APIs so it can go online
    * Enabling video summarization or transcript fetching
    * Writing files to your computer
    * Making calculations or running code
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## MCP capabilities that extend AI functionality

MCP provides several key features that make it powerful for AI applications:

* **Resources**: Share data and content with AI models
* **Tools**: Let AI models perform actions through your services
* **Prompts**: Create reusable templates for consistent AI interactions
* **Sampling**: Allow your services to request information from AI models
* **Transports**: Connect clients and servers efficiently

## Try MCP yourself: Build an AI tool in minutes

<Frame>
  <iframe title="Mastering MCP: The Ultimate Guide to AI Connectivity" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up an MCP environment">
    Replit provides Templates that let you experiment with MCP without installing anything. These Templates include all the necessary components to connect AI models to useful tools.

    To get started quickly:

    1. Remix this template: [Learn about MCP](https://replit.com/@matt/Learn-about-MCP?v=1\&utm_source=matt\&utm_medium=blog\&utm_campaign=mcp-in-3)
    2. Wait for the environment to load completely
    3. You'll have a ready-to-use MCP setup with no configuration needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a practical example">
    A simple demonstration shows how MCP enables AI to:

    1. Fetch a YouTube video using just a URL
    2. Get the content or transcript of that video
    3. Write a summary to a file on your system

    Try this command in our MCP Template:

    ```bash theme={null}
    llm "Summarize this video https://youtu.be/1qxOcsj1TAg and write the summary to summary.txt"
    ```

    This demonstrates how MCP gives AI models abilities they wouldn't normally have.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize for your needs">
    Once you understand the basics, you can connect MCP servers to your own data sources or create custom tools that your AI can use to solve specific problems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-world applications you can build with MCP

MCP enables a wide range of powerful AI applications:

* **Customer service systems** that can access company databases to answer specific questions
* **Research assistants** that can search and summarize content from multiple sources
* **Productivity tools** that can interact with your files and applications
* **Content creation tools** that can access media libraries and publishing platforms

## Benefits of using MCP for your AI projects

MCP offers three key benefits:

* Ready-to-use integrations your AI can connect to immediately
* The ability to switch between different AI providers without rewriting your connections
* Security features that keep your sensitive data protected

This is transformative for developers building AI applications and for users who want AI that can do more than just generate text.

<Note>
  MCP is an emerging standard with growing support across the AI ecosystem. More tools and integrations are being added regularly.

# Mobile app troubleshooting
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/mobile-app-troubleshooting

Fix common issues when building mobile apps with Expo and React Native on Replit.

When building mobile apps on Replit, you may encounter issues with previews, bundling, or package dependencies. This guide helps you resolve common problems, starting with quick fixes and progressing to deeper debugging steps.

## Quick fixes

Try these first—they resolve most issues:

| Problem                           | What to try                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Changes not showing on your phone | Shake your phone to open the Expo menu, then tap **Reload** |
| Changes not showing in preview    | Press **R** in the console to rebundle                      |
| App stuck or unresponsive         | Stop and restart the app from the console                   |

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Changes aren't appearing on my device">
    When you make changes but don't see them on your phone:

    1. **Shake your phone** to open the Expo developer menu
    2. Tap **Reload** to redownload the bundle

    On the web preview, press **R** in the console to trigger a rebundle.

    If changes still don't appear, try clearing the cache (see [Clear the Metro cache](#clear-the-metro-cache) below).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Red error screen in Expo Go">
    A red error screen usually indicates a JavaScript error or missing module. Read the error message—it often points to the specific file and line.

    **Common causes:**

    * A package isn't installed or is the wrong version
    * A module works on web but not on native (or vice versa)
    * Syntax error in your code

    **What to try:**

    1. Read the error message carefully—it often tells you exactly what's wrong
    2. Ask Agent to help fix the error by sharing the message
    3. If the error mentions a specific package, try reinstalling dependencies (see [Reinstall packages](#reinstall-packages))
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App works on web but crashes on phone (or vice versa)">
    Some packages or features work differently across platforms. React Native compiles to three targets: iOS, Android, and web. A library that works on web might not support native, or might need different configuration.

    **What to try:**

    1. Check if the package supports your platform in its documentation
    2. Ask Agent: "Is this package compatible with Expo Go?"
    3. Consider moving the functionality to your server if it's not supported on mobile

    <Tip>
      When researching packages, look for "Expo compatible" or check the [Expo SDK documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/) for supported modules.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="QR code won't scan or app won't connect">
    **Check your network:**

    * Your phone and computer must be on the same WiFi network
    * Some corporate or public networks block the connection

    **Try tunnel mode:**
    If you're on a restricted network, tunnel mode routes traffic through Expo's servers. Ask Agent to start the app with tunnel mode, or run `npx expo start --tunnel` in the shell.

    **Restart Expo Go:**
    Close Expo Go completely and reopen it before scanning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build takes a long time">
    The first build is always slower because there's no cache. Subsequent builds should be faster.

    **What affects build time:**

    * Number of packages in your project
    * First run after clearing the cache
    * Network speed when downloading packages

    If builds are consistently slow, check if you have unnecessary packages installed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Module not found errors">
    When you see "Unable to resolve module" or "Module not found":

    1. The package might not be installed—ask Agent to install it
    2. The package might be installed but the cache is stale—clear the cache
    3. The package might not exist or be misspelled—check the package name

    Try [reinstalling packages](#reinstall-packages) if the module should exist.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debugging commands

When quick fixes don't work, these commands help reset various caches and states. Run them in the Shell.

### Clear the Metro cache

Metro is the bundler that compiles your React Native code. Clearing its cache forces a fresh build.

In the shell, run:

```bash theme={null}
npx expo start --clear
```

This clears the bundler cache and restarts the development server. You'll see "Bundler cache is empty. Rebuilding." in the output.

<Tip>
  If you're frequently hitting cache issues, you can add `-c` to your start command. Ask Agent to update the dev command to include the clear flag.
</Tip>

### Reinstall packages

If you're seeing module errors or version mismatches, reinstalling packages often helps.

In the shell, run:

```bash theme={null}
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

This deletes all installed packages and reinstalls them from scratch based on your `package.json`.

<Note>
  If your project uses a different package manager (like `bun` or `pnpm`), use the appropriate install command: `bun install` or `pnpm install`.
</Note>

### Check for version mismatches

Expo Doctor scans your project for common issues like version mismatches between packages.

In the shell, run:

```bash theme={null}
npx expo-doctor
```

Review the output for warnings. If it suggests fixes, evaluate them carefully—don't blindly upgrade packages, as this can introduce new issues.

<Warning>
  Only update packages when there's a specific reason to do so. Upgrading "just because" can break your app if the new version has incompatible changes.
</Warning>

## Full reset

When nothing else works, a full reset clears all caches and reinstalls everything.

<Accordion title="Nuclear option: Full reset command">
  This command removes all caches and reinstalls packages from scratch. Use it as a last resort.

  ```bash theme={null}
  rm -rf node_modules .expo && npm cache clean --force && npm install && npx expo start --clear
  ```

  **What this does:**

  1. `rm -rf node_modules` — Deletes installed packages
  2. `rm -rf .expo` — Deletes Expo's local cache
  3. `npm cache clean --force` — Clears npm's global cache
  4. `npm install` — Reinstalls all packages
  5. `npx expo start --clear` — Starts with a fresh Metro cache

  After running this, your next build will take longer as everything rebuilds from scratch.
</Accordion>

### Clear cache on your device

If the app on your phone seems stuck with old code even after reloading:

* **iOS**: In Expo Go, go to **Settings** and tap **Clear Cache**
* **Android**: Go to **Settings > Apps > Expo Go > Storage > Clear Cache**

## Quick reference

| Problem                   | Try first                | Then try                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Changes not showing       | Shake phone → Reload     | Clear Metro cache        |
| Bundler errors            | `npx expo start --clear` | Delete node\_modules     |
| Module not found          | Reinstall dependencies   | Full reset               |
| Version mismatch warnings | Run `npx expo-doctor`    | Evaluate suggested fixes |
| New package not working   | Restart the server       | Clear Metro cache        |
| Changed app.json          | Restart the server       | —                        |

## Getting more help

If you're still stuck:

* **Ask Agent**: Describe the error and what you've tried. Agent can often diagnose and fix issues.
* **Check Expo docs**: The [Expo troubleshooting guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/overview/) covers additional scenarios.
* **Search the error**: Copy the exact error message and search—someone has likely encountered it before.

# Plan vs. Build Mode
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/plan-vs-build-mode

Learn the difference between Plan and Build modes in Replit, and how to combine them for more effective development.

Replit Agent offers two interaction modes: **Plan Mode** and **Build Mode**. Use them together to think through your ideas first, then implement with confidence.

## What is Plan Mode?

[Plan Mode](/replitai/plan-mode) lets you brainstorm, ask questions, and plan your work with Agent—without modifying any code. Think of it as a collaborative planning session where you can explore ideas freely.

Plan Mode is perfect for:

* **Brainstorming ideas**: Explore different approaches before committing to one
* **Breaking down complex projects**: Get a structured task list before building
* **Learning and understanding**: Ask questions about technologies, patterns, or your codebase
* **Planning architecture**: Design your app's structure before writing code

<Info>
  In Plan Mode, Agent reads your project and provides guidance, but it won't make any changes to your files. When you're ready to implement, switch to Build Mode or approve a plan to start building automatically.
</Info>

## What is Build Mode?

Build Mode is the default mode where Agent writes code, modifies files, and implements features directly in your project. This is where ideas become reality.

Use Build Mode when you're ready to:

* **Create new features**: Let Agent write the code for your next feature
* **Set up your app**: Install dependencies, configure databases, and connect services
* **Fix issues**: Let Agent debug and resolve problems in your codebase
* **Refactor code**: Improve existing code structure and organization

## Using both modes together

**Plan Mode and Build Mode work best as a sequence.** Start by planning to clarify your thinking, then build with a clear direction.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start in Plan Mode">
    Switch to Plan Mode and describe what you want to build. Agent will help you think through the requirements, suggest approaches, and identify potential challenges—all without touching your code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a task list">
    Ask Agent to create a development plan. It will break down your project into specific, actionable tasks with clear priorities and dependencies.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Generated task list with priorities and dependencies" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and refine">
    Review the proposed plan. Ask follow-up questions, request changes, or explore alternative approaches. Keep iterating until the plan matches your vision.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    When you're satisfied with the plan, select **Start building**. Agent automatically switches to Build Mode and begins implementing the approved tasks.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Mode selector showing Plan mode and Build mode options" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track progress">
    Monitor Agent's progress as it works through the task list. Each completed task creates a checkpoint, so you can review changes and roll back if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to use each mode

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Use Plan Mode when" icon="lightbulb">
    * You're starting a new project and need direction
    * You want to explore different approaches
    * The task is complex and needs breaking down
    * You want to learn before implementing
    * You're unsure about the best solution
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Build Mode when" icon="hammer">
    * You know exactly what you want
    * You have a clear plan ready to execute
    * You're making quick fixes or small changes
    * You're following an approved task list
    * Speed of implementation is the priority
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Not sure which to pick?** If your request involves multiple features or significant changes, start with Plan Mode. For simple, well-defined tasks, go straight to Build Mode.
</Tip>

## Key differences

| Feature          | Plan Mode                        | Build Mode                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**      | Brainstorm, plan, and learn      | Implement and build            |
| **Code changes** | None—read-only                   | Writes and modifies files      |
| **Output**       | Ideas, task lists, guidance      | Working code and features      |
| **Best for**     | Complex projects, exploration    | Clear tasks, implementation    |
| **Transition**   | Click "Start building" to switch | Already in implementation mode |

## Best practices

### Getting the most from Plan Mode

* **Be specific about requirements**: The more detail you provide, the better the plan
* **Ask follow-up questions**: Clarify suggestions you don't understand
* **Request examples**: Ask Agent to show code snippets or patterns
* **Discuss trade-offs**: Explore pros and cons of different approaches
* **Iterate on ideas**: Refine the plan until it feels right

### Seamless transitions

* **Review before building**: Always review the task list before approving
* **Start small**: Begin with a subset of tasks if the full plan feels overwhelming
* **Use checkpoints**: Agent creates checkpoints as it builds, so you can always roll back

# Share a database across multiple apps
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/share-database-across-apps

Learn how to expose your Replit database as a REST API to share data securely across multiple apps and external services.

Share your database across multiple apps by exposing it as a REST API. This lets other apps securely read and write your data through HTTP requests while keeping everything in one place.

## Add an API to your existing app

Ask **Agent** to create a REST API for your database. Agent will set up endpoints, add authentication, and protect your data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your app">
    Open the app that contains the database you want to share.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Agent to create the API">
    <AiPrompt>
      Expose my database as a REST API secured with an API key. Create endpoints for all CRUD operations on my existing tables. Use Drizzle ORM for safe database queries. Store the API key in Secrets as API\_KEY.
    </AiPrompt>

    Agent will set up everything you need automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your API key">
    1. Open the **Secrets** tab
    2. Add a secret: `API_KEY` with a secure password
    3. This key protects your database from unauthorized access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your app">
    1. Select **Run** to test your API
    2. Select **Publish** > **Autoscale** to get a public URL
    3. Your database is now accessible to other apps
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Database API template

See a working example with the [Database API Example template](https://replit.com/@matt/Replit-Database-API-Example?utm_source=replit\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_campaign=database-helium). Fork it to start a new database API from scratch, or explore the code to understand how it works.

The template includes:

* Automatic database setup with sample data
* API endpoints for all CRUD operations
* API key authentication
* Drizzle ORM for safe queries

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the template">
    Open the [Database API Example template](https://replit.com/@matt/Replit-Database-API-Example?utm_source=replit\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_campaign=database-helium) and fork it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an API key">
    1. Open the **Secrets** tab
    2. Add `API_KEY` with a secure password
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and publish">
    1. Select **Run** to start the API
    2. Select **Publish** > **Autoscale** when ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect from other apps

Ask **Agent** to write the connection code in any of your other apps:

<AiPrompt>
  Create a backend endpoint that connects to my database API at https\://\[YOUR-APP].replit.app. Use the API key from secrets (API\_KEY) on the server side. Create routes to fetch and display data from the API.
</AiPrompt>

Be sure to replace \[YOUR-APP] with your app's name. Agent will handle authentication and error handling automatically, keeping your API key secure on the server.

### API endpoints reference

Your database uses standard REST endpoints. For an `items` table:

| Action   | Method | Endpoint         |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| List all | GET    | `/api/items`     |
| Get one  | GET    | `/api/items/:id` |
| Create   | POST   | `/api/items`     |
| Update   | PUT    | `/api/items/:id` |
| Delete   | DELETE | `/api/items/:id` |

All requests need an `X-API-KEY` header with your API key.

### Write your own connection code

If you prefer to code the connection yourself, use these backend examples:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Node.js (Backend) theme={null}
  const API_URL = 'https://your-app.replit.app';
  const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/items`, {
    headers: { 'X-API-KEY': API_KEY }
  });
  const items = await response.json();
  ```

  ```python Python (Backend) theme={null}
  import os
  import requests

  API_URL = 'https://your-app.replit.app'
  API_KEY = os.environ['API_KEY']

  response = requests.get(
      f'{API_URL}/api/items',
      headers={'X-API-KEY': API_KEY}
  )
  items = response.json()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  These examples are for **backend code only**. Never use API keys in frontend/browser code - they will be exposed to anyone viewing your page source. For frontend apps, create a backend endpoint that proxies requests to your database API.

  Always store your API key in **Secrets**, not in your code.
</Warning>

## Add more tables

Extend your database as your app grows:

<AiPrompt>
  Add a users table with email, name, and role columns. Create API endpoints for users with the same authentication as the existing endpoints.
</AiPrompt>

Agent will update your schema, create endpoints, and apply authentication automatically.

## How it works

Your API acts as a central hub. When an app needs data, it sends a request to your API. The API checks the API key, then reads or writes to your database. Multiple apps share one database securely.

## Security

Your API includes built-in protection:

* **API key authentication**: Only apps with the correct key can access your database
* **SQL injection protection**: Drizzle ORM prevents malicious queries
* **Data validation**: The API checks all data before saving

<Warning>
  Store your API key in **Secrets**, never in code.
</Warning>

Only share your API key with apps you trust.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't connect from another app">
    * Publish your database API app (not just run it)
    * Use your published URL ending in `.replit.app`
    * Verify both apps have the same API key in Secrets
    * Check the secret is named `API_KEY` in both apps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    * Store the API key in **Secrets**, not in code
    * Verify the API key matches in both apps
    * Check the secret is named `API_KEY` (all caps)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need help">
    Ask **Agent** to troubleshoot:

    <AiPrompt>
      I'm trying to connect to my database API but getting errors. Can you help me debug the connection?
    </AiPrompt>
  </Accordion>

    To add a secret:

    1. Go to the **Secrets** pane in your Workspace
    2. Select **Add a new secret**
    3. Enter a key and value
    4. Select **Add secret**

    Keep sensitive information like API keys secure:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    // Don't do this
    const apiKey = "sk_test_abcdef12345";

    // Do this instead
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Object storage">
    When using Replit's object storage:

    * Files are backed by Google Cloud Storage
    * Only your app can access stored files by default
    * No need to worry about public access control
    * Agent can set up Object Storage with advanced authentication and access controls

    Ask Agent to add secure file storage:

    ```
    Add Object Storage with authentication for user file uploads
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replit Auth">
    Implement authentication without building it from scratch.

    Benefits of Replit Auth:

    * Handles login securely
    * Manages sessions
    * Reduces authentication implementation errors

    Ask Agent:

    ```
    Help me implement authentication for my application with Replit Auth
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Secure architecture with Agent">
    Agent builds applications with:

    * Proper separation of front-end and back-end
    * Secure back-end communication with databases
    * Front-end that communicates only with your back-end API
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database security with ORMs">
    Agent uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools when building applications with databases:

    * Protection against SQL injection
    * Schema validation
    * Type safety
    * Managed database connections
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Security checklist for vibe coding

Follow this comprehensive security checklist to ensure your vibe coded applications follow best security practices.

This guide provides a comprehensive security checklist to ensure your vibe coded applications follow best security practices.

While Replit provides many security features [out of the box](/tutorials/vibe-code-securely), it's important to understand and implement more security measures for your specific application needs.

<iframe title="Vibe code security checklist" />

## Prerequisites

* A Replit account
* Basic understanding of your preferred programming language
* Familiarity with the Replit Workspace
* An application you're building on Replit

## Front-end security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HTTPS everywhere" icon="lock">
    Replit uses HTTPS by default for all applications. So you don't need to worry about it!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Input validation and sanitization" icon="shield-check">
    Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    // Bad: Direct use of user input
    element.innerHTML = userInput;

    // Good: Sanitize input before using
    import { sanitize } from 'some-sanitizer-library';
    element.innerHTML = sanitize(userInput);
    ```

    Switch to [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) and ask Agent:

    ```
    Help me validate and sanitize inputs to protect against XSS attacks
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep sensitive data out of the browser" icon="eye-slash">
    You should use Replit Secrets to store sensitive information like API keys.

    Be sure you don't pass secrets to the client side or put them in the following places:

    * Local storage
    * Session storage
    * Client-side JavaScript
    * Cookies without proper security attributes

    Switch to [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) and ask Agent:

    ```
    Help me keep sensitive data out of the browser. Am I doing this correctly?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CSRF protection" icon="shield">
    Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for forms:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    // Example of CSRF token implementation
    const csrfToken = generateToken();
    session.csrfToken = csrfToken;
    ```

    Switch to [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) and ask Agent:

    ```
    Help me implement CSRF tokens for forms
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Back-end security

<AccordionGroup>

    Agent uses ORMs by default, which helps prevent SQL injection. If writing custom database queries:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    // Bad: String concatenation in queries
    db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`);

    // Good: Parameterized queries with ORM
    db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [username]);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security headers" icon="code">
    Add important security headers to your application:

    ```html theme={null}
    <!-- In index.html or through your back-end -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="DENY">
    <meta http-equiv="X-Content-Type-Options" content="nosniff">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'">

# Vibe coding 101: from idea to published app
Source: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/vibe-coding-101

Learn how to go from an idea to a published application using Replit Agent, featuring an interactive map visualization project.

This tutorial walks you through the "vibe coding" process on Replit—taking an idea from concept to a fully published application. This tutorial will build an interactive map visualization of San Francisco parks, pulling in external data and using modern frameworks. You'll see how to leverage [Replit Agent](/replitai/agent) for initial development, refinements and debugging.

<YouTubeEmbed />

## The vibe coding philosophy

Vibe coding is less about writing every line of code and more about guiding AI tools with your vision and domain knowledge. It's an iterative process of prompting, reviewing, and refining.

Key takeaways from the video:

* **Conceptualize First**: Start with a clear idea of what you want to build. Visualizing the end product helps, especially when prompting AI.
* **Domain Knowledge is Power**: Knowing relevant frameworks (like Leaflet.js for maps) or data sources (like OpenStreetMap) significantly improves AI-generated results.
* **Iterative Development**: Expect to debug and refine. AI tools are powerful, but they're collaborators, not magic wands.

## Project: San Francisco parks map

The goal is to build an interactive map displaying parks and public spaces in San Francisco.

**Problem Statement**: The goal is an interactive map to discover parks and public spaces in San Francisco.
**Solution**: An interactive tool using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap data.
**Key lessons**:

* Prompting AI effectively.
* Processing external data.
* Debugging and handling errors.

## Building with Replit Agent

Replit Agent can scaffold entire projects, set up environments, and generate initial code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Crafting the Initial Prompt">
    A good prompt is specific. We tell Agent:

    * The goal: "Help me create a minimalist maps app to visualize San Francisco's parks."
    * Key technologies: "You should use leaflet for map visualization and fetch data from OpenStreetMap."
    * Specific data types from OpenStreetMap (after research): Natural formations (woods, beaches, islets, cave entrances) and leisure locations (parks, gardens).

    <AiPrompt>
      Help me create a minimalist maps app to visualize San Francisco's parks. You should use leaflet for map visualization and fetch data from OpenStreetMap. Include the following OpenStreetMap data types for San Francisco: natural formations (woods, beaches, islet, cave entrance) and leisure (park, gardens).
    </AiPrompt>

    To learn more about how to write effective prompts, check out [this article](tutorials/effective-prompting).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attaching a Mockup">
    Visual aids help Agent understand the desired layout and features. A simple sketch or mockup can be attached directly to the prompt.

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Wireframe sketch of the maps app" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent's Process">
    1. **Plan Creation**: [Agent](/replitai/agent) outlines the steps it will take. Review and approve this plan.

       <Frame>
         <img alt="Replit Agent plan creation" />
       </Frame>
    2. **Visual Preview**: Agent streams a visual preview of the app's UI.

       <Frame>
         <img alt="Replit Agent visual preview" />
       </Frame>
    3. **Environment Setup**: Agent configures the development environment, installing necessary languages and packages—no manual setup required.
    4. **Building the App**: Agent writes the code for the front end and back end.
    5. **Checkpoints**: Agent creates checkpoints ([Git commits](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/version-control)) so you can roll back if something goes wrong.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Debugging with Agent">
    Errors happen. Use the browser's DevTools (specifically the Console and Network tabs) to find error messages.

    * **Observe**: The map loaded, but no data points appeared.
    * **Investigate**: The console showed an error: "Failed to fetch map features error cannot read properties of undefined reading natural."
    * **Inform Agent**: Paste the error message directly into the chat with Agent. Agent will attempt to debug and fix the issue.

      <Frame>
        <img alt="Browser console showing an error" />
      </Frame>

    In the video, Agent identified an issue with parsing the Overpass API response and added robust error handling, which resolved the problem.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Refining with Fast mode

Once Agent builds the MVP, use [Fast mode](/replitai/fast-mode) for smaller, more targeted edits and refinements. Fast mode is optimized for quick changes.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Improving Map Styling">
    The initial map was functional but could look better.
    **Prompt to Agent**: "Can you use a more minimalist carto style for OpenStreetMap? Carto lite."

    This relies on knowing that "Carto lite" is a known theme for Leaflet maps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adding Dark Mode">
    A common refinement is adding a dark mode.
    **Prompt to Agent**: "Can you add a dark mode to my app and use, carto dark for the map in the dark mode?"

    <Frame>
      <img alt="Replit Agent implementing dark mode" />
    </Frame>

    Agent will:

    * Read files for context.
    * Make changes to necessary files (e.g., theme providers, styles).
    * Restart the app to apply changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterative Debugging with Agent">
    Adding dark mode involved several iterations:

    1. Initial implementation had a toggle that worked for the map but then disappeared.
       **Feedback**: "The toggle theme button works for the map, but it disappears when clicked. The theme toggle should be in the side nav and the theme should be applied to the side nav."
    2. Issues with multiple toggle buttons and incorrect component references (`side nav` vs. `sidebar`).
       **Feedback & Guidance**: "Now there are two toggle themes. One controls the map, the other controls the side nav. Make them into one in the side. Now and update the CSS."
       When Agent made an incorrect assumption (e.g. `SideNav` component), explicitly pointing it to the correct file (`@Sidebar`) helps.
    3. Final fix to ensure the dark mode toggle in the sidebar correctly toggled the map theme to Carto Dark.
       **Feedback**: "Now the dark mode toggle in @Sidebar does not toggle the map to carto dark."

    This process highlights the "conversation" aspect of vibe coding. Be descriptive and guide the AI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Publishing your application

Replit makes publishing straightforward.

1. Select the **[Publish](/cloud-services/deployments/about-deployments)** button.
2. Agent suggests a publishing configuration (e.g., app name, build and run commands). Review and confirm.
3. If your app uses API keys or other sensitive information, store them in **[Secrets](replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets)**. Agent will use these securely.
4. Select **Publish**. Replit bundles your app and makes it live on the web.

   <Frame>
     <img alt="Replit deployment screen" />
   </Frame>

Your published app will have a public URL (e.g., `park-mapper.replit.app`). Changes made in your development environment won't affect the published version until you click **Republish**.

## Recap and next steps

This tutorial went from an idea to a published interactive map application without writing a single line of code manually. Replit Agent was used for the heavy lifting, with Fast mode for refinements, leveraging domain knowledge and an iterative debugging process.

**Potential Next Steps for the Park Mapper App**:

* Add a [database](category/storage-and-databases) to store park data persistently (avoiding re-fetch on every load).
* Allow users to save or favorite parks.
* Implement advanced filtering.
* Improve styling and add custom icons for map markers.
* Enhance mobile responsiveness (e.g., ensuring filters are accessible on mobile).

Vibe coding is about iterating, experimenting, and guiding AI to bring your ideas to life. Don't be afraid of errors; they are part of the process!
