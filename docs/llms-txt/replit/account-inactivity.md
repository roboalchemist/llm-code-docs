# Account Inactivity

> Learn about Replit's account inactivity policy, when accounts may be terminated, and how paid subscriptions affect account status.

A free Replit account provides access to most Replit features and products. An account is kept active by user actions, including logging in and interacting with the Replit Workspace. An inactive Replit account is one that has not been used within a **1-year** period, meaning the user has not logged in to the account during that period. Replit reserves the right to terminate inactive Replit accounts and delete associated user data. Replit will delete Replit Apps associated with inactive free accounts.

Replit accounts under a paid subscription plan are not subject to termination due to account inactivity.
