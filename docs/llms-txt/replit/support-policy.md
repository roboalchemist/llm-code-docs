# Support Policy

> Replit offers different support options for all Replit users.

## Community support

All Replit users can also access the [Community Forum](https://replit.discourse.group/) for community support and resources.

## Replit Core and Teams support

Replit Core and Teams members can submit private support requests to Replit's support team. This support covers a wide range of topics including billing, account management, product questions, and technical assistance.

### Scope

While Replit Agent is a powerful tool designed to help you build quickly, it may occasionally produce code that doesn't fully match your intent or contains errors. Reviewing, modifying, and refining application code—either through manual changes or additional Agent prompts—is ultimately the user's responsibility.

Replit Support is here to ensure the platform itself is functioning correctly and to assist with billing, account, and platform-related issues. However, we're unable to provide hands-on debugging or fixes for individual application-level code.

However, [Replit Learn](https://blog.replit.com/replit-learn) is a great resource for learning how to use Replit and build your first app!

### Contact Us

Replit Core and Teams support is available via the in-app [`? Get Help` button](https://replit.com/t/replit?supportform=true).
