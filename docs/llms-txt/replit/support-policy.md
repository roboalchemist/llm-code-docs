# Support Policy

> Replit offers different support options for all Replit users, members and free.

## Community support

All Replit users can also access the [Community Hub](https://replit.com/community) for community resources.

Free users can also email [support@replit.com](mailto:support@replit.com) for get help with their account.

## Replit Core member support

Replit Core members can submit private support requests to Replit's support team. This support covers a wide range of topics including billing, account management, product questions, and technical assistance. Member support is open from 9am to 8pm Eastern Time (UTC-5), Monday through Friday and available only in English.

### Channels

Member support is available via the in-app `? Get Help` button as well as emailing [support@replit.com](mailto:support@replit.com). Using the in-app button is the best way to get in touch.

### Scope

Member support covers a number of areas:

* Billing, Cycles, Bounties, and account help
* Product issues, configuration help, and general usage questions
* Analysis of Nix-os issues
* Help with Extensions, Power Ups, Replit AI, and other features
* [Templates](https://replit.com/templates) created by @replit

Member support does not cover:

* General application debugging
* General modifications or refactoring of applications to run or publish on Replit
* Writing code or teaching how to code: Replit provides a number of resources for learning how to code, but support cannot provide direct assistance
* Community created Templates

However, [Community Hub](https://replit.com/community) is a great resource for learning how to code or getting code-level help.
