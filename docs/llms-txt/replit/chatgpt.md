# Replit in ChatGPT

> Build real apps by talking to ChatGPT. Create, update, and inspect Replit Apps from a single conversation.

The Replit integration in ChatGPT lets you create, update, and inspect Replit Apps directly from your conversations—no setup required. Build real apps by talking to ChatGPT and let Agent handle the rest.

## What is Replit in ChatGPT

Replit in ChatGPT connects your ChatGPT conversations to Replit's powerful development platform. You can describe what you want to build, and Agent will create a fully functional Replit App for you. Once created, you can ask ChatGPT to modify, update, or analyze your app—all through natural conversation.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to connect Replit to ChatGPT and create your first app.

### Connect Replit to ChatGPT

You can connect Replit to ChatGPT in two ways:

<Accordion title="Connect from Settings">
  1. Click your profile icon in ChatGPT
  2. Go to **Settings** → **Apps & Connectors**
  3. Find **Replit** and click **Connect**
  4. Complete the OAuth authorization with your Replit account
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connect from a conversation">
  1. Start a new conversation in ChatGPT
  2. Invoke Replit using one of the methods below
  3. ChatGPT will guide you through the OAuth flow if you're not connected
</Accordion>

### Invoke Replit in ChatGPT

Once connected, you can invoke Replit in three ways:

| Method         | How to use                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct mention | Type `Replit, <request>` at the start of your message |
| Slash command  | Type `/Replit` in the composer                        |
| Composer menu  | Click the **+** button → **More** → **Replit**        |

### Create your first app

After connecting, create your first Replit App:

1. Start a new conversation in ChatGPT
2. Invoke Replit and describe what you want to build (e.g., "Replit, create a todo app with dark mode")
3. Agent will generate your app and deploy it automatically
4. Once complete, you'll receive a link to view your app

<Note>
  Each conversation can work with one Replit App. If you create a new app in the same conversation, it will modify the existing app. To create multiple apps, start separate conversations.
</Note>

## Features

* **[Replit AI](/category/replit-ai)**: Agent generates and deploys apps based on your natural language requests
* **[Replit Workspace](/category/replit-workspace)**: Full-featured development environment accessible from ChatGPT
* **[Publishing](/category/replit-deployments)**: Apps are automatically deployed and ready to share

<Accordion title="What you can do">
  **Create:** Build new Replit Apps by describing what you want. Agent generates the application and deploys it automatically.

  **Update:** Modify the app in your current conversation. Ask ChatGPT to add features, fix bugs, or make changes, and Agent will apply them.

  **Inspect:** Analyze your app without making changes. Get information about code structure, file paths, or behavior.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Supported file formats">
  You can include various file types in your prompts:

  | Format                  | Supported                    |

  <Note>
    To include images or videos in your app, provide public URLs in your prompt. You can also add media files directly in Replit after the app is created.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build times">
  Agent typically builds apps in:

  | App complexity                                     | Typical build time |
  | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | Simple (calculators, small landing pages)          | 2–3 minutes        |
  | Complex (games, rich animations, dense dashboards) | 3–4 minutes        |
</Accordion>

## Billing and credits

Work done by Replit in ChatGPT is billed as Replit Agent usage in your Replit account.

<Accordion title="How billing works">
  * **Core** and **Teams** plans include monthly credits that cover Agent, publishing, and databases up to your allowance
  * You can buy **credit packs** ($100, $300, $500, $1,000 with discounts on larger packs) that expire after six months and do not auto‑renew—ideal for launch spikes or experiments
  * Use **usage alerts** and **budget limits** in Replit's billing settings to cap spend

  Learn more in the [AI billing documentation](/billing/ai-billing).
</Accordion>

## Current limitations

Currently, the Replit app in ChatGPT:

* Can only work on the app created in that specific conversation
* Cannot open or modify:
  * Apps created in other ChatGPT threads
  * Apps you built directly in Replit

Feature parity with the full Replit experience (databases, secrets management, more advanced workspace controls) is coming later.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Replit not appearing in Browse apps">
  If you don't see Replit in **Browse apps**, check:

  * Whether apps are available in your region
  * Whether your workspace admin has enabled the Replit app (Business/Enterprise/Edu)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build failures">
  If builds fail, open the app in Replit:

  * Check usage and billing
  * Use checkpoints and rollbacks to revert
  * Ask Agent for help directly in the Workspace
</Accordion>
