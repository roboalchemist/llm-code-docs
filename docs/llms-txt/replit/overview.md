## Replit Teams Billing

Replit Teams plans have two parts of their billing: Seats and Usage-Based costs. Both are charged at the same time on the same invoice. To see your historic and upcoming bills, visit the usage page.

An invoice will have:

* The upfront seat cost for the current billing period
* The usage-based costs for the previous billing period

## Seat pricing

Seats are a fixed fee per user per billing period. Each seat comes with a monthly spend credit, which is currently {TeamsCredits} per user per month.

## Usage-Based pricing

Visit our [Usage-Based](/billing/about-usage-based-billing) docs for more information.

## Credit packs

If your team needs additional credits beyond your monthly subscription allowance, you can purchase credit packs on your [billing page](https://replit.com/account#billing).

<CreditPackTable />

Credit packs expire six months after the purchase date and do not renew or roll over. Credits are automatically used from the credit pack that expires earliest first, helping you maximize the value of your purchases. They're perfect for covering temporary spikes in team usage or preparing for larger projects.
