# Replit Core Sponsorships

> Learn how to gift Replit Core subscriptions to developers outside your organization through sponsorships for hackathons, bootcamps, and other events.

# Replit Core sponsorships

## Overview

Sponsorships allow you to gift Replit Core to users outside of your Organization. Sponsorships can be a great fit for situations like Developer Relations teams and coding bootcamps. Example use cases:

* hosting a hackaton or contest and giving away Replit Core as a prize for participants
* running a bootcamp where each student should get their own Replit Core account

Sponsored users will not have any direct access to your Organization, and you won't have any direct access to the sponsored user's content. A sponsorship is simply a way to gift Replit Core to users and give them [the benefits of Replit Core](https://replit.com/pricing) (e.g. more powerful workspaces, private Replit Apps and monthly credits).

The sponsorship invite link will expire after 7 days. If the recipient claims the sponsorship, they will receive Replit Core automatically. When the sponsorship ends (e.g. in our example, after 2 months), the recipient can decide whether or not they want to pay for Replit Core or not.
