<Tip>
  Proper syntax highlighting makes code easier to scan and understand at a glance. Choose colors that work well together and provide sufficient contrast against your background.

## Theme design best practices

Create visually appealing and functional themes by following these guidelines:

### Color and contrast

* **Balance contrast**: Ensure sufficient difference between background and foreground elements
* **Create cohesive palettes**: Choose colors that complement each other rather than clash
* **Maintain consistent brightness**: Keep a similar brightness level across syntax elements
* **Design for accessibility**: Consider users with visual impairments by avoiding low-contrast combinations

<Warning>
  Common theme design issues to avoid:

  * Excessive brightness differences between syntax elements
  * Poorly matched colors that create visual discord
  * Insufficient contrast between code and background
</Warning>
