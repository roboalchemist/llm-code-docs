# LLM-based Development

> Enhance your AI coding experience with LLM readable documentation.

### Overview

Welcome to the guide on utilizing our specialized `llms.txt` files to enhance your LLM-based coding workflow. Whether you’re using Replit, Cursor, Devin, or any other AI coding tool, this page will assist you in leveraging our resources to debug and refine code generated by Fireflies.

Our platform seamlessly integrates with a variety of AI coding tools. While the generated code may not always be perfect, this guide outlines how to effectively use our `llms.txt` files to improve the debugging process, ensuring your development workflow remains smooth and efficient.

### How to Use `llms.txt` Files

#### For Tools with Limited Agentic Capabilities

If your coding tool does not support web querying or autonomous resource fetching:

* **Download the File**\
  Access the complete file by visiting [this link](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt) and download it to your local machine.

* **Upload and Debug**\
  Upload the downloaded file to your AI coding tool. Instruct your tool to analyze and debug the code using the content of this file. This manual intervention guides the tool in identifying and fixing errors in generated code.

#### For Advanced, Agentic Coding Tools

If your coding tool is sophisticated and capable of querying the web independently:

* **Provide the URL Directly**\
  Instead of downloading the full file, supply your tool with the URL [https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt).

* **Let It Decide**\
  Your advanced tool will automatically determine which parts of the file to use and where to look, streamlining the debugging process without additional manual steps.

### Additional Tips

* **Tool Configuration:** Ensure that your AI coding tool is configured to handle file uploads or URL-based inputs effectively.
* **Experiment and Adapt:** Different tools may interact with our resources in unique ways. Experiment with both methods to find the approach that best suits your workflow.
* **Support and Documentation:** If you encounter any challenges or need further assistance, please contact our support team.

Happy coding!
