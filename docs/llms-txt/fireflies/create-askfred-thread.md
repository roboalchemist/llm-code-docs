# Create AskFred Thread

> Create a new AskFred conversation thread with a question about your meetings

## Overview

The `createAskFredThread` mutation allows you to start a new AskFred conversation by asking questions about your meeting transcripts. You can ask about a specific meeting or search across multiple meetings using filters. AskFred uses AI to analyze your meeting data and provide intelligent, context-aware answers.
