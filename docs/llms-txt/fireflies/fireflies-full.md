# Quickstart
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/askfred/quickstart

Get started with AskFred in minutes - learn how to create threads and ask questions about your meetings

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **API Key**: Obtain your API key from [app.fireflies.ai/integrations](https://app.fireflies.ai/integrations/custom/fireflies)
2. **Transcript ID** (optional): The ID of a meeting transcript you want to query

<Note>
  If you don't have a transcript ID, you can query across all your meetings using filters. See [Step 3](#step-3-query-across-meetings) below.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create Your First Thread

Start by asking a question about a specific meeting:

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL theme={null}
  mutation CreateThread {
    createAskFredThread(input: {
      query: "What were the main discussion points?",
      transcript_id: "your_transcript_id",
      response_language: "en",
      format_mode: "markdown"
    }) {
      message {
        id
        thread_id
        answer
        suggested_queries
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "mutation CreateThread($input: CreateAskFredThreadInput!) { createAskFredThread(input: $input) { message { id thread_id answer suggested_queries } } }",
      "variables": {
        "input": {
          "query": "What were the main discussion points?",
          "transcript_id": "your_transcript_id",
          "response_language": "en",
          "format_mode": "markdown"
        }
      }
    }' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql';
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_api_key'
  };

  const mutation = `
    mutation CreateThread($input: CreateAskFredThreadInput!) {
      createAskFredThread(input: $input) {
        message {
          id
          thread_id
          answer
          suggested_queries
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  const variables = {
    input: {
      query: 'What were the main discussion points?',
      transcript_id: 'your_transcript_id',
      response_language: 'en',
      format_mode: 'markdown'
    }
  };

  axios
    .post(url, { query: mutation, variables }, { headers })
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data.data.createAskFredThread);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error(error);
    });
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql'
  headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'
  }

  mutation = """
  mutation CreateThread($input: CreateAskFredThreadInput!) {
    createAskFredThread(input: $input) {
      message {
        id
        thread_id
        answer
        suggested_queries
      }
    }
  }
  """

  variables = {
      'input': {
          'query': 'What were the main discussion points?',
          'transcript_id': 'your_transcript_id',
          'response_language': 'en',
          'format_mode': 'markdown'
      }
  }

  response = requests.post(
      url,
      json={'query': mutation, 'variables': variables},
      headers=headers
  )

  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Response

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "createAskFredThread": {
      "message": {
        "id": "msg_abc123",
        "thread_id": "thread_xyz789",
        "answer": "The main discussion points were:\n\n1. **Q4 Product Roadmap**: The team reviewed upcoming features...\n2. **Budget Allocation**: Discussion on resource allocation...\n3. **Timeline Concerns**: Several concerns about launch dates...",
        "suggested_queries": [
          "Can you elaborate on the timeline concerns?",
          "What features are prioritized for Q4?",
          "Who raised concerns about the budget?"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Ask Follow-up Questions

Continue the conversation with context-aware follow-ups using the `thread_id` from the previous response:

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL theme={null}
  mutation ContinueThread {
    continueAskFredThread(input: {
      thread_id: "thread_xyz789",
      query: "Can you elaborate on the timeline concerns?"
    }) {
      message {
        answer
        suggested_queries
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "mutation ContinueThread($input: ContinueAskFredThreadInput!) { continueAskFredThread(input: $input) { message { answer suggested_queries } } }",
      "variables": {
        "input": {
          "thread_id": "thread_xyz789",
          "query": "Can you elaborate on the timeline concerns?"
        }
      }
    }' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript theme={null}
  const variables = {
    input: {
      thread_id: 'thread_xyz789',
      query: 'Can you elaborate on the timeline concerns?'
    }
  };

  const mutation = `
    mutation ContinueThread($input: ContinueAskFredThreadInput!) {
      continueAskFredThread(input: $input) {
        message {
          answer
          suggested_queries
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  axios.post(url, { query: mutation, variables }, { headers })
    .then(response => console.log(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  variables = {
      'input': {
          'thread_id': 'thread_xyz789',
          'query': 'Can you elaborate on the timeline concerns?'
      }
  }

  mutation = """
  mutation ContinueThread($input: ContinueAskFredThreadInput!) {
    continueAskFredThread(input: $input) {
      message {
        answer
        suggested_queries
      }
    }
  }
  """

  response = requests.post(
      url,
      json={'query': mutation, 'variables': variables},
      headers=headers
  )

  print(response.json())
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Query Across Meetings

Analyze patterns across multiple meetings using filters:

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL theme={null}
  mutation CrossMeetingAnalysis {
    createAskFredThread(input: {
      query: "What customer concerns were raised this month?",
      filters: {
        start_time: "2024-03-01T00:00:00Z",
        end_time: "2024-03-31T23:59:59Z",
        participants: ["customer@example.com"]
      }
    }) {
      message {
        answer
        suggested_queries
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "mutation CrossMeetingAnalysis($input: CreateAskFredThreadInput!) { createAskFredThread(input: $input) { message { answer suggested_queries } } }",
      "variables": {
        "input": {
          "query": "What customer concerns were raised this month?",
          "filters": {
            "start_time": "2024-03-01T00:00:00Z",
            "end_time": "2024-03-31T23:59:59Z",
            "participants": ["customer@example.com"]
          }
        }
      }
    }' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  For more details on available filters and parameters, see the [createAskFredThread](/graphql-api/mutation/create-askfred-thread) documentation.
</Note>

## Step 4: List Your Threads

Retrieve all your conversation threads:

<CodeGroup>
  ```graphql GraphQL theme={null}
  query GetThreads {
    askfred_threads {
      id
      title
      transcript_id
      created_at
    }
  }
  ```

  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "query { askfred_threads { id title transcript_id created_at } }"
    }' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

# Authorization
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/authorization

Authenticating your requests with the Fireflies API

## Overview

The Fireflies API implements token-based authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access certain data and functionalities.

### Token-Based Authentication

We use a standard bearer token authentication mechanism. This means that to make authorized requests to the API, you must include an `Authorization` header with a valid token.

### Acquiring a Token

Follow these steps to obtain your API key for the Fireflies API:

1. Log in to your account at [fireflies.ai](https://app.fireflies.ai)
2. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.fireflies.ai/integrations) section
3. Click on [Fireflies API](https://app.fireflies.ai/integrations/custom/fireflies)
4. Copy and store your API key securely

### Making an Authenticated Request

To make an authenticated request, add the `Authorization` header followed by the word `Bearer` and your API key.

### Example of an Authenticated Request Header

```plaintext theme={null}
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

### Example request with Authorization header

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl theme={null}
   curl \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     --data '{ "query": "{ user { name integrations } }" }' \
     https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript javascript theme={null}
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql';
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_api_key'
  };
  const data = {
    query: '{ user { name integrations } }'
  };

  axios
    .post(url, data, { headers: headers })
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
  ```

  ```python python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql'
  headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'
  }
  data = {
      'query': '{ user { name integrations } }'
  }

  response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
  print(response.json())
  ```

  ```java java theme={null}
  import java.net.URI;
  import java.net.http.HttpClient;
  import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
  import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
  import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

  public class ApiRequest {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
          String url = "https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql";
          String json = "{\"query\":\"{ user { name integrations } }\"}";
          HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                  .uri(URI.create(url))
                  .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
                  .header("Authorization", "Bearer your_api_key")
                  .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(json, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
                  .build();

          client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
                  .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
                  .thenAccept(System.out::println)
                  .join();
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ensure to replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.

## Best Practices for Token Security

* **Keep it Secret:** Treat your API key like a password. Never expose it in client-side code or share it publicly.
* **Store Securely:** Store the API key securely in your application, ideally in environment variables or secure storage solutions.

<Warning>
  Improper handling of API keys can lead to security vulnerabilities. Always ensure API keys are
  used and stored securely.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

* **Invalid key:** If you receive an error regarding an invalid API key, verify that the API key hasn't expired and that it's correctly included in the request header.
* **Missing key:** Ensure that the `Authorization` header is present in your requests requiring authentication.

<Info>
  If you encounter issues with authentication or have questions about API key management, please
  contact our support team.
</Info>

# General concepts
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/concepts

Foundational guide to the core aspects of the Fireflies API

## Overview

This section serves as a primer on the essential features of the Fireflies API. It covers the requirements to make authenticated requests to the Fireflies API, key GraphQL concepts and a breakdown of core components like queries, mutations, schema and data types.

### Host

The Fireflies API is hosted at [https://api.fireflies.ai](https://api.fireflies.ai)

### Authorization

The Fireflies API requires a valid API key for all requests. Please see [Authorization](/fundamentals/authorization) for more information

## GraphQL API Concepts

Welcome to our GraphQL API! GraphQL is a powerful query language designed for APIs, offering clients the ability to request exactly what they need and nothing more.

### Queries

Queries are used to fetch data in GraphQL. They are akin to the `GET` request in REST.
A basic query might look like this:

<Info>Queries are read-only and won’t modify your data.</Info>

```graphql graphql theme={null}
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Mutations allow you to modify data – create, update, or delete.

<Warning>Mutations should be used with caution as they change server-side data.</Warning>

```graphql graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  setUserRole(user_id: "1", role: "user") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Schema and Types

### Schema Definition

The schema defines the API's capabilities, including types, queries, mutations, and more.

<Tip>
  <h3>Understanding GraphQL Schema</h3>
  <p>The schema is a contract between client and server, defining how clients can access data.</p>
</Tip>

#### Data Types

**Standard Types:** Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID.

**Custom Types:** Defining complex data structures. Custom types are user-defined and can include combinations of standard types.

#### Best Practices

1. Optimize query performance by requesting for only necessary data.
2. Use variables in queries to enhance readability and flexibility

## Overview

Understanding how errors are structured and returned by the Fireflies API is key to effectively handling and troubleshooting issues. This page outlines the common error format and details specific error types.

## Error schema

Our GraphQL API follows a standard format for returning errors. Errors are encapsulated within an `errors` array in the response body.

Please visit [Error codes](/miscellaneous/error-codes) to view explanations for error code types

<ResponseField name="message" type="String">
  Description of the error
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="code" type="String">
  Error code.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="friendly" type="Boolean">
  `friendly === true` are safe to show to the frontend client. Unfriendly errors may have technical
  details that may not be useful to the UI layer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="extensions" type="Object">
  Contains useful metadata related to the error.

  Where relevant, includes field `helpUrls` pointing to relevant API documentation sections that explain the error and provide guidance on how to resolve it
</ResponseField>

```json Example theme={null}
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error description",
	    "friendly": true,
      "code": "error_code",
      "extensions": {
        "helpUrls": [
         "https://docs.fireflies.ai/miscellaneous/error-codes#error_code"
        ],
        "code": "error_code",
        "status": http_status_code,
		    ... otherFields
      }
    }

# Introduction
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/introduction

Welcome to Fireflies public API documentation.

<Note>
  We are actively working to expose more functionality via our API. If you have specific requests,
  please [reach out to us](https://guide.fireflies.ai/).
</Note>

# Introduction

## Overview of the API

The Fireflies API is built on top of GraphQL, a powerful interface designed to provide you with efficient and flexible access to your data. This API allows you to retrieve exactly the data you need in a structured format. Whether you are building a web application, a mobile app, or a complex software system, our API caters to a wide range of data requirements.

Our API covers various functionalities, including queries for fetching data as well as uploading meeting audio. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that you can start fetching and manipulating data with minimal setup.

## Advantages of Using GraphQL

**1. Precise Data Fetching:** One of the key strengths of GraphQL is its ability to return exactly what you request and nothing more. This precision eliminates the over-fetching of data, common in traditional REST APIs, leading to more efficient network utilization and faster response times.

**2. Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST APIs, which often require multiple endpoints for different data needs, GraphQL operates through a single endpoint. This simplification streamlines interactions with the API and makes maintaining and managing the API more straightforward.

**3. Flexibility and Scalability:** GraphQL APIs are incredibly flexible, allowing for queries that can evolve with your needs. This flexibility, combined with efficient data retrieval, makes GraphQL an ideal choice for both small projects and large-scale applications.

In the following sections, we will guide you through the essential components of our API, provide detailed examples, and offer best practices to help you make the most of our API. Whether you're a new user or an experienced developer, this documentation is designed to assist you in seamlessly integrating the API into your applications.

# LLM-based Development
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/llm-development

Enhance your AI coding experience with LLM readable documentation.

### Overview

Welcome to the guide on utilizing our specialized `llms.txt` files to enhance your LLM-based coding workflow. Whether you’re using Replit, Cursor, Devin, or any other AI coding tool, this page will assist you in leveraging our resources to debug and refine code generated by Fireflies.

Our platform seamlessly integrates with a variety of AI coding tools. While the generated code may not always be perfect, this guide outlines how to effectively use our `llms.txt` files to improve the debugging process, ensuring your development workflow remains smooth and efficient.

### How to Use `llms.txt` Files

#### For Tools with Limited Agentic Capabilities

If your coding tool does not support web querying or autonomous resource fetching:

* **Download the File**\
  Access the complete file by visiting [this link](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt) and download it to your local machine.

* **Upload and Debug**\
  Upload the downloaded file to your AI coding tool. Instruct your tool to analyze and debug the code using the content of this file. This manual intervention guides the tool in identifying and fixing errors in generated code.

#### For Advanced, Agentic Coding Tools

If your coding tool is sophisticated and capable of querying the web independently:

* **Provide the URL Directly**\
  Instead of downloading the full file, supply your tool with the URL [https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt).

* **Let It Decide**\
  Your advanced tool will automatically determine which parts of the file to use and where to look, streamlining the debugging process without additional manual steps.

### Additional Tips

* **Tool Configuration:** Ensure that your AI coding tool is configured to handle file uploads or URL-based inputs effectively.
* **Experiment and Adapt:** Different tools may interact with our resources in unique ways. Experiment with both methods to find the approach that best suits your workflow.

</Update>

<Update label="2.15.0" description="Set Meeting Channels">
  ### Set Meeting Channels

  The new [Update Meeting Channel](/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-channel) mutation allows meeting owners and team administrators to set the channel for one or more meetings. You can update 1–5 transcripts to a single channel in one API call with all-or-nothing semantics.

  This mutation requires either meeting ownership or team admin privileges for all specified transcripts. If any transcript fails validation, none of the transcripts will be updated, ensuring data consistency across your channel organization.
</Update>

<Update label="2.14.0" description="Active Meetings Fetching">
  ### Active Meetings Fetching

  The new [Active Meetings](/graphql-api/query/active-meetings) query allows you to fetch meetings currently in progress. This query returns real-time information about active meetings including meeting details, start time, organizer, and meeting link.
</Update>

<Update label="2.13.0" description="Rate Limiting for Delete Transcript">
  ### Rate Limiting for Delete Transcript

  The [Delete Transcript](/graphql-api/mutation/delete-transcript) mutation now includes rate limiting protection to prevent abuse. The mutation is limited to 10 requests per minute across all user tiers.

  If you exceed this limit, the API will return a `too_many_requests` error (HTTP 429) with a `retryAfter` timestamp indicating when you can make requests again.
</Update>

<Update label="2.12.0" description="Meeting Privacy Control">
  ### Meeting Privacy Control

  The new [Update Meeting Privacy](/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-privacy) mutation allows meeting owners and team administrators to programmatically update meeting privacy settings. You can now change privacy levels between `link`, `owner`, `participants`, `teammatesandparticipants`, and `teammates` to control who can access meeting transcripts.

  This mutation follows the same authorization pattern as other meeting management operations, requiring either meeting ownership or team admin privileges.
</Update>

<Update label="2.10.0" description="Meeting Attendance Tracking">
  ### Meeting Attendance Tracking

  The [Transcript](/schema/transcript) schema now includes a new `meeting_attendance` field that provides detailed participant attendance information. This field returns an array of [MeetingAttendance](/schema/meeting-attendance) records showing when participants joined and left the meeting.

  Each attendance record includes the participant's name, join time (ISO 8601 format), and leave time (if they left during the meeting). This feature enables better meeting analytics and participation tracking by leveraging meeting events data.

  The attendance data is available in both [Transcript](/graphql-api/query/transcript) and [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) queries.
</Update>

<Update label="2.9.0" description="Channel Filtering">
  ### Channel Filtering

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query now supports filtering by channel using the new `channel_id` parameter. This allows you to retrieve transcripts from specific channels by providing a single channel ID.

  The `channel_id` parameter accepts a string value and enables more targeted querying of meeting transcripts within your organization's channels.
</Update>

<Update label="2.8.0" description="Array Fields for Organizers and Participants">
  ### Array Fields for Organizers and Participants

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query now supports array fields `organizers` and `participants` that allow filtering by multiple email addresses. These new array fields provide more flexible querying capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

  The previous single email fields `organizer_email` and `participant_email` are now deprecated but continue to work. Using both old and new fields simultaneously will result in a validation error.
</Update>

<Update label="2.7.0" description="User Groups">
  ### User Groups

  The Fireflies API now includes comprehensive support for user groups. The new [User Groups](/graphql-api/query/user-groups) query allows you to fetch all user groups within your team or filter to only show groups you belong to using the `mine` parameter.

  Additionally, the [User](/schema/user) and [Users](/graphql-api/query/users) queries now include enhanced `user_groups` fields with detailed member information, providing better visibility into team organization and collaboration.
</Update>

<Update label="2.6.2" description="Keyword search">
  ### Keyword Search

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query has been enhanced to include keyword search functionality. By utilizing the `keyword` and `scope` parameters, you can now perform advanced searches within both the title and the transcript text, offering more precise retrieval.

  The `title` parameter has been deprecated in favor of `keyword`

# Delete Transcript
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/mutation/delete-transcript

Use the API to manage transcript deletion

## Overview

The `deleteTranscript` mutation is designed to delete a specific transcript by its ID.

<Note>
  **Rate Limit:** This mutation is rate-limited to 10 requests per minute across all user tiers. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `too_many_requests` error with a `retryAfter` timestamp indicating when you can make requests again.
</Note>

## Arguments

<ParamField type="String">
  Transcript ID
</ParamField>

## Usage Example

To delete a transcript, provide the unique id of the transcript as an argument to the mutation. The returned subfields will be from the deleted transcript. Here’s an example of how this mutation could be used:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation deleteTranscript($id: String!) {
  deleteTranscript(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    host_email
    organizer_email
    fireflies_users
    participants
    date
    transcript_url
    audio_url
    duration
  }
}
```

<RequestExample>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{"query": "mutation($transcriptId: String!) { deleteTranscript(id: $transcriptId) { title date duration organizer_email } }", "variables": {"transcriptId": "your_transcript_id"}}' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript javascript theme={null}

# Update Meeting Channel
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-channel

Use the API to update meeting channel assignments

## Overview

The `updateMeetingChannel` mutation allows for batch updating the channel assignment of multiple meeting transcripts. This operation requires admin privileges within the team or ownership of the meetings. You can update 1–5 transcripts at once with all-or-nothing semantics—if any transcript fails validation, none are updated.

## Arguments

<ParamField type="UpdateMeetingChannelInput">
  The channel assignment to be applied to the specified transcripts. See [UpdateMeetingChannelInput](/schema/input/update-meeting-channel-input).
</ParamField>

## Usage Example

To update meeting channels, provide an array of transcript IDs (1–5 items) and a single channel ID as arguments to the mutation. Here's an example of how this mutation could be used:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation UpdateMeetingChannel($input: UpdateMeetingChannelInput!) {
  updateMeetingChannel(input: $input) {
    id
    title
    channels {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

<RequestExample>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql \
  	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	-H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  	-d '{
  		"query": "mutation($input: UpdateMeetingChannelInput!) { updateMeetingChannel(input: $input) { id title channels { id } } }",
  		"variables": {
  			"input": {
  				"transcript_ids": ["transcript_id_1", "transcript_id_2"],
  				"channel_id": "channel_id"
  			}
  		}
  	}'

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Who has permission to update meeting channels?">
  <p>Only users with admin privileges or meeting owners can update meeting channels. All specified meetings must be owned by users in your team.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many transcripts can I update at once?">
  <p>You can update between 1 and 5 transcripts in a single mutation call. If you need to update more transcripts, make multiple mutation calls.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the operation fails for one transcript?">
  <p>The mutation uses all-or-nothing semantics. If any transcript fails validation (not found, no access, or permission denied), none of the transcripts will be updated. All transcripts must pass validation for the update to succeed.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can a meeting belong to multiple channels?">
  <p>No, a meeting can only belong to one channel at a time. This mutation sets the meeting's channel to the specified value, replacing any previous channel assignment.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the response order guaranteed to match the input order?">
  <p>No, the response order is not guaranteed to match the input order of transcript\_ids. If you need to correlate responses with inputs, use the id field in the response.</p>
</Accordion>

## Error Codes

List of possible error codes that may be returned by the `updateMeetingChannel` mutation. Full list of error codes can be found [here](/miscellaneous/error-codes).

## Authenticated Downloads

The `download_auth` field allows you to upload audio/video files that require authentication. This is useful when your media files are hosted on private servers or behind authentication.

### Bearer Token Authentication

Use bearer token authentication when your media URL requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://example.com/protected-audio.mp3"
    title: "Protected Meeting Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: bearer_token
      bearer: {
        token: "your-bearer-token-here"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

### Basic Authentication

Use basic authentication when your media URL requires username and password:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://example.com/protected-audio.mp3"
    title: "Protected Meeting Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: basic_auth
      basic: {
        username: "your-username"

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Can I upload a file directly from my machine?">
  <p>Audio upload only works with publicly accessible URLs or URLs with supported authentication (bearer token or basic auth). We cannot accept files hosted on your local machine.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I don't want to expose my audio files to the public internet. How can I upload them to Fireflies.ai safely?">
  <p>You have two options:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Signed URLs:</strong> Use signed URLs with short expiry times (e.g., AWS S3 presigned URLs, Google Cloud Storage signed URLs)</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticated Downloads:</strong> Use the <code>download\_auth</code> field to provide bearer token or basic authentication credentials. Fireflies will use these credentials when downloading your media file.</li>
  </ol>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What authentication methods are supported?">
  <p>Fireflies supports two authentication methods for downloading media files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bearer Token:</strong> Adds <code>Authorization: Bearer \<token></code> header when downloading</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Auth:</strong> Adds <code>Authorization: Basic \<base64(username:password)></code> header when downloading</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If your media file is publicly accessible, you don't need to provide <code>download\_auth</code>.</p>

# Active Meetings
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/query/active-meetings

Query active meetings in progress

## Overview

The active\_meetings query is designed to fetch a list of meetings that are currently active (in progress). This endpoint allows you to monitor ongoing meetings for users in your team.

## Arguments

<ParamField type="String">
  Filter active meetings by a specific user's email address.

  **Permission requirements:**

  * **Regular users**: Can only query their own active meetings (must pass their own email or omit this field)
  * **Admins**: Can query active meetings for any user in their team

  If this field is omitted, the query returns active meetings for the authenticated user.

  The email must be valid and belong to a user in the same team as the requester.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="[MeetingState]">
  Filter active meetings by their state. Accepts an array of [MeetingState](/schema/enum/meeting-state) values.

  **Possible values:**

  * `active`: Meetings that are currently in progress
  * `paused`: Meetings that have been paused

  If this field is omitted, the query returns meetings in both `active` and `paused` states by default.
</ParamField>

# AskFred Threads
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/query/askfred-threads

Get a summary of all AskFred conversation threads for the current user

## Overview

The `askfred_threads` query retrieves a summary of all AskFred conversation threads belonging to the authenticated user. This query provides a lightweight overview of threads without including the full message history, making it ideal for listing and browsing conversations.

## Arguments

<ParamField type="String">
  Filter threads to only those associated with a specific transcript ID
</ParamField>

## Schema

Fields available to the [AskFredThreadSummary](/schema/askfred-thread-summary) query:

* `id`: Unique identifier for the thread
* `title`: Thread title (typically derived from the first question)
* `transcript_id`: Associated transcript/meeting ID (if applicable)
* `user_id`: ID of the user who created the thread
* `created_at`: Timestamp when the thread was created

## Usage Example

```graphql theme={null}
query GetAskFredThreads {
  askfred_threads {
    id
    title
    transcript_id
    user_id
    created_at
  }
}
```

### With Filter

```graphql theme={null}
query GetFilteredThreads($transcriptId: String) {
  askfred_threads(transcript_id: $transcriptId) {
    id
    title
    transcript_id
    user_id
    created_at
  }

## Overview

The transcripts query is designed to fetch a list of transcripts against input arguments.

## Arguments

<ParamField type="String">
  <b>This field is deprecated. Please use `keyword` instead.</b>

  Title of the transcript

  This argument is mutually exclusive with `keyword` field

  The maximum allowable length for this field is `256` characters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="String">
  Allows searching for keywords in meeting title and/or words spoken during the meeting

  This argument is mutually exclusive with `title` field

  The maximum allowable length for this field is `255` characters.

# Webhooks
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/webhooks

Webhook events for the Fireflies.ai API

## Overview

Webhooks enable your application to set up event based notifications. In this section, you'll learn how to configure webhooks to receive updates from Fireflies.

## Events supported

The webhooks support the following events:

* Transcription complete: Triggers when a meeting has been processed and the transcript is ready for viewing

<Note>
  Fireflies sends webhook notifications as POST requests to your specified endpoint. Each request
  contains a JSON payload with information about the event that occurred.
</Note>

## Saving a webhook

Follow the instructions below to save a webhook URL that sends notifications for all subscribed events. This webhook will only be fired for meetings that you own.

<Steps>
  <Step>Visit the [Fireflies.ai dashboard settings](https://app.fireflies.ai/settings)</Step>
  <Step>Navigate to the Developer settings tab</Step>
  <Step>Enter a valid https URL in the webhooks field and save</Step>
</Steps>

You may test your webhook using the upload audio API or by uploading through the dashboard at [app.fireflies.ai/upload](https://app.fireflies.ai/upload)

## Upload audio webhook

You can also include a webhook URL as part of an upload audio request. This is different from the saved webhook as it will only send notifications for that singular audio upload request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "mutation($input: AudioUploadInput) { uploadAudio(input: $input) { success title message } }",
      "variables": {
        "input": {
          "url": "https://url_to_the_audio_file",
          "title": "title of the file",
          "webhook": "https://url_for_the_webhook"
        }
      }
    }' \
    https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript javascript theme={null}
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql';
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_api_key'
  };

  const input = {
    url: 'https://url_to_the_audio_file',
    title: 'title of the file',
    webhook: 'https://url_for_the_webhook'
  };
  const data = {
    query: `       mutation($input: AudioUploadInput) {
          uploadAudio(input: $input) {
            success
            title
            message
          }
        }
      `,
    variables: { input }
  };

  axios
    .post(url, data, { headers: headers })
    .then(result => {
      console.log(result.data);
    })
    .catch(e => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(e));
    });
  ```

  ```python python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql'

  headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'
  }

  input_data = {
  	"url": "https://url_for_audio_file",
  	"title": "title of the file",
  	"webhook": "https://url_for_the_webhook"
  }

  data = {
  	'query': '''
  		mutation($input: AudioUploadInput) {
  			uploadAudio(input: $input) {
  				success
  				title
  				message
  			}
  		}
  	''',
  	'variables': {'input': input_data}
  }

  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

  if response.status_code == 200:
      print(response.json())
  else:
      print(response.text)
  ```

  ```java java theme={null}
  import java.io.IOException;
  import java.net.URI;
  import java.net.http.HttpClient;
  import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
  import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
  import java.net.http.HttpRequest.BodyPublishers;
  import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers;

  public class ApiRequest {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
  HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

  	String json = "{"

  		+ "\"input\": {"
  			+ "\"url\":\"https://url_for_audio_file.com\","
  			+ "\"title\":\"title of the file\","
  			+ "\"webhook\":\"https://url_for_the_webhook\""
  		+ "}"
  		+ "}"
  	+ "}";


  	HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
  			.uri(URI.create("https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql"))
  			.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
  			.header("Authorization", "Bearer your_api_key")
  			.POST(BodyPublishers.ofString(json))
  			.build();

  	client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
  		.thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
  		.thenAccept(System.out::println)
  		.join();
      }

  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Webhook Authentication

Webhook authentication ensures that incoming webhook requests are securely verified before processing. This allows consumers to trust that webhook events originate from a secure and verified source.

### How It Works

Each webhook request sent from the server includes an `x-hub-signature` header containing a SHA-256 HMAC signature of the request payload. This signature is generated using a secret key known only to the server and your application.

When the consumer receives a webhook, they can use the signature provided in the `x-hub-signature` header to verify that the request has not been tampered with. This is done by computing their own HMAC signature using the shared secret key and comparing it to the signature included in the header.

### Saving a secret

1. Go to the settings page at [app.fireflies.ai/settings](https://app.fireflies.ai/settings)
2. Navigate to the **Developer Settings** tab
3. You can either:
   * Enter a custom secret key of 16-32 characters in the input field
   * Click on the refresh button to generate a random secret key
4. Click Save to ensure the secret gets updated
5. Make sure to store this secret key securely, as it will be used to authenticate incoming webhook requests

### Verifying the Signature

1. **Receive the Webhook**:

   * Each request will include the payload and an `x-hub-signature` header

2. **Verify the Signature**:
   * Compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature using the payload and the shared secret key
   * Compare the computed signature to the `x-hub-signature` header value
   * If they match, the request is verified as authentic. If they do not match, treat the request with caution or reject it

By verifying webhook signatures, consumers can ensure that webhook events received are secure and have not been altered during transmission

### See it in action

To see webhook authentication in action, you can view an example at [Fireflies.ai Verifying Webhook Requests](https://replit.com/@firefliesai/Firefliesai-Verifying-webhook-requests#index.js). This example demonstrates how to receive a webhook, compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature, and verify it against the `x-hub-signature` header to ensure the request's authenticity.

}
```

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why am I not receiving webhook requests">
  <p>There may be multiple reasons why you are not receiving webhook requests. Please go through the following checklist:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Webhooks are only fired for meeting owners, referred to in the API as the `organizer_email.` Ensure that you have correctly setup the webhooks for the meeting owner.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your webhook is setup as a POST request</li>
    <li>If you have setup secret verification, ensure that you are correctly verifying the request by checking the example implementation [here](https://replit.com/@firefliesai/Firefliesai-Verifying-webhook-requests?v=1).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Team-wide webhooks are only supported for the Enterprise tier with the Super Admin role. This allows you to setup one webhook for all meetings owned by your team. Details [here](/fundamentals/super-admin).</p>

### Search and Retrieve Pattern

1. Use `fireflies_search` or `fireflies_get_transcripts` to find relevant meetings
2. Extract meeting IDs from results
3. Use `fireflies_fetch` to get complete details, or:
   * Use `fireflies_get_transcript` for conversation only
   * Use `fireflies_get_summary` for insights only

### Team Analysis Pattern

1. Use `fireflies_get_usergroups` to get team structure
2. Extract member emails from target groups
3. Use `fireflies_get_transcripts` with `participants` filter
4. Optionally use `fireflies_get_user` for individual member details

### Contact-Based Search Pattern

1. Use `fireflies_get_user_contacts` to get contact list
2. Find target contact by name or email
3. Use `fireflies_get_transcripts` with contact email in `participants`
4. Retrieve detailed transcripts or summaries as needed

## Getting Started

You can refer to this page to understand the meaning and possible causes of different error codes that you may encounter while using the API. It provides a comprehensive reference for troubleshooting and resolving issues. Please visit [Errors](/fundamentals/errors) page for more details

## API Errors

### `invalid_arguments`

Returned when invalid arguments are passed to a query or mutation

```json theme={null}
{
  "errors": [
    {
      ... other fields for error
      "message": "Invalid argument(s) were provided",
      "code": "invalid_arguments",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "invalid_arguments",
        "status": 400,

For example, making a request to `uploadAudio` as a free user will throw a `paid_required` error with tier `pro_or_higher`, which means that you need to be subscribed to a Pro or Higher plan to perform this action

```json theme={null}
{
  "errors": [
    {
	  ... other fields for error
      "message": "You need to be subscribed to a paid plan to perform this action",
      "code": "paid_required",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "paid_required",
        "status": 403,

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `not_in_team`

Returned when you are attempting to query against a `userId` that is not a part of your team

	  .. other fields for error
      "message": "You do not have permission to perform this action",
      "code": "require_elevated_privilege",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "require_elevated_privilege",
        "status": 403,
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Getting Started
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/realtime-api/getting-started

Learn how to connect to Fireflies.ai's Realtime API for live transcription

## Overview

This guide shows you how to connect to the Fireflies.ai Realtime API and start receiving transcription events in real time.

## Endpoint

```text theme={null}
wss://api.fireflies.ai
```

## Requirements

You'll need the following:

* A valid API token
* A `transcriptId` (or meeting ID)

<Tip>
  Use the [Active Meetings](/graphql-api/query/active-meetings) query to discover meetings currently in progress and get their IDs for connecting to the Realtime API.
</Tip>

## Connecting via Socket.IO

Use the Socket.IO client to connect and listen for events.

```ts theme={null}
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('wss://api.fireflies.ai', {
  path: '/ws/realtime',
  auth: {
    token: 'Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>',
    transcriptId: '<TRANSCRIPT_ID>'
  }
});

socket.on('auth.success', data => {
  console.log('Authenticated:', data);
});

socket.on('auth.failed', err => {
  console.error('Authentication failed:', err);
});

socket.on('connection.error', err => {
  console.error('Connection error:', err);
});

socket.on('connection.established', () => {
  console.log('Connection established');
});

socket.on('transcription.broadcast', event => {
  console.log('Transcript event:', event);
});
```

## Auth Parameters

| Field          | Type   | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `token`        | string | Your API access token           |
| `transcriptId` | string | ID of the meeting or transcript |

If authentication fails, the server emits an `auth.failed` event and disconnects the socket.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/realtime-api/overview

Learn about Fireflies.ai's Realtime API for live transcription

The Fireflies.ai Realtime API allows your application to receive **live transcription events** over WebSockets. This enables building interactive features such as live captioning, transcription overlays, and real-time analysis as users speak.

<Warning>
  The Realtime API is currently in <b>beta</b>. Features and endpoints may change. We welcome your feedback as we continue to improve this API.
</Warning>

## How It Works

The Realtime API uses WebSocket connections to deliver transcription data as it's generated.

## Flow

1. **Authenticate**: Connect using a valid API token and transcript ID.
2. **Listen**: Once connected, you'll start receiving transcription events in real time.
3. **React**: Update your UI or process transcription events as they arrive.

## Features

* **Low Latency**: Data is streamed as soon as it’s transcribed.
* **Event-Based**: Receive structured events for easy handling.
* **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure connections with scoped access.
* **Incremental Transcription**: Receive transcript segments progressively.

# DownloadAuthType
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/enum/download-auth-type

Enum for DownloadAuthType - authentication methods for media downloads

The `DownloadAuthType` enum specifies the authentication method to use when downloading media files during audio upload.

## Values

<ParamField type="Enum Value">
  No authentication required. The media file is publicly accessible.

  This is the default when `download_auth` is not provided.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="Enum Value">
  Bearer token authentication. Requires the `bearer` field with a token.

  Fireflies will send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when downloading the file.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="Enum Value">
  HTTP Basic authentication. Requires the `basic` field with username and/or password.

  Fireflies will send `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>` when downloading the file.
</ParamField>

## Usage

The `DownloadAuthType` enum is used in the [DownloadAuthInput](/schema/input/download-auth-input) type to specify which authentication method should be used:

```graphql theme={null}
input DownloadAuthInput {
  type: DownloadAuthType!
  bearer: BearerTokenAuthInput
  basic: BasicAuthInput
}
```

## Examples

### No Authentication (Default)

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://public-storage.com/audio.mp3"
    title: "Public Recording"
    # download_auth omitted - defaults to 'none'
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

Or explicitly:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://public-storage.com/audio.mp3"
    title: "Public Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: none
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

### Bearer Token

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://protected-storage.com/audio.mp3"
    title: "Protected Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: bearer_token
      bearer: {
        token: "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

### Basic Authentication

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://private-server.com/audio.mp3"
    title: "Private Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: basic_auth
      basic: {
        username: "user"
        password: "pass"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

## Choosing the Right Authentication Method

| Method         | Use When                         | Example Use Cases                                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`         | File is publicly accessible      | Public S3 buckets, CDN-hosted files, public web servers                     |
| `bearer_token` | File requires OAuth or API token | Private cloud storage, API-protected resources, JWT-authenticated endpoints |
| `basic_auth`   | File requires username/password  | Web servers with `.htaccess`, internal file servers, legacy systems         |

# MeetingState
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/enum/meeting-state

Enum for MeetingState - possible states for active meetings

The `MeetingState` enum specifies the current state of an active meeting.

## Values

<ParamField type="Enum Value">
  The meeting is currently in progress with the Fireflies bot actively recording.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="Enum Value">
  The meeting has been paused. The Fireflies bot is still in the meeting but recording is temporarily stopped.
</ParamField>

## Usage

The `MeetingState` enum is used in two contexts:

1. **As a filter** in the [GetActiveMeetingsInput](/schema/input/active-meetings-input) to filter meetings by state
2. **As a response field** in the [ActiveMeeting](/schema/active-meeting) type to indicate the current state

### Filtering by State

```graphql theme={null}
query ActiveMeetings {
  active_meetings(input: { states: [active] }) {
    id
    title
    state
  }
}
```

### Getting All States (Default)

When no `states` filter is provided, both `active` and `paused` meetings are returned:

```graphql theme={null}
query ActiveMeetings {
  active_meetings {
    id
    title
    state
  }
}
```

Schema for BasicAuthInput - HTTP Basic authentication configuration

The `BasicAuthInput` type configures HTTP Basic authentication for downloading media files. When provided, Fireflies will include an `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>` header when downloading your media file.

## Fields

<ParamField type="String">
  The username for basic authentication. This field is optional - if not provided, only the password will be used.

  When provided, the value will be trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="String">
  The password for basic authentication. This field is required when using basic auth.

  The password must be a non-empty string and will be trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
</ParamField>

## Usage

HTTP Basic authentication is commonly used with:

* Web servers with `.htaccess` protection
* Internal company file servers
* Legacy systems requiring username/password authentication
* Simple authentication schemes for private media hosting

## Examples

### With Username and Password

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://files.company.com/recordings/meeting.mp3"
    title: "Sales Call"
    download_auth: {
      type: basic_auth
      basic: {
        username: "api-user"
        password: "secure-password-123"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

### Password Only

When the server only requires a password (username is optional):

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://protected.example.com/audio.mp3"
    title: "Meeting Recording"
    download_auth: {
      type: basic_auth
      basic: {
        password: "access-key-here"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

## How It Works

When you provide basic authentication credentials:

1. Fireflies combines the username and password as `username:password`
2. The combined string is base64-encoded
3. The encoded value is sent as `Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>`
4. The media file is downloaded using this authentication header

For example, if you provide:

* Username: `user`
* Password: `pass`

Fireflies will send: `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz`

## Security Considerations

* **HTTPS Required**: The media URL must use HTTPS to ensure credentials are transmitted securely
* **Credential Storage**: Credentials are used only for downloading the file and are not stored permanently
* **Access Control**: Use credentials with minimal required permissions (read-only access to the specific file)
* **Credential Rotation**: For production use, consider rotating credentials regularly

# BearerTokenAuthInput
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/input/bearer-token-auth-input

Schema for BearerTokenAuthInput - bearer token authentication configuration

The `BearerTokenAuthInput` type configures bearer token authentication for downloading media files. When provided, Fireflies will include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when downloading your media file.

## Fields

<ParamField type="String">
  The bearer token to use for authentication. This token will be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when downloading the media file.

  The token must be a non-empty string and will be trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
</ParamField>

## Usage

Bearer token authentication is commonly used with:

* Cloud storage services (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
* API-protected media servers
* OAuth 2.0 protected resources
* JWT-authenticated endpoints

## Example

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://storage.example.com/recordings/meeting.mp3"
    title: "Team Meeting"
    download_auth: {
      type: bearer_token
      bearer: {
        token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.dozjgNryP4J3jVmNHl0w5N_XgL0n3I9PlFUP0THsR8U"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

* **Token Expiry**: Ensure your bearer token has sufficient lifetime for Fireflies to download the file (typically a few minutes to hours)
* **Token Scope**: Use tokens with minimal required permissions (read-only access to the specific file)
* **Token Rotation**: For production use, consider using short-lived tokens and rotating them regularly
* **HTTPS Only**: The media URL must use HTTPS to ensure the token is transmitted securely

# DownloadAuthInput
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/schema/input/download-auth-input

Schema for DownloadAuthInput - authentication configuration for media downloads

The `DownloadAuthInput` type configures authentication for downloading media files during audio upload. This allows you to upload files that are hosted on private servers or require authentication.

## Fields

<ParamField type="DownloadAuthType">
  The authentication method to use when downloading the media file. Must be one of:

  * `none` - No authentication (publicly accessible URL)
  * `bearer_token` - Bearer token authentication
  * `basic_auth` - HTTP Basic authentication

  See [DownloadAuthType](/schema/enum/download-auth-type) for details.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="BearerTokenAuthInput">
  Bearer token configuration. Required when `type` is `bearer_token`, must not be provided for other types.

  See [BearerTokenAuthInput](/schema/input/bearer-token-auth-input) for the complete schema definition.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="BasicAuthInput">
  Basic authentication configuration. Required when `type` is `basic_auth`, must not be provided for other types.

  See [BasicAuthInput](/schema/input/basic-auth-input) for the complete schema definition.
</ParamField>

## Validation Rules

The `DownloadAuthInput` type enforces mutual exclusivity between authentication methods:

* When `type` is `bearer_token`, only the `bearer` field should be provided
* When `type` is `basic_auth`, only the `basic` field should be provided
* When `type` is `none`, neither `bearer` nor `basic` should be provided

Providing fields for multiple authentication types will result in a validation error.

## Examples

### Bearer Token Authentication

```graphql theme={null}
{
  type: bearer_token
  bearer: {
    token: "your-bearer-token-here"
  }
}
```

### Basic Authentication

```graphql theme={null}
{
  type: basic_auth
  basic: {
    username: "your-username"
    password: "your-password"
  }
}
```

### No Authentication (Default)

When the media file is publicly accessible, you can either omit the `download_auth` field entirely or explicitly set it to `none`:

```graphql theme={null}
{
  type: none
}
```

## Use Cases

### Private Cloud Storage

Use bearer token authentication for files stored in private cloud storage with token-based access:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://storage.example.com/recordings/meeting-123.mp3"
    title: "Team Standup"
    download_auth: {
      type: bearer_token
      bearer: {
        token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

### Protected Web Servers

Use basic authentication for files hosted on web servers with HTTP Basic Auth:

```graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  uploadAudio(input: {
    url: "https://recordings.company.com/meeting-123.mp3"
    title: "Client Call"
    download_auth: {
      type: basic_auth
      basic: {
        username: "api-user"
        password: "secure-password"
      }
    }
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```
