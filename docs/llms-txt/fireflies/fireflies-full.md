# Authorization
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/authorization

Authenticating your requests with the Fireflies API

## Overview

The Fireflies API implements token-based authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access certain data and functionalities.

### Token-Based Authentication

We use a standard bearer token authentication mechanism. This means that to make authorized requests to the API, you must include an `Authorization` header with a valid token.

### Acquiring a Token

Follow these steps to obtain your API key for the Fireflies API:

1. Log in to your account at [fireflies.ai](https://app.fireflies.ai)
2. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.fireflies.ai/integrations) section
3. Click on [Fireflies API](https://app.fireflies.ai/integrations/custom/fireflies)
4. Copy and store your API key securely

### Making an Authenticated Request

To make an authenticated request, add the `Authorization` header followed by the word `Bearer` and your API key.

### Example of an Authenticated Request Header

```plaintext  theme={null}
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

### Example request with Authorization header

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl theme={null}
   curl \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     --data '{ "query": "{ user { name integrations } }" }' \
     https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql
  ```

  ```javascript javascript theme={null}
  const axios = require('axios');

  const url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql';
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer your_api_key'
  };
  const data = {
    query: '{ user { name integrations } }'
  };

  axios
    .post(url, data, { headers: headers })
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
  ```

  ```python python theme={null}
  import requests

  url = 'https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql'
  headers = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key'
  }
  data = {
      'query': '{ user { name integrations } }'
  }

  response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
  print(response.json())
  ```

  ```java java theme={null}
  import java.net.URI;
  import java.net.http.HttpClient;
  import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
  import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
  import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

  public class ApiRequest {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
          String url = "https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql";
          String json = "{\"query\":\"{ user { name integrations } }\"}";
          HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                  .uri(URI.create(url))
                  .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
                  .header("Authorization", "Bearer your_api_key")
                  .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(json, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
                  .build();

          client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
                  .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
                  .thenAccept(System.out::println)
                  .join();
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ensure to replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.

## Best Practices for Token Security

* **Keep it Secret:** Treat your API key like a password. Never expose it in client-side code or share it publicly.
* **Store Securely:** Store the API key securely in your application, ideally in environment variables or secure storage solutions.

<Warning>
  Improper handling of API keys can lead to security vulnerabilities. Always ensure API keys are
  used and stored securely.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

* **Invalid key:** If you receive an error regarding an invalid API key, verify that the API key hasn't expired and that it's correctly included in the request header.
* **Missing key:** Ensure that the `Authorization` header is present in your requests requiring authentication.

<Info>
  If you encounter issues with authentication or have questions about API key management, please
  contact our support team.
</Info>

# General concepts
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/concepts

Foundational guide to the core aspects of the Fireflies API

## Overview

This section serves as a primer on the essential features of the Fireflies API. It covers the requirements to make authenticated requests to the Fireflies API, key GraphQL concepts and a breakdown of core components like queries, mutations, schema and data types.

### Host

The Fireflies API is hosted at [https://api.fireflies.ai](https://api.fireflies.ai)

### Authorization

The Fireflies API requires a valid API key for all requests. Please see [Authorization](/fundamentals/authorization) for more information

## GraphQL API Concepts

Welcome to our GraphQL API! GraphQL is a powerful query language designed for APIs, offering clients the ability to request exactly what they need and nothing more.

### Queries

Queries are used to fetch data in GraphQL. They are akin to the `GET` request in REST.
A basic query might look like this:

<Info>Queries are read-only and won’t modify your data.</Info>

```graphql graphql theme={null}
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Mutations allow you to modify data – create, update, or delete.

<Warning>Mutations should be used with caution as they change server-side data.</Warning>

```graphql graphql theme={null}
mutation {
  setUserRole(user_id: "1", role: "user") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Schema and Types

### Schema Definition

The schema defines the API's capabilities, including types, queries, mutations, and more.

<Tip>
  <h3>Understanding GraphQL Schema</h3>
  <p>The schema is a contract between client and server, defining how clients can access data.</p>
</Tip>

#### Data Types

**Standard Types:** Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID.

**Custom Types:** Defining complex data structures. Custom types are user-defined and can include combinations of standard types.

#### Best Practices

1. Optimize query performance by requesting for only necessary data.
2. Use variables in queries to enhance readability and flexibility

# Errors
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/errors

Error standards for the Fireflies API

## Overview

Understanding how errors are structured and returned by the Fireflies API is key to effectively handling and troubleshooting issues. This page outlines the common error format and details specific error types.

## Error schema

Our GraphQL API follows a standard format for returning errors. Errors are encapsulated within an `errors` array in the response body.

Please visit [Error codes](/miscellaneous/error-codes) to view explanations for error code types

<ResponseField name="message" type="String" required>
  Description of the error
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="code" type="String" required>
  Error code.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="friendly" type="Boolean" required>
  `friendly === true` are safe to show to the frontend client. Unfriendly errors may have technical
  details that may not be useful to the UI layer.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="extensions" type="Object">
  Contains useful metadata related to the error.

  Where relevant, includes field `helpUrls` pointing to relevant API documentation sections that explain the error and provide guidance on how to resolve it
</ResponseField>

```json Example theme={null}
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error description",
	    "friendly": true,
      "code": "error_code",
      "extensions": {
        "helpUrls": [
         "https://docs.fireflies.ai/miscellaneous/error-codes#error_code"
        ],
        "code": "error_code",
        "status": http_status_code,
		    ... otherFields
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Introduction
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/introduction

Welcome to Fireflies public API documentation.

<Note>
  We are actively working to expose more functionality via our API. If you have specific requests,
  please [reach out to us](https://guide.fireflies.ai/).
</Note>

# Introduction

## Overview of the API

The Fireflies API is built on top of GraphQL, a powerful interface designed to provide you with efficient and flexible access to your data. This API allows you to retrieve exactly the data you need in a structured format. Whether you are building a web application, a mobile app, or a complex software system, our API caters to a wide range of data requirements.

Our API covers various functionalities, including queries for fetching data as well as uploading meeting audio. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that you can start fetching and manipulating data with minimal setup.

## Advantages of Using GraphQL

**1. Precise Data Fetching:** One of the key strengths of GraphQL is its ability to return exactly what you request and nothing more. This precision eliminates the over-fetching of data, common in traditional REST APIs, leading to more efficient network utilization and faster response times.

**2. Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST APIs, which often require multiple endpoints for different data needs, GraphQL operates through a single endpoint. This simplification streamlines interactions with the API and makes maintaining and managing the API more straightforward.

**3. Flexibility and Scalability:** GraphQL APIs are incredibly flexible, allowing for queries that can evolve with your needs. This flexibility, combined with efficient data retrieval, makes GraphQL an ideal choice for both small projects and large-scale applications.

In the following sections, we will guide you through the essential components of our API, provide detailed examples, and offer best practices to help you make the most of our API. Whether you're a new user or an experienced developer, this documentation is designed to assist you in seamlessly integrating the API into your applications.

# LLM-based Development
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/llm-development

Enhance your AI coding experience with LLM readable documentation.

### Overview

Welcome to the guide on utilizing our specialized `llms.txt` files to enhance your LLM-based coding workflow. Whether you’re using Replit, Cursor, Devin, or any other AI coding tool, this page will assist you in leveraging our resources to debug and refine code generated by Fireflies.

Our platform seamlessly integrates with a variety of AI coding tools. While the generated code may not always be perfect, this guide outlines how to effectively use our `llms.txt` files to improve the debugging process, ensuring your development workflow remains smooth and efficient.

### How to Use `llms.txt` Files

#### For Tools with Limited Agentic Capabilities

If your coding tool does not support web querying or autonomous resource fetching:

* **Download the File**\
  Access the complete file by visiting [this link](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt) and download it to your local machine.

* **Upload and Debug**\
  Upload the downloaded file to your AI coding tool. Instruct your tool to analyze and debug the code using the content of this file. This manual intervention guides the tool in identifying and fixing errors in generated code.

#### For Advanced, Agentic Coding Tools

If your coding tool is sophisticated and capable of querying the web independently:

* **Provide the URL Directly**\
  Instead of downloading the full file, supply your tool with the URL [https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.fireflies.ai/llms-full.txt).

* **Let It Decide**\
  Your advanced tool will automatically determine which parts of the file to use and where to look, streamlining the debugging process without additional manual steps.

### Additional Tips

* **Tool Configuration:** Ensure that your AI coding tool is configured to handle file uploads or URL-based inputs effectively.
* **Experiment and Adapt:** Different tools may interact with our resources in unique ways. Experiment with both methods to find the approach that best suits your workflow.
* **Support and Documentation:** If you encounter any challenges or need further assistance, please contact our support team.

Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/mcp-configuration

Connect your AI tools directly to your meeting data with Fireflies MCP Server.

### Overview

The Fireflies MCP Server enables AI tools to connect directly to your meeting data without switching platforms or copying transcript excerpts. This integration allows you to ask questions like "What were the main objections in this week's sales calls?" or "Create a summary of all product feedback from user interviews this month" directly from your AI coding tools.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. With Fireflies MCP Server, your AI tools can access meeting transcripts, summaries, action items, and insights directly from your Fireflies account.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* Active Fireflies.ai account
* AI tool that supports MCP (such as Claude, OpenAI Connector, Cursor, Devin, or other MCP-compatible applications)

#### Installation

1. **Configure your AI tool**
   Add the Fireflies MCP server to your AI tool's configuration. The remote server URL is [https://api.fireflies.ai/mcp](https://api.fireflies.ai/mcp) which uses OAuth with your Fireflies account. The exact steps depend on your specific AI application.

   For specific AI tools, you can also configure directly through:

   * [Claude Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors)
   * [Devin MCP Marketplace](https://app.devin.ai/settings/mcp-marketplace/setup/fireflies)

2. **Use your Fireflies API key on Claude Desktop** (Optional):
   1. Add this config to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
      ```json  theme={null}
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "fireflies": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
              "mcp-remote",
              "https://api.fireflies.ai/mcp",
              "--header",
              "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
   2. Get your API Key from Fireflies
      * Go to **Settings > Developer Settings** and **Copy your API key**
      * [See how to get your API key →](https://guide.fireflies.ai/hc/en-us/articles/360020249198-How-to-access-the-Fireflies-API-key)
      * Once you have the API key, paste it in your claude\_desktop\_config.json
      * Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
   3. Restart Claude Desktop

3. **Start querying your data**
   Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about your meeting data directly.

### Use Cases

* **Sales Analysis**: "What were the common objections in this week's sales calls?"
* **Product Feedback**: "Summarize all product feedback from user interviews this month"
* **Meeting Insights**: "What action items were assigned to John across all meetings?"
* **Trend Analysis**: "How has customer sentiment changed over the past quarter?"

# What's New
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/getting-started/whats-new

Latest updates to the Fireflies API

Take a look at our latest updates, features, and improvements for the Fireflies API.

<Update label="2.15.0" description="Set Meeting Channels">
  ### Set Meeting Channels

  The new [Update Meeting Channel](/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-channel) mutation allows meeting owners and team administrators to set the channel for one or more meetings. You can update 1–5 transcripts to a single channel in one API call with all-or-nothing semantics.

  This mutation requires either meeting ownership or team admin privileges for all specified transcripts. If any transcript fails validation, none of the transcripts will be updated, ensuring data consistency across your channel organization.
</Update>

<Update label="2.14.0" description="Active Meetings Fetching">
  ### Active Meetings Fetching

  The new [Active Meetings](/graphql-api/query/active-meetings) query allows you to fetch meetings currently in progress. This query returns real-time information about active meetings including meeting details, start time, organizer, and meeting link.
</Update>

<Update label="2.13.0" description="Rate Limiting for Delete Transcript">
  ### Rate Limiting for Delete Transcript

  The [Delete Transcript](/graphql-api/mutation/delete-transcript) mutation now includes rate limiting protection to prevent abuse. The mutation is limited to 10 requests per minute across all user tiers.

  If you exceed this limit, the API will return a `too_many_requests` error (HTTP 429) with a `retryAfter` timestamp indicating when you can make requests again.
</Update>

<Update label="2.12.0" description="Meeting Privacy Control">
  ### Meeting Privacy Control

  The new [Update Meeting Privacy](/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-privacy) mutation allows meeting owners and team administrators to programmatically update meeting privacy settings. You can now change privacy levels between `link`, `owner`, `participants`, `teammatesandparticipants`, and `teammates` to control who can access meeting transcripts.

  This mutation follows the same authorization pattern as other meeting management operations, requiring either meeting ownership or team admin privileges.
</Update>

<Update label="2.10.0" description="Meeting Attendance Tracking">
  ### Meeting Attendance Tracking

  The [Transcript](/schema/transcript) schema now includes a new `meeting_attendance` field that provides detailed participant attendance information. This field returns an array of [MeetingAttendance](/schema/meeting-attendance) records showing when participants joined and left the meeting.

  Each attendance record includes the participant's name, join time (ISO 8601 format), and leave time (if they left during the meeting). This feature enables better meeting analytics and participation tracking by leveraging meeting events data.

  The attendance data is available in both [Transcript](/graphql-api/query/transcript) and [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) queries.
</Update>

<Update label="2.9.0" description="Channel Filtering">
  ### Channel Filtering

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query now supports filtering by channel using the new `channel_id` parameter. This allows you to retrieve transcripts from specific channels by providing a single channel ID.

  The `channel_id` parameter accepts a string value and enables more targeted querying of meeting transcripts within your organization's channels.
</Update>

<Update label="2.8.0" description="Array Fields for Organizers and Participants">
  ### Array Fields for Organizers and Participants

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query now supports array fields `organizers` and `participants` that allow filtering by multiple email addresses. These new array fields provide more flexible querying capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

  The previous single email fields `organizer_email` and `participant_email` are now deprecated but continue to work. Using both old and new fields simultaneously will result in a validation error.
</Update>

<Update label="2.7.0" description="User Groups">
  ### User Groups

  The Fireflies API now includes comprehensive support for user groups. The new [User Groups](/graphql-api/query/user-groups) query allows you to fetch all user groups within your team or filter to only show groups you belong to using the `mine` parameter.

  Additionally, the [User](/schema/user) and [Users](/graphql-api/query/users) queries now include enhanced `user_groups` fields with detailed member information, providing better visibility into team organization and collaboration.
</Update>

<Update label="2.6.2" description="Keyword search">
  ### Keyword Search

  The [Transcripts](/graphql-api/query/transcripts) query has been enhanced to include keyword search functionality. By utilizing the `keyword` and `scope` parameters, you can now perform advanced searches within both the title and the transcript text, offering more precise retrieval.

  The `title` parameter has been deprecated in favor of `keyword`
</Update>

<Update label="2.6.1" description="Upload audio">
  ### Enhancements to Audio Upload

  The [Upload Audio](/graphql-api/mutation/upload-audio) function now includes a `bypass_size_check` flag. This enhancement provides greater control over filtering unwanted uploads, such as voicemails from dialers.
</Update>

<Update label="2.6.0" description="Realtime API">
  ### Realtime API

# Update Meeting Channel
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/mutation/update-meeting-channel

Use the API to update meeting channel assignments

## Overview

The `updateMeetingChannel` mutation allows for batch updating the channel assignment of multiple meeting transcripts. This operation requires admin privileges within the team or ownership of the meetings. You can update 1–5 transcripts at once with all-or-nothing semantics—if any transcript fails validation, none are updated.

## Arguments

<ParamField path="input" type="UpdateMeetingChannelInput" required>
  The channel assignment to be applied to the specified transcripts. See [UpdateMeetingChannelInput](/schema/input/update-meeting-channel-input).
</ParamField>

## Usage Example

To update meeting channels, provide an array of transcript IDs (1–5 items) and a single channel ID as arguments to the mutation. Here's an example of how this mutation could be used:

```graphql  theme={null}
mutation UpdateMeetingChannel($input: UpdateMeetingChannelInput!) {
  updateMeetingChannel(input: $input) {
    id
    title
    channels {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

<RequestExample>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST https://api.fireflies.ai/graphql \
  	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  	-H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  	-d '{
  		"query": "mutation($input: UpdateMeetingChannelInput!) { updateMeetingChannel(input: $input) { id title channels { id } } }",
  		"variables": {
  			"input": {
  				"transcript_ids": ["transcript_id_1", "transcript_id_2"],
  				"channel_id": "channel_id"
  			}
  		}
  	}'

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Who has permission to update meeting channels?">
  <p>Only users with admin privileges or meeting owners can update meeting channels. All specified meetings must be owned by users in your team.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many transcripts can I update at once?">
  <p>You can update between 1 and 5 transcripts in a single mutation call. If you need to update more transcripts, make multiple mutation calls.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the operation fails for one transcript?">
  <p>The mutation uses all-or-nothing semantics. If any transcript fails validation (not found, no access, or permission denied), none of the transcripts will be updated. All transcripts must pass validation for the update to succeed.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can a meeting belong to multiple channels?">
  <p>No, a meeting can only belong to one channel at a time. This mutation sets the meeting's channel to the specified value, replacing any previous channel assignment.</p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the response order guaranteed to match the input order?">
  <p>No, the response order is not guaranteed to match the input order of transcript\_ids. If you need to correlate responses with inputs, use the id field in the response.</p>

# User
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/query/user

Querying user details

## Overview

The user query is designed to fetch details associated with a specific user id.

## Arguments

<ParamField path="id" type="String" />

<Note>
  `id` is an optional argument. Not passing an ID to this query will return user details for the
  owner of the API key
</Note>

# Webhooks
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/graphql-api/webhooks

Webhook events for the Fireflies.ai API

## Overview

Webhooks enable your application to set up event based notifications. In this section, you'll learn how to configure webhooks to receive updates from Fireflies.

## Events supported

The webhooks support the following events:

* Transcription complete: Triggers when a meeting has been processed and the transcript is ready for viewing

<Note>
  Fireflies sends webhook notifications as POST requests to your specified endpoint. Each request
  contains a JSON payload with information about the event that occurred.
</Note>

## Saving a webhook

Follow the instructions below to save a webhook URL that sends notifications for all subscribed events. This webhook will only be fired for meetings that you own.

<Steps>
  <Step>Visit the [Fireflies.ai dashboard settings](https://app.fireflies.ai/settings)</Step>
  <Step>Navigate to the Developer settings tab</Step>
  <Step>Enter a valid https URL in the webhooks field and save</Step>
</Steps>

You may test your webhook using the upload audio API or by uploading through the dashboard at [app.fireflies.ai/upload](https://app.fireflies.ai/upload)

## Upload audio webhook

You can also include a webhook URL as part of an upload audio request. This is different from the saved webhook as it will only send notifications for that singular audio upload request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl theme={null}
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
    -d '{
      "query": "mutation($input: AudioUploadInput) { uploadAudio(input: $input) { success title message } }",
      "variables": {
        "input": {
          "url": "https://url_to_the_audio_file",
          "title": "title of the file",
          "webhook": "https://url_for_the_webhook"
        }
      }
    }' \

## Webhook Authentication

Webhook authentication ensures that incoming webhook requests are securely verified before processing. This allows consumers to trust that webhook events originate from a secure and verified source.

### How It Works

Each webhook request sent from the server includes an `x-hub-signature` header containing a SHA-256 HMAC signature of the request payload. This signature is generated using a secret key known only to the server and your application.

When the consumer receives a webhook, they can use the signature provided in the `x-hub-signature` header to verify that the request has not been tampered with. This is done by computing their own HMAC signature using the shared secret key and comparing it to the signature included in the header.

### Saving a secret

1. Go to the settings page at [app.fireflies.ai/settings](https://app.fireflies.ai/settings)
2. Navigate to the **Developer Settings** tab
3. You can either:
   * Enter a custom secret key of 16-32 characters in the input field
   * Click on the refresh button to generate a random secret key
4. Click Save to ensure the secret gets updated
5. Make sure to store this secret key securely, as it will be used to authenticate incoming webhook requests

### Verifying the Signature

1. **Receive the Webhook**:

   * Each request will include the payload and an `x-hub-signature` header

2. **Verify the Signature**:
   * Compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature using the payload and the shared secret key
   * Compare the computed signature to the `x-hub-signature` header value
   * If they match, the request is verified as authentic. If they do not match, treat the request with caution or reject it

By verifying webhook signatures, consumers can ensure that webhook events received are secure and have not been altered during transmission

### See it in action

To see webhook authentication in action, you can view an example at [Fireflies.ai Verifying Webhook Requests](https://replit.com/@firefliesai/Firefliesai-Verifying-webhook-requests#index.js). This example demonstrates how to receive a webhook, compute the HMAC SHA-256 signature, and verify it against the `x-hub-signature` header to ensure the request's authenticity.

## Webhook Schema

<ParamField path="meetingId" type="String" required>
  Identifier for the meeting / transcript that the webhook has triggered for. MeetingId and
  TranscriptId are used interchangeably for the Fireflies.ai Platform.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="eventType" type="String">
  Name of the event type that has been fired against the webhook
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="clientReferenceId" type="ID">
  Custom identifier set by the user during upload. You may use this to identify your uploads in your
  events.
</ParamField>

## Example Payload

```json  theme={null}
{
  "meetingId": "ASxwZxCstx",
  "eventType": "Transcription completed",
  "clientReferenceId": "be582c46-4ac9-4565-9ba6-6ab4264496a8"
}
```

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why am I not receiving webhook requests">
  <p>There may be multiple reasons why you are not receiving webhook requests. Please go through the following checklist:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Webhooks are only fired for meeting owners, referred to in the API as the `organizer_email.` Ensure that you have correctly setup the webhooks for the meeting owner.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your webhook is setup as a POST request</li>
    <li>If you have setup secret verification, ensure that you are correctly verifying the request by checking the example implementation [here](https://replit.com/@firefliesai/Firefliesai-Verifying-webhook-requests?v=1).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Team-wide webhooks are only supported for the Enterprise tier with the Super Admin role. This allows you to setup one webhook for all meetings owned by your team. Details [here](/fundamentals/super-admin).</p>

# Getting Started
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/realtime-api/getting-started

Learn how to connect to Fireflies.ai's Realtime API for live transcription

## Overview

This guide shows you how to connect to the Fireflies.ai Realtime API and start receiving transcription events in real time.

## Endpoint

```text  theme={null}
wss://api.fireflies.ai
```

## Requirements

You'll need the following:

* A valid API token
* A `transcriptId` (or meeting ID)

<Tip>
  Use the [Active Meetings](/graphql-api/query/active-meetings) query to discover meetings currently in progress and get their IDs for connecting to the Realtime API.
</Tip>

## Connecting via Socket.IO

Use the Socket.IO client to connect and listen for events.

```ts  theme={null}
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('wss://api.fireflies.ai', {
  path: '/ws/realtime',
  auth: {
    token: 'Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>',
    transcriptId: '<TRANSCRIPT_ID>'
  }
});

socket.on('auth.success', data => {
  console.log('Authenticated:', data);
});

socket.on('auth.failed', err => {
  console.error('Authentication failed:', err);
});

socket.on('connection.error', err => {
  console.error('Connection error:', err);
});

socket.on('connection.established', () => {
  console.log('Connection established');
});

socket.on('transcription.broadcast', event => {
  console.log('Transcript event:', event);
});
```

## Auth Parameters

| Field          | Type   | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `token`        | string | Your API access token           |
| `transcriptId` | string | ID of the meeting or transcript |

If authentication fails, the server emits an `auth.failed` event and disconnects the socket.

# Overview
Source: https://docs.fireflies.ai/realtime-api/overview

Learn about Fireflies.ai's Realtime API for live transcription

The Fireflies.ai Realtime API allows your application to receive **live transcription events** over WebSockets. This enables building interactive features such as live captioning, transcription overlays, and real-time analysis as users speak.

<Warning>
  The Realtime API is currently in <b>beta</b>. Features and endpoints may change. We welcome your feedback as we continue to improve this API.
</Warning>

## How It Works

The Realtime API uses WebSocket connections to deliver transcription data as it's generated.

## Flow

1. **Authenticate**: Connect using a valid API token and transcript ID.
2. **Listen**: Once connected, you'll start receiving transcription events in real time.
3. **React**: Update your UI or process transcription events as they arrive.

## Features

* **Low Latency**: Data is streamed as soon as it’s transcribed.
* **Event-Based**: Receive structured events for easy handling.
* **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure connections with scoped access.
* **Incremental Transcription**: Receive transcript segments progressively.
