# Live Preview

> Learn to set up your project for live previewing items from your application.

Live preview allows you to show changes in your website collection before publishing and without the need to refresh the browser.

## Live Preview Pre-Requisites

Before setting up live preview, ensure your Directus instance can embed external content by configuring the content security policy headers as described below.

**Required Environment Variable**

Your website will not be able to be rendered in your Directus instance if you do not set `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__FRAME_SRC="<your-website-base-url>"` within your instances env.

[Learn more](/configuration/security-limits) about Directus env security settings.

**Configure Your Website Content Security Policy**

Your website must allow Directus to embed it in an iframe. Add this header to your website: `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' <your-directus-url>;`. If you're unsure where to add this, check your web server configuration files, your site's build configuration, or your hosting platform's security settings.

For more information, see the [Live Preview Reference Tutorials](#reference-tutorials).

## Configure a Live Preview URL

Navigate to Settings -> Data Model and select the collection you wish to configure. In the "Preview URL" section, specify the Preview URL for your project by selecting the field you wish to use to identify your object in your application from the dropdown and entering a URL in this format:
`http://your-website-url/<field>`

### Using Live Preview with Your Application

Once configured, Directus will send a request to your application for a page with the specified URL format. For example, if you've configured the URL to be `https://mysite.com/posts/{id}`, and load the preview for the item with an `id` of `42`, then your application will receive a request to `https://mysite.com/posts/42`. You may choose to add `preview=true` to indicate to your client that it needs to treat this as a live preview. You may also choose to add an access token with the ability to view items as an additional URL query parameter.

You can then develop your application to handle that request and return a page that shows a preview of the item requested.

**Using Live Preview with Static Site Generators**
If you're using a static site generator to preview your item data, be sure to develop it to render the item page on load as opposed to on build. Otherwise, it will only show the state of the item when the site itself was last built.

## Previewing Item Contents in the Editor

In an item page, toggle "Enable Preview" at the top of the page. Whenever you create or edit an item in your collection
and "click" save, you should see a live preview of the item on the right-hand side of the screen.

 allows you to pop the live preview out into a separate window.

## Using Versions

If you've enabled [content versioning](/guides/content/content-versioning), you can configure your preview URL to pass the selected version to your frontend.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Model** and select your collection
2. In the **Preview URL** field, include the `{{$version}}` variable
3. Example: `https://your-site.com/{{slug}}?preview=true&version={{$version}}`

Directus passes the selected version key as the `version` query parameter. Your frontend must read this and fetch the versioned content from the API (e.g. `/items/posts/42?version=draft`). Without this, the preview will display main content regardless of the selected version.

**Visual Editing with Versions**
If your frontend is also configured with the [Visual Editor Frontend Library](/guides/content/visual-editor/frontend-library) and your [Visual Editor URL](/guides/content/visual-editor/studio-module#version-support-in-urls) includes `{{$version}}`, visual editing in the live preview pane works with content versions too. When viewing a version, only items on collections with versioning enabled will show editable elements.

## Visual Editing in Live Preview

If your frontend is configured with the [Visual Editor Frontend Library](/guides/content/visual-editor/frontend-library), the live preview pane becomes interactive. You can then hover and click to edit content directly without leaving the item page.

### Requirements

Visual editing in live preview requires:

- A Preview URL configured on the collection
- At least one Visual Editor URL configured in **Settings → Visual Editor** that matches the preview URL's origin
- Frontend configured with the [Visual Editor Frontend Library](/guides/content/visual-editor/frontend-library)
- Viewing an existing item (not available when creating new items or viewing content versions)

### Using Visual Editing

Click the <icon name="material-symbols:edit">



</icon>

 button in the preview toolbar to highlight all editable elements. Click any highlighted element to open its editor in a drawer, modal, or popover.

The display options menu provides additional controls:

- **Full Width** — Expand the preview to full width (you can also drag the divider to 95%+ to trigger this)
- **Open in New Window** — Pop out the preview to a separate window
- **Open in Visual Editor** — Jump to the full [Visual Editor module](/guides/content/visual-editor/studio-module) (if the module is enabled)

When you save changes, the item refreshes automatically.
