> Integrate Directus with Netlify to deploy your sites, track build progress, and manage frontend projects from within your Directus instance.

Integrate your Directus instance with Netlify to centrally deploy sites, track build progress, and manage multiple frontend projects — all from within Directus.

**Quick Start**

1. **Enable Deployment module**: Enable the Deployment module in your Directus project settings
2. **Link your Netlify account**: Go to the Deployment module and enter your Netlify Personal Access Token
3. **Add sites**: Connect one or more Netlify sites to your Directus instance
4. **Deploy**: Trigger builds and track deployment progress from Directus

</callout>

## Getting Started

4. Select **Configure Netlify** to set up the integration

  - **Personal Access Token**: Your Netlify [personal access token](https://docs.netlify.com/api/get-started/#authentication)

**Removing Sites**<br />


Removing a site from the Netlify integration will permanently delete all deployment history for that site from Directus. This cannot be undone.

### View Your Sites

Once set up, your connected Netlify sites appear in the Deployment module. From here you can:

- See all connected sites at a glance
- Access deployment controls for each site
- Track deployment status and history

**Permissions**<br />


The Deployment module uses Directus native permissions to control access. See [Deployment Security](/guides/deployments/security) for details on configuring roles and access policies.
