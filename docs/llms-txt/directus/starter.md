# Migrate from Starter Cloud Tier

> This guide will walk you through migrating your Directus project from Cloud Starter tier to a self-hosted environment. We'll cover both generic self-hosting instructions and a streamlined Railway deployment option.

While Directus offers both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options, we’ve spent a lot of time looking at how people are using the platform and where we can make the biggest long-term impact. After a lot of consideration, we’ve decided to retire the Starter Cloud tier.

Starter Cloud users have two options: upgrade to our managed Pro Cloud service, or transition to a self-hosted environment. We have created this guide to make transitioning from Starter Cloud to a self-hosted setup as smooth as possible.

## Overview

When migrating from Directus Cloud to self-hosting, you'll need to:

1. Set up a new Directus instance on your chosen infrastructure
2. Import your data and configure your environment
3. Update any necessary connection strings or configurations

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have:

- Access to your Cloud project export (.zip file received from the Directus Support team)
- Database client compatible with PostgreSQL (psql, pgAdmin, or DBeaver)
- Basic familiarity with Docker or Node.js (depending on your deployment method)

## Self-Hosting Deployment

This section covers self-hosting on any infrastructure provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure, etc.).

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup

**PostgreSQL Database (v13.8 or higher)**

*A managed service (AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed Database) or self-managed PostgreSQL instance.*

**Object Storage**

*S3, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, or local filesystem*

**Compute Instance**

*Docker host, Kubernetes cluster, or Node.js server (Minimum: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM for small projects)*

### Step 2: Deploy Directus

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  directus:
    image: directus/directus:latest
    ports:
      - 8055:8055
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/directus/uploads
      - ./extensions:/directus/extensions
    environment:
      KEY: 'replace-with-random-value'
      SECRET: 'replace-with-random-value'
      
      ADMIN_EMAIL: 'admin@example.com'
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: 'your-secure-password'
      
      DB_CLIENT: 'pg'
      DB_HOST: 'your-db-host'
      DB_PORT: '5432'
      DB_DATABASE: 'directus'
      DB_USER: 'directus'
      DB_PASSWORD: 'your-db-password'
      
      # If using S3-compatible storage
      STORAGE_LOCATIONS: 's3'
      STORAGE_S3_DRIVER: 's3'
      STORAGE_S3_KEY: 'your-s3-key'
      STORAGE_S3_SECRET: 'your-s3-secret'
      STORAGE_S3_BUCKET: 'your-bucket'
      STORAGE_S3_REGION: 'us-east-1'
      
      # Optional: Redis for caching
      CACHE_ENABLED: 'true'
      CACHE_STORE: 'redis'
      REDIS: 'redis://redis:6379'
      
      # Security
      PUBLIC_URL: 'https://your-domain.com'
      CORS_ENABLED: 'true'
      CORS_ORIGIN: 'true'

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    
volumes:
  uploads:
```

**Generate secure keys:**

```bash
# Generate KEY
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Start Directus:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Option B: Using Node.js

```bash
# Install Directus
npm init directus-project my-project

# Navigate to project
cd my-project

# Configure your .env file with database credentials
nano .env

# Start Directus
npx directus start
```

### Step 3: Restore Your Database

```bash
# Stop Directus temporarily
docker-compose down

# Create the directus database
psql -h your-db-host \
  -p 5432 \
  -U directus \
  -d directus \
  -c "CREATE DATABASE \"directus\""

# (Optional) Install postgis if you need to use maps
psql -h your-db-host \
  -p 5432 \
  -U directus \
  -d directus \
  -c "CREATE EXTENSION \"postgis\""

# Restore the project database

psql -h your-db-host \
  -p 5432 \
  -U directus \
  directus < example.sql

# Configure file storage provider to local storage

psql -h your-db-host \
  -p 5432 \
  -U directus 
  -c "UPDATE \"directus_files\" SET \"storage\" = 'local'"


# Start Directus again
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Import Your Files

#### If using local storage:

```bash
# Copy files to the uploads directory
cp -r assets/* ./uploads/
```

#### If using S3-compatible storage:

```bash
# Upload files to your S3 bucket
aws s3 cp assets/ s3://your-bucket/ --recursive
```

### Step 5: Update Configuration

1. **Update Admin Credentials**: Log in with your original admin credentials (from the import) or reset if needed
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure PUBLIC_URL matches your domain
3. **Update Webhooks**: If you had webhooks configured, update their endpoints
4. **Test Extensions**: Verify any custom extensions are loaded correctly

### Step 6: Configure DNS and SSL

1. Point your domain to your server's IP address
2. Set up SSL certificate (recommended: Let's Encrypt with Certbot)
3. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx or Caddy)

**Example Nginx configuration:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8055;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Railway Deployment

- Automatic SSL certificates
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Built-in monitoring and logs
- Generous free tier, then usage-based pricing

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy deployments)
3. Create a new project

### Step 2: Deploy Directus Template

To help you get started quickly, our official Directus CMS template is now live on [Railway](https://railway.com/deploy/directus-official). With one click, you can spin up a full Directus project on a lightweight, cost-efficient platform.

Railway will automatically:

- Create a PostgreSQL database
- Deploy Directus with proper configuration
- Generate a public URL

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, add/update these variables in the Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your Directus service → **Variables** tab
2. Update or add:

```text
KEY=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-project.up.railway.app
```

1. For file storage, add S3 configuration:

```text
STORAGE_LOCATIONS=s3
STORAGE_S3_DRIVER=s3
STORAGE_S3_KEY=your-aws-key
STORAGE_S3_SECRET=your-aws-secret
STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
STORAGE_S3_REGION=us-east-1
STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Step 4: Import Your Database to Railway

Railway provides direct database access:

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your PostgreSQL service
2. Click on **"Connect"** tab and copy the PostgreSQL connection URL
3. Import your dump:

```bash
# Using the Railway connection string
pg_restore -d postgresql://railway-user:password@host:port/database \
  -v your_database_dump.sql
```

Alternatively, use Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Connect to database
railway connect postgres

# Then run your import commands
```

### Step 5: Upload Files

#### Option A: Use Railway's persistent volumes

1. Add a volume to your Directus service in Railway dashboard
2. Mount it at `/directus/uploads`
3. Use Railway shell to upload files:

```bash
railway shell
# Then use scp or other methods to transfer files
```

#### Option B: Use S3 (Recommended for production)

Configure S3 storage as shown in Step 3 and upload files directly to S3.

### Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your Directus service
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Networking"**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS records as instructed
5. Railway automatically provisions SSL

### Step 7: Verify and Test

1. Visit your Railway URL or custom domain
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Verify all collections and data are present
4. Check file uploads are working
5. Test any custom extensions or webhooks

## Post-Migration Checklist
