**Removing Projects**<br />


Removing a project from the Vercel integration will also permanently delete all deployment history for that project from Directus. This action cannot be undone.

### View Your Projects

Once configured, your connected Vercel projects will be listed in the Deployment module. From here you can:

- View all connected projects at a glance
- Access deployment controls for each project
- Monitor deployment status and history

**Permissions**<br />


The Deployment module uses Directus native permissions to control access. See [Deployment Security](/guides/deployments/security) for details on configuring roles and access policies.
