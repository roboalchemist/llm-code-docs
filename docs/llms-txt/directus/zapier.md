**Permissions**<br />

**Admin Token (Recommended for Getting Started)**<br />


Many operations, including creating webhooks for triggers, require Administrator permissions. Assign the Administrator role to the user for the easiest setup and full access to all collections and features.

<br />

**Custom Role (For Production)**<br />


For better security, create a custom role with specific permissions. This allows you to limit access to only the collections and operations your workflows need. The token inherits the user's role permissions, so you can lock down access while still allowing necessary operations.
