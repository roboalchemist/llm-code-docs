# Usage Guide

> Learn how to use Collaborative Editing for real-time collaboration on content in your Directus project.

This guide covers the essential features you'll use when collaborating on content in real-time.

## Visual Indicators

![Collaborative editing indicators](/img/collaborative-editing-explanation.png)

When you open any item for editing, you'll see collaboration indicators:

- **User avatar stack** - appears in the header to show how the users currently editing the item
- **User avatars** appear next to fields when someone is editing them
- **Field locking** prevents you from editing fields others are actively using
- **Real-time updates** show changes as they happen

## Basic Usage

1. Open any collection item
2. Start editing - your avatar appears for others to see
3. Other users' avatars show which fields they're working on
4. Locked fields automatically unlock when users move away

## Where It Works

Collaborative editing works across:

- **All collections and items**![Collaborative pages](/img/collaborative-pages.png)
- **File library**![File library metadata](/img/collaborative-file-library.png)
- **User directory profiles**![User directory profiles](/img/collaborative-user.png)
- **Relational fields (even within) and page builders**![Relational fields and page builders](/img/collaborative-relationships-drawer.png)

## Summary

Collaborative editing happens automatically once enabled. Multiple users can work on the same content simultaneously without conflicts, with clear visual indicators showing who's working where.

## Known Limitations

- Translation forms: The entire form locks rather than on a field-by-field basis.
- Relational fields (M2A/M2M): When editing a relational entry in a drawer the entire relational interface will lock rather than on an entry-by-entry basis.
- Saving without permissions: When a user tries to save changes on an item while there are changes on a field they don't have write access to, they will receive an error.

**Next Steps:**

- Test with teammates to see real-time collaboration in action
- Check out the [Configuration Guide](/guides/content/collaborative-editing/configuration) if you need to configure settings
