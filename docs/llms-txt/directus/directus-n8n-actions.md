> Complete guide for using Directus actions in n8n workflows, including working with items, users, and files.

This guide covers how to use the Directus Node to perform actions on your Directus data in n8n workflows, including working with items, users, and files.

**← Back to Directus + n8n Overview**

## Using the Directus Node (Actions)

The Directus node lets you perform actions on your Directus data. It works with three types of resources: **Items**, **Users**, and **Files**.

## Available Actions

## Common Operations

Most operations follow a similar pattern across resources. Set the **Resource** type (Item, User, or File), choose the **Operation**, and configure the required fields.

### Create, Update, Delete

These operations work similarly across all resources:

- **Create**: Set Resource → Operation to Create → Select Collection (Items only) → Fill in fields → Click **Add Field** for additional fields
- **Update**: Set Resource → Operation to Update → Enter ID → Update desired fields
- **Delete**: Set Resource → Operation to Delete → Enter ID

**Note for Items**: When creating or updating items, you must select the **Collection** first. For Users and Files, no collection selection is needed.

<callout icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="warning">

**Permanent Deletion**
Delete operations permanently remove data. Make sure this is what you want to do!

</callout>

### Get Operations

- **Get**: Set Resource → Operation to Get → Enter ID → Optionally select **Fields** to return
- **Get Many**: Set Resource → Operation to Get Many → Optionally add filters → Set **Limit** → Optionally select **Fields**

**Note for Items**: Select the **Collection** before configuring filters.

## Resource-Specific Operations

### Items

Items are content entries in your Directus collections (blog posts, products, pages, etc.). All standard operations require selecting a **Collection** first.

**Example**: Create a blog post

- Collection: `posts`
- Fields: `title`, `content`, `status`

### Users

#### Invite a User

Set **Resource** to **User** → **Operation** to **Invite** → Enter **Email** → Select **Role**.

All other operations (Get, Get Many, Update, Delete) follow the standard pattern above.

### Files

#### Upload a File

Set **Resource** to **File** → **Operation** to **Upload a File**. The file must come from a previous node that outputs binary data (like an HTTP Request node). Optionally set **Title**, **Description**, and **Folder**.

#### Import a File from URL

Set **Resource** to **File** → **Operation** to **Import a File** → Enter **File URL**

All other operations (Get, Get Many, Update, Delete) follow the standard pattern above.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Using Expressions

You can use n8n expressions to reference data from previous nodes:

- `{{ $json.id }}` - Get the ID from the previous node
- `{{ $json.title }}` - Get the title field
- `{{ $json.email }}` - Get the email field

This is especially useful when chaining Directus nodes together. For example, use `{{ $json.id }}` to update an item that was just created in a previous node.

### Field Selection

When getting items, you can select specific fields to return. This is helpful when:

- You only need certain information
- You want to reduce the amount of data transferred
- You're working with large collections

<callout icon="material-symbols:info-outline">

**Performance Tip**
Selecting only the fields you need reduces data transfer and improves workflow performance, especially with large collections.

</callout>

### Simplify Option

For **Get Many** operations on Users and Files, use the **Simplify** option to get only the most commonly used fields. This makes the data easier to work with in subsequent nodes.

## Troubleshooting

When working with Directus API through n8n, you may encounter various error codes. For a comprehensive list of Directus error codes and their meanings, refer to the [official Directus Error Codes documentation](https://directus.io/docs/guides/connect/errors).

### Error Handling

If you get errors:

1. **Permission Errors**: Check that your Directus API token has the right permissions
2. **Not Found Errors**: Verify that the collection, item ID, or user ID exists
3. **Connection Errors**: Make sure your Directus URL is correct and accessible

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **For Directus-specific questions:** Ask for help in the [Directus Community](https://community.directus.io/)
2. **For n8n-specific questions:** Visit the [n8n Community Forum](https://community.n8n.io/) or check [n8n Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/)
3. **For API connection issues:** Verify your Directus configuration and permissions
