# Integration

> Connect Directus with n8n to automate workflows, sync data, and integrate your CMS with other services using the Directus community node.

Connect your Directus instance with n8n to automate workflows, sync data between systems, and build powerful integrations.

<callout icon="heroicons-outline:rocket-launch">

**Quick Start**

1. **Install the node**: Click the **+** button in n8n, search for "Directus", and install the verified node (look for the verification badge)
2. **Configure credentials**: Add your Directus URL and API token
3. **Start building**: Use the **Directus** node for actions or **Directus Trigger** node for automation

**Important**: Always install via the node palette search (+ button), not Settings → Community Nodes

</callout>

## Available Nodes

The Directus community node provides two components:

- **Directus Node**: Perform CRUD operations on items, users, and files
- **Directus Trigger Node**: Automatically start workflows when events occur in Directus

## Installation

### Install the Community Node

1. In n8n, open the node palette (click the **+** button to add a node)
2. Search for "Directus" in the search bar
3. The **Directus** verified node will appear in the results
4. Click the **Install** button

<callout icon="material-symbols:info-outline">

**Self-Hosted n8n Users**<br />


If you can't find the Directus node when searching, ensure community nodes are enabled:

1. Set `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED=true` in your n8n environment variables
2. Restart your n8n instance

After restarting, the verified Directus node should appear when you search for "Directus" in the node palette.

</callout>

### Configure Credentials

Before you can use the Directus nodes, you need to connect to your Directus instance:

1. In any Directus node, click on **Credential to connect with**
2. Click **Create New Credential** (or select an existing one)
3. Fill in your connection details:

  - **Directus URL**: Your Directus instance URL
  - **Token**: Your Directus API token
4. Click **Save** to store your credentials

#### Getting Your API Token

1. In Directus, go to **Users**
2. Select or create a user for n8n integration
3. Open the user's detail page
4. Scroll to **Token** section
5. Click **Generate Token**
6. Copy the token and paste into n8n
7. **Important**: Click the checkmark (✓) to save

<callout icon="material-symbols:info-outline">

**Permissions**<br />

**Admin Token (Recommended for Getting Started)**<br />


Many operations, including creating webhooks for triggers, require Administrator permissions. Assign the Administrator role to the user for the easiest setup and full access to all collections and features.

<br />

**Custom Role (For Production)**<br />


For better security, create a custom role with specific permissions. This allows you to limit access to only the collections and operations your workflows need. The token inherits the user's role permissions, so you can lock down access while still allowing necessary operations.

</callout>

## Troubleshooting

### "The specified package could not be loaded" or "Class could not be found"

This error occurs when stale files remain in n8n's community nodes directory after updates or reinstallation. This is a known n8n platform issue, not specific to the Directus node.

**For Docker deployments:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> sh -c "cd /home/node/.n8n/nodes && rm -rf package.json node_modules"
docker restart <container-name>
```

**For standard installations:**

1. Stop n8n
2. Delete the community nodes directory: `rm -rf ~/.n8n/nodes`
3. Start n8n
4. Reinstall the Directus node through the node palette (search for "Directus")

<callout icon="material-symbols:warning">

**Important**: After clearing the nodes directory, always reinstall by **searching for "Directus" in the node palette** (the + button), not through Settings → Community Nodes. The node palette search will show the verified Directus node with a shield icon.

</callout>

### "Package is not vetted for installation"

If you see this error, you're likely trying to install via Settings → Community Nodes using the package name `@directus/n8n-nodes-directus`.

**Solution**: Install through the node palette instead:

1. Click the **+** button to open the node palette
2. Search for "Directus"
3. Install the verified node (it will have a verification badge)

The Directus node is officially verified by n8n, but the verification system only works when installing through the node palette search, not through manual package name entry.

### Docker Volume Persistence

If your Directus nodes disappear after container restarts, ensure you're persisting the `~/.n8n/nodes` volume:

```yaml
volumes:
  - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
```
