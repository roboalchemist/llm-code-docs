# Overview

> Connect AI assistants directly to your Directus instance. Let Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI tools manage your content without manual copy-pasting.

AI assistants can now directly access your Directus content using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP). Instead of copying data back and forth, your AI tools connect directly to your Directus instance.

<callout color="info" icon="material-symbols:info">

**MCP requires Directus v11.12+**. For older versions, use the [Local MCP alternative](/guides/ai/mcp/local-mcp).

</callout>

## How can this help me?

- **Content editors**: Migrate content from Google Docs, organize individual files, and manage content with AI assistance.
- **Developers**: Rapidly prototype data models, create collections, and build automation workflows.
- **Teams**: Dramatically speed up content operations while maintaining brand consistency.

- Build landing pages using page builder components and relationships
- Add metadata to individual images (alt text, descriptions, tags)
- Organize files into logical folder structures
- Create content entries with proper relationships to authors, categories, etc.

### For Developers

**Rapidly prototype data models and build automation using natural language.**

- Create collections with proper field types and validation rules
- Set up complex relationships (M2O, O2M, M2M, M2A) between collections
- Generate automation flows triggered by database events
- Build approval workflows with custom operations
- Prototype entire data models through conversation
