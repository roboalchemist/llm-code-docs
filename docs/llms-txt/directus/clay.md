> Connect Directus with Clay to automate data enrichment and sync content between platforms using webhooks and HTTP API templates.

Connect your Directus instance with Clay to automate data enrichment, sync content, and build powerful workflows between your content platform and Clay's data enrichment tools.

## Before You Start

### Set Up Your Directus Project

You'll need a Directus project with:

- Collections set up with the data you want to work with
- Proper permissions configured for the operations you plan to use
- API access enabled and a valid API token

### Set Up Clay

Make sure you have a Clay account and are familiar with:

- Creating enrichment columns
- Basic Clay workflow concepts
- How to search for and use templates
