# Changing quality profiles

The instance’s default quality profiles for each language is applied by default to your project. As a project administrator, you can apply other standards to your project.

Proceed as follows:

1. Retrieve your project. See [retrieving-projects](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-community-build/user-guide/viewing-projects/retrieving-projects "mention") for more details.
2. Select **Project Settings > Quality Profiles**.
3. In the **Actions** column of the language you want to configure, select the pen icon. If the language is not listed, select **Add language**.
4. Select **Always use a specific Quality Profile**, and select the quality profile in the list.
5. Select **Save**.
