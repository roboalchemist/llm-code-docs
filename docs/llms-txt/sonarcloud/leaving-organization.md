# Leaving an organization

You can leave SonarQube Cloud organizations you are not interested in anymore. There are a few cases where you won’t be able to leave an organization:

* If the organization membership is automatically managed through the identity provider.
* If you are the unique administrator of an Organization, you must transfer the administrator rights before transferring. See the [organization-permissions](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-organization/users-and-permissions/organization-permissions "mention") page for more information.
  * Alternatively, you can delete your organization completely. Check the[deleting-organization](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-organization/creating-organization/deleting-organization "mention") page for instructions.

To leave an organization:

1. Select your account menu in the top right corner of the SonarQube Cloud interface.
2. In the menu, select **My Organizations**. The **My Organizations** page opens with the list of organizations you’re a member of.
3. Select **Leave** on the row of the organization you want to leave.
