# Activity and history

The project **Activity** page shows a list of the analyses that have been performed on your project. This covers all historical data except for that which has been cleaned up by the [housekeeping](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/digging-deeper/housekeeping "mention") process.

Graphs on the activity page help you understand the evolution of up to three measures of your choice against each other. Graph mouseovers show the measure values and events associated with particular analyses.

### Events <a href="#events" id="events"></a>

There are four types of events:

* **Quality Gate**: the status of your quality gate has changed. See the [introduction-to-quality-gates](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/managing-quality-gates/introduction-to-quality-gates "mention") page for details.
* **Profile**: the quality profile used to analyze your project has changed - either the profile was edited, or a different profile was used to analyze the project. See the [understanding-quality-profiles](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/managing-quality-profiles/understanding-quality-profiles "mention") page for details.
* **Version**: the project’s version changed.
* **Other**: an event was manually created on a snapshot. See the page about [managing-project-history](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/digging-deeper/managing-project-history "mention").

Events are shown on the project **Overview** page; scroll down to see the **Latest Activity** section. See the[main-branch-analysis](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/improving/main-branch-analysis "mention") and [first-analysis](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/getting-started/first-analysis "mention") pages to for explanations about what information is available.
