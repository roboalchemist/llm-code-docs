# Assuring your AI code

Recommended checks include high standards to reduce code complexity, remove bugs, and eliminate injection vulnerabilities. SonarQube’s AI Code Assurance features bring confidence that your AI-generated code is being reviewed to avoid any accountability crisis.

These objectives are achieved with three features that allow Quality Standard administrators to qualify projects as AI Code Assured:

1. [#label-projects-with-ai-code](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/2025.2/ai-capabilities/ai-standards#label-projects-with-ai-code "mention")
2. [#apply-qualified-quality-gate](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/2025.2/ai-capabilities/ai-standards#apply-qualified-quality-gate "mention")
3. Publish an [#using-the-ai-code-assurance-badge](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/2025.2/ai-capabilities/ai-standards#using-the-ai-code-assurance-badge "mention") externally to your websites (optional)
