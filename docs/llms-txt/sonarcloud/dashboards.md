You can use the Project health dashboard, a built-in dashboard provided by Sonar, or create your own dashboards from scratch. Duplicating existing dashboards provides a good starting point for creating custom dashboards that fit your organization’s needs. Dashboards use interactive widgets that visualize data based on various types of measures. You can then sort and filter the data and click on values displayed in a dashboard to investigate further.
