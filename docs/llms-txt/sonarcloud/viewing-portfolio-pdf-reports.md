# Viewing portfolio PDF reports

This feature is only available in the [Enterprise plan](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/#sonarqube-cloud-features).

The code quality in the portfolio PDF report is presented through a number of lenses such as security, reliability, maintainability, security review, and releasability. Additionally, it includes information about code coverage and duplication for new and overall code.

Before you can view the Enterprise-level reports, your organization must be added to an enterprise. For more information, see [managing-enterprise](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-enterprise "mention").
