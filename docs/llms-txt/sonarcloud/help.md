### The Sonar Community <a href="#the-sonar-community" id="the-sonar-community"></a>

For SonarQube for IDE support questions ("How do I?", "I got this error, why?", …), please first read the [FAQ](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/frequently-asked-questions/7204) to learn how to get your logs, then head to the [Sonar forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/sl/11) and find your dedicated SonarQube for IDE channel. Before creating a new topic, please check if your question has already been answered because there is a chance that someone has already had the same issue.

When creating a new topic, please describe your issue with as much detail as possible. Please use this template:

* **Your IDE flavor/version/OS** (when applicable): *example: Eclipse 2023-09 on MacOSX*
* **Your SonarQube for IDE version**:
* **Is connected mode used (Y/N)**:
  * **If yes, to which version of SonarQube Server, or is it SonarQube Cloud or the SonarQube Community Build?**
* **If you are using connected mode on SonarQube Server, what are the installed analyzers?** *You can easily get a list by opening* `https://<SQ server>/api/plugins/installed` *in a Web browser.*
* **Please include the full stacktrace of the error and logs with** ***Verbose output*** **and** ***Analysis logs*** **enabled.** *See your IDE-specific **Troubleshooting page** for detailed instructions to get these logs.*

Be aware that the Sonar Community Forum is a community, and the standard pleasantries are expected (*Hello*, *Thank you*, *I appreciate the reply*, *etc*). If you don’t get an answer to your thread, please wait for at least three days before bumping it. Operators are not standing by, but the Teams and Community Managers know that your questions are important.
