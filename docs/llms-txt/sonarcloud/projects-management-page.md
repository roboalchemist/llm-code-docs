# Using Projects Management page

This feature is only available in the [Enterprise plan](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/#sonarqube-cloud-features).

As the organization admin, you can manage the projects of your organization on the **Projects Management** page. There, you can manage any project individually, you can delete or apply a permission template to several projects at a time, and you can create new projects. You can also recover lost administrator access to a project.

Proceed as follows:

1. Retrieve your organization. See [viewing-organizations](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/getting-started/viewing-organizations "mention") for more details.
2. Go to **Administration** > **Projects Management**.
3. To manage the permissions of a single project, use the three-dot menu at the far right of the project line.
4. To manage several projects at a time:
   * Retrieve and select the projects you want to manage.
   * In the toolbar, select the tool you want to use, either **Delete** or **Bulk Apply Permission Template.** The corresponding dialog opens.
5. To create new projects, select the **Analyze new projects** button. See [setting-up-project](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/managing-your-projects/administering-your-projects/setting-up-project "mention") for more information.
