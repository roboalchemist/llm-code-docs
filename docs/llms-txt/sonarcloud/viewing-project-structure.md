# Viewing project structure

You can view the project’s structure and code in SonarQube Server. For private projects, you need the **Browse** and **See Source Code** permission.

To view the structure and code of a project:

1. Retrieve your project. See [retrieving-projects](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/user-guide/viewing-projects/retrieving-projects "mention") for more information.
2. In the project navigation bar, select **Code**. It takes you to an outline of your project structure.
3. Drill down to see files in a directory, and select a file to see its code.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your project is too large for easy exploration via drilling, the search feature on this page will help. While the global search in the main menu returns results from throughout the SonarQube Server instance, the localized search on the code page is restricted to files and directories in the current project.
{% endhint %}
