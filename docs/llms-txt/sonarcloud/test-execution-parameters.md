# Test execution parameters

*Test execution reports* describe which tests within your test suite have been run during a build.

This differs from *test coverage reports*, which describe the percentage of your code that has been tested by your test suite during a build. For details, see [test-coverage-parameters](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/enriching/test-coverage/test-coverage-parameters "mention").

Test execution reports are not generated by SonarQube Cloud itself. Much like tests coverage reports, test execution reports must be generated by an external tool and then imported into SonarQube Cloud by specifying a parameter telling the scanner where to look for the report. The data is then displayed in your SonarQube Cloud analysis.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Only long-lived branches are supported for test execution**

SonarQube Cloud only supports test execution reports for the [branch-analysis](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/enriching/branch-analysis "mention") of a project (including the main branch) not for pull requests and [#short-lived-branch-analysis](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/branch-analysis#short-lived-branch-analysis "mention"). This differs from the case with test coverage reports where pull requests and short-lived branches are supported.
{% endhint %}

Below, you will find language- and tool-specific analysis parameters for importing test execution reports.

For information on analysis parameters in general, see [analysis-parameters](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/advanced-setup/analysis-parameters "mention").

Unless otherwise specified, these properties require values that are relative to the project root. Some properties support the following wildcards in paths. The remarks for properties that support wildcards will mention this fact. If wildcards are not noted for a given property, then they are not supported for that property.

| **Symbol** | **Meaning**               |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `?`        | a single character        |
| `*`        | any number of characters  |
| `**`       | any number of directories |

### All languages <a href="#all-languages" id="all-languages"></a>

**sonar.testExecutionReportPaths**

Comma-delimited list of paths to execution reports in the [generic-test-data](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/enriching/test-coverage/generic-test-data "mention") format.

### C/C++/Objective-C <a href="#ccobjective-c" id="ccobjective-c"></a>

**sonar.cfamily.cppunit.reportsPath**

Path to the directory holding the [CPPUnit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/) reports. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

### C# <a href="#c" id="c"></a>

**sonar.cs.vstest.reportsPaths**

Paths to VSTest reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

**sonar.cs.nunit.reportsPaths**

Paths to NUnit execution reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

**sonar.cs.xunit.reportsPaths**

Paths to xUnit execution reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

### Go <a href="#go" id="go"></a>

**sonar.go.tests.reportPaths**

Comma-delimited list of paths to unit test report files. Paths may be absolute or relative to the project root.

### Java <a href="#java" id="java"></a>

**sonar.junit.reportPaths**

Comma-delimited list of paths to Surefire XML-format reports.

### PHP <a href="#php" id="php"></a>

**sonar.php.tests.reportPath**

Path to the PHPUnit unit test execution report file. The path may be absolute or relative to the project root.

### Python <a href="#python" id="python"></a>

**sonar.python.xunit.reportPath**

Path to unit test execution report. Leave unset to use the default (`xunit-reports/xunit-result-*.xml`). Path wildcards (see above) are supported. If any paths in the report are invalid, set `sonar.python.xunit.skipDetails=true` to collect only project-level details.

### VB.NET <a href="#vbnet" id="vbnet"></a>

**sonar.vbnet.vstest.reportsPaths**

Paths to VSTest execution reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

**sonar.vbnet.nunit.reportsPaths**

Paths to NUnit execution reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.

**sonar.vbnet.xunit.reportsPaths**

Paths to xUnit execution reports. Multiple paths may be comma-delimited or included via wildcards. Note that while measures such as the number of tests are displayed at the project level, no drill-down is available.
