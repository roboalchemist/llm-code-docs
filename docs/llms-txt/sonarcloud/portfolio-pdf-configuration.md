# Portfolio PDF configuration

*PDF reports are available as part of the* [*Enterprise Edition*](https://app.gitbook.com/u/IjlgA9XCtdf4qR4Sdfz6QWWoRks1) *and* [*above*](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/)*.*

A user with administrative rights on a portfolio can configure email distribution of the PDF. From a Portfolio Home Page go to **Administration > Executive Report**.

#### Frequency <a href="#frequency" id="frequency"></a>

You can tune the email frequency of the PDF Report. The possible values are:

* Daily: report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the day (if any)
* Weekly: report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the week (if any) from Monday
* Monthly (default): report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the month (if any), starting from the first day of the current month

#### Other Recipients <a href="#other-recipients" id="other-recipients"></a>

If people without SonarQube accounts want to receive the PDF, you can feed the administrative "Other Recipients" field with their email addresses.

PDF reports give a periodic, high-level overview of the overall code quality and security of your projects, applications, or portfolios.
