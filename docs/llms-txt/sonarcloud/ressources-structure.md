# Ressources structure

- [Organization](/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/about-sonarqube-cloud-solution/ressources-structure/organization.md): SonarQube Cloud mirrors the organization-based structure of your DevOps platform. Projects are grouped together for collaborative work and permission management.
- [Organization's projects](/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/about-sonarqube-cloud-solution/ressources-structure/projects.md): SonarQube Cloud projects represent DevOps platform repos and can be public or private, with binding to the repository determining visibility. Project permissions are managed through user groups.
- [Enterprise](/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/about-sonarqube-cloud-solution/ressources-structure/enterprise.md): SonarQube Cloud's Enterprise plan allows the centralized administration of multiple Organizations which may or may not be linked to multiple DevOps platforms.
- [Binding with the DevOps platform](/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/about-sonarqube-cloud-solution/ressources-structure/binding-with-dop.md): Your organizations and projects in SonarQube Cloud are bound to their respective organization or repository on GitHub, Bitbucket Cloud, GitLab, or Azure DevOps.
