# Security contact

### Permissions

You need the Administer Organization permission to set up the security contact for an organization. To change the permissions, select your organization from the **Account** menu and go to **Administration** > **Permissions** to apply the permission to users or groups.

### Setting up the security contact email address

To set up the security contact email address:

1. Select your organization from the **Accounts** menu and go to **Administration** > **Organization settings** > **Security contact**.
2. Click on **Add email** and enter the email address for your security contact.
3. Click **Save**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sonar recommends that you use a distribution list or group alias, for example <securityteam@yourcompany.com>, for the security contact email.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once you have saved the security contact email address, you can **Edit** it, or delete it. Additionally, the entry shows the email address of the user who set up the security contact and the date when it was updated.
