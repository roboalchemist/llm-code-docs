# Product release lifecycle

This document describes Sonar’s product release lifecycle and standard definitions for alpha, beta, and general availability (GA) stages. The alpha and beta stages replace the previously used Early Access (deprecated) programs.

### Alpha <a href="#alpha" id="alpha"></a>

Products or features in the alpha stage have limited functionality and are subject to significant change or cancellation. Access is invitation-only. Products or features in alpha are not covered under SLA.

### Beta <a href="#beta" id="beta"></a>

Products or features in the beta stage have nearly complete functionality. Access is by request and requires approval. Products or features in beta are not covered under SLA.

### General availability (GA) <a href="#general-availability" id="general-availability"></a>

A public release of a product or feature. It includes all planned functionalities and is available to customers for purchase. A GA product is publicly announced by Sonar, fully functional, stable, documented, supported, and covered under SLA.
