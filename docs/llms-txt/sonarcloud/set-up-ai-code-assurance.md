# Set up AI Code Assurance

Setting up AI Code Assurance is a three-step process laid out in full on the [overview](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/ai-code-assurance/overview "mention") page.

### Assuring your AI code <a href="#assuring-your-ai-code" id="assuring-your-ai-code"></a>

SonarQube Cloud recognizes that AI-generated code should be monitored with additional quality standards. Recommended checks include high standards to reduce code complexity, remove bugs, and eliminate injection vulnerabilities. SonarQube’s AI Code Assurance features bring confidence that your AI-generated code is being reviewed to avoid any accountability crisis.

These objectives are achieved with three features that allow Quality Standard administrators to qualify projects as AI Code Assured:

1. [#label-projects-with-ai-code](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/ai-code-assurance/overview#label-projects-with-ai-code "mention")
2. [#apply-a-quality-gate-for-ai-code-assurance](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/ai-code-assurance/overview#apply-a-quality-gate-for-ai-code-assurance "mention")
3. Publish an AI Code Assurance badge externally to your websites to [#monitor-projects-containing-ai-code](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/ai-code-assurance/overview#monitor-projects-containing-ai-code "mention").

Steps 1 and 2 are applied in the **Project Settings**. Step 3 reports the AI Code Assurance status of the project. Check the [monitor-projects-with-ai-code](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/standards/ai-code-assurance/monitor-projects-with-ai-code "mention") page for a description of the AI Code Assurance labels and badges.
