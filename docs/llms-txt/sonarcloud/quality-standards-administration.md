# Quality standards administration

- [Managing quality gates](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates.md): This section helps you understand how to view, manage, and change your quality gates in SonarQube Server.
- [Introduction](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/introduction.md): Your introduction to understanding how to use quality gates in SonarQube Server.
- [Understanding quality gates](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/introduction-to-quality-gates.md): SonarQube Server quality gates use sets of conditions to measure checks against your code during analysis. Depending on result, code passes or fails the quality gate.
- [Viewing a quality gate](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/viewing-quality-gate.md): Any user can view the quality gates and their conditions defined in a SonarQube Server instance.
- [Managing custom quality gates](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/managing-custom-quality-gates.md): You can create your own, custom quality gates in SonarQube Server. To manage custom quality gates, you must have the Administer Quality Gates permission.
- [Changing instance's default quality gate](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/changing-default-quality-gate.md): A default quality gate is assigned in your SonarQube Server settings. This quality gate is automatically applied to new projects and can be modified at any time.
- [Associating a quality gate with projects](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-gates/associating-projects-with-quality-gate.md): The default quality gate is associated with all projects in the organization that are not explicitly associated with a quality gate.
- [Managing quality profiles](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles.md): This section helps you understand how to view, manage, and change your quality profiles in SonarQube Server.
- [Introduction](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/introduction.md): Your introduction to understanding how to use quality profiles in SonarQube Server.
- [Understanding quality profiles](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/understanding-quality-profiles.md): Quality profiles are a key part of your SonarQube Server configuration because they are composed of a list of rules to check your code against.
- [Viewing quality profiles](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/viewing-quality-profiles.md): Any user can view and compare quality profiles in SonarQube Server.
- [Creating a quality profile](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/creating-a-quality-profile.md): The Sonar way quality profile is designed to be broadly suitable for most projects and you can use custom quality profiles to adjust your project as it progresses.
- [Editing a quality profile](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/editing-a-custom-quality-profile.md): To edit a quality profile in SonarQube Server, you need the Administer Quality Profiles permission or be authorized to manage this particular profile.
- [Associating with projects](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/associating-a-quality-profile-with-projects.md): By default, a SonarQube Server project is associated with each language’s default quality profile. You can also explicitly associate a quality profile with projects.
- [Changing default quality profile](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/changing-default-quality-profile.md): By default, the language’s BUILT-IN quality profile, Sonar way, is the profile assigned to projects not explicitly associated with another quality profile.
- [Maintaining quality profiles](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/maintaining-your-custom-quality-profiles.md): Maintaining your custom quality profile in SonarQube Server is important if it's not inherited from the Sonar way built-in profile.
- [Granting permissions to users](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/authorizing-other-users-to-manage-quality-profile.md): It is a simple process in SonarQube Server to assign the correct quality profile administration permission to users and groups.
- [Adding tags to a rule](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/managing-quality-profiles/adding-tags-to-rule.md): Tags are a way to categorize rules and issues.
- [Standards for AI Code Assurance](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/ai-code-assurance.md): SonarQube Server's AI Code Assurance features help you set appropriate standards for projects containing AI-generated code.
- [Set your AI standards](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/ai-code-assurance/overview.md): This section explains how to manage AI standards, including the use of tools for Sonar’s AI Code Assurance in your SonarQube Server project.
- [Quality gates for AI code](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/ai-code-assurance/quality-gates-for-ai-code.md): This page explains how to manage quality gates for AI Code Assurance for securing your SonarQube Server project.
- [Quality profiles for AI code](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/ai-code-assurance/quality-profiles-for-ai-code.md): This page explains how to manage quality profiles for AI Code Assurance for securing your SonarQube Server project.
- [Monitor projects with AI code](/sonarqube-server/quality-standards-administration/ai-code-assurance/monitor-projects-with-ai-code.md): This page explains the internal and external AI Code Assurance labels and badges you have to mark your SonarQube Server projects.
