# Billing model

### Billing methods <a href="#billing-methods" id="billing-methods"></a>

The billing method is different depending on the plan.

<details>

<summary>Team</summary>

In SonarQube Cloud each Team plan organization is billed separately. Payment information is always specific to a particular organization, it is not tied to the DevOps platform account that you signed in with.

You can use the following billing methods:

* Monthly with credit card: You have to provide your credit card details and your credit card will be automatically charged every month. With the new billing customer portal, the currency used (EUR, GBP, JPY, or USD) will depend on your billing country.\
  This method is supported only for the Team plan.
* Custom with coupon: You must [contact our team](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/contact/) to purchase a coupon, which is usually valid for one year.\
  This method is supported for the Team and Enterprise plans.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recently introduced a new billing customer portal that is currently only available to new customers.

<details>

<summary>Enterprise</summary>

The Enterprise plan is now based on an enterprise-level subscription. You must [contact our team](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/contact/) to purchase a one-year or multi-year license, billed annually.

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
Indirect taxes may be added to your subscription fee. See [viewing-taxes-and-invoices](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-subscription/viewing-taxes-and-invoices "mention") for more information.
{% endhint %}

### Free trial <a href="#free-trial" id="free-trial"></a>

When you sign up for a monthly paid plan (with credit card payment), a 14-days free trial is offered.

If you sign up with a coupon, a custom trial may be associated with the coupon.

### Automatic renewal of monthly subscriptions <a href="#automatic-renewal" id="automatic-renewal"></a>

Paid plan subscriptions automatically renew every month by automatically charging your credit card.

### If the renewal payment fails or your coupon or license expires <a href="#if-payment-fails" id="if-payment-fails"></a>

If your credit card is rejected multiple times or if your coupon or license expires, your private projects will be suspended. New analyses will no longer be possible on those projects but all your data will be preserved. The private projects will remain private, nothing will be deleted, and organization members will still be able to access all the data of these projects.

You can re-activate these projects simply by correcting your credit card problem and re-entering the credit card information (even if it is the same as your previous one), or entering a new coupon or license. You may also downgrade to the Free plan in which you can benefit from the analysis of up to 50k lines of private code. See [changing-plan](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-subscription/changing-plan "mention") for more information.

If you abandon your account by failing to renew or update payment information for a long period of time, your private projects will eventually be deleted. However, we will always attempt to reach out and warn you to remedy the situation before this happens.

{% hint style="info" %}
Two months prior to the enterprise license expiration, a banner warning of upcoming license expiration will be displayed to all users. In that case, please have your admin [contact our team](https://www.sonarsource.com/company/contact/) to renew your license.
