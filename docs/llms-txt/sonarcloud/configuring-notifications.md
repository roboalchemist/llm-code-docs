# Configuring issue-related notifications

You can receive an email notification for issue-related events. You can enable the notifications at global level (for all your projects) and at project level.

To configure the notifications for issue-related events:

1. In the top right corner of the SonarQube UI, click your account icon and select **My account** in the account menu.
2. In the Account’s navigation bar, select **Notifications**.
3. In **Overall notifications**, check the option to enable notifications at the global level as illustrated below.
4. To configure notifications for a given project, select **Add a project**.
