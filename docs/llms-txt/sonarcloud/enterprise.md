Several organizations can be grouped together into an enterprise in SonarQube Cloud. To do so, the organizations must belong to an enterprise. The following applies:

* The enterprise’s organizations may belong to different DevOps platforms.
* At least one user is defined as the enterprise admin.
* The members of the enterprise are the users who are members of an enterprise’s organization.
