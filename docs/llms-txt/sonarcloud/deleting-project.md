# Deleting project

You can delete your project provided you’re a project admin.

{% hint style="info" %}
As an organization administrator, you can delete several projects from your organization at a time. See [projects-management-page](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-organization/manage-org-projects/projects-management-page "mention") for more information.
{% endhint %}

Proceed as follows:

1. Retrieve your project. See [retrieving-projects](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/managing-your-projects/retrieving-projects "mention") for more details.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Administration** > **Deletion** and confirm. The **Delete project** dialog opens.
3. Enter the project name and select **Delete**.
