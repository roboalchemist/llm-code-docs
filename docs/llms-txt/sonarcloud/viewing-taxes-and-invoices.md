5. To view an invoice, select it in the list. The invoice page opens.

7. To download the invoice, select **Download invoice**.
8. To download the receipt, select **Download receipt**.

### Viewing the indirect taxes <a href="#indirect-taxes" id="indirect-taxes"></a>

Depending on where your business is located, you may be charged taxes in addition to your subscription fee. Tax rates are calculated based on the tax laws where you live. SonarQube Cloud determines where you live based on the country, state/county, street number, and ZIP Code that you provided when you purchased your subscription.

{% hint style="info" %}

* The tax amounts can change over time with local tax requirements.
* If your company has moved, change your billing details accordingly. We will calculate and charge you the appropriate rate for your new company address. See [updating-billing-payment-details](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/administering-sonarcloud/managing-subscription/updating-billing-payment-details "mention") for more information.
