# Signing up and onboarding

This page is directed at administrators when onboarding their first DevOps platform organization. For sign-in instructions, see [signing-in](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-cloud/managing-your-account/signing-in "mention").

When you first sign up for SonarQube Cloud, you have to choose which DevOps platform you want to connect to.

Then sign into SonarQube Cloud with your existing credentials on that service (there is no such thing as a SonarQube Cloud-only account). Your SonarQube Cloud account will be created and bound to your account on the DevOps platform. For more information, see [Authentication](https://www.sonarsource.com/trust-center/#authentication) in the Trust Center.

At this point, you can import organizations from your DevOps platform to SonarQube Cloud and then import repositories from those organizations. Each imported organization becomes a SonarQube Cloud organization and each imported repository becomes a SonarQube Cloud project. Once you import a project, it appears in your **My Projects** list.
