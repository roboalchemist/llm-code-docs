- [Introduction](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/introduction.md): Main steps for setting the project's analysis scope.
- [Setting initial scope](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/setting-initial-scope.md): Setting the initial scope of analysis for your project's source and test files.
- [Excluding based on path-matching patterns](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/excluding-files-based-on-patterns.md): Adjust your project’s initial analysis scope by excluding files based on path-matching patterns.
- [Excluding based on file extension](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/excluding-based-on-file-extension.md): For each programming language, define the file extensions to be analyzed.
- [Excluding from coverage or duplication](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/exclude-from-coverage-duplication.md): Exclude specific files from your project's code coverage analysis or duplication checks.
- [Applying advanced exclusions](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/advanced-exclusions.md): Tailor your project's analysis by applying advanced exclusions based on file content, specific code blocks, and defined coding rules.
- [Other adjustments](/sonarqube-server/project-administration/adjusting-analysis/setting-analysis-scope/other-adjustments.md): Adjust your project's analysis based on secret detection scope, file size, and SCM file ignore patterns.
