# Customizing your UI

The SonarQube Cloud interface theme defines the appearance of windows, dialog boxes, buttons, and other visual elements of the user interface. It is not the same as the color scheme (that covers colors, fonts, etc).

When you first log into SonarQube Cloud, the default setting is the *Sync with system* theme. For existing users, the light theme is selected as the default option, but in both cases, you can select any of the three options:

* **Sync with system**: SonarQube Cloud detects the current system settings and uses the default dark or light theme accordingly.
* **Light theme**: The traditional light theme.
* **Dark theme**: A darkened appearance in which the UI text and content stand out while windows and controls appear to recede into the background.

If you change your mind later, you can change your selection by going to **User** > **My Account** > **Appearance** and switching to the theme of your choice.
