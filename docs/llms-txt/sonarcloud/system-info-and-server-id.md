# System info and server ID

### Viewing your system Info <a href="#system-info" id="system-info"></a>

The **System Info** page is found at **Administration** > **System**. It gives you access to detailed information on the state of your SonarQube Server instance.

You can browse details about your running instance on this page.

#### Downloading your system info <a href="#downloading-your-system-info" id="downloading-your-system-info"></a>

If you have a support contract, you might be asked by a support representative to send in your system info, which can be downloaded using the **Download System Info** button at the top.

### Getting your Server ID <a href="#server-id" id="server-id"></a>

If you want to switch to a another SonarQube Server edition, you will be asked by your sales representative to send in your Server ID.

Your server ID can be found at the top of the page **Administration** > **System**.

If you’re running a commercial instance, you can also find this value on the **License** page by going to **Administration** > **Configuration** > **License Manager.**
