# Reviews And Feedback

> Agent.ai provides a centralized place for builders to view, respond to, and manage feedback from users.

This includes both feedback left after individual agent runs and general feedback submitted by users outside of a specific run.

All feedback is accessible from the **Agent Builder → Reviews & Feedback** section.

## Types of Feedback

[Agent.ai](http://Agent.ai) supports two types of user feedback:

### Run Feedback

Run feedback is collected after a user runs an agent.

Users can leave:

* A thumbs up or thumbs down
* Optional written feedback tied to that specific run

This feedback helps builders understand how agents perform in real usage.

### General Agent Feedback

Users can also share feedback about an agent at any time, outside of a specific run.

This feedback is submitted through a dedicated feedback page accessible from the agent’s profile.

Users can find this option under:\
**Agent Profile → “Share Feedback with Builder”**

## Unified Feedback Dashboard

All run feedback and general agent feedback appear in one place.

You can find this dashboard in:\
**Agent Builder → Reviews & Feedback → User Feedback**

From this view, builders can:

* Review all feedback in a single feed
* See whether feedback is tied to a specific run
* Track open and resolved feedback items

## Responding to Feedback

When a user submits feedback:

* Builders receive an email notification with a direct link to the feedback
* Builders can reply directly from the Reviews & Feedback dashboard
* Users receive email notifications when builders respond

This allows builders to acknowledge feedback, ask follow-up questions, or provide updates.

### Resolving Feedback

Once feedback has been addressed, builders can mark it as resolved.

This helps:

* Keep the feedback inbox organized
* Track which items still need attention
* Maintain a clear feedback workflow over time

## Feedback Stats

The Reviews & Feedback section also provides high-level feedback metrics, including:

* Counts of positive and negative feedback
* Total feedback volume
* Review-related statistics at a glance

These metrics help builders monitor agent performance and user sentiment over time.

## Getting Started

To view feedback for an agent you’ve built:

1. Open the agent in the Agent Builder
2. Click the **Reviews** icon in the builder sidebar
3. Select the **User Feedback** tab
