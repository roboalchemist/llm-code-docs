# Data Security & Privacy at Agent.ai

> Agent.ai prioritizes your data security and privacy with full encryption, no data reselling, and transparent handling practices. Find out how we protect your information while providing AI agent services and our current compliance status.

## **Does Agent.ai store information submitted to agents?**

Yes, Agent.ai stores the inputs you submit and the outputs you get when interacting with our agents. This is necessary to provide you with a seamless experience and to ensure continuity in your conversations with our AI assistants.

## **How we handle your data**

* **We store inputs and outputs**: Your conversations and data submissions are stored to maintain context and conversation history.

* **We don't share or resell your data**: Your information remains yours—we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties.

* **No secondary use**: The data you share is not used to train our models or for any purpose beyond providing you with the service you requested.

* **Comprehensive encryption**: All user data—both inputs and outputs—is fully encrypted in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.

## **Third-party LLM providers and your data**

When you interact with agents on Agent.ai, your information may be processed by third-party Large Language Model (LLM) providers, depending on which AI model powers the agent you're using.

* **API-based processing**: Agent.ai connects to third-party LLMs via their APIs. When you submit data to an agent, that information is transmitted to the relevant LLM provider for processing.

* **Varying privacy policies**: Different LLM providers have different approaches to data privacy, retention, and usage. The handling of your data once it reaches these providers is governed by their individual privacy policies.

* **Considerations for sensitive data**: When building or using agents that process personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, health information, or company-sensitive information, we recommend:

  * Reviewing the specific LLM provider's privacy policy

  * Understanding their data retention practices

  * Confirming their compliance with relevant regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

  * Considering data minimization approaches where possible

Agent.ai ensures secure transmission of your data to these providers through encryption, but we encourage users to be mindful of the types of information shared with agents, especially for sensitive use cases.

## **Our commitment to your privacy**

At Agent.ai, we believe that privacy isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental right. Our approach to data security reflects our core company values:

**Trust**: We understand that meaningful AI assistance requires sharing information that may be sensitive or confidential. We honor that trust by implementing rigorous security measures and transparent data practices.

**Respect**: Your data belongs to you. Our business model doesn't rely on monetizing your information—it's built on providing value through our services.

**Integrity**: We're straightforward about what we do with your data. We collect only what's necessary to provide our services and use it only for the purposes you expect.

## **Intellectual Property Rights for Agent Builders**

When you create an agent on Agent.ai, you retain full ownership of the intellectual property (IP) associated with that agent. Similar to sellers on marketplace platforms (Amazon, Etsy), Agent.ai serves as the venue where your creation is hosted and discovered, but the underlying IP remains your own. This applies to the agent's concept, design, functionality, and unique implementation characteristics.

* **Builder ownership**: You maintain ownership rights to the agents you build, including their functionality, design, and purpose

* **Platform hosting**: Agent.ai provides the infrastructure and marketplace for your agent but does not claim ownership of your creative work

* **Content responsibility**: As the owner, you're responsible for ensuring your agent doesn't infringe on others' intellectual property

For complete details regarding intellectual property rights, licensing terms, and usage guidelines, please review our [Terms of Service](https://www.agent.ai/terms). Our approach to IP ownership aligns with our broader commitment to respecting your rights and fostering an ecosystem where builders can confidently innovate.

## **Compliance and certifications**

Agent.ai does not currently hold specific industry certifications such as SOC 2, HIPAA compliance, ISO 27001, or other specialized security and privacy certifications. While our security practices are robust and our encryption protocols are industry-standard, organizations with specific regulatory requirements should carefully evaluate whether our current security posture meets their compliance needs. If your organization requires specific certifications for data handling, we recommend reviewing our security documentation or contacting our team to discuss whether our platform aligns with your requirements.

## **Security measures**

Our encryption and security protocols are regularly audited and updated to maintain the highest standards of data protection. We implement multiple layers of technical safeguards to ensure your information remains secure throughout its lifecycle on our platform.

If you have specific concerns about data security or would like more information about our privacy practices, please contact our support team who can provide additional details about our security infrastructure.
