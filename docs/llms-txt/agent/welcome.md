## Do I have to be a developer to build AI agents?

Not at all! Our platform is a no-code platform, where you can drag and drop various components together to build AI agents.

Our builder had dozens of actions that can grab data from various data sources (i.e. X. Bluesky, LinkedIn, Google) and use any frontier LLM (i.e. OpenAI's 4o and o1, Google's Gemini models, Anthropic's Claude models, as well as open source Meta Llama 3s and Mistral models) in an intuitive interface.

For those users looking for can code and are looking for more advanced functionality, you can even use third party APIs and write serverless functions to interact with your agent's steps.
