# How Credits Work

> Agent.ai uses credits to enable usage and reward actions in the community.

## **Agent.ai's Mission**

Agent.ai is free to use and build with.

As a platform, Agent.ai's goal is to build the world's best professional marketplace for AI agents.

## **How Credits Fit In**

Credits are an agent.ai marketplace currency with no monetary value. Credits cannot be bought, sold, or exchanged for money. They exist to enable usage of the platform and reward actions in the communiuty.

Generally speaking, running an agent costs 1 credit.

You can earn more credits by performing actions like completing your profile or referring new users. Additionally, [Agent.ai](http://Agent.ai) replenishes credits on a weekly basis — if your balance falls below 25, we’ll automatically top it back up to 100.

If you ever do happen to hit your credit limit (most people won't) and can't run agents because you need more credits, let us know — we're happy to top you back up.
