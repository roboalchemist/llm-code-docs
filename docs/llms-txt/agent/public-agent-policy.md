# Policy for Public Agents

> This is the Agent.ai policy for publishing public agents. Below you’ll find the criteria your agent needs to meet to be published. Published agents can show up in search so other users can find and use them. This document should be viewed alongside our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

*Last updated May 14, 2025. Subject to change.*

## Public Agents need to meet our standards for Usability, Remarkability, and Safety (URS).

### **Usability** means that the agent:

* **Runs successfully**: executes its assigned tasks as described without bugs or crashes.
* **Has a clear and unique name**: Is easily found by users searching for something that does what it does. Avoids using trademarked terms without permission
* **Has a helpful description:** Explains expected user inputs, outputs, agent behavior and purpose
  * Ideally includes a short demo video.
* **Doesn’t break easily**:
  * Handles poor/incomplete inputs without failing
  * Handles errors gracefully via dependent APIs
  * Avoids brittle logic, (e.g. looks for LinkedIn handle, breaks when given a full URL.)
* **Is useful and formatted well**:
  * Provides output that is readable, helpful and aligned with the task (text, HTML, JSON, etc.)

### **Remarkability** means that the agent:

* **Is unique**: Isn’t a copy of another agent or serves a duplicate function of another agent already listed.
* **Has a purpose**: Solves a clear user problem or provides unique utility
* **Demonstrates value:**
  * Goes beyond a basic LLM call through thoughtful prompt design.
  * Adds novel methods, integrations, or problem-solving techniques not yet found on [Agent.ai](http://Agent.ai).
  * Incorporates your own perspective, unique insights or subject matter expertise to delight users.

### **Safety** means that the agent:

* **Avoids inappropriate language or content:** No prohibited content or behavior.
* **Is not spammy:** Doesn’t send emails or other messages without explicit user permission.
* **Asks for user consent:** Asks for explicit permission before collecting email addresses, user\_context, personally identifying information (PII) or before sending any data to a third party.
* **Does not aim to deceive:** Does not contain aggressive or deceptive calls to action or claims.
* **Respects user security:** Does not collect passwords, payment information, government IDs or other sensitive information.
* **Displays proper disclaimers if they’re related to regulated services**: Any agents that in fields like finance, legal, medicine, or other regulated industries must display a disclaimer.
* **Self-identifies honestly**: Doesn’t pretend to be human or hide its nature as an AI.

## Agents may be delisted if they:

* No longer meet the above criteria.
* Get too many bad reviews, recurring issues, or poor user feedback.
* Are changed in a way that violates our Terms of Service.
