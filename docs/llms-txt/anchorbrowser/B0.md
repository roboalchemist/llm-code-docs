# b0.dev - Deterministic Browser Tasks

> B0 makes browser automation easy. Just describe what you want to do, and B0 does it for you. No coding required.

B0 is the easiest way to automate anything on the web. Just tell B0 what you want to do in plain English, and it handles the rest.

# How B0 Works

B0 takes your prompt and runs the following process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Exploration">
    B0 passes the prompt to a dedicated exploration agent, which extracts the main goal of the task and break it down to different steps, as well as the expected output.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session Recording">
    Whether "Demonstrate Manually" was chosen or not, B0 creates a cloud [Session](/quickstart/use-via-code) and Record the interactions with the browser for later usage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deterministic Code Generation">
    B0 uses the interaction recordings from last step, and use them to generate a deterministic code, creates a [Task](/advanced/tasks) with that code, and run it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluation">
    B0 compares between the results of the 2 execution and determines whether the results are equivalent and summarizes it to the user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Information>
  The task created in the process is available in the [Tasks Page](/advanced/tasks) and from the SDK.
</Information>

## Manual Demonstration

This feature allows you to show B0 the flow you want manually, while recording, B0 analyzes what's done and with the context of the prompt, it will generate the deterministic code as expected.

## Core Advantages

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Reduced Costs" icon="dollar">
    Agent costs applied only on task creation. Any additional run doesn't require an agent involvement.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Works Every Time" icon="check-circle">
    B0 creates reliable automations that work consistently, for generating deterministic code.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Supported Authentication" icon="key">
    B0 is based on Anchor's SDK, which expose methods for [MFA handling](/advanced/mfa).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Need help?** B0 works best when you describe exactly what you want to do. Be specific about which websites, what actions to take, and what results you expect. You can also show B0 how to do it by demonstrating the steps yourself.
