# Create Your First Extension

## Create a new extension

Open the Create Extension command, name your extension "Hello World" and select the "Detail" template. Pick a parent folder in the Location field and press `⌘` `↵` to continue.

To create a private extension, select your organization in the first dropdown. You need to be logged in and part of an organization to see the dropdown. Learn more about Raycast for Teams [here](https://developers.raycast.com/teams/getting-started).

To kickstart your extensions, Raycast provides various templates for commands and tools. Learn more [here](https://developers.raycast.com/information/developer-tools/templates).
{% endhint %}

Next, you'll need to follow the on-screen instructions to build the extension.

## Build the extension

Open your terminal, navigate to your extension directory and run `npm install && npm run dev`. Open Raycast, and you'll notice your extension at the top of the root search. Press `↵` to open it.

## Develop your extension

To make changes to your extension, open the `./src/index.tsx` file in your extension directory, change the `markdown` text and save it. Then, open your command in Raycast again and see your changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
`npm run dev` starts the extension in development mode with hot reloading, error reporting and [more](https://developers.raycast.com/information/developer-tools/cli#development).
{% endhint %}

## Use your extension

Now, you can press `⌃` `C` in your terminal to stop `npm run dev`. The extension stays in Raycast, and you can find its commands in the root when searching for the extension name "Hello World" or the command name "Render Markdown".
