### Agents Platform

- **Conversation ID in Twilio/SIP webhooks**: The `conversation_id` is now included in webhook payloads when fetching conversation initiation client data for Twilio, SIP, and WhatsApp integrations. This enables real-time monitoring without polling the API to retrieve conversation IDs.
- **Agent versioning fields**: Agent response models now include `version_id`, `branch_id`, and `main_branch_id` fields (nullable strings) for tracking agent versions and branches.
- **Conversation version tracking**: Added `version_id` field to conversation models to identify the agent version used for each conversation.
- **Batch call enhancements**: The `BatchCallRecipientStatus` enum now includes `dispatched` status, and batch call responses include `total_calls_finished` field with improved defaults for tracking.

### Voices

- **Collection IDs**: Voice models now include a `collection_ids` field (array of strings, nullable) indicating which collections a voice belongs to.
- **Voice type filter expansion**: The `GET /v2/voices` endpoint now supports `saved` as a `voice_type` filter value for retrieving non-default voices that have been added to a collection.
