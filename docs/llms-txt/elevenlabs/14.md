### Agents Platform

- **LLM overrides**: Added support for overriding an agent's LLM during a conversation, enabling you to specify a different language model on a per-conversation basis. This is useful for testing different models or accommodating specific requirements while maintaining HIPAA and data residency compliance.
- **Post-call webhook failures**: Added the option to send post-call webhook events in the event of a phone call failure. This allows you to track and respond to failed call attempts through your webhook endpoint, providing better visibility into call issues.
