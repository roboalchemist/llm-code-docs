### Agents Platform

- **MCP pre-tool speech**: Added support for configuring tools extracted from an MCP Server to require pre-tool execution speech. This enhancement allows agents to provide verbal context before executing specific tools, improving the conversational flow during tool usage.

- **ElevenLabs hosted LLMs**: Added support for [ElevenLabs hosted LLMs](/docs/agents-platform/customization/llm#elevenlabs-experimental) which unlock lower latency by running on ElevenLabs infrastructure alongside Speech to Text and Text to Speech services.

- **Enum values for tool parameters**: Added support for specifying a tool's parameters as [enum values](/docs/api-reference/tools/create#response.body.tool_config.WebhookToolConfig.api_schema.request_body_schema.properties.LiteralJsonSchemaProperty.enum) for greater control

### SDK Releases

#### Python SDK

#### Package Updates
