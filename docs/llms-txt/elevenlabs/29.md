### v1 TTS model deprecation

The `eleven_monolingual_v1` and `eleven_multilingual_v1` models are deprecated and will be removed on December 15th, 2025. Please [migrate to newer models](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/models#deprecated-models) for continued service.

### Agents Platform

- **Workflow Expressions**: Workflows now support complex expressions that allow for defining deterministic conditions using logical operators, dynamic variables and LLM evaluation. This enables more sophisticated agent logic and decision-making capabilities.
- **MCP Server Interrupt Control**: Added option to disable interruptions during all tool calls for MCP Servers, providing better control over agent behavior during tool execution.
- **Audio Alignment Data**: Agents now have a flag to enable alignment data in audio events, useful for audio-text synchronization use cases such as lip sync applications.
- **Ignore Default Personality Setting**: The Agents Platform configuration page now includes a checkbox to toggle whether agents should ignore the default helpful personality, giving developers more control over agent behavior.

### Speech to Text

- **Fixed Base64 Encoding Flag**: Resolved an issue where the `is_base64_encoded` flag in STT responses was incorrectly set to false for PDF and DOCX formats, even when content was actually base64 encoded.

### SDK Releases

#### JavaScript SDK

- **v2.16.0**: Updated with latest API schema changes from September 19, 2025.

#### Packages

- **@elevenlabs/types@0.0.1**: New public TypeScript types package providing shared type definitions across ElevenLabs integrations.
- **@elevenlabs/react@0.7.0** and **@elevenlabs/client@0.7.0**: Added support for passing custom script paths to avoid blob: and data: URLs for improved security and flexibility.
- **@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed@0.3.0** and **@elevenlabs/convai-widget-core@0.3.0**: Added `use_rtc` attribute for widget functionality and added expand event support for better widget interaction handling.
