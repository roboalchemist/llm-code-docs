# Klarna search FAQ

## Updates, price files and information

### How can I fix incorrect information or the name of a particular product?

A lot of the information we display comes directly from the merchants. So, if you find an error, it’s quite probable that something is wrong in the merchant's product feeds. We would be grateful if you could report incorrect information to us via email.

### How can I change incorrect company information?

Please contact our customer support team and they will assist you.

### Why aren’t recently updated prices visible?

When a merchant makes a change to its site or in the price file, this means we have to import the file again before the changes are displayed. The file is imported automatically every day, but we can also schedule the file to be imported several times a day or do it manually straight away if you request it. If you’ve added/removed columns in a price file or rebuilt your site, this can cause our import of your file to not work as it should. That’s why it’s a good idea to be proactive and inform us of such changes in advance so we can adapt to them. Things you should know about price updates:

- Prices or product information that’s already visible will be updated immediately after we import the price file or site.
- It can take around 24 hours for new products to appear on the site after importing the price file.
- If you add or change products, categories or make other important updates, please let us know. We can then speed up the process and make sure everything runs as smoothly and correctly as possible.

Always consult with us before you restructure or make major changes to your site or price file.

### What happens if we change our price file or site without informing you?

If you simply add new products, categories or other existing information to the price file or on the site, this shouldn’t cause any problems. But if you make significant changes to the structure of your site/price file, there is a risk that products will disappear from our site or that there may be problems when we try to import the file or site. If you make changes in the field for each product's unique article number (SKU), this means that each product must be recreated in our database. As a result, this means the accrued popularity (number of clicks) for those products will disappear. Please always inform us if you’re planning major or important changes. We’ll then make sure that everything’s in order and runs as smoothly and correctly as possible.

### Why does it take a while before new products appear?

It varies how long it takes from a product being added to the website, or included in your price file, to become visible. This can depend on a range of things. It can take up to 24 hours before new products are displayed. And if these are completely new categories, it can take longer. If you add or change products, categories or make other important updates, it’s always best to let us know. We can then speed up the process and make sure it’s as smooth and correct as possible. We strongly recommend that you provide the manufacturer's barcode number (EAN) or article number (MSKU) in your price file or on your site. This means that matching to the right product on our site will be automatic, and that updates will be quicker.

### How often do you import our site or price file?

Your site or price file is imported 1-4 times per day. The number of times we import the file depends on how much system resources the data collection takes. If you have preferences about the times for importing the price file, we’re happy to accommodate these. Prices or information about products that are already live will be updated immediately after we import the price file or site.

### Why are several of our products missing images?

It might be that the links, which we load with your images, have stopped working. Or, if you’ve replaced the images on existing image links, we might need to re-upload them to our system. Another possible reason is that we simply don’t support your image format. Make sure you always have clear and correct product images, as this increases your chances of more clicks. Please contact us if you have problems with your images.

### Why are the prices on my products so far down the list?

The most likely explanation is that you either have a higher product price than many of your competitors, or that we have no shipping costs for the product. When price-sorting for products that include shipping costs, products without shipping costs always end up at the bottom. There are also products that we’ve not yet created a sorted price comparison for. These products are not sorted in ascending price order, but are instead based on, among other things, relevance.

### Why does the listing look different in certain categories?

We strive to display products in a way that users appreciate the most. This means that the default selection for some categories is in list view, primarily consisting of text. For other categories, the default selection for product images may have a more prominent position in a grid view. For all products where we have a price comparison, the standard setting is to show the lowest price at the top, excluding shipping costs. The products then follow in ascending order of price. Customers can always change how the list is sorted—for example, you can sort the list by lowest price including shipping costs, or by shortest delivery time.

## Searches and product categorization

### Why can't I find the product I'm looking for?

The easiest way to find what you’re looking for is to type your query in the search bar at the top of the site. You can enter the brand, model or type of product you’re looking for. A product can also be found in several categories, or within a different category from where the search leads to. 

### Why do our products sometimes end up in the wrong category?

We match every product category with the merchant to the category that has the best match. In some cases, the content of the merchant's category doesn’t mirror the title. For example, a category entitled "Mobile phones" can also include accessories for mobile phones. In this case, there is a risk that these will not be in the right category.  Be clear with your product categorization and make sure you don’t mix up product types. This is to avoid products ending up categorized incorrectly, or that they can’t be listed at all. Of course, we always strive to make sure that everything is correct, but we can’t guarantee 100% accuracy. If you think that a product is incorrectly categorized, simply contact us and we will try to find a solution.

## Clicks, tracking and conversions

### Why have all my products disappeared?

Of course, we have procedures to avoid this, but unfortunately we can’t guarantee that it’ll never happen. If a merchant disappears, it’s normally due to one of the following reasons:

- Your price file can no longer be found on the specified link.
- Your price file has changed in a way that means our import no longer works.
- Your site has changed in a way that means our import no longer works.
- Your categories have changed and now require new manual matching by us.
- You have reached your monthly spend limit.

Always consult with us before you restructure or make major changes to your site or price file.

### According to you, our store has received a certain number of clicks. Yet, why does Google Analytics show a different figure?

It’s common for data to be different in Google Analytics compared with our figures. This is because Google Analytics shows sessions and not clicks—and clicks are what we count and invoice for. This means that customers can click on several of your product links during a short period of time, and this will still be registered as a single session by Google Analytics. It’s very common for our users to click on more than one link from the same merchant—that’s why it’s not unusual to have more clicks than sessions. We also have protection against "robot clicks." This means that all clicks that take place within 10 seconds on a merchant’s product are always recorded as a single click in our systems.

### Why has the number of clicks to my shop reduced?

A reduction in traffic can have many different causes. A few of the common ones are:

- The number of products on your site or in your price file have been reduced, or the matching of the categories is problematic.
- Your products have insufficient information to be matched.
- There have been complications during the import of your site or price file.
- The number of competitors in your merchant's segment has increased and reduced your share of the total clicks.
- Your prices are no longer among the cheapest.

### Why do we generally have low conversions, or on particular products?

There are many different reasons for low conversions, and this often varies quite a lot from merchant to merchant. Feel free to contact us if you have questions about your conversions, and we can perform an analysis for your store. A few probable causes are listed below:

- The prices don’t match. If a higher price is displayed on the merchant's page, there’s a risk that the customer will abandon the purchase.
- The majority of our visitors use mobile. If your site is not customized for a mobile user experience, there’s a risk that visitors won’t purchase anything.
- It’s a hassle to pay. If the purchase process is complicated or unclear, or if you lack an established payment method, some visitors won’t buy from you.
- You charge additional fees. If there are shipping costs, handling charges or similar fees that aren’t visible, there’s a risk that the customer will abandon the purchase.
- Product information or images are unclear or incorrect.
- The stock status is not correct. If a product is shown as in stock but is out of stock on the merchant's homepage, the customer will probably find another merchant.
- Popular products that are out of stock can get lots of clicks despite being described as out of stock. This is sometimes because the customer wants to double-check that the stock status is correct.
- The customer may feel less confident in making a purchase because of an unprofessional impression of the page. 
- The company information on the merchant site is incomplete or poorly written.
- The requested delivery methods by the customer are missing.
