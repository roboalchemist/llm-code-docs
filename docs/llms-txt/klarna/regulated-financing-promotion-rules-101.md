**Examples of messaging that references monthly financing**(this list is not exhaustive).

- Pay over time with monthly financing.\* 

## If your ad refers to Pay in 4 and/or Pay in 30; AND monthly financing

## If your ad references payment terms or interest rates for financing.

If you list payment terms when referring to Klarna’s monthly financing products offered through Klarna’s partnership with WebBank, you need to understand the Truth-in-Lending Act. Please work with your legal and compliance teams to review the next sections carefully.

### The Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA)

You have to disclose important terms of credit to a consumer when you advertise Klarna’s financing products offered in partnership with WebBank. When advertising the terms of this type of credit, advertisements can only state terms that are *actually available*. When you mention specific terms of credit (called “*trigger terms*”), TILA requires you to provide specific information about the terms of the financing. This is referred to as a "*representative example"* of what a real loan might look like. This helps consumers understand what they are agreeing to.

### What are trigger terms?

The following are examples of trigger terms. If you use these, you need to provide a representative example.

- The periodic payment amount (e.g., \$60/every month). 
- The number of payments or period of repayment (e.g., 6 payments or 6 months).
- The amount of interest.
- The amount or percentage of any down payment.

### What aren’t trigger terms

The following words aren’t trigger terms. If you use them without the above mentioned trigger terms, you don’t need to include a representative example.

- Klarna.
- Monthly payments.
- Pay over time
- Financing
- Term loan
- Pay later.
- Pay in 4.
- Pay in 30 days.

### Representative example and disclosure

If you use a *trigger term,* you have to provide a (i) *<u>representative example</u>* and (ii) <u>*full* *disclosure*</u> to consumers. A **representative example** shows what a typical loan looks like and needs to include the following information:

- Monthly payment.
- Number of months.
- Total payment/purchase price
- Amount of any down payment.
- Representative Annual percentage rate

The **full disclosure** provides consumers with all of the information that they need to make an informed decision about the financing offer. It includes:

- Available APRs
- Important conditions and limitations Klarna's financing products offered in partnership with WebBank
- A clear range of payments so consumers understand how APRs affect their monthly payment.

#### Klarna financing (term loan) representative example:

For the closed term loan financing product, we have approved the following in the representative example. Please place the representative example on the same creative as the trigger term—in close proximity, and in a similar font size.

- A \$1,000 purchase might cost \$173.53 per month over 6 months at 13.99% APR.

#### Klarna financing (term loan) full disclosure:

You **must also include** the following full legal disclosure (1) on the asset, (2) at the bottom of the page connected with a signal, or (3) one click away.

- Rate ranges from 0.00%-35.99% APR based on creditworthiness, term length, and subject to credit approval, resulting in, for example, 3 equal monthly payments of \$333.33 at 0.00% APR to \$353.52 at 35.99% APR per \$1,000 borrowed.
