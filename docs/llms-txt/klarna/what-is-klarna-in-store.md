# What is Klarna In-store?

## Klarna Payments for physical stores brings the convenience and flexibility of Klarna's seamless payment solutions to your in-store shopping experience.

## Introduction to Scan QR

Klarna In-store offers a Scan QR solution that makes Klarna's payment options available in physical stores. Klarna transactions are initiated when a merchant presents a QR code to be scanned by the customer. Currently, we offer three flavors of Scan QR: dynamic QR, static QR, and payment link for self-generated QR codes.

## Dynamic QR

In the dynamic QR integration option, a merchant generates a QR code and sends it to a device placed in-store, for example, a payment terminal or a customer-facing screen. Dynamic QR is the optimal solution for:

- In-store payment service providers (PSPs), acquirers, and payment gateway providers
- self-checkout kiosks 
- point-of-sale (POS) system providers and merchants with customer-facing screens

## Static QR

If there’s no customer-facing digital device available in-store, the merchant places a printed static QR code close to the checkout. Static QR is the optimal solution for point-of-sale (POS) system providers and merchants without a customer-facing screen. A customer scans the QR code using their phone, either with the Klarna app or directly using the phone’s camera. Then, the customer completes the payment and an order is created in Klarna's systems and assigned an identifier.

## Payment link

If a partner wants to customize the size and the format of the QR code, they can use a payment link to generate their own QR code. This option is a good fit with payment terminal integrations.
