# Legal and privacy (AU)

<em>Australia</em> When adding Klarna payments to your site, you need to consider privacy and data sharing aspects, and ensure your customer-facing terms reflect the cooperation with Klarna.

## Terms and conditions

Ensure that your terms and conditions reflect your cooperation with Klarna.

## Compliance Requirements for your website

As a merchant using Klarna to transact with your customers, it is crucial to meet, among other things, legal requirements on the merchant's website to ensure transparency and compliance with applicable consumer protection laws. Before a customer completes its purchase on your website, you must present the following information in a clear and easily accessible manner on your website. Please note that it is not sufficient to require customers to first contact you to receive this information, nor delay providing it until after the transaction is completed. **Product or Service Description**

- Provide clear, detailed, and accurate descriptions of products or services, including essential characteristics, to ensure customer understanding. If you choose to include images or videos, they must also reflect a clear and honest representation of the products.

**Total Price and Payment Information**

- Clearly display the total price, including taxes, fees, and any additional charges (such as delivery or customs fees), and outline payment terms and available payment methods.

**Delivery and Performance Details**

- Specify estimated delivery times, shipping methods, and any geographical restrictions. For services, outline the timeline for service completion.

**Return and Refund Policy**

- Include a clear policy for returns, refunds, and exchanges, specifying conditions, timelines, and any associated costs.
- If the goods or services turn out to be faulty or do not look or work as advertised, you must offer remedies to the customer, such as repair, replacement, or refund. Clearly state in your return policy that you will cover return shipping costs for incorrect or faulty items.
- Clearly outline the types of products eligible for return, any exceptions (for example, perishable goods, digital downloads, custom-made items), and any specific conditions required (for example, in original packaging, with tags attached).
- Describe the steps for initiating a return, such as contacting customer support, completing an online return form, or including a printed return slip with the item. Provide return shipping instructions, including address or instructions for any return pick-up services offered.

**Customer Support and Dispute Resolution**

- Describe the process for resolving disputes directly through the merchant, such as submitting a complaint or request via email or an online form, and outline the expected response timeline. Provide contact information for customer support and outline any internal or third-party dispute resolution options.

**Digital Content or Subscription Details (if applicable)**

- For digital services, specify any limitations on functionality, compatibility, and duration of access. For contracts of fixed duration or subscriptions, specify the length and conditions for renewal and termination.

**Legal Rights and Warranties**

- Mention statutory warranty rights and any additional commercial guarantees if provided.

**Customer Reviews and Testimonials**

- Ensure all customer reviews and testimonials on your website are genuine and transparent by:
- not engaging in buying, selling, writing, or publishing fake reviews,
- not offering incentives for positive reviews,
- not suppressing or censoring negative reviews,
- disclosing any insider relationships within reviews,
- avoiding the creation of company-controlled review sites that falsely appear independent, and
- refraining from trading in fake social media influence indicators.

**Important Notice:** Non-compliance with these requirements may significantly impact the resolution of any disputes. Adhering to the guidelines listed above is essential for maintaining trust and accountability in your dealings with customers and ensuring a favorable outcome in dispute scenarios. **Klarna’s Buyers Protection Policy** Do not use Klarna’s Buyer’s Protection Policy in any promotional materials or website copy as an endorsement of the quality of your goods or your store.
