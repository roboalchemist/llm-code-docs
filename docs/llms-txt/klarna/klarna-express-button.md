# Express button

## Express button gives shoppers a fast and convenient way to buy with Klarna.

## How does Express button work?

When a customer click on the Express button and successfully signs in, they will be redirected to checkout with:

- Pre-filled customer and address data
- Default shipping method (first available by sort order set in **Admin Stores**\> **Configuration**\> **Sales**\> **Delivery Methods**)
- Klarna as a preselected payment method

The checkout experience is designed and optimized for the Klarna payments integration flow.
