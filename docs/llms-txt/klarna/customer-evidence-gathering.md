# Customer evidence gathering

## In this article, you'll find a clear guide on what evidence customers need to raise a dispute.

When a customer raises a dispute, they need to provide Klarna with valid evidence to support their claim. The specific information required varies based on the nature of the dispute (dispute reason) to ensure it's relevant to the issue at hand. If the necessary evidence is provided and the matter isn't resolved within the set timelines, an investigation might be initiated.

## Report a problem

Once the customer has agreed to the conditions to raise a dispute Klarna will request further information regarding the Merchant contact. In this step, the customer provides Klarna with a basic Proof of contact.

| Question | Response |
|--------|--------|
| “When did you contact the store?” | ( not possible to select dates before capture ) |
| “How did you contact the store” | * Sent an email or text message * Through phone * Written communication * On Seller website |
| “What was the store’s response?” | * Store agrees to assist with my problem * Store was not available * Store’s response was not as expected * Store was not able to help |
| “Proof of contact & response” | ( recommended but not mandatory at this stage of the process ) |

Once the customer has provided Klarna with a basic Proof of Contact they need to provide information specific to their problem. Below is a breakdown per dispute reason.
