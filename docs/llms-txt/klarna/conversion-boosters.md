## On-site messaging

OSM enables you to add tailored messaging to your website and turn visitor into shoppers by delivering messages like Klarnas’ flexible payment options or incentivising products like Deals, Rewards Club. With OSM you can let shoppers know about the different payment options you have available as they browse your website. Knowing what financing options are available early on can influence the purchase decision. In this app you can find three sections:

### Placements

In the placements page you can choose the different messages you want to include in your website. You can choose messages by store (if you have more than one), country and language. In the placements tab, under each option for the different messages, you also have the possibility of customising according to the ‘look and feel’ of your own website. That way, it will be fully integrated to what you already display in it. You can choose font, color and size of the text.
