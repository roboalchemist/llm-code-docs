# Check the details of a customer token

## Use the Klarna payments API to check the status and details of the payment method linked to a customer token.

## Get customer token details

To get the details of a customer token, send a `GET` request with an empty request body to the `{apiUrl}/customer-token/v1/tokens/{customerToken}` endpoint. Provide the customer token as a `customerToken` path parameter.

### Success response

### In response to your call, you'll receive the customer token's status and the details of the associated payment method.

``` json
{
"card": {
"brand": "VISA",
"expiry_date": "12/2020",
"masked_number": "**1234"
},
"direct_debit": {
"masked_number": "**124"
},
"payment_method_type": "INVOICE",
"status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

A success response to the check customer token details request.

### Error response

### ​If the customer token in your request is invalid, you'll get an error response. Make sure that the `customerToken` in the path matches the `token_id` of the token you \[ created earlier\].

You can use the value in `correlation_id` to find entries related to the request in **Logs** in the Merchant portal.

``` json
{
"correlation_id":   "6a9b1cb1-73a3-4936-a030-481ba4bb203b",
"error_code":   "NOT_FOUND",
"error_messages":   [
"Invalid customer-token ID"
]
}
```

An error response to the check customer token details request.
