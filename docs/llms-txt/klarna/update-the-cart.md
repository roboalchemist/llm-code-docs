# Update the cart

## If your customer updates their shopping cart or if you make any changes to payment details, you have to update the payment session before creating an order.

## Updating the cart before authorization

When the customer modifies the content of their shopping cart before authorization, you can update a payment session in two steps.

1.  Send a `POST` request to the [`{apiUrl}`](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/other-actions/update-the-cart/)`/payments/v1/sessions/{sessionID}` endpoint.
2.  Send a l`oad()` call to make the changes visible to your customer.

### 1: POST API request

To update the payment session, send the updated order details in a `POST` request to the [`{apiUrl}`](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/other-actions/update-the-cart/)`/payments/v1/sessions/{sessionID}` endpoint.

The `sessionID` path parameter must match the session identifier (`session_id`) you got in response to the [create session request](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/step-1-initiate-a-payment/).

``` json
{
"order_amount": 998,
"order_tax_amount": 0,
"order_lines": [{
"type": "physical",
"reference": "19-315",
"name": "Battery Power Pack",
"quantity": 2,
"unit_price": 499,
"tax_rate": 0,
"total_amount": 998,
"total_discount_amount": 0,
"total_tax_amount": 0
}]
}
```

A sample request to update the details of a Klarna payments session.

### Success response

If the request is successful, the Klarna payments session is updated and you'll receive a `204 No content` response.

### Error response

If your request contains errors, you'll receive an error response.

``` json
{
"correlation_id":   "6a9b1cb1-73a3-4936-a030-481ba4bb203b",
"error_code":   "ERROR_CODE",
"error_messages":   [
"ERROR_MESSAGE"
]
}
```

An error response to the update session request.

Here are examples of common errors with troubleshooting suggestions. You can use the value in `correlation_id` to find entries related to the request under **Logs** in the Merchant portal.

| Error code | Error message | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `BAD_VALUE` | `Bad value: order_tax_amount` | The tax details in the request aren't aligned with [the rules for tax handling](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/additional-resources/error-handling-and-validations/tax-handling/). |
| `BAD_VALUE` | `Bad value: order_lines` | Some of the order line details don't follow our guidelines or violate API field restrictions. Refer to the [Klarna payments API reference](https://docs.klarna.com/api/payments/) for details. |
| `BAD_VALUE` | `Bad value: purchase_currency` | `purchase_currency` is incorrectly formatted or doesn’t match locale. This may occur if the customer updates their billing address, causing `country` to be updated. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | `Invalid session id` | The session identifier specified in the path can't be found. Make sure the value in `sessionID` has the correct value and try again. |

### 2: A load() call

​​To show the updated order details to your customer, send the updated details in a `load()` call to Klarna.

``` javascript
Klarna.Payments.load({
container: "#klarna_container",
payment_method_categories:[
{
"asset_urls": {},
"identifier": "klarna",
"name": "Pay with Klarna"
}
] },
{
"purchase_country": "GB",
"purchase_currency": "GBP",
"locale": "en-GB",
"order_amount": 20,
"order_tax_amount": 0,
"order_lines": [{
"type": "physical",
"reference": "19-402",
"name": "Battery Power Pack",
"quantity": 2,
"unit_price": 10,
"tax_rate": 0,
"total_amount": 20,
"total_discount_amount": 0,
"total_tax_amount": 0
}]
}
, function(res) {
console.debug(res);
})
```

A `load()` call to update the order details.

​Learn how to handle [responses to the load() call](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/step-2-checkout/#display-klarna-load-responses).

## Updating the cart after authorization

If your customer updates the cart after the `authorize()` call, you can share updates with Klarna in two ways:

- If the Klarna widget is still displayed to the customer in the browser, send a new `authorize()` call with updated details to start a new risk and fraud assessment process.

In response to a successful `authorize()` call, you'll get a new `authorization_token`. Make sure to use the new token to place an order.

- If your checkout solution lets the customer change the order details after payment, for example, on an order review page, you have to re-authorize the session. In this case, a Klarna widget is typically not displayed, meaning you can't authorize the purchase in the standard way with `init()`, `load()`, and `authorize()` calls. A `reauthorize()` call can handle this and any necessary customer communication in fullscreen modals.

We recommend you display modals launched during re-authorization as the customer might need to provide some input to complete the purchase.
