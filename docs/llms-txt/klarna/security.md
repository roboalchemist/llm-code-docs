## Security banners at checkout

As part of our ongoing commitment to **provide a secure and trusted shopping environment**, Klarna has introduced informational banners in the purchase flow of selected merchants.  These banners are designed to sustain consumer confidence and safeguard shopping experiences, all without interfering with your checkout processes or payment options. Here's what you need to know:

### New store

If your store is relatively new or still being evaluated by Klarna, a banner may appear to inform customers. This is simply to indicate that we are in the process of verifying your store’s product quality and return policies.  **What you can do**

- Make sure your contact information, along with your shipping and return policies are easy to find  on your website.
- Get to know Klarna's [Merchant Protection Program](https://x.klarnacdn.net/cdn-klarna-com/1.0/shared/content/policy/shipping/en_us/MerchantProtectionTerms.pdf) for more tips and best practices.''

### Elevated complaints

Merchants experiencing a higher than average dispute rate will have a banner displayed as a caution to customers. **What You Can Do**

- Review your dispute resolution and customer service practices.
- Ensure your policies on shipping and returns are clearly displayed on your website.
- Check out [Klarna's Dispute &amp; Returns Improvement Guide](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/after-payments/disputes/dispute-returns-improvement-guide.md) for additional advice on enhancing your dispute management and customer satisfaction.

### Banner removal

The banners **will automatically be removed once the underlying reason has been mitigated**. For merchants labeled as 'Unverified', this will occur after we have gathered enough data and for those with elevated disputes, improvement in errand rates will lead to banner removal.

## Web security is important

Your store is your brand, your identity, and the first place of contact with your customers. If it isn't secure, business relationships can be compromised. A single security breach can be a death knell for your business. Hackers have multiple ways of threatening your store:

- Infecting a website with malware and spreading it to site visitors
- Stealing sensitive customer information, for example, names, email addresses, credit card details, and other transaction information
- Adding the website to a botnet of infected sites
- Hijacking or crashing the site

Security breaches affect your customers, you, and your business. Breaches can incur high fines, penalties, and other costs. Your business can only be successful if you build up trust and a vital relationship with your customers. Even if a security incident doesn't cause a data breach, it can have a huge impact on customer trust. When you're of the risks and consequences of inadequate web security, you know that you must take measures to secure your store. All businesses, no matter the size, can fall prey to an attack. Hackers use automated tools to find vulnerable sites and they don’t differentiate between small, mid, and enterprise businesses. Threats and attacks are everywhere, so be prepared now.

## General security guidelines

- Keep all your software up to date by always installing the latest patches. This applies to everything: the operating system, the web server, frameworks, and plug-ins.
- Scan for security problems if a scanner is available (for example, [<https: www.magereport.com="">](https://www.magereport.com/) for Magento).
- Be selective about granting admin rights to user accounts.
- Delete accounts of employees or contractors that no longer work for you, as well as any unknown accounts.
- Don’t share the same account between users so that you can link actions to a specific person.
- Use strong passwords consisting of 10 or more characters.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if possible.
- Enable logging of admin actions in your store's software.
- Monitor suspicious admin activities.
