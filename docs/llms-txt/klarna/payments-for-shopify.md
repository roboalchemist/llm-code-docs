# Klarna Payments for Shopify

## Integrate Klarna Payments into your Shopify store using the Klarna Payments app to offer region-specific payment options with a single Merchant ID and supported currencies.

### Direct integration

The Klarna Payments app on Shopify adds Klarna as a direct, additional payment method, for all Klarna payments regions, supported by Klarna. To integrate Klarna as an alternative payment method with your store, please [follow the integration steps from Klarna.Docs](https://docs.klarna.com/platform-solutions/e-commerce-platforms/shopify/payments/how-to-install-klarna-payments-on-shopify). This integration allows your store to be connected to a single Klarna Merchant ID. Klarna will only be available to customers in the locations configured on your Klarna Merchant ID. The Klarna Payment options (Pay in 4, Pay in 3, Installments, etc.) that will be visible to your customers are determined by market availability.

- See the [list of regions supported by Klarna](https://docs.klarna.com/klarna-payments/in-depth-knowledge/puchase-countries-currencies-locales).

You will only be able to offer Klarna in the base currency of your Shopify store - multiple currencies on a single Shopify store are not supported. European merchants can support multiple currencies if enabling [Klarna for Shopify Payments](https://docs.klarna.com).
