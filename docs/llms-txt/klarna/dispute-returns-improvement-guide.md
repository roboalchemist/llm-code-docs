## Returns

Returns are an inevitable part of the purchase lifecycle. Handling them well ensures that customers maintain trust in you, the Merchant, and Klarna while minimizing errands and disputes. Below you, the Merchant, will find best practices for handling returns and fees, and providing customers up front information and communication.

### Improving Customer Return Experience

To enhance your customer's return experience and prevent disputes, we recommend implementing the following steps:

- **Self-Service Return Option**: Always offer a self-service return option with clear instructions. This could include: - A return label in the package - A QR code on the confirmation page with a prepaid label
- **No Return Fees:** Never charge fees for returns.
- **Domestic Return Address:** Always provide a local return address.
- **Prompt Return Registration:** Register the return as soon as you receive it.
- **Confirmation Email:** Send a confirmation email immediately after the customer registers the return. This email should include: - Date of return receipt - Item(s) returned - Expected refund amount - Refund method - Expected refund timeline
- **Clear Return Information:** Display your return policy and a FAQ section about returns prominently on your website. This should cover: - Items eligible for return - Return process - Expected refund timeline
- **Responsive Customer Service:** Ensure your Customer Service team can respond to inquiries within 2 business days and are well-versed in return information: - Return process - Reasons for return denial - Return registration confirmation - Expected refund timeline

By following these steps you, the Merchant, can make the return process more transparent and user-friendly, leading to improved customer satisfaction and fewer disputes.

## Goods Not Received

In the world of online shopping, providing accurate and transparent information to customers is paramount. This section emphasizes best practices for you, the Merchant, including tracking information sent to customers, efficient order handling, and the importance of effective communication on your website. By prioritizing these aspects, you can significantly improve customer satisfaction, reduce disputes, and enhance their operational efficiency.

### Preventing Goods Not Received Experiences 

Prioritizing well organized order and delivery handling can help prevent goods not received, thus reducing errands and disputes. We recommend the following best practices:

- **Quick Delivery:** Deliver items to customers within 20 days of order date.
- **Accurate Order Capture:** This should occur at the time of shipment. If you send multiple packages (partially fulfill the order), capture the amount for only the sent items.
- **Thorough Cart Page:** The cart page is a great first place for customers to get shipping information such as: - Shipping options and costs - Additional shipping or customs fees - Estimated arrival time
- **Send Confirmation Emails:** Providing information to customers upfront can reduce errands. It is best practice to send customers confirmation emails when: - Order has been placed (order confirmation) - Order has been shipped
- **Share Tracking ID:** Providing customers with a traceable tracking ID empowers them to track orders independently. Tracking ID can be made available to customers either via: - Order confirmation email - Order shipped email
- **Clear Shipping Information:** Share easy-to-locate details for customers to check. We recommend clearly stating in your website’s Frequently Asked Questions: - Order processing time prior to shipment - Typical shipping timeline - Typical delivery timeline per country / region - How you provide the tracking ID
- **Effective Goods Not Received Support**: Give customers the ability to easily report goods not received issues. We recommend: - Providing the reporting process via a dedicated email address or user-friendly form - In website FAQs, explain how customers can report a problem or return and its process - In website FAQs, inform customers when and how to contact Klarna
- **Knowledgeable Customer Service:** Ensure your representatives respond to inquiries within 2 business days and that they can provide: - Order and delivery confirmations - Expected delivery timelines / tracking ID - How to report issues with you - When and how to contact Klarna

## Faulty Goods

Faulty products, or significant deviations, can taint the shopping experience and negatively impact customers trust in you, the Merchant, and Klarna. In this section we highlight key areas for you, the Merchant, to ensure product quality and customer satisfaction. Accurate product descriptions, a precise definition of faulty goods, and a simple reporting process empower customers to make informed decisions. Through evidence submission and swift resolution, partners should address issues efficiently, either offering refunds or replacements.

### Avoiding Issues with Faulty Goods

The following best practices will help drastically reduce customer complaints around faulty goods disputes:

- **Accurate Product Descriptions**: Provide detailed and accurate product descriptions, including specifications and high-quality images. This information should be visible to customers while shopping and during checkout.
- **Define Faulty Goods:** Provide a clearly stated policy that defines faulty or defective goods and explain how you handle these situations.
- **Provide Reporting Process**Customers should be able to easily report faulty or defective goods: - Through their account. - By contacting your customer service.
- **Swift Resolution:** You should swiftly process customer requests for faulty products by: - Issuing a refund. - Sending a replacement at your own expense
- **Customer Service Support**Your customer service should be responsive and provide a first response within 2 business days to address any questions or concerns about product quality, incorrect items, and refund confirmations. You should be able to take necessary actions to correct any issues.

## Incorrect Invoice

When customers purchase online it’s important to be transparent and ensure that they know what they are paying for. When a customer has completed their order, they do not want any surprises when they see the invoice later on. Customers need to understand what items have been added to the cart. In the event of upselling you, the Merchant, has to make sure that the customer is aware of what is happening, can see the added products and prices in checkout. If hidden fees are added to the total order amount, or if it’s not clearly stated that a discount has been added, questions will most likely be directed to Klarna and you, the Merchant. Not only does this confuse customers, it can also make them lose trust as they might feel that they have been fooled. Because of this, it’s important for you, the Merchant, to ensure a detailed checkout summary. By following these best practices the partner can reduce both operational costs and disputes. 

### Ensuring accurate invoices

The following best practices will help drastically reduce customer invoice questions and incorrect invoice disputes:

- **Remove Out of Stock Items:** It is best practice to regularly update your website to reflect current item availability. To help customers further, you could show an estimated item restock time and provide a notification option.
- **Ensure Accurate Checkout:** Clearly present goods before checkout and include: - Accurate items, pictures, descriptions, sizes, quantities, and prices - Accurate order total with any discounts, promotions, or fees listed - Note of any upselling and ability to skip or remove
- **State Subscription Services:** If you offer subscription services, we suggest clearly stating this prior to purchase completion to prevent canceled orders and disputes.
- **Prevent Duplicate Orders**: Implement necessary security measures during the checkout process. Confirm successful order submission with a confirmation pop-up or message.
- **Send Order Confirmation Email:** Soon after order completion, send a confirmation email to customers with an order summary showing: - Order number - Accurate items, pictures, descriptions, sizes, quantities, and prices - Accurate order total with any discounts, promotions, and fees listed - If shipping in multiple packages, note that this will create multiple statements with the Klarna order
- **Send Accurate Orders to Klarna:** Send Klarna the same item names, photos, and order details shown on your website and in your order confirmation emails. This ensures accurate expectations and avoids errands and disputes.
