# Klarna On-site messaging app for Shopify

## Learn how to display Klarna’s On-site messaging in your Shopify store.

[Klarna On-site messaging](https://apps.shopify.com/klarna-on-site-messaging) (OSM) is a free, public app available in the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/). This app allows you to add customized promotional messaging and inform your customers about their purchase power with Klarna before reaching the checkout. You can use the Klarna OSM app with any Shopify + Klarna integration that uses a Shopify theme, for example, a \[ direct integration\], [Shopify Payments](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/shopify-payments/local-payment-methods/klarna), or [Mollie](https://help.mollie.com/hc/en-us/sections/12840599723666). If you’ve integrated Klarna through [Global-e](https://www.global-e.com/klarna-partnership), you need to install Klarna OSM manually as the Klarna OSM app doesn’t support this integration method. Before you install and configure the On-site messaging app, [integrate Klarna with your Shopify store](https://docs.klarna.com/platform-solutions/e-commerce-platforms/shopify/payments/ways-to-integrate-on-shopify) either directly through Klarna as an alternative payment method, or through another integration option. To preview the app’s integration and functionality, take a look at the video available [in the Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/klarna-on-site-messaging).

Please test to verify that product prices are correctly updated within the Klarna On-site messaging, specifically when different priced variants are selected. The placement should be refreshed by the app when the variant is updated by the customer, but this feature isn’t compatible with some themes.
