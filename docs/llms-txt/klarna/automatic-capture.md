# Automatic capture

## What is automatic capture (auto-capture)?

By default, all transactions successfully completed via Klarna Payment direct integrations will be finalized with an order created but not captured. This means that the customer has successfully completed a purchase but has not actually been charged for the order. In order to comply with Klarna's shipping policy and remain covered by the [Merchant Protection Program](https://www.klarna.com/international/merchant-protection-program/) , all orders should only be captured at the time of order fulfillment. In specific segments, orders are immediately fulfilled, and the final customer will gain access to their purchase on the spot. This is common for digital products or services. The automatic capture allows businesses in these particular categories to capture and charge the customer immediately at the time of purchase confirmation.

## Categories and exceptions allowed to use auto-capture

Usage of automatic capture is restricted to the following use cases and business categories:

- In-store
- Digital products
- Vouchers
- Services & Events
- Fulfilment of order within 24 hours from order creation

**Merchants associated to any other category not mentioned above are required to get explicit approval from Klarna in order to implement it.** Multiple categories that are allowed to use automatic-capture are also required to send [addition information](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/additional-resources/use-cases/extra-merchant-data.md) based on the corresponding category.

## Integration considerations

In order to enable automatic capture of an order, it is required to include `auto_capture`property in the `create_order` request and set it up to `true`**true**

### Integration via PSPs or Platforms

Note that every partner may enable different support and configuration processes to enable and disable auto-capture. In particular cases, if the capability is enabled by default, you will be required to disabled it in order to be compliant with the requirements in Klarna's [Merchant Protection Program](https://www.klarna.com/international/merchant-protection-program/). Please see \[ here\] the specific documentation for the corresponding partner to understand particular requirements.
