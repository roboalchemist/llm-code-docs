# Cooperation agreement complementary conditions

## These clauses ensure that the cooperation agreement remains robust and adaptable, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and fostering a resilient partnership.

When entering into a partnership with Klarna, a well-structured agreement lays the foundation for a successful, collaborative business relationship. In this page you will find additional provisions that clarify the original agreement and addresses specific scenarios.

## Stop order/fraud or suspicious circumstances

 In the event Klarna discovers fraud or suspicious circumstances relating to a transaction, Klarna may instruct the Merchant to stop the order process and/or shipping. The Merchant agrees to follow Klarna’s instructions immediately upon receipt, so long as such instructions are provided within twenty-four (24) hours of Capture of the applicable Claim. The Merchant shall notify the Customer of any stop request at the Customer’s contact details (e.g. email address, telephone number and/or address) as approved by Klarna at the time of order.

### Repayment for Claims involving related parties

Klarna has the right to be repaid by the Merchant for any Claim that arises from a transaction involving a person or entity reasonably considered to share a financial interest with the Merchant. This includes, but is not limited to, affiliated companies, as well as any owner, board member, senior executive, or employee of the Merchant or its affiliates.

This repayment obligation does not apply where the transaction was conducted in the ordinary course of business, on commercially reasonable terms, and in the absence of any indicators suggesting an improper purpose, a conflict of interest, or fraud, as determined by Klarna in its sole discretion.

## Security Interests in the Claim

The Parties agree that when the Claim is created Klarna shall be exclusively entitled to all security interests related to the Claim, e.g. any retention of title in the goods delivered. For clarity, if a Claim is retransferred from Klarna to the Merchant, all security interests relating to such Claim will also be retransferred. 

## Service Charges for Direct, Card, and Other Non-Integrated Transactions

The Service Charges will be applicable to all Claims that are Captured via (i) a direct API Integration (Direct); (ii) a one-time use virtual card Integration (Virtual Card); (iii) a Klarna -branded card product (such card and Virtual Card together are referred to herein as a Card); or (iv) any other payment solution outside of the Integration (together with a Card, a Non-Integrated Transaction). Unless otherwise stated in the Agreement, for Non-Integrated Transactions, Merchant will pay the Service Charge(s) as set forth in the Agreement irrespective of the indicated Integration type.

<span>For any Claims that are processed as payment network transactions (i.e. Visa), such Claims will be processed  pursuant to the terms and conditions of applicable third party operators of payment networks (Third Party Payment Option Providers), and the terms and conditions of any applicable agreement(s) between Merchant and its acquiring bank. The Merchant will be responsible for any interchange or similar processing fees charged by the applicable Third Party Payment Option Provider related to the use of commercial credit or debit products in connection with the Shopping Solutions.</span>
