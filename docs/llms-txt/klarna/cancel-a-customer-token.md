# Cancel a customer token

## You can cancel a customer token if it's no longer needed, for example, if a customer cancels their subscription.

Once you cancel a token, it becomes unavailable and you can't restore it. If the customer signs up for your services in the future, you'll need to generate a new customer token.

## Cancelling a token

To cancel a customer token, send a `PATCH` request to the [`{apiUrl}`](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/web-payments/integrate-with-klarna-payments/other-actions/cancel-a-customer-token.md)`/customer-token/v1/tokens/{customerToken}/status` endpoint. Specify the token identifier as the `customerToken` path parameter and set the `status` body parameter to `CANCELLED`.

``` json
{
"status": "CANCELLED"
}
```

A sample request to cancel a customer token.

### Success response

In response to your call, you'll get a confirmation that the token is being canceled.

``` json
Token patch request has been accepted and is being processed.
```

A success response to the token cancelation request.

### Error response

If a token can't be canceled, you'll get an error response.

``` json
{
"correlation_id":   "6a9b1cb1-73a3-4936-a030-481ba4bb203b",
"error_code":   "ERROR_CODE",
"error_messages":   [
"ERROR_MESSAGE"
]
}
```

An error response to the token cancelation request. Here are examples of common errors with troubleshooting suggestions. You can use the value in `correlation_id` to find entries related to the request under **Logs** in the Merchant portal.

| Error code | Error message | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `NOT_FOUND` | `Invalid token ID` | A specified token doesn't exist. Check if the value in {`customerToken`} is correct, then try again. |
