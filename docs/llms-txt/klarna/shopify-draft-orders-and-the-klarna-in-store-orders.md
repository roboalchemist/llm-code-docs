# Shopify draft orders and in-store orders

## Enable Klarna payments for in-store purchases by creating Shopify draft orders and sending customers an invoice to complete payment through the online checkout.

Shopify doesn’t yet support alternative payment methods, like Klarna, to directly integrate into [Shopify's Point of Sale sales channel](https://www.shopify.com/pos/features#Payments). Customers in store can still easily pay with Klarna using Shopify draft orders. Here’s how you can process an In-store order:

1.  Create a [Shopify draft order](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/create-orders) for a customer (with optional customer details prepopulated) with the desired products. Don't select **Paid**.
2.  Email the invoice to the customer from the Shopify draft order admin page using the **Send invoice** button, either from the draft order or **Payment due later** order.
3.  The customer then can pay for the draft order via your Shopify store's Online Store sales channel using your store's Shopify web checkout and choose Klarna or any other payment option available in checkout.
