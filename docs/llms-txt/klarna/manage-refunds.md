# Manage refunds in-store

## Learn how to process refunds for in-store purchases.

## Manage refunds using API

Klarna returns an order identifier (`order_id`) as part of the distribution results. You’ll need `order_id` to refund the purchase using the [Order management API](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/after-payments/order-management/manage-orders-with-the-api/refund-orders-and-manage-authorizations/).

#### Best practices

- Use the `Klarna-Idempotency-Key` HTTP header when implementing refunds through the API, in order to prevent duplicate refund requests at the point of sale from happening in case of network issues.
- Include the `order_lines[]` for the items to be refunded if included in the payment session initially.

We recommend you store the Klarna `order_id` and link it to the transaction reference number generated by the point of sale and stored as the `merchant_reference1` parameter. You can also print the transaction reference number on the customer’s receipt.

Customers who want to get a refund for an in-store purchase have to present the receipt. The store associate can retrieve the transaction reference and enter it on the point of sale device, which can then derive the Klarna `order_id` and the order amount required to submit a refund using the Order management API.

## Manage refunds in Merchant portal

Another element to add to the receipt is the shorter Klarna reference value (`klarna_reference`) returned in the distribution results. The store associate can use this value to find the corresponding transaction directly in **Orders** in the [Merchant portal](https://docs.klarna.com/payments/after-payments/order-management/manage-orders-in-the-merchant-portal/navigate-the-orders-dashboard/).
