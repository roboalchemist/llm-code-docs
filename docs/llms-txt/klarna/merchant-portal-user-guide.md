# Merchant Portal Homepage

Klarna’s **Merchant Portal** is the online platform where you will be able to manage all of the details associated with your Klarna account, from managing orders, downloading settlement reports, searching for marketing assets or displaying the on-site messaging on your platform. Depending on how you were onboarded to Klarna, you might not be able to see all the apps available within the portal. The portal is connected via API with your own e-commerce platform, which means that any action performed in an order in your backend, will be communicated automatically to the portal, making the management easier and more efficient. In that way, you don't need to modify your normal order management process.  Be aware that any action performed manually in Merchant Portal, won’t be reflected in your backend.

## Overview

Access to Merchant portal tools are enabled via 3 main areas as highlighted in the following image:
