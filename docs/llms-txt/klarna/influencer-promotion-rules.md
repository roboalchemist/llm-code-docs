# Influencer promotion rules

## If you use social media influencers, bloggers, or other third parties to advertise Klarna and your business, there is more you need to know!

When social media influencers, bloggers, or other individuals receive any type of payment to endorse or otherwise mention a product (called an **“endorsement”**), they are required to disclose the existence of the relationship on the post where the endorsement was made. The commercial relationship must be made clear and clearly labelled or identifiable as paid-for content. The relevant labels/ terms will vary depending on the type of relationship with the influencer, it is imperative to follow the Klarna marketing guideline and toolkit (links below).  For clarity we’ve included a brief summary of the Klarna approved terms below. Please note they should always be CAPITALISED and prominent. Positioning of the term varies depending on media platform and format, all details available in the Influencer marketing whitepaper. See below link for more information. 

| Term | Definition |
|----|----|
| \[ADVERT\] | Paid deliverable with a level of editorial control by brand. Post featuring a gifted product whereby the influencer has had a monetary relationship with the brand in the last 12 months. |

| \[GIFTED\] | Organic gifting by brand.No editorial control. Not guaranteed to post. No previous monetary relationship in the last 12 months. |
