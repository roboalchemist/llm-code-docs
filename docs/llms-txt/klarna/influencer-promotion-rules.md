# Influencer promotion rules - United Kingdom

## Ensure influencer promotions in the UK comply with Klarna’s guidelines by updating FRN references, clearly disclosing paid endorsements, and using the approved tools and terms from Klarna’s influencer marketing resources.

<em>Important: Update to Klarna’s Firm Reference Number</em> Klarna Financial Services UK Ltd is now authorised by the FCA as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) under FRN 1021834, replacing our previous FRN 987816. To remain compliant please ensure you update all FRN references in all consumer-facing touchpoints; including websites, social content, checkout messaging, and legal disclosures. When social media influencers, bloggers, or other individuals receive any type of payment to endorse or otherwise mention a product (called an **“endorsement”**), they are required to disclose the existence of the relationship on the post where the endorsement was made. The commercial relationship must be made clear and clearly labeled or identifiable as paid-for content. The relevant labels/ terms will vary depending on the type of relationship with the influencer, it is imperative to follow the Klarna marketing guideline and toolkit (links below).  For clarity, we’ve included a brief summary of the Klarna approved terms below. Please note they should always be CAPITALISED and prominent. Positioning of the term varies depending on media platform and format, all details are available in the Influencer marketing whitepaper. See the below link for more information.
