# Considerations for Conversion boosters with Adyen

## Klarna On-site messaging

Use Klarna’s On-site messaging to raise awareness of Klarna's flexible payment options and other benefits throughout the shopping journey. With only a few lines of code, you’ll have our dynamic messaging up and running in no time. And the result? You’ll get an uplift in average order value, improve conversion, and expand your customer base.  Klarna On-site messaging isn’t currently integrated by Adyen, but you can add it by following the [Klarna documentation](https://docs.klarna.com/on-site-messaging). You’ll have access to **On-site messaging** in the Klarna Merchant portal. For more information, reach out to Klarna partner support.

## Express button

Simplify the checkout experience and give your customers a fast and convenient way to shop with Klarna, even if it’s their first time visiting your website. Adding our Express button is an effortless way to increase conversion.  Express button isn’t currently integrated by Adyen, but you can add it by following the [Klarna documentation](https://docs.klarna.com/express-button.md). For more information, reach out to Klarna partner support. When integrating Express button, don’t collect the customer’s billing address again as Klarna will provide the details back to you via a callback.

## Branding

For a smoooth post-purchase experience, the right brand configuration is a must. If you want to update your store's branding information, you can do so through the Klarna merchant portal.
