# Partner marketing legal guidelines - Rest of the world

​​​**Keep it simple.** Don’t lose a customer because the payment instructions were too complicated, but do make it clear what you are offering. **Stand out for the right reason.** Highlight the payment option you offer, but be sure to be clear, fair and not misleading. **Be sensitive to the situation.** Consider what is going with your customers and in the wider market as a whole. Use this knowledge to decide how you promote and market Klarna in all your channels. One message does not fit all circumstances. **Don't encourage debt.** Do not encourage shoppers to spend outside of their means. Using phrases such as *‘strapped for cash?’*, *‘don’t wait until payday’* or *‘broke AF’* are unacceptable and irresponsible. You have an obligation to ensure your customers stay financially healthy. **﻿Make sure your ads are socially responsible to consumers and society.** Offers or benefits should not be linked to credit marketing which are likely to make the credit offer attractive.
