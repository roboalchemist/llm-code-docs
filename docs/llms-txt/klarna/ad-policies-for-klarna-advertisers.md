# Ad policies for Klarna advertisers

## Overview

This Advertising Legal and Ethical Policy (“Policy”) applies globally to all Klarna advertising properties, including the Klarna App, Klarna.com, and any other Klarna owned channels (hereinafter “Klarna Properties”), and to all ads served through our advertising partners, and all ad types and implementations.  All creatives, advertisements and other material subject to this Policy must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Klarna is not responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, although advertisers may be required to submit documentation from an attorney affirming such compliance if deemed necessary by Klarna. While Klarna requires its advertisers to comply with this Policy, the content of the advertisements is the advertiser's responsibility. The advertiser is responsible for ensuring that all product claims, warranties, guarantees, discounts, pricing claims, or other assurances comply with applicable laws and regulations. **By placing the advertisements, the advertiser assumes all liability for and arising from the advertisements. **

## Ad review and enforcement

All ads that run on Klarna properties may be subject to automated and/or manual review to assess compliance with this Policy.  Repeated or serious violations of our policies may result in termination or suspension of your privileges to place advertising on Klarna Properties. Klarna reserves the right at any time, in its sole discretion, to deny approval, revoke approval, and/or require the elimination or revision of any advertisement or campaign. Klarna reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time without prior notice.

## Privacy policies and data protection requirements

### Privacy policies

In accordance with IAB 3.0 standard terms: *XII. f. Privacy Policies*. Agency, Advertiser, and Media Company will post on their respective Web sites their privacy policies and adhere to their privacy policies, which will abide by applicable laws. Privacy Policies are required on all advertiser landing pages as well as on other pages of an advertiser's website that specifically collect personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address) or other advertising related information.

### Data collection within advertising

Collection of Personal Information from within ad creatives, unless there is prior authorization and appropriate disclosure and notification to users is strictly prohibited. Where Personal Information is collected on a landing page, users should be directed to a secure landing page for such data collection. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

## Third party and intellectual property rights

### General

Advertisers are responsible for not infringing or violating the intellectual property rights or any other rights of third parties. Klarna reserves the right to remove any ads that we suspect may violate a third party’s intellectual property or other rights in our sole discretion. If you believe your trademark or copyright has been used improperly by an advertiser, please reach out to merchant@klarna.com.

### Klarna intellectual property

Use of any Klarna intellectual property, including logos, trademarks, brand names on advertiser’s creatives and linking urls without express permission is prohibited. Requests may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Advertising content policy

All copy must be legible, clear, and accurate so the consumer has sufficient and factual information prior to engaging with the content. 

### Anti-discrimination

Advertising (ad text, images, videos, links and/or landing pages) that misrepresents, ridicules or attacks an individual or group on the basis of age, color, national origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or cognitive, sensory or physical disabilities, or otherwise violates this Policy or any anti-discrimination laws in any region in which the advertisement is shown is strictly prohibited. Discovery of violations of this provision may result in immediate termination of your privileges to place advertising on Klarna Properties.

### Community guidelines

Advertising that promotes or displays violence, crime or obscenity or other forms of anti-social behavior, or is otherwise not in good taste, is not acceptable. Advertisements may not use disparaging language or imply that use of the advertised product or service will help avoid compliance with a law or promote illegal activity.

1.  Advertising that features defamatory, libelous or threatening content or language is not acceptable.
2.  Advertising that features potentially offensive content or language is not acceptable. This includes but is not limited to:

- Ads and landing pages that leverage fear, tragic events, or salacious content.
- Ads and landing pages that use inflammatory language or images that exacerbate sensitive social issues, incite hatred, or are fundamentally misleading or inaccurate.
- Ads and landing pages that leverage sensitive or controversial political or cultural topics to promote commercial products or offers.
- Ads that use race baiting, bigotry or similarly offensive techniques.
- Viscerally impactful images such as close up images of medical conditions or unattractive conditions the product is meant to treat, blood, body parts, or bodily fluids.
- Vulgar or offensive words or phrases.

*Advertising that is associated with extreme user irritation, including but not limited to negative user feedback, may be removed from Klarna Properties and platforms without notice at Klarna’s sole discretion. *

### Competitive or comparative messaging

Negative or unlawful competitive, comparative, or anti-competitive messaging is not acceptable. Messaging must be relevant and can indicate advantages (competitive features, pricing etc) of your product over a competitor’s. However, any messaging that contains disparaging content or otherwise violates comparative advertising laws and regulations is not acceptable.

### Sweepstakes and contests

Random draw sweepstakes and skills contests may only be promoted if the contest/sweepstakes (i) does not constitute an illegal lottery, (ii) is only open to consumers over the age of majority (typically 18+) in the region in which the promotion occurs and (iii) otherwise complies with all applicable country, federal and state laws. Such programs include random drawings, trivia contests, word games, spelling bees, essay contests and photography contests. Advertisements for contests and sweepstakes must clearly and conspicuously disclose the material terms and conditions of participating and must not be false, deceptive or misleading. All promotions must clearly disclose that no purchase is necessary when legally required (e.g., United States).

### Prices and savings claims

If an ad promotes a percentage savings, such as 10% off, the landing page should reflect the exact same offer (10% off) and not just the money savings. If the offer is only available for a selected range of products, this should be specified in the copy/ad itself to prevent consumers from being misled into thinking the offer applies to all products for that merchant. Offers that use seasonal messaging should only be used during the relevant promotional period, such as “Mother’s Day offers”, “Easter Deals” or “Back-to-School offers.” If the offer has a start and end date, those dates should be provided in the copy or offer terms and conditions. The landing page for the offer must also include any additional exclusions, limitations, or terms that are necessary for the consumer to be fully informed regarding what is being offered. 

### False or misleading claims

Any and all advertising claims should be truthful, not deceptive or likely to deceive a consumer, accurate and substantiated. False or misleading claims are not acceptable. Advertisers may be asked to provide third-party substantiation to support certain claims. Klarna advises against using aggressive language or language that creates a sense of urgency for purchasing, such as “Hurry” or “Offer ends soon.” **Consumers should not be encouraged to spend outside of their means.**The ad should further not suggest or imply that a product is available if that product is not actually available at that time, or sold out. Advertisers may not falsely claim or imply affiliation with another business, government entity, manufacturer, or association. All ad components must be accurate and relevant to the ultimate offer. Landing pages must lead to a fully functional web page that renders properly on all devices. Landing pages must directly relate to both the ad text and the product that is ultimately offered to consumers. Don’t mislead users with the ad text, image or video, or the “sponsored by” label or any combination of the elements. Images or videos must be relevant, recognizable, and appropriate to the advertised product. There should be a clear, simple, and logical link between the supplied image or video and the ad message to users.

### Advertising to minors

Klarna’s primary payment products are designed for users over the age of 18. Klarna does not permit the intentional serving of advertisements to consumers known to be under 18.

### Call To Action (CTA)

A clear and concise CTA should be used to inform the consumer of the expected user journey after clicking on the ad. A CTA is not always required when on the Klarna website or mobile app, however it is advised for larger placements, such as hero placements or larger banners that have less restrictive space. 

### Language

All copy and CTAs in ads shall be in the primary language of the locale in which they appear. All copy should use proper grammar and spelling. 

### Price reductions

Any announcement of a price reduction/discount for a specific product should follow applicable laws and indicate the prior price. The prior price means the lowest price available for that product during a period of time not shorter than 30 days prior to the application of the price reduction or any period required by applicable law in the jurisdiction where the advertisement appears.

### Promotion of credit or financial services

Promotion of credit or other financial services is ***strictly prohibited*** on all Klarna Properties.

### Deal and promotion terms

If an ad includes a deal or promotion, the essential terms and conditions for such a deal or promotion should be clearly and conspicuously presented either in the ad itself, or available on the landing page one click away. Essential terms and conditions may include the maximum available discount amount, minimum spending limit, or restrictions on available dates, and any other information which could affect the consumer’s decision to make a purchase. 

### Labeling and disclosures

It should be clear that the ad is an advertisement and marked respectively so consumers understand that this is a paid placement. When adding a specific disclosure to an ad to clarify a claim, always ensure any such disclosure is prominent and easy for a consumer to understand and includes all significant conditions.

### Age of the audience

Klarna offers its products and services to consumers who are older than 18. Therefore, ads and disclosures must be directed at the consumers 18+ years old.
