# Enterprise Platform 0.8.0 Release Notes

June 13th, 2025

## Features

- The telemetry sink now supports connecting through AWS MSK using IAM. To make use of this, make sure to annotate the service account with the appropriate role and define GRAFBASE_KAFKA_MSK_REGION, and do not specify GRAFBASE_KAFKA_PASSWORD and GRAFBASE_KAFKA_USERNAME.
- The opentelemetry-collector section of the values now supports a KAFKA_MSK_REGION env var to achieve the same effect. Just like for telemetry-sink, annotate the service account with the right role and refrain from specifying GRAFBASE_KAFKA_PASSWORD and GRAFBASE_KAFKA_USERNAME if you want to connect to MSK.

## Breaking changes

- The telemetry sink secrets no longer contain GRAFBASE_KAFKA_USERNAME and GRAFBASE_KAFKA_PASSWORD by default. They were previously set to "grafbase", in case you want to restore the default behaviour.
- The opentelemetry-collector section of the values no longer has defaults for KAFKA_USER, KAFKA_PASSWORD and KAFKA_SASL_MECHANISM. The previous values were "grafbase", "grafbase" and "PLAIN" respectively.
