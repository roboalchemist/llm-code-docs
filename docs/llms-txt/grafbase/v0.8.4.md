# Enterprise Platform 0.8.4 Release Notes

August 1st, 2025

## Breaking changes

- This release defaults to version 0.6.0 of the API and 0.5.0 of the dashboard. Previously, the dashboard was initializing the Zitadel state directly with the Zitadel API. Now it does this using the Grafbase API. The api service now handles all communication with the Zitadel API, and now uses REST instead of gRPC to do so. It is important that you do not upgrade major version on one component and not the other with this jump.

## Improvements

- The API now uses the Zitadel REST API instead of gRPC, which will make it work in more varied environments.
