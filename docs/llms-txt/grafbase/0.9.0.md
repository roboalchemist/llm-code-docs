# Enterprise Platform 0.9.0 Release Notes

August 27th, 2025

## Breaking changes

- Four subcharts in the enterprise-platform chart were Bitnami charts: postgresql, minio, kafka, and clickhouse. The images used by these charts [will no longer be maintained by Bitnami, as of 2025-08-28](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164). These subcharts are mostly useful for proof of concepts. Often, you will want to use your own postgres / S3 / kafka / clickhouse infrastructure instead.

### Migration Strategy

To address the Bitnami image deprecation, we've created custom Helm charts for these accessory services:

- **Custom charts created** for PostgreSQL, Kafka, and ClickHouse to have full control over configuration and avoid external dependencies
- **Replaced MinIO chart** with the official MinIO chart from `https://charts.min.io/`
- All services now use official Docker images from their respective projects

### Migration from Bitnami Charts

To address the Bitnami deprecation, the following changes have been made:

1. **PostgreSQL**: Custom chart created (replacing `bitnami/postgresql`)
   - Uses official PostgreSQL Docker image (`postgres:17`)
   - Simplified configuration with direct environment variables
   - Maintains compatibility with existing service names and connection strings
   - Supports Helm hooks for proper deployment ordering

2. **Kafka**: Custom chart created (replacing `bitnami/kafka`)
   - Uses official Apache Kafka Docker image (`apache/kafka:3.9.0`)
   - Configured for KRaft mode (no Zookeeper dependency)
   - Single-node configuration for simplicity
   - Automatic node ID assignment based on pod hostname

3. **ClickHouse**: Custom chart created (replacing `bitnami/clickhouse`)
   - Uses official ClickHouse Docker image (`clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.11`)
   - Configuration via environment variables to avoid read-only filesystem issues
   - Simplified user and database setup
   - Service naming remains compatible (`{{ release }}-clickhouse`)

4. **MinIO**: Migrated from `bitnami/minio` to the official MinIO chart from `https://charts.min.io/` (v5.4.0)
   - Configuration changes:
     - `auth.rootUser` → `rootUser`
     - `auth.rootPassword` → `rootPassword`
     - Service configuration structure has changed

### Required Configuration Updates

Users upgrading from v0.8.x will need to update their values files:
- PostgreSQL values remain largely compatible, but hook annotations can now be configured
- Kafka configuration simplified to essential settings (replicas, storage, resources)
- ClickHouse configuration simplified to auth settings (username, password, database)
- MinIO configuration must be updated to match the new chart structure
- The duplicate `replicated-supportbundle` secret template has been removed from the main chart
