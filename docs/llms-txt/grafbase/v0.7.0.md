# Enterprise Platform 0.7.0 Release Notes

June 11th, 2025

## Improvements

- The object storage (formerly known as GDN) story is brought to parity between the enterprise platform and hybrid deployments. A new service called `object-storage` is introduced. It serves graph schemas (for use with the --graph-ref argument of the Gateway) and trusted documents from the assets bucket, checking for access tokens. To take advantage of it, make sure you use version 0.40.0 or above of the Gateway and set the `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_URL` environment to the URL of the new object-storage service. See the [charts section of the docs](https://website-git-tomhoule-nspykwntrykn.grafbase-vercel.dev/docs/platform/self-hosting/charts/api) for reference documentation on the service and the new `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_REGION` and `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` values.

## Breaking changes

- The RUNTIME_ASSET_STORAGE and AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME values for configuration are deprecated. Point to the S3-compatible bucket to use with `GRAFBASE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME` and any combination of the environment variables.
