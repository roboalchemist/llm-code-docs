# Enterprise Platform 0.10.0 Release Notes

October 1st, 2025

## Breaking changes

- The chart will now be hosted on Docker Hub (docker.io). All the replicated resources and image pull secrets are gone in this release.
- To configure the required imagePullSecret, a new top-level value is introduced. To use an image pull secret, set `enabled: true` and provide the `dockerconfigjson` field, then add the secret to each subchart's imagePullSecrets array:

```yaml
imagePullSecret:
  enabled: true
  name: grafbase-image-pull-secret
  dockerconfigjson: "<base64-encoded-dockerconfigjson>"

api:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: grafbase-image-pull-secret

dashboard:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: grafbase-image-pull-secret

telemetry-sink:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: grafbase-image-pull-secret
```
