# Members

Note: As of March 31, 2020, the `members` endpoint replaces the `sponsors` endpoint, which is now deprecated and will no longer be supported on or after September 30, 2020. API clients should update calls to the `sponsors.list` method to use the `members.list` method instead.   

This endpoint can only be used by individual creators to make requests for their own, channel-memberships-enabled YouTube channel. Reach out to your Google or YouTube representative to request access.

A **member** resource represents a channel member for a YouTube
channel. A member provides recurring monetary support to a creator and receives special
benefits. For example, members are able to chat when the creator turns on members-only mode for
a chat.

## Methods

The API supports the following methods for `member` resources:

[list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/members/list)
:   Lists members (formerly known as "sponsors") for a channel. The API request must be authorized by
    the channel owner.

For example, this occurs with members who have deleted their channels but are still paying for memberships. Note that these members can still access their membership benefits. <br /> API responses include resources for those members to ensure accurate counts even though the profile details inside the `memberDetails` object are not set. The [membershipsDetails](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/members#snippet.membershipsDetails) are still provided for such members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The [snippet.membershipsDetails.membershipsDurationAtLevel[]](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/members#snippet.membershipsDetails.membershipsDurationAtLevel[]) property then contains a list of objects that contain details about a period of the membership during which the member had access to a particular membership level. <br /> The following example shows how these properties work: A member purchases a new membership in January at membership level 1 and has that membership until March. In April and May, the member does not have a membership. In June, the member restarts their membership, again at level 1. Then, in August, the member upgrades their membership to level 2. So, if an API call is made in October, the `member` resource would contain the following: ``` "membershipsDetails": { "membershipsDuration": { "memberSince": "2020-06-01T12:00:00", "memberTotalDurationMonths": 7, }, "membershipsDurationAtLevel": [ { "level": "level_1_ID", "memberSince": "2020-06-01T12:00:00", "memberTotalDurationMonths": 7 }, { "level": "level_2_ID", "memberSince": "2020-08-01T12:00:00", "memberTotalDurationMonths": 2 }, ] } ``` |

In other words, the member has continuously had a membership since this date and time. Note that different periods of the membership might have been spent at different membership levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
