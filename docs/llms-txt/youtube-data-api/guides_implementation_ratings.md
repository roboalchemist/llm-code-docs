# Implementation: Ratings

The following examples show how to use the YouTube Data API (v3) to perform functions related to video ratings.

## Rate a video

Call the [videos.rate](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/rate) method to submit a user's rating for a video. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.

Set the following two parameters in your request:

<br />

- The [id](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/rate#id) parameter specifies the YouTube video ID of the video that is being rated (or having its rating removed).
- The [rating](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/rate#rating) parameter specifies the rating that the user authorizing the request wishes to record. Valid parameter values are `like`, `dislike`, and `none`. The first two values set a rating, and the third removes any rating that previously existed for the user.

<br />

The sample request below gives a positive (like) rating to the video of the keynote speech at the 2014 Google I/O conference:  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.videos.rate?
        id=wtLJPvx7-ys
        &rating=like
```

## Retrieve the current user's rating of a video

The [videos.getRating](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/getRating) method lets you retrieve the currently authenticated user's rating of one or more videos. In your request, set the [id](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/rate#id) parameter's value to a comma-separated list of YouTube video IDs for the resources for which you are retrieving rating data. Note that this request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.

The sample request below retrieves the current user's rating of the video of the keynote speech at the 2014 Google I/O conference. (If you executed the previous example in the APIs Explorer, the API response should indicate that the rating is `like`.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.videos.getRating?
id=wtLJPvx7-ys
```

## Retrieve videos rated by the current user

The `videos.list` method's [myRating](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list#myRating) parameter lets you retrieve a list of videos rated by the user authorizing the API request. The parameter value indicates whether you want to retrieve liked or disliked videos.

The sample request below retrieves a list of videos to which the current user gave a `like` rating. The request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.videos.list?
part=snippet
&myRating=like
```  
**Note:** You can also retrieve a list of the user's liked videos (but not disliked videos) by following the flow for [retrieving a channel's favorite videos](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/ratings#favorites). In step 1 of that process, instead of retrieving the playlist ID for the channel's favorite videos, retrieve the playlist ID for the channel's liked videos. The `contentDetails.relatedPlaylists.likes` property contains the value.  

Thus, the API allows you to retrieve a list of videos that the user liked using either the `videos.list` method or the `playlistItems.list` method. Since different information is returned in a `video` resource than a `playlistItem` resource, you can choose the method that best suits your needs.
