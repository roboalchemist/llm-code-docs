# Implementation: Search requests

The following examples demonstrate how to complete several different types of search requests in the v3 API.

## Videos

This example calls the [search.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) method to find the most viewed, high-definition (HD) videos associated with the query "skateboarding dog." The query sets the `order`, `part`, `q`, `type`, and `videoDefinition` parameters.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?
        part=snippet
        &order=viewCount
        &q=skateboarding+dog
        &type=video
        &videoDefinition=high
```

See the [search.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#usage) method's documentation for code samples.

## Playlists

This example shows how to find playlists matching the query term "GoogleDevelopers." It calls the [search.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) method and sets the [type](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#type) parameter's value to `playlist` so that the result set only includes playlists.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?
        part=snippet
        &q=GoogleDevelopers
        &type=playlist
```

## Channels

This example shows how to find channels matching the query term "travel." It calls the [search.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) method and sets the [type](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#type) parameter's value to `channel` so that the result set only includes channels.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?
        part=snippet
        &q=travel
        &type=channel
```

## Results relevant to a specific language

This example calls the [search.list](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) method to find search results that are most relevant to a specific language. The example shows that the query term is **marine** (`q=marine`) and that the API response should contain results most relevant to the French language (`relevanceLanguage=fr`).  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?
        part=snippet
        &q=marine
        &relevanceLanguage=fr
```

Note that the request does not set a value for the `type` parameter, which means each search result could reference a video, playlist, or channel.

## Videos uploaded via the developer's app or website

This example shows how to use the [forDeveloper](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list#forDeveloper) parameter to restrict a search to only retrieve videos uploaded via the developer's application or website. This parameter can be used in conjunction with optional search parameters, like the `q` parameter.

**Note:** This query does not actually return results in the APIs Explorer because the APIs Explorer doesn't support video uploads. You can run this query for your own application outside of the APIs Explorer, but you can't get results for *your* application using the APIs Explorer.

Each uploaded video is automatically tagged with the project number that is associated with the developer's application in the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

When a search request subsequently sets the `forDeveloper` parameter to true, the API service uses the request's authorization credentials to identify the developer. Thus, a developer can restrict results to videos uploaded through the developer's own app or website but not to videos uploaded through other apps or sites.  

```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.search.list?
        part=snippet
        &q=fun
        &forDeveloper=true
```
