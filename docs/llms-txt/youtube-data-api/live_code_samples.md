# Use Cases and Code Snippets

This page lets you explore common use cases for the YouTube Live Streaming API and YouTube Data API.

When you select a resource and method, the table below updates to display a list of common use cases, including a description of each use case, for that method. In addition:

- You can click on a use case name to populate the API Explorer widget with sample parameter and property values for that use case.
- You can click the code icon (![](https://developers.google.com/site-assets/platform-html-color.svg)) next to any sample name to open the fullscreen APIs Explorer and populate it with the sample values for that use case. The fullscreen APIs Explorer shows working code samples for Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and `curl`.
