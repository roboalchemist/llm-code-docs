# Implementation: Partial responses

The following examples show how to retrieve partial API responses in the YouTube Data API (v3).

**Note:** The API's [getting started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#partial) guide provides more detail about partial requests and responses.

The v3 API allows, and actually requires, the retrieval of partial resources so that applications avoid transferring, parsing, and storing unneeded data. This approach also ensures that the API uses network, CPU, and memory resources more efficiently.

The API supports two request parameters, `part` and `fields`, that enable you to identify the resource properties that should be included in API responses. The `part` parameter also identifies the properties that should be set by API requests that insert or update resources.

Note that if an update request does not specify a value for a resource property that previously had a value, the existing value will be deleted if the following conditions are true:

- The property's value can be modified by the request. (For example, when updating a `video` resource, you can update the value of the `snippet.description` property, but you cannot update the value of the `snippet.thumbnails` object.

- The request's `part` parameter value identifies the resource part that contains the property.

#### Example

For example, suppose you want to update the `video` resource shown below. (Note that all of the properties shown below can be updated via the API, and resource properties not relevant to the example have been omitted.)  

```
{
  "snippet": {
    "title": "Old video title",
    "description": "Old video description",
    "tags": ["keyword1","keyword2","keyword3"],
    "categoryId: 22
  },
  "status": {
    "privacyStatus": "private",
    "publishAt": "2014-09-01T12:00:00.0Z",
    "license": "youtube",
    "embeddable": True,
    "publicStatsViewable": True
  }
}
```

You call the [videos.update](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/update) method and set the `part` parameter value to `snippet`. The body of the API request contains the following resource:  

```
{
  "snippet": {
    "title": "New video title",
    "tags": ["keyword1","keyword2","keyword3"],
    "categoryId: 22
  }
}
```

This request updates the video's title, deletes its description, and does not change its tags or category ID. The video's description is deleted because the request does not specify a value for the `snippet.description` property.

The properties in the `status` object are not affected at all because the `part` parameter value did not include `status` as one of the parts that the request would update. In fact, if the body of the API request included the `status` object, the API would return a `400 (Bad Request)` HTTP response due to an [unexpected part](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/errors#youtube.api.RequestContextError-badRequest-unexpectedPart) being included in the request body.
