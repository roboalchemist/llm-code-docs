# Implementation Guide

This series of guides explains how to use the YouTube Data API (v3) to perform many different types of functions. It includes descriptions, pointers to code samples, and links that populate the APIs Explorer with sample queries.

In reading this guide, please remember that:

- Whenever possible, sample v3 API queries link to and populate the APIs Explorer with the values shown in the queries. These examples help you easily submit test queries and see sample responses.

- Some of the sample requests do require authorization. There is a small widget near the top of the APIs Explorer form that enables OAuth 2.0 authorization.

- To use the YouTube Data API in your application, you must first [obtain authorization credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).
