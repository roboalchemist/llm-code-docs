# Quota and Compliance Audits

The YouTube Data API uses a [quota system](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/determine_quota_cost) to ensure that developers use the service as intended and that they don't create API clients which unfairly reduce service quality or limit access for others.

Projects that enable the YouTube Data API have a default quota allocation of 10,000 units per day, an amount sufficient for
the majority of our API users. You can see your quota usage on [Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) page in the Google API Console.

If you would like to request additional quota beyond the default allocation, you must first complete an audit to show that your project is in compliance with the [YouTube API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies). This gives YouTube visibility into the intended use cases of large projects and ensures that YouTube's API services are being used in a manner that is free from abuse. Visit [this link](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide) for additional details on complying with YouTube's Developer Policies.
