# Choose your use case

With our no-code tools, you can build agents for these use cases:

1. **Chat:** Answer questions with tailored responses based on topics, personas, or data.
2. **Text generation:** Collect specific user inputs and generate customized outputs. Best for long- or short-form structured content, such as blog posts, FAQs, press releases, and newsletters.
3. **Research:** Conduct web research and receive a structured report.

Define the structure of the agent by outlining the inputs (the information you provide) and the outputs (the content you receive).

Here are some input and output examples:

## Chat

**Inputs:**

* User queries about specific topics (for example, "What are your store hours?")
* User requests for assistance (for example, "Help me track my order.")

**Outputs:**

* Direct answers to user queries (for example, "Our store hours are 9 AM to 9 PM, Monday through Friday.")
* Assistance responses and guidance (for example, "I can help you track your order. Please provide your order ID.")

## Text generation

**Inputs:**

* Content briefs or outlines that specify the topic you want to write about, the SEO keywords and a CTA you want to include.

**Outputs:**

* Completed text that includes SEO keywords and the specific CTA

## Research

**Inputs:**

* Questions or briefs about the topic that you want to research.
* Whether the research should perform a general search of the web or limit the search to specific sources.

**Outputs:**

* A summary of the information found, including links to the sources.
