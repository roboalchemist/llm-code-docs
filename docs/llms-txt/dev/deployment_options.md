# Compare deployment options

> Choose between Standard Cloud and Private Cloud deployment for Writer. Compare security, compliance, scalability, and enterprise features.

Writer's platform is purpose-built for the enterprise, designed to provide security, compliance, and scalability to support AI deployments at an enterprise scale. We currently offer two managed platform deployment options: **Standard Cloud** (default) and **Private Cloud** deployment at a fee. Each option comes with tailored features to suit diverse operational needs.

In both deployment models, Writer prioritizes data privacy and rigorous protection standards. We offer fully managed application lifecycle management, including monitoring, scaling, and high availability (99.9% uptime). We also adhere to global privacy laws and security standards such as GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 Type II, PCI, and HIPAA.

Across all deployments, customer data is:

* Encrypted in transit and at rest
* Retained only for the duration necessary to fulfill service requirements
* Not used for model training, testing, or improvements
