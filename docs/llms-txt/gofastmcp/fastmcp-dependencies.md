# `fastmcp.dependencies`

Dependency injection exports for FastMCP.

This module re-exports dependency injection symbols from Docket and FastMCP
to provide a clean, centralized import location for all dependency-related
functionality.

DI features (Depends, CurrentContext, CurrentFastMCP) work without pydocket
using a vendored DI engine. Only task-related dependencies (CurrentDocket,
CurrentWorker) and background task execution require fastmcp\[tasks].
