<Update label="v2.13.0" description="2025-10-25">
  **[v2.13.0: Cache Me If You Can](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.13.0)**

  FastMCP 2.13 "Cache Me If You Can" represents a fundamental maturation of the framework. After months of community feedback on authentication and state management, this release delivers the infrastructure FastMCP needs to handle production workloads: persistent storage, response caching, and pragmatic OAuth improvements that reflect real-world deployment challenges.

  💾 **Pluggable storage backends** bring persistent state to FastMCP servers. Built on [py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value), a new library from FastMCP maintainer Bill Easton ([@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate)), the storage layer provides encrypted disk storage by default, platform-aware token management, and a simple key-value interface for application state. We're excited to bring this elegantly designed library into the FastMCP ecosystem - it's both powerful and remarkably easy to use, including wrappers to add encryption, TTLs, caching, and more to backends ranging from Elasticsearch, Redis, DynamoDB, filesystem, in-memory, and more! OAuth providers now automatically persist tokens across restarts, and developers can store arbitrary state without reaching for external databases. This foundation enables long-running sessions, cached credentials, and stateful applications built on MCP.

  🔐 **OAuth maturity** brings months of production learnings into the framework. The new consent screen prevents confused deputy and authorization bypass attacks discovered in earlier versions while providing a clean UX with customizable branding. The OAuth proxy now issues its own tokens with automatic key derivation from client secrets, and RFC 7662 token introspection support enables enterprise auth flows. Path prefix mounting enables OAuth-protected servers to integrate into existing web applications under custom paths like `/api`, and MCP 1.17+ compliance with RFC 9728 ensures protocol compatibility. Combined with improved error handling and platform-aware token storage, OAuth is now production-ready and security-hardened for serious applications.

  FastMCP now supports out-of-the-box authentication with:

  * **[WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos)** and **[AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit)**
  * **[GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github)**
  * **[Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google)**
  * **[Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure)** (Entra ID)
  * **[AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito)**
  * **[Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0)**
  * **[Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope)**
  * **[Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit)**
  * **[JWTs](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#jwt-token-verification)**
  * **[RFC 7662 token introspection](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#token-introspection-protocol)**

  ⚡ **Response Caching Middleware** dramatically improves performance for expensive operations. Cache tool and resource responses with configurable TTLs, reducing redundant API calls and speeding up repeated queries.

  🔄 **Server lifespans** provide proper initialization and cleanup hooks that run once per server instance instead of per client session. This fixes a long-standing source of confusion in the MCP SDK and enables proper resource management for database connections, background tasks, and other server-level state. Note: this is a breaking behavioral change if you were using the `lifespan` parameter.

  ✨ **Developer experience improvements** include Pydantic input validation for better type safety, icon support for richer UX, RFC 6570 query parameters for resource templates, improved Context API methods (list\_resources, list\_prompts, get\_prompt), and async file/directory resources.

  This release includes contributions from **20** new contributors and represents the largest feature set in a while. Thank you to everyone who tested preview builds and filed issues - your feedback shaped these improvements!

<Update label="v2.12.5" description="2025-10-17">
  **[v2.12.5: Safety Pin](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.12.5)**

  FastMCP 2.12.5 is a point release that pins the MCP SDK version below 1.17, which introduced a change affecting FastMCP users with auth providers mounted as part of a larger application. This ensures the `.well-known` payload appears in the expected location when using FastMCP authentication providers with composite applications.

<Update label="v2.12.0" description="2025-08-31">
  **[v2.12.0: Auth to the Races](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.12.0)**

  FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date, both in scope and community involvement. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we're shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption.

  🔐 **OAuth Proxy for Broader Provider Support** addresses a fundamental challenge: while MCP requires Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), many popular OAuth providers don't support it. The new OAuth proxy bridges this gap, enabling FastMCP servers to authenticate with providers like GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration. These native integrations ship today, with more providers planned based on community needs.

  📋 **Declarative JSON Configuration** introduces a standardized, portable way to describe and deploy MCP servers. The `fastmcp.json` configuration file becomes the single source of truth for dependencies, transport settings, entrypoints, and server metadata. This foundation sets the stage for future capabilities like transformations and remote sources, moving toward a world where MCP servers are as portable and shareable as container images.

  🧠 **Sampling API Fallback** tackles the chicken-and-egg problem limiting adoption of advanced MCP features. Sampling—where servers request LLM completions from clients—is powerful but underutilized due to limited client support. FastMCP now lets server authors define fallback handlers that generate sampling completions server-side when clients don't support the feature, encouraging adoption while maintaining compatibility.

  This release took longer than usual to ship, and for good reason: the community's aggressive testing and feedback on the authentication system helped us reach a level of stability we're confident in. There's certainly more work ahead, but these foundations position FastMCP to handle increasingly complex use cases while remaining approachable for developers.

  Thank you to our new contributors and everyone who tested preview builds. Your feedback directly shaped these features.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.11.3" description="2025-08-11">
  **[v2.11.3: API-tite for Change](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.3)**

  This release includes significant enhancements to the experimental OpenAPI parser and fixes a significant bug that led schemas not to be included in input/output schemas if they were transitive dependencies (e.g. A → B → C implies A depends on C). For users naively transforming large OpenAPI specs into MCP servers, this may result in ballooning payload sizes and necessitate curation.

<Update label="v2.11.0" description="2025-08-01">
  ## [v2.11.0: Auth to a Good Start](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.0)

  FastMCP 2.11 doubles down on what developers need most: speed and simplicity. This massive release delivers significant performance improvements and a dramatically better developer experience.

  🔐 **Enterprise-Ready Authentication** brings comprehensive OAuth 2.1 support with WorkOS's AuthKit integration. The new AuthProvider interface leverages MCP's support for separate resource and authorization servers, handling API keys and remote authentication with Dynamic Client Registration. AuthKit integration means you can plug into existing enterprise identity systems without rebuilding your auth stack, setting the stage for plug-and-play auth that doesn't require users to become security experts overnight.

  ⚡ The **Experimental OpenAPI Parser** delivers dramatic performance improvements through single-pass schema processing and optimized memory usage. OpenAPI integrations are now significantly faster, with cleaner, more maintainable code. *(Note: the experimental parser is disabled by default, set `FASTMCPEXPERIMENTALENABLENEWOPENAPIPARSER=1` to enable it. A message will be shown to all users on the legacy parser encouraging them to try the new one before it becomes the default.)*

  🧠 **Context State Management** finally gives you persistent state across tool calls with a simple dict interface, while enhanced meta support lets you expose rich component metadata to clients. Combined with improved type annotations, string-based argument descriptions, and UV transport support, this release makes FastMCP feel more intuitive than ever.

  This release represents a TON of community contributions and sets the foundation for even more ambitious features ahead.

  ## [v2.10.0: Great Spec-tations](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.10.0)

  FastMCP 2.10 brings full compliance with the 6/18/2025 MCP spec update, introducing elicitation support for dynamic server-client communication and output schemas for structured tool responses. Please note that due to these changes, this release also includes a breaking change to the return signature of `client.call_tool()`.

  ### Elicitation Support

  Elicitation allows MCP servers to request additional information from clients during tool execution, enabling more interactive and dynamic server behavior. This opens up new possibilities for tools that need user input or confirmation during execution.

  ### Output Schemas

  Tools can now define structured output schemas, ensuring that responses conform to expected formats and making tool integration more predictable and type-safe.

  ## [v2.9.0: Stuck in the Middleware With You](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

  FastMCP 2.9 introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol: MCP Middleware and server-side type conversion.

  ### MCP Middleware

  MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses at the protocol level, giving you powerful capabilities for logging, authentication, validation, and more. This is particularly useful for building production-ready MCP servers that need sophisticated request handling.

  ### Server-side Type Conversion

  This release also introduces server-side type conversion for prompt arguments, ensuring that data is properly formatted before being passed to your functions. This reduces the burden on individual tools and prompts to handle type validation and conversion.

  ## What's Changed

  ### New Features 🎉

  * Add File utility for binary data by [@gorocode](https://github.com/gorocode) in [#843](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/843)

<Update label="v2.8.0" description="2024-06-10">
  ## [v2.8.0: Transform and Roll Out](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

  FastMCP 2.8.0 introduces powerful new ways to customize and control your MCP servers!

  ### Tool Transformation

  The highlight of this release is first-class [**Tool Transformation**](/patterns/tool-transformation), a new feature that lets you create enhanced variations of existing tools. You can now easily rename arguments, hide parameters, modify descriptions, and even wrap tools with custom validation or post-processing logic—all without rewriting the original code. This makes it easier than ever to adapt generic tools for specific LLM use cases or to simplify complex APIs. Huge thanks to [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) for partnering on this, starting with [#591](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/discussions/591) and [#599](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/599) and continuing offline.

  ### Component Control

  This release also gives you more granular control over which components are exposed to clients. With new [**tag-based filtering**](/servers/server#tag-based-filtering), you can selectively enable or disable tools, resources, and prompts based on tags, perfect for managing different environments or user permissions. Complementing this, every component now supports being [programmatically enabled or disabled](/servers/tools#disabling-tools), offering dynamic control over your server's capabilities.

  ### Tools-by-Default

  Finally, to improve compatibility with a wider range of LLM clients, this release changes the default behavior for OpenAPI integration: all API endpoints are now converted to `Tools` by default. This is a **breaking change** but pragmatically necessitated by the fact that the majority of MCP clients available today are, sadly, only compatible with MCP tools. Therefore, this change significantly simplifies the out-of-the-box experience and ensures your entire API is immediately accessible to any tool-using agent.

  ## What's Changed

</Update>

<Update label="v2.7.0" description="2024-06-05">
  ## [v2.7.0: Pare Programming](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

  This is primarily a housekeeping release to remove or deprecate cruft that's accumulated since v1. Primarily, this release refactors FastMCP's internals in preparation for features planned in the next few major releases. However please note that as a result, this release has some minor breaking changes (which is why it's 2.7, not 2.6.2, in accordance with repo guidelines) though not to the core user-facing APIs.

  ### Breaking Changes 🛫

  * decorators return the objects they create, not the decorated function
  * websockets is an optional dependency
  * methods on the server for automatically converting functions into tools/resources/prompts have been deprecated in favor of using the decorators directly

  ### New Features 🎉

  * allow passing flags to servers by [@zzstoatzz](https://github.com/zzstoatzz) in [#690](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/690)
  * replace $ref pointing to `#/components/schemas/` with `#/$defs/\` by [@phateffect](https://github.com/phateffect) in [#697](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/697)
  * Split Tool into Tool and FunctionTool by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#700](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/700)
  * Use strict basemodel for Prompt; relax from\_function deprecation by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#701](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/701)
  * Formalize resource/functionresource replationship by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#702](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/702)
  * Formalize template/functiontemplate split by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#703](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/703)
  * Support flexible @tool decorator call patterns by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#706](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/706)
  * Ensure deprecation warnings have stacklevel=2 by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#710](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/710)
  * Allow naked prompt decorator by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#711](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/711)

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * Updates / Fixes for Tool Content Conversion by [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) in [#642](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/642)
  * Fix pr labeler permissions by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#708](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/708)

  * Fix links in README.md by [@alainivars](https://github.com/alainivars) in [#723](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/723)

  Happily, this release DOES permit the use of "naked" decorators to align with Pythonic practice:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def my_tool():
      ...
  ```

# Bearer Token Authentication
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/auth/bearer

Authenticate your FastMCP client with a Bearer token.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

<Tip>
  Bearer Token authentication is only relevant for HTTP-based transports.
</Tip>

You can configure your FastMCP client to use **bearer authentication** by supplying a valid access token. This is most appropriate for service accounts, long-lived API keys, CI/CD, applications where authentication is managed separately, or other non-interactive authentication methods.

A Bearer token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used to authenticate a request. It is most commonly used in the `Authorization` header of an HTTP request, using the `Bearer` scheme:

```http  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Client Usage

The most straightforward way to use a pre-existing Bearer token is to provide it as a string to the `auth` parameter of the `fastmcp.Client` or transport instance. FastMCP will automatically format it correctly for the `Authorization` header and bearer scheme.

<Tip>
  If you're using a string token, do not include the `Bearer` prefix. FastMCP will add it for you.
</Tip>

```python {5} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

async with Client(
    "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth="<your-token>",
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

You can also supply a Bearer token to a transport instance, such as `StreamableHttpTransport` or `SSETransport`:

```python {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    "http://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth="<your-token>",
)

async with Client(transport) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

## `BearerAuth` Helper

If you prefer to be more explicit and not rely on FastMCP to transform your string token, you can use the `BearerAuth` class yourself, which implements the `httpx.Auth` interface.

```python {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

async with Client(
    "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
    auth=BearerAuth(token="<your-token>"),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

## Custom Headers

If the MCP server expects a custom header or token scheme, you can manually set the client's `headers` instead of using the `auth` parameter by setting them on your transport:

```python {5} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

async with Client(
    transport=StreamableHttpTransport(
        "https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", 
        headers={"X-API-Key": "<your-token>"},
    ),
) as client:
    await client.ping()
```


# OAuth Authentication
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/auth/oauth

Authenticate your FastMCP client via OAuth 2.1.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

<Tip>
  OAuth authentication is only relevant for HTTP-based transports and requires user interaction via a web browser.
</Tip>

When your FastMCP client needs to access an MCP server protected by OAuth 2.1, and the process requires user interaction (like logging in and granting consent), you should use the Authorization Code Flow. FastMCP provides the `fastmcp.client.auth.OAuth` helper to simplify this entire process.

This flow is common for user-facing applications where the application acts on behalf of the user.

## Client Usage

### Default Configuration

The simplest way to use OAuth is to pass the string `"oauth"` to the `auth` parameter of the `Client` or transport instance. FastMCP will automatically configure the client to use OAuth with default settings:

```python {4} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

# Uses default OAuth settings
async with Client("https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
    await client.ping()
```

### `OAuth` Helper

To fully configure the OAuth flow, use the `OAuth` helper and pass it to the `auth` parameter of the `Client` or transport instance. `OAuth` manages the complexities of the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security, and implements the full `httpx.Auth` interface.

```python {2, 4, 6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

oauth = OAuth(mcp_url="https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp")

async with Client("https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

#### `OAuth` Parameters

* **`mcp_url`** (`str`): The full URL of the target MCP server endpoint. Used to discover OAuth server metadata
* **`scopes`** (`str | list[str]`, optional): OAuth scopes to request. Can be space-separated string or list of strings
* **`client_name`** (`str`, optional): Client name for dynamic registration. Defaults to `"FastMCP Client"`
* **`token_storage`** (`AsyncKeyValue`, optional): Storage backend for persisting OAuth tokens. Defaults to in-memory storage (tokens lost on restart). See [Token Storage](#token-storage) for encrypted storage options
* **`additional_client_metadata`** (`dict[str, Any]`, optional): Extra metadata for client registration
* **`callback_port`** (`int`, optional): Fixed port for OAuth callback server. If not specified, uses a random available port

## OAuth Flow

The OAuth flow is triggered when you use a FastMCP `Client` configured to use OAuth.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token Check">
    The client first checks the configured `token_storage` backend for existing, valid tokens for the target server. If one is found, it will be used to authenticate the client.
  </Step>

  <Step title="OAuth Server Discovery">
    If no valid tokens exist, the client attempts to discover the OAuth server's endpoints using a well-known URI (e.g., `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) based on the `mcp_url`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dynamic Client Registration">
    If the OAuth server supports it and the client isn't already registered (or credentials aren't cached), the client performs dynamic client registration according to RFC 7591.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Local Callback Server">
    A temporary local HTTP server is started on an available port (or the port specified via `callback_port`). This server's address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`) acts as the `redirect_uri` for the OAuth flow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browser Interaction">
    The user's default web browser is automatically opened, directing them to the OAuth server's authorization endpoint. The user logs in and grants (or denies) the requested `scopes`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorization Code & Token Exchange">
    Upon approval, the OAuth server redirects the user's browser to the local callback server with an `authorization_code`. The client captures this code and exchanges it with the OAuth server's token endpoint for an `access_token` (and often a `refresh_token`) using PKCE for security.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Token Caching">
    The obtained tokens are saved to the configured `token_storage` backend for future use, eliminating the need for repeated browser interactions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticated Requests">
    The access token is automatically included in the `Authorization` header for requests to the MCP server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refresh Token">
    If the access token expires, the client will automatically use the refresh token to get a new access token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Token Storage

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

By default, tokens are stored in memory and lost when your application restarts. For persistent storage, pass an `AsyncKeyValue`-compatible storage backend to the `token_storage` parameter.

<Warning>
  **Security Consideration**: Use encrypted storage for production. MCP clients can accumulate OAuth credentials for many servers over time, and a compromised token store could expose access to multiple services.
</Warning>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

# Create encrypted disk storage
encrypted_storage = FernetEncryptionWrapper(
    key_value=DiskStore(directory="~/.fastmcp/oauth-tokens"),
    fernet=Fernet(os.environ["OAUTH_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
)

oauth = OAuth(
    mcp_url="https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp",
    token_storage=encrypted_storage
)

async with Client("https://fastmcp.cloud/mcp", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

You can use any `AsyncKeyValue`-compatible backend from the [key-value library](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value) including Redis, DynamoDB, and more. Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` for encryption.

<Note>
  When selecting a storage backend, review the [py-key-value documentation](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value) to understand the maturity level and limitations of your chosen backend. Some backends may be in preview or have constraints that affect production suitability.
</Note>


# The FastMCP Client
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client

Programmatic client for interacting with MCP servers through a well-typed, Pythonic interface.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

The central piece of MCP client applications is the `fastmcp.Client` class. This class provides a **programmatic interface** for interacting with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, handling protocol details and connection management automatically.

The FastMCP Client is designed for deterministic, controlled interactions rather than autonomous behavior, making it ideal for:

* **Testing MCP servers** during development
* **Building deterministic applications** that need reliable MCP interactions
* **Creating the foundation for agentic or LLM-based clients** with structured, type-safe operations

All client operations require using the `async with` context manager for proper connection lifecycle management.

<Note>
  This is not an agentic client - it requires explicit function calls and provides direct control over all MCP operations. Use it as a building block for higher-level systems.
</Note>

## Creating a Client

Creating a client is straightforward. You provide a server source and the client automatically infers the appropriate transport mechanism.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# In-memory server (ideal for testing)
server = FastMCP("TestServer")
client = Client(server)

# HTTP server
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp")

# Local Python script
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")

async def main():
    async with client:
        # Basic server interaction
        await client.ping()
        
        # List available operations
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        prompts = await client.list_prompts()
        
        # Execute operations
        result = await client.call_tool("example_tool", {"param": "value"})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Client-Transport Architecture

The FastMCP Client separates concerns between protocol and connection:

* **`Client`**: Handles MCP protocol operations (tools, resources, prompts) and manages callbacks
* **`Transport`**: Establishes and maintains the connection (WebSockets, HTTP, Stdio, in-memory)

### Transport Inference

The client automatically infers the appropriate transport based on the input:

1. **`FastMCP` instance** → In-memory transport (perfect for testing)
2. **File path ending in `.py`** → Python Stdio transport
3. **File path ending in `.js`** → Node.js Stdio transport
4. **URL starting with `http://` or `https://`** → HTTP transport
5. **`MCPConfig` dictionary** → Multi-server client

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# Examples of transport inference
client_memory = Client(FastMCP("TestServer"))
client_script = Client("./server.py") 
client_http = Client("https://api.example.com/mcp")
```

<Tip>
  For testing and development, always prefer the in-memory transport by passing a `FastMCP` server directly to the client. This eliminates network complexity and separate processes.
</Tip>

## Configuration-Based Clients

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

Create clients from MCP configuration dictionaries, which can include multiple servers. While there is no official standard for MCP configuration format, FastMCP follows established conventions used by tools like Claude Desktop.

### Configuration Format

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "server_name": {
            # Remote HTTP/SSE server
            "transport": "http",  # or "sse" 
            "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
            "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token"},
            "auth": "oauth"  # or bearer token string
        },
        "local_server": {
            # Local stdio server
            "transport": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["./server.py", "--verbose"],
            "env": {"DEBUG": "true"},
            "cwd": "/path/to/server",
        }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Server Example

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {"url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp"},
        "assistant": {"command": "python", "args": ["./assistant_server.py"]}
    }
}

client = Client(config)

async with client:
    # Tools are prefixed with server names
    weather_data = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "London"})
    response = await client.call_tool("assistant_answer_question", {"question": "What's the capital of France?"})
    
    # Resources use prefixed URIs
    icons = await client.read_resource("weather://weather/icons/sunny")
    templates = await client.read_resource("resource://assistant/templates/list")
```

## Connection Lifecycle

The client operates asynchronously and uses context managers for connection management:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def example():
    client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")
    
    # Connection established here
    async with client:
        print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
        
        # Make multiple calls within the same session
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        
    # Connection closed automatically here
    print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
```

## Operations

FastMCP clients can interact with several types of server components:

### Tools

Tools are server-side functions that the client can execute with arguments.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # List available tools
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
    # Execute a tool
    result = await client.call_tool("multiply", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    print(result.data)  # 15
```

See [Tools](/clients/tools) for detailed documentation.

### Resources

Resources are data sources that the client can read, either static or templated.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # List available resources
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    
    # Read a resource
    content = await client.read_resource("file:///config/settings.json")
    print(content[0].text)
```

See [Resources](/clients/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable message templates that can accept arguments.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # List available prompts
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
    
    # Get a rendered prompt
    messages = await client.get_prompt("analyze_data", {"data": [1, 2, 3]})
    print(messages.messages)
```

See [Prompts](/clients/prompts) for detailed documentation.

### Server Connectivity

Use `ping()` to verify the server is reachable:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    await client.ping()
    print("Server is reachable")
```

### Initialization and Server Information

When you enter the client context manager, the client automatically performs an MCP initialization handshake with the server. This handshake exchanges capabilities, server metadata, and instructions. The result is available through the `initialize_result` property.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", instructions="Use the greet tool to say hello!")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    # Initialization already happened automatically
    print(f"Server: {client.initialize_result.serverInfo.name}")
    print(f"Version: {client.initialize_result.serverInfo.version}")
    print(f"Instructions: {client.initialize_result.instructions}")
    print(f"Capabilities: {client.initialize_result.capabilities.tools}")
```

#### Manual Initialization Control

In advanced scenarios, you might want precise control over when initialization happens. For example, you may need custom error handling, want to defer initialization until after other setup, or need to measure initialization timing separately.

Disable automatic initialization and call `initialize()` manually:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

# Disable automatic initialization
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py", auto_initialize=False)

async with client:
    # Connection established, but not initialized yet
    print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
    print(f"Initialized: {client.initialize_result is not None}")  # False

    # Initialize manually with custom timeout
    result = await client.initialize(timeout=10.0)
    print(f"Server: {result.serverInfo.name}")

    # Now ready for operations
    tools = await client.list_tools()
```

The `initialize()` method is idempotent - calling it multiple times returns the cached result from the first successful call.

## Client Configuration

Clients can be configured with additional handlers and settings for specialized use cases.

### Callback Handlers

The client supports several callback handlers for advanced server interactions:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogMessage

async def log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    print(f"Server log: {message.data}")

async def progress_handler(progress: float, total: float | None, message: str | None):
    print(f"Progress: {progress}/{total} - {message}")

async def sampling_handler(messages, params, context):
    # Integrate with your LLM service here
    return "Generated response"

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    log_handler=log_handler,
    progress_handler=progress_handler,
    sampling_handler=sampling_handler,
    timeout=30.0
)
```

The `Client` constructor accepts several configuration options:

* `transport`: Transport instance or source for automatic inference
* `log_handler`: Handle server log messages
* `progress_handler`: Monitor long-running operations
* `sampling_handler`: Respond to server LLM requests
* `roots`: Provide local context to servers
* `timeout`: Default timeout for requests (in seconds)

### Transport Configuration

For detailed transport configuration (headers, authentication, environment variables), see the [Transports](/clients/transports) documentation.

# User Elicitation
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/elicitation

Handle server-initiated user input requests with structured schemas.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

## What is Elicitation?

Elicitation allows MCP servers to request structured input from users during tool execution. Instead of requiring all inputs upfront, servers can interactively ask users for information as needed - like prompting for missing parameters, requesting clarification, or gathering additional context.

For example, a file management tool might ask "Which directory should I create?" or a data analysis tool might request "What date range should I analyze?"

## How FastMCP Makes Elicitation Easy

FastMCP's client provides a helpful abstraction layer that:

* **Converts JSON schemas to Python types**: The raw MCP protocol uses JSON schemas, but FastMCP automatically converts these to Python dataclasses
* **Provides structured constructors**: Instead of manually building dictionaries that match the schema, you get dataclass constructors that ensure correct structure
* **Handles type conversion**: FastMCP takes care of converting between JSON representations and Python objects
* **Runtime introspection**: You can inspect the generated dataclass fields to understand the expected structure

When you implement an elicitation handler, FastMCP gives you a dataclass type that matches the server's schema, making it easy to create properly structured responses without having to manually parse JSON schemas.

## Elicitation Handler

Provide an `elicitation_handler` function when creating the client. FastMCP automatically converts the server's JSON schema into a Python dataclass type, making it easy to construct the response:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.elicitation import ElicitResult

async def elicitation_handler(message: str, response_type: type, params, context):
    # Present the message to the user and collect input
    user_input = input(f"{message}: ")
    
    # Create response using the provided dataclass type
    # FastMCP converted the JSON schema to this Python type for you
    response_data = response_type(value=user_input)
    
    # You can return data directly - FastMCP will implicitly accept the elicitation
    return response_data
    
    # Or explicitly return an ElicitResult for more control
    # return ElicitResult(action="accept", content=response_data)

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    elicitation_handler=elicitation_handler,
)
```

### Handler Parameters

The elicitation handler receives four parameters:

<Card icon="code" title="Elicitation Handler Parameters">
  <ResponseField name="message" type="str">
    The prompt message to display to the user
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="response_type" type="type">
    A Python dataclass type that FastMCP created from the server's JSON schema. Use this to construct your response with proper typing and IDE support. If the server requests an empty object (indicating no response), this will be `None`.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="params" type="ElicitRequestParams">
    The original MCP elicitation request parameters, including the raw JSON schema in `params.requestedSchema` if you need it
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="context" type="RequestContext">
    Request context containing metadata about the elicitation request
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

### Response Actions

The handler can return data directly (which implicitly accepts the elicitation) or an `ElicitResult` object for more control over the response action:

<Card icon="code" title="ElicitResult Structure">
  <ResponseField name="action" type="Literal['accept', 'decline', 'cancel']">
    How the user responded to the elicitation request
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="content" type="dataclass instance | dict | None">
    The user's input data (required for "accept", omitted for "decline"/"cancel")
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

**Action Types:**

* **`accept`**: User provided valid input - include their data in the `content` field
* **`decline`**: User chose not to provide the requested information - omit `content`
* **`cancel`**: User cancelled the entire operation - omit `content`

## Basic Example

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.elicitation import ElicitResult

async def basic_elicitation_handler(message: str, response_type: type, params, context):
    print(f"Server asks: {message}")
    
    # Simple text input for demonstration
    user_response = input("Your response: ")
    
    if not user_response:
        # For non-acceptance, use ElicitResult explicitly
        return ElicitResult(action="decline")
    
    # Use the response_type dataclass to create a properly structured response
    # FastMCP handles the conversion from JSON schema to Python type
    # Return data directly - FastMCP will implicitly accept the elicitation
    return response_type(value=user_response)

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py", 
    elicitation_handler=basic_elicitation_handler
)
```


# Server Logging
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/logging

Receive and handle log messages from MCP servers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

MCP servers can emit log messages to clients. The client can handle these logs through a log handler callback.

## Log Handler

Provide a `log_handler` function when creating the client. For robust logging, the log messages can be integrated with Python's standard `logging` module.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import logging
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogMessage

# In a real app, you might configure this in your main entry point
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Get a logger for the module where the client is used
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# This mapping is useful for converting MCP level strings to Python's levels
LOGGING_LEVEL_MAP = logging.getLevelNamesMapping()

async def log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    """
    Handles incoming logs from the MCP server and forwards them
    to the standard Python logging system.
    """
    msg = message.data.get('msg')
    extra = message.data.get('extra')

    # Convert the MCP log level to a Python log level
    level = LOGGING_LEVEL_MAP.get(message.level.upper(), logging.INFO)

    # Log the message using the standard logging library
    logger.log(level, msg, extra=extra)


client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    log_handler=log_handler,
)
```

## Handling Structured Logs

The `message.data` attribute is a dictionary that contains the log payload from the server. This enables structured logging, allowing you to receive rich, contextual information.

The dictionary contains two keys:

* `msg`: The string log message.
* `extra`: A dictionary containing any extra data sent from the server.

This structure is preserved even when logs are forwarded through a FastMCP proxy, making it a powerful tool for debugging complex, multi-server applications.

### Handler Parameters

The `log_handler` is called every time a log message is received. It receives a `LogMessage` object:

<Card icon="code" title="Log Handler Parameters">
  <ResponseField name="LogMessage" type="Log Message Object">
    <Expandable title="attributes">
      <ResponseField name="level" type="Literal[&#x22;debug&#x22;, &#x22;info&#x22;, &#x22;notice&#x22;, &#x22;warning&#x22;, &#x22;error&#x22;, &#x22;critical&#x22;, &#x22;alert&#x22;, &#x22;emergency&#x22;]">
        The log level
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="logger" type="str | None">
        The logger name (optional, may be None)
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="data" type="dict">
        The log payload, containing `msg` and `extra` keys.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def detailed_log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    msg = message.data.get('msg')
    extra = message.data.get('extra')

    if message.level == "error":
        print(f"ERROR: {msg} | Details: {extra}")
    elif message.level == "warning":
        print(f"WARNING: {msg} | Details: {extra}")
    else:
        print(f"{message.level.upper()}: {msg}")
```

## Default Log Handling

If you don't provide a custom `log_handler`, FastMCP's default handler routes server logs to the appropriate Python logging levels. The MCP levels are mapped as follows: `notice` → INFO; `alert` and `emergency` → CRITICAL. If the server includes a logger name, it is prefixed in the message, and any `extra` data is forwarded via the logging `extra` parameter.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")

async with client:
    # Server logs are forwarded at their proper severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL)
    await client.call_tool("some_tool")
```


# Message Handling
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/messages

Handle MCP messages, requests, and notifications with custom message handlers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.9.1" />

MCP clients can receive various types of messages from servers, including requests that need responses and notifications that don't. The message handler provides a unified way to process all these messages.

## Function-Based Handler

The simplest way to handle messages is with a function that receives all messages:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

async def message_handler(message):
    """Handle all MCP messages from the server."""
    if hasattr(message, 'root'):
        method = message.root.method
        print(f"Received: {method}")
        
        # Handle specific notifications
        if method == "notifications/tools/list_changed":
            print("Tools have changed - might want to refresh tool cache")
        elif method == "notifications/resources/list_changed":
            print("Resources have changed")

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    message_handler=message_handler,
)
```

## Message Handler Class

For fine-grained targeting, FastMCP provides a `MessageHandler` class you can subclass to take advantage of specific hooks:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.messages import MessageHandler
import mcp.types

class MyMessageHandler(MessageHandler):
    async def on_tool_list_changed(
        self, notification: mcp.types.ToolListChangedNotification
    ) -> None:
        """Handle tool list changes specifically."""
        print("Tool list changed - refreshing available tools")

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    message_handler=MyMessageHandler(),
)
```

### Available Handler Methods

All handler methods receive a single argument - the specific message type:

<Card icon="code" title="Message Handler Methods">
  <ResponseField name="on_message(message)" type="Any MCP message">
    Called for ALL messages (requests and notifications)
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_request(request)" type="mcp.types.ClientRequest">
    Called for requests that expect responses
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_notification(notification)" type="mcp.types.ServerNotification">
    Called for notifications (fire-and-forget)
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_tool_list_changed(notification)" type="mcp.types.ToolListChangedNotification">
    Called when the server's tool list changes
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_resource_list_changed(notification)" type="mcp.types.ResourceListChangedNotification">
    Called when the server's resource list changes
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_prompt_list_changed(notification)" type="mcp.types.PromptListChangedNotification">
    Called when the server's prompt list changes
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_progress(notification)" type="mcp.types.ProgressNotification">
    Called for progress updates during long-running operations
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="on_logging_message(notification)" type="mcp.types.LoggingMessageNotification">
    Called for log messages from the server
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

## Example: Handling Tool Changes

Here's a practical example of handling tool list changes:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.messages import MessageHandler
import mcp.types

class ToolCacheHandler(MessageHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        self.cached_tools = []
    
    async def on_tool_list_changed(
        self, notification: mcp.types.ToolListChangedNotification
    ) -> None:
        """Clear tool cache when tools change."""
        print("Tools changed - clearing cache")
        self.cached_tools = []  # Force refresh on next access

client = Client("server.py", message_handler=ToolCacheHandler())
```

## Handling Requests

While the message handler receives server-initiated requests, for most use cases you should use the dedicated callback parameters instead:

* **Sampling requests**: Use [`sampling_handler`](/clients/sampling)
* **Progress requests**: Use [`progress_handler`](/clients/progress)
* **Log requests**: Use [`log_handler`](/clients/logging)

The message handler is primarily for monitoring and handling notifications rather than responding to requests.


# Progress Monitoring
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/progress

Handle progress notifications from long-running server operations.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.3.5" />

MCP servers can report progress during long-running operations. The client can receive these updates through a progress handler.

## Progress Handler

Set a progress handler when creating the client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

async def my_progress_handler(
    progress: float, 
    total: float | None, 
    message: str | None
) -> None:
    if total is not None:
        percentage = (progress / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}% - {message or ''}")
    else:
        print(f"Progress: {progress} - {message or ''}")

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    progress_handler=my_progress_handler
)
```

### Handler Parameters

The progress handler receives three parameters:

<Card icon="code" title="Progress Handler Parameters">
  <ResponseField name="progress" type="float">
    Current progress value
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="total" type="float | None">
    Expected total value (may be None)
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="message" type="str | None">
    Optional status message (may be None)
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

## Per-Call Progress Handler

Override the progress handler for specific tool calls:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Override with specific progress handler for this call
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task", 
        {"param": "value"}, 
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )
```


# Prompts
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/prompts

Use server-side prompt templates with automatic argument serialization.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Prompts are reusable message templates exposed by MCP servers. They can accept arguments to generate personalized message sequences for LLM interactions.

## Listing Prompts

Use `list_prompts()` to retrieve all available prompt templates:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
    # prompts -> list[mcp.types.Prompt]
    
    for prompt in prompts:
        print(f"Prompt: {prompt.name}")
        print(f"Description: {prompt.description}")
        if prompt.arguments:
            print(f"Arguments: {[arg.name for arg in prompt.arguments]}")
        # Access tags and other metadata
        if hasattr(prompt, '_meta') and prompt._meta:
            fastmcp_meta = prompt._meta.get('_fastmcp', {})
            print(f"Tags: {fastmcp_meta.get('tags', [])}")
```

### Filtering by Tags

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

You can use the `meta` field to filter prompts based on their tags:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
    
    # Filter prompts by tag
    analysis_prompts = [
        prompt for prompt in prompts 
        if hasattr(prompt, '_meta') and prompt._meta and
           prompt._meta.get('_fastmcp', {}) and
           'analysis' in prompt._meta.get('_fastmcp', {}).get('tags', [])
    ]
    
    print(f"Found {len(analysis_prompts)} analysis prompts")
```

<Note>
  The `_meta` field is part of the standard MCP specification. FastMCP servers include tags and other metadata within a `_fastmcp` namespace (e.g., `_meta._fastmcp.tags`) to avoid conflicts with user-defined metadata. This behavior can be controlled with the server's `include_fastmcp_meta` setting - when disabled, the `_fastmcp` namespace won't be included. Other MCP server implementations may not provide this metadata structure.
</Note>

## Using Prompts

### Basic Usage

Request a rendered prompt using `get_prompt()` with the prompt name and arguments:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Simple prompt without arguments
    result = await client.get_prompt("welcome_message")
    # result -> mcp.types.GetPromptResult
    
    # Access the generated messages
    for message in result.messages:
        print(f"Role: {message.role}")
        print(f"Content: {message.content}")
```

### Prompts with Arguments

Pass arguments as a dictionary to customize the prompt:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Prompt with simple arguments
    result = await client.get_prompt("user_greeting", {
        "name": "Alice",
        "role": "administrator"
    })
    
    # Access the personalized messages
    for message in result.messages:
        print(f"Generated message: {message.content}")
```

## Automatic Argument Serialization

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

FastMCP automatically serializes complex arguments to JSON strings as required by the MCP specification. This allows you to pass typed objects directly:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    age: int

async with client:
    # Complex arguments are automatically serialized
    result = await client.get_prompt("analyze_user", {
        "user": UserData(name="Alice", age=30),     # Automatically serialized to JSON
        "preferences": {"theme": "dark"},           # Dict serialized to JSON string
        "scores": [85, 92, 78],                     # List serialized to JSON string
        "simple_name": "Bob"                        # Strings passed through unchanged
    })
```

The client handles serialization using `pydantic_core.to_json()` for consistent formatting. FastMCP servers can automatically deserialize these JSON strings back to the expected types.

### Serialization Examples

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("data_analysis", {
        # These will be automatically serialized to JSON strings:
        "config": {
            "format": "csv",
            "include_headers": True,
            "delimiter": ","
        },
        "filters": [
            {"field": "age", "operator": ">", "value": 18},
            {"field": "status", "operator": "==", "value": "active"}
        ],
        # This remains a string:
        "report_title": "Monthly Analytics Report"
    })
```

## Working with Prompt Results

The `get_prompt()` method returns a `GetPromptResult` object containing a list of messages:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("conversation_starter", {"topic": "climate"})
    
    # Access individual messages
    for i, message in enumerate(result.messages):
        print(f"Message {i + 1}:")
        print(f"  Role: {message.role}")
        print(f"  Content: {message.content.text if hasattr(message.content, 'text') else message.content}")
```

## Raw MCP Protocol Access

For access to the complete MCP protocol objects, use the `*_mcp` methods:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Raw MCP method returns full protocol object
    prompts_result = await client.list_prompts_mcp()
    # prompts_result -> mcp.types.ListPromptsResult
    
    prompt_result = await client.get_prompt_mcp("example_prompt", {"arg": "value"})
    # prompt_result -> mcp.types.GetPromptResult
```

## Multi-Server Clients

When using multi-server clients, prompts are accessible without prefixing (unlike tools):

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:  # Multi-server client
    # Prompts from any server are directly accessible
    result1 = await client.get_prompt("weather_prompt", {"city": "London"})
    result2 = await client.get_prompt("assistant_prompt", {"query": "help"})
```

## Common Prompt Patterns

### System Messages

Many prompts generate system messages for LLM configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("system_configuration", {
        "role": "helpful assistant",
        "expertise": "python programming"
    })
    
    # Typically returns messages with role="system"
    system_message = result.messages[0]
    print(f"System prompt: {system_message.content}")
```

### Conversation Templates

Prompts can generate multi-turn conversation templates:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.get_prompt("interview_template", {
        "candidate_name": "Alice",
        "position": "Senior Developer"
    })
    
    # Multiple messages for a conversation flow
    for message in result.messages:
        print(f"{message.role}: {message.content}")
```

<Tip>
  Prompt arguments and their expected types depend on the specific prompt implementation. Check the server's documentation or use `list_prompts()` to see available arguments for each prompt.

# Resource Operations
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/resources

Access static and templated resources from MCP servers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Resources are data sources exposed by MCP servers. They can be static files or dynamic templates that generate content based on parameters.

## Types of Resources

MCP servers expose two types of resources:

* **Static Resources**: Fixed content accessible via URI (e.g., configuration files, documentation)
* **Resource Templates**: Dynamic resources that accept parameters to generate content (e.g., API endpoints, database queries)

## Listing Resources

### Static Resources

Use `list_resources()` to retrieve all static resources available on the server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    # resources -> list[mcp.types.Resource]
    
    for resource in resources:
        print(f"Resource URI: {resource.uri}")
        print(f"Name: {resource.name}")
        print(f"Description: {resource.description}")
        print(f"MIME Type: {resource.mimeType}")
        # Access tags and other metadata
        if hasattr(resource, '_meta') and resource._meta:
            fastmcp_meta = resource._meta.get('_fastmcp', {})
            print(f"Tags: {fastmcp_meta.get('tags', [])}")
```

### Resource Templates

Use `list_resource_templates()` to retrieve available resource templates:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    templates = await client.list_resource_templates()
    # templates -> list[mcp.types.ResourceTemplate]
    
    for template in templates:
        print(f"Template URI: {template.uriTemplate}")
        print(f"Name: {template.name}")
        print(f"Description: {template.description}")
        # Access tags and other metadata
        if hasattr(template, '_meta') and template._meta:
            fastmcp_meta = template._meta.get('_fastmcp', {})
            print(f"Tags: {fastmcp_meta.get('tags', [])}")
```

### Filtering by Tags

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

You can use the `meta` field to filter resources based on their tags:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    
    # Filter resources by tag
    config_resources = [
        resource for resource in resources 
        if hasattr(resource, '_meta') and resource._meta and
           resource._meta.get('_fastmcp', {}) and
           'config' in resource._meta.get('_fastmcp', {}).get('tags', [])
    ]
    
    print(f"Found {len(config_resources)} config resources")
```

<Note>
  The `_meta` field is part of the standard MCP specification. FastMCP servers include tags and other metadata within a `_fastmcp` namespace (e.g., `_meta._fastmcp.tags`) to avoid conflicts with user-defined metadata. This behavior can be controlled with the server's `include_fastmcp_meta` setting - when disabled, the `_fastmcp` namespace won't be included. Other MCP server implementations may not provide this metadata structure.
</Note>

## Reading Resources

### Static Resources

Read a static resource using its URI:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Read a static resource
    content = await client.read_resource("file:///path/to/README.md")
    # content -> list[mcp.types.TextResourceContents | mcp.types.BlobResourceContents]
    
    # Access text content
    if hasattr(content[0], 'text'):
        print(content[0].text)
    
    # Access binary content
    if hasattr(content[0], 'blob'):
        print(f"Binary data: {len(content[0].blob)} bytes")
```

### Resource Templates

Read from a resource template by providing the URI with parameters:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Read a resource generated from a template
    # For example, a template like "weather://{{city}}/current"
    weather_content = await client.read_resource("weather://london/current")
    
    # Access the generated content
    print(weather_content[0].text)  # Assuming text JSON response
```

## Content Types

Resources can return different content types:

### Text Resources

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    content = await client.read_resource("resource://config/settings.json")
    
    for item in content:
        if hasattr(item, 'text'):
            print(f"Text content: {item.text}")
            print(f"MIME type: {item.mimeType}")
```

### Binary Resources

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    content = await client.read_resource("resource://images/logo.png")
    
    for item in content:
        if hasattr(item, 'blob'):
            print(f"Binary content: {len(item.blob)} bytes")
            print(f"MIME type: {item.mimeType}")
            
            # Save to file
            with open("downloaded_logo.png", "wb") as f:
                f.write(item.blob)
```

## Working with Multi-Server Clients

When using multi-server clients, resource URIs are automatically prefixed with the server name:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:  # Multi-server client
    # Access resources from different servers
    weather_icons = await client.read_resource("weather://weather/icons/sunny")
    templates = await client.read_resource("resource://assistant/templates/list")
    
    print(f"Weather icon: {weather_icons[0].blob}")
    print(f"Templates: {templates[0].text}")
```

## Raw MCP Protocol Access

For access to the complete MCP protocol objects, use the `*_mcp` methods:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Raw MCP methods return full protocol objects
    resources_result = await client.list_resources_mcp()
    # resources_result -> mcp.types.ListResourcesResult
    
    templates_result = await client.list_resource_templates_mcp()
    # templates_result -> mcp.types.ListResourceTemplatesResult
    
    content_result = await client.read_resource_mcp("resource://example")
    # content_result -> mcp.types.ReadResourceResult
```

## Common Resource URI Patterns

Different MCP servers may use various URI schemes:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# File system resources
"file:///path/to/file.txt"

# Custom protocol resources  
"weather://london/current"
"database://users/123"

# Generic resource protocol
"resource://config/settings"
"resource://templates/email"
```

<Tip>
  Resource URIs and their formats depend on the specific MCP server implementation. Check the server's documentation for available resources and their URI patterns.
</Tip>


# Client Roots
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/roots

Provide local context and resource boundaries to MCP servers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Roots are a way for clients to inform servers about the resources they have access to. Servers can use this information to adjust behavior or provide more relevant responses.

## Setting Static Roots

Provide a list of roots when creating the client:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Static Roots theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import Client

  client = Client(
      "my_mcp_server.py", 
      roots=["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"]
  )
  ```

  ```python Dynamic Roots Callback theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import Client
  from fastmcp.client.roots import RequestContext

  async def roots_callback(context: RequestContext) -> list[str]:
      print(f"Server requested roots (Request ID: {context.request_id})")
      return ["/path/to/root1", "/path/to/root2"]

  client = Client(
      "my_mcp_server.py", 
      roots=roots_callback
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# LLM Sampling
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/sampling

Handle server-initiated LLM sampling requests.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

MCP servers can request LLM completions from clients. The client handles these requests through a sampling handler callback.

## Sampling Handler

Provide a `sampling_handler` function when creating the client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.sampling import (
    SamplingMessage,
    SamplingParams,
    RequestContext,
)

async def sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    context: RequestContext
) -> str:
    # Your LLM integration logic here
    # Extract text from messages and generate a response
    return "Generated response based on the messages"

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    sampling_handler=sampling_handler,
)
```

### Handler Parameters

The sampling handler receives three parameters:

## Basic Example

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.sampling import SamplingMessage, SamplingParams, RequestContext

async def basic_sampling_handler(
    messages: list[SamplingMessage],
    params: SamplingParams,
    context: RequestContext
) -> str:
    # Extract message content
    conversation = []
    for message in messages:
        content = message.content.text if hasattr(message.content, 'text') else str(message.content)
        conversation.append(f"{message.role}: {content}")

    # Use the system prompt if provided
    system_prompt = params.systemPrompt or "You are a helpful assistant."

    # Here you would integrate with your preferred LLM service
    # This is just a placeholder response
    return f"Response based on conversation: {' | '.join(conversation)}"

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    sampling_handler=basic_sampling_handler
)
```

<Note>
  If the client doesn't provide a sampling handler, servers can optionally configure a fallback handler. See [Server Sampling](/servers/sampling#sampling-fallback-handler) for details.
</Note>


# Tool Operations
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/tools

Discover and execute server-side tools with the FastMCP client.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Tools are executable functions exposed by MCP servers. The FastMCP client provides methods to discover available tools and execute them with arguments.

## Discovering Tools

Use `list_tools()` to retrieve all tools available on the server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    # tools -> list[mcp.types.Tool]
    
    for tool in tools:
        print(f"Tool: {tool.name}")
        print(f"Description: {tool.description}")
        if tool.inputSchema:
            print(f"Parameters: {tool.inputSchema}")
        # Access tags and other metadata
        if hasattr(tool, 'meta') and tool.meta:
            fastmcp_meta = tool.meta.get('_fastmcp', {})
            print(f"Tags: {fastmcp_meta.get('tags', [])}")
```

### Filtering by Tags

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

You can use the `meta` field to filter tools based on their tags:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
    # Filter tools by tag
    analysis_tools = [
        tool for tool in tools 
        if hasattr(tool, 'meta') and tool.meta and
           tool.meta.get('_fastmcp', {}) and
           'analysis' in tool.meta.get('_fastmcp', {}).get('tags', [])
    ]
    
    print(f"Found {len(analysis_tools)} analysis tools")
```

<Note>
  The `meta` field is part of the standard MCP specification. FastMCP servers include tags and other metadata within a `_fastmcp` namespace (e.g., `meta._fastmcp.tags`) to avoid conflicts with user-defined metadata. This behavior can be controlled with the server's `include_fastmcp_meta` setting - when disabled, the `_fastmcp` namespace won't be included. Other MCP server implementations may not provide this metadata structure.
</Note>

## Executing Tools

### Basic Execution

Execute a tool using `call_tool()` with the tool name and arguments:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Simple tool call
    result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    # result -> CallToolResult with structured and unstructured data
    
    # Access structured data (automatically deserialized)
    print(result.data)  # 8 (int) or {"result": 8} for primitive types
    
    # Access traditional content blocks  
    print(result.content[0].text)  # "8" (TextContent)
```

### Advanced Execution Options

The `call_tool()` method supports additional parameters for timeout control and progress monitoring:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # With timeout (aborts if execution takes longer than 2 seconds)
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task", 
        {"param": "value"}, 
        timeout=2.0
    )
    
    # With progress handler (to track execution progress)
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task",
        {"param": "value"},
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )
```

**Parameters:**

* `name`: The tool name (string)
* `arguments`: Dictionary of arguments to pass to the tool (optional)
* `timeout`: Maximum execution time in seconds (optional, overrides client-level timeout)
* `progress_handler`: Progress callback function (optional, overrides client-level handler)
* `meta`: Dictionary of metadata to send with the request (optional, see below)

## Sending Metadata

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

The `meta` parameter sends ancillary information alongside tool calls. This can be used for various purposes like observability, debugging, client identification, or any context the server may need beyond the tool's primary arguments.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool(
        name="send_email",
        arguments={
            "to": "user@example.com",
            "subject": "Hello",
            "body": "Welcome!"
        },
        meta={
            "trace_id": "abc-123",
            "request_source": "mobile_app"
        }
    )
```

The structure and usage of `meta` is determined by your application. See [Client Metadata](/servers/context#client-metadata) in the server documentation to learn how to access this data in your tool implementations.

## Handling Results

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

Tool execution returns a `CallToolResult` object with both structured and traditional content. FastMCP's standout feature is the `.data` property, which doesn't just provide raw JSON but actually hydrates complete Python objects including complex types like datetimes, UUIDs, and custom classes.

### CallToolResult Properties

<Card icon="code" title="CallToolResult Properties">
  <ResponseField name=".data" type="Any">
    **FastMCP exclusive**: Fully hydrated Python objects with complex type support (datetimes, UUIDs, custom classes). Goes beyond JSON to provide complete object reconstruction from output schemas.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name=".content" type="list[mcp.types.ContentBlock]">
    Standard MCP content blocks (`TextContent`, `ImageContent`, `AudioContent`, etc.) available from all MCP servers.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name=".structured_content" type="dict[str, Any] | None">
    Standard MCP structured JSON data as sent by the server, available from all MCP servers that support structured outputs.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name=".is_error" type="bool">
    Boolean indicating if the tool execution failed.
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

### Structured Data Access

FastMCP's `.data` property provides fully hydrated Python objects, not just JSON dictionaries. This includes complex type reconstruction:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import UUID

async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("get_weather", {"city": "London"})
    
    # FastMCP reconstructs complete Python objects from the server's output schema
    weather = result.data  # Server-defined WeatherReport object
    print(f"Temperature: {weather.temperature}°C at {weather.timestamp}")
    print(f"Station: {weather.station_id}")
    print(f"Humidity: {weather.humidity}%")
    
    # The timestamp is a real datetime object, not a string!
    assert isinstance(weather.timestamp, datetime)
    assert isinstance(weather.station_id, UUID)
    
    # Compare with raw structured JSON (standard MCP)
    print(f"Raw JSON: {result.structured_content}")
    # {"temperature": 20, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z", "station_id": "123e4567-..."}
    
    # Traditional content blocks (standard MCP)  
    print(f"Text content: {result.content[0].text}")
```

### Fallback Behavior

For tools without output schemas or when deserialization fails, `.data` will be `None`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("legacy_tool", {"param": "value"})
    
    if result.data is not None:
        # Structured output available and successfully deserialized
        print(f"Structured: {result.data}")
    else:
        # No structured output or deserialization failed - use content blocks
        for content in result.content:
            if hasattr(content, 'text'):
                print(f"Text result: {content.text}")
            elif hasattr(content, 'data'):
                print(f"Binary data: {len(content.data)} bytes")
```

### Primitive Type Unwrapping

<Tip>
  FastMCP servers automatically wrap non-object results (like `int`, `str`, `bool`) in a `{"result": value}` structure to create valid structured outputs. FastMCP clients understand this convention and automatically unwrap the value in `.data` for convenience, so you get the original primitive value instead of a wrapper object.
</Tip>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("calculate_sum", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    
    # FastMCP client automatically unwraps for convenience
    print(result.data)  # 8 (int) - the original value
    
    # Raw structured content shows the server-side wrapping
    print(result.structured_content)  # {"result": 8}
    
    # Other MCP clients would need to manually access ["result"]
    # value = result.structured_content["result"]  # Not needed with FastMCP!
```

## Error Handling

### Exception-Based Error Handling

By default, `call_tool()` raises a `ToolError` if the tool execution fails:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

async with client:
    try:
        result = await client.call_tool("potentially_failing_tool", {"param": "value"})
        print("Tool succeeded:", result.data)
    except ToolError as e:
        print(f"Tool failed: {e}")
```

### Manual Error Checking

You can disable automatic error raising and manually check the result:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "potentially_failing_tool", 
        {"param": "value"}, 
        raise_on_error=False
    )
    
    if result.is_error:
        print(f"Tool failed: {result.content[0].text}")
    else:
        print(f"Tool succeeded: {result.data}")
```

### Raw MCP Protocol Access

For complete control, use `call_tool_mcp()` which returns the raw MCP protocol object:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool_mcp("potentially_failing_tool", {"param": "value"})
    # result -> mcp.types.CallToolResult
    
    if result.isError:
        print(f"Tool failed: {result.content}")
    else:
        print(f"Tool succeeded: {result.content}")
        # Note: No automatic deserialization with call_tool_mcp()
```

## Argument Handling

Arguments are passed as a dictionary to the tool:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Simple arguments
    result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
    
    # Complex arguments
    result = await client.call_tool("process_data", {
        "config": {"format": "json", "validate": True},
        "items": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        "metadata": {"source": "api", "version": "1.0"}
    })
```

<Tip>
  For multi-server clients, tool names are automatically prefixed with the server name (e.g., `weather_get_forecast` for a tool named `get_forecast` on the `weather` server).
</Tip>


# Client Transports
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/clients/transports

Configure how FastMCP Clients connect to and communicate with servers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

The FastMCP `Client` communicates with MCP servers through transport objects that handle the underlying connection mechanics. While the client can automatically select a transport based on what you pass to it, instantiating transports explicitly gives you full control over configuration—environment variables, authentication, session management, and more.

Think of transports as configurable adapters between your client code and MCP servers. Each transport type handles a different communication pattern: subprocesses with pipes, HTTP connections, or direct in-memory calls.

## Choosing the Right Transport

* **Use [STDIO Transport](#stdio-transport)** when you need to run local MCP servers with full control over their environment and lifecycle
* **Use [Remote Transports](#remote-transports)** when connecting to production services or shared MCP servers running independently
* **Use [In-Memory Transport](#in-memory-transport)** for testing FastMCP servers without subprocess or network overhead
* **Use [MCP JSON Configuration](#mcp-json-configuration-transport)** when you need to connect to multiple servers defined in configuration files

## STDIO Transport

STDIO (Standard Input/Output) transport communicates with MCP servers through subprocess pipes. This is the standard mechanism used by desktop clients like Claude Desktop and is the primary way to run local MCP servers.

### The Client Runs the Server

<Warning>
  **Critical Concept**: When using STDIO transport, your client actually launches and manages the server process. This is fundamentally different from network transports where you connect to an already-running server. Understanding this relationship is key to using STDIO effectively.
</Warning>

With STDIO transport, your client:

* Starts the server as a subprocess when you connect
* Manages the server's lifecycle (start, stop, restart)
* Controls the server's environment and configuration
* Communicates through stdin/stdout pipes

This architecture enables powerful local integrations but requires understanding environment isolation and process management.

### Environment Isolation

STDIO servers run in isolated environments by default. This is a security feature enforced by the MCP protocol to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

When your client launches an MCP server:

* The server does NOT inherit your shell's environment variables
* API keys, paths, and other configuration must be explicitly passed
* The working directory and system paths may differ from your shell

To pass environment variables to your server, use the `env` parameter:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

# If your server needs environment variables (like API keys),
# you must explicitly pass them:
client = Client(
    "my_server.py",
    env={"API_KEY": "secret", "DEBUG": "true"}
)

# This won't work - the server runs in isolation:
# export API_KEY="secret"  # in your shell
# client = Client("my_server.py")  # server can't see API_KEY
```

### Basic Usage

To use STDIO transport, you create a transport instance with the command and arguments needed to run your server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["my_server.py"]
)
client = Client(transport)
```

You can configure additional settings like environment variables, working directory, or command arguments:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["my_server.py", "--verbose"],
    env={"LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"},
    cwd="/path/to/server"
)
client = Client(transport)
```

For convenience, the client can also infer STDIO transport from file paths, but this doesn't allow configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("my_server.py")  # Limited - no configuration options
```

### Environment Variables

Since STDIO servers don't inherit your environment, you need strategies for passing configuration. Here are two common approaches:

**Selective forwarding** passes only the variables your server actually needs:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

required_vars = ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL", "REDIS_HOST"]
env = {
    var: os.environ[var] 
    for var in required_vars 
    if var in os.environ
}

transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["server.py"],
    env=env
)
client = Client(transport)
```

**Loading from .env files** keeps configuration separate from code:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from dotenv import dotenv_values
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

env = dotenv_values(".env")
transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["server.py"],
    env=env
)
client = Client(transport)
```

### Session Persistence

STDIO transports maintain sessions across multiple client contexts by default (`keep_alive=True`). This improves performance by reusing the same subprocess for multiple connections, but can be controlled when you need isolation.

By default, the subprocess persists between connections:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.transports import StdioTransport

transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["server.py"]
)
client = Client(transport)

async def efficient_multiple_operations():
    async with client:
        await client.ping()
    
    async with client:  # Reuses the same subprocess
        await client.call_tool("process_data", {"file": "data.csv"})
```

For complete isolation between connections, disable session persistence:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
transport = StdioTransport(
    command="python",
    args=["server.py"],
    keep_alive=False
)
client = Client(transport)
```

Use `keep_alive=False` when you need complete isolation (e.g., in test suites) or when server state could cause issues between connections.

### Specialized STDIO Transports

FastMCP provides convenience transports that are thin wrappers around `StdioTransport` with pre-configured commands:

* **`PythonStdioTransport`** - Uses `python` command for `.py` files
* **`NodeStdioTransport`** - Uses `node` command for `.js` files
* **`UvStdioTransport`** - Uses `uv` for Python packages (uses `env_vars` parameter)
* **`UvxStdioTransport`** - Uses `uvx` for Python packages (uses `env_vars` parameter)
* **`NpxStdioTransport`** - Uses `npx` for Node packages (uses `env_vars` parameter)

For most use cases, instantiate `StdioTransport` directly with your desired command. These specialized transports are primarily useful for client inference shortcuts.

## Remote Transports

Remote transports connect to MCP servers running as web services. This is a fundamentally different model from STDIO transports—instead of your client launching and managing a server process, you connect to an already-running service that manages its own environment and lifecycle.

### Streamable HTTP Transport

<VersionBadge version="2.3.0" />

Streamable HTTP is the recommended transport for production deployments, providing efficient bidirectional streaming over HTTP connections.

* **Class:** `StreamableHttpTransport`
* **Server compatibility:** FastMCP servers running with `mcp run --transport http`

The transport requires a URL and optionally supports custom headers for authentication and configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

# Basic connection
transport = StreamableHttpTransport(url="https://api.example.com/mcp")
client = Client(transport)

# With custom headers for authentication
transport = StreamableHttpTransport(
    url="https://api.example.com/mcp",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here",
        "X-Custom-Header": "value"
    }
)
client = Client(transport)
```

For convenience, FastMCP also provides authentication helpers:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

client = Client(
    "https://api.example.com/mcp",
    auth=BearerAuth("your-token-here")
)
```

### SSE Transport (Legacy)

Server-Sent Events transport is maintained for backward compatibility but is superseded by Streamable HTTP for new deployments.

* **Class:** `SSETransport`
* **Server compatibility:** FastMCP servers running with `mcp run --transport sse`

SSE transport supports the same configuration options as Streamable HTTP:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.transports import SSETransport

transport = SSETransport(
    url="https://api.example.com/sse",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer token"}
)
client = Client(transport)
```

Use Streamable HTTP for new deployments unless you have specific infrastructure requirements for SSE.

## In-Memory Transport

In-memory transport connects directly to a FastMCP server instance within the same Python process. This eliminates both subprocess management and network overhead, making it ideal for testing and development.

* **Class:** `FastMCPTransport`

<Note>
  Unlike STDIO transports, in-memory servers have full access to your Python process's environment. They share the same memory space and environment variables as your client code—no isolation or explicit environment passing required.
</Note>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
import os

mcp = FastMCP("TestServer")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    prefix = os.environ.get("GREETING_PREFIX", "Hello")
    return f"{prefix}, {name}!"

client = Client(mcp)

async with client:
    result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
```

## MCP JSON Configuration Transport

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

This transport supports the emerging MCP JSON configuration standard for defining multiple servers:

* **Class:** `MCPConfigTransport`

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        },
        "assistant": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["./assistant.py"],
            "env": {"LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"}
        }
    }
}

client = Client(config)

async with client:
    # Tools are namespaced by server
    weather = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "NYC"})
    answer = await client.call_tool("assistant_ask", {"question": "What?"})
```

### Tool Transformation with FastMCP and MCPConfig

FastMCP supports basic tool transformations to be defined alongside the MCP Servers in the MCPConfig file.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http",
            "tools": { }   #  <--- This is the tool transformation section
        }
    }
}
```

With these transformations, you can transform (change) the name, title, description, tags, enablement, and arguments of a tool.

For each argument the tool takes, you can transform (change) the name, description, default, visibility, whether it's required, and you can provide example values.

In the following example, we're transforming the `weather_get_forecast` tool to only retrieve the weather for `Miami` and hiding the `city` argument from the client.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
tool_transformations = {
    "weather_get_forecast": {
        "name": "miami_weather",
        "description": "Get the weather for Miami",
        "arguments": {
            "city": {
                "name": "city",
                "default": "Miami",
                "hide": True,
            }
        }
    }
}

config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http",
            "tools": tool_transformations
        }
    }
}
```

#### Allowlisting and Blocklisting Tools

Tools can be allowlisted or blocklisted from the client by applying `tags` to the tools on the server. In the following example, we're allowlisting only tools marked with the `forecast` tag, all other tools will be unavailable to the client.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
tool_transformations = {
    "weather_get_forecast": {
        "enabled": True,
        "tags": ["forecast"]
    }
}


config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http",
            "tools": tool_transformations,
            "include_tags": ["forecast"]
        }
    }
}
```


# FastMCP Cloud
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/fastmcp-cloud

The fastest way to deploy your MCP server

[FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) is a managed platform for hosting MCP servers, built by the FastMCP team. While the FastMCP framework will always be fully open-source, we created FastMCP Cloud to solve the deployment challenges we've seen developers face. Our goal is to provide the absolute fastest way to make your MCP server available to LLM clients like Claude and Cursor.

FastMCP Cloud is a young product and we welcome your feedback. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aGsSC3yDF4) to share your thoughts and ideas, and you can expect to see new features and improvements every week.

<Note>
  FastMCP Cloud supports both **FastMCP 2.0** servers and also **FastMCP 1.0** servers that were created with the official MCP Python SDK.
</Note>

<Tip>
  FastMCP Cloud is completely free while in beta!
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

To use FastMCP Cloud, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. In addition, you'll need a GitHub repo that contains a FastMCP server instance. If you don't want to create one yet, you can proceed to [step 1](#step-1-create-a-project) and use the FastMCP Cloud quickstart repo.

Your repo can be public or private, but must include at least a Python file that contains a FastMCP server instance.

<Tip>
  To ensure your file is compatible with FastMCP Cloud, you can run `fastmcp inspect <file.py:server_object>` to see what FastMCP Cloud will see when it runs your server.
</Tip>

If you have a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` in the repo, FastMCP Cloud will automatically detect your server's dependencies and install them for you. Note that your file *can* have an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, but it will be ignored by FastMCP Cloud.

For example, a minimal server file might look like:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Getting Started

There are just three steps to deploying a server to FastMCP Cloud:

### Step 1: Create a Project

Visit [fastmcp.cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) and sign in with your GitHub account. Then, create a project. Each project corresponds to a GitHub repo, and you can create one from either your own repo or using the FastMCP Cloud quickstart repo.

Next, you'll be prompted to configure your project.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=4c221cd0734a6fd7b634970ac0aff73a" alt="FastMCP Cloud Configuration Screen" data-og-width="2656" width="2656" data-og-height="1808" height="1808" data-path="assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=168c690ac8a8e5098b05c8e23cf9173b 280w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=16cd0ee3977040439e9982e8aa438ffe 560w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=4b0265a257b6a9510c85863da1b5e17a 840w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=e898cfe81f01bf14312d98902be41b5c 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=d97a7ddad8e60c86e303faa8e37d784c 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/assets/images/fastmcp_cloud/create_project.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=51b9fa2763dc5064c1eef4f8f90af77a 2500w" />

The configuration screen lets you specify:

* **Name**: The name of your project. This will be used to generate a unique URL for your server.
* **Entrypoint**: The Python file containing your FastMCP server (e.g., `echo.py`). This field has the same syntax as the `fastmcp run` command, for example `echo.py:my_server` to specify a specific object in the file.
* **Authentication**: If disabled, your server is open to the public. If enabled, only other members of your FastMCP Cloud organization will be able to connect.

Note that FastMCP Cloud will automatically detect yours server's Python dependencies from either a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file.

### Step 2: Deploy Your Server

Once you configure your project, FastMCP Cloud will:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build your FastMCP server
3. Deploy it to a unique URL
4. Make it immediately available for connections

FastMCP Cloud will monitor your repo and redeploy your server whenever you push a change to the `main` branch. In addition, FastMCP Cloud will build and deploy servers for every PR your open, hosting them on unique URLs, so you can test changes before updating your production server.

### Step 3: Connect to Your Server

Once your server is deployed, it will be accessible at a URL like:

```
https://your-project-name.fastmcp.app/mcp
```

You should be able to connect to it as soon as you see the deployment succeed! FastMCP Cloud provides instant connection options for popular LLM clients:

# HTTP Deployment
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/http

Deploy your FastMCP server over HTTP for remote access

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<Tip>
  STDIO transport is perfect for local development and desktop applications. But to unlock the full potential of MCP—centralized services, multi-client access, and network availability—you need remote HTTP deployment.
</Tip>

This guide walks you through deploying your FastMCP server as a remote MCP service that's accessible via a URL. Once deployed, your MCP server will be available over the network, allowing multiple clients to connect simultaneously and enabling integration with cloud-based LLM applications. This guide focuses specifically on remote MCP deployment, not local STDIO servers.

## Choosing Your Approach

FastMCP provides two ways to deploy your server as an HTTP service. Understanding the trade-offs helps you choose the right approach for your needs.

The **direct HTTP server** approach is simpler and perfect for getting started quickly. You modify your server's `run()` method to use HTTP transport, and FastMCP handles all the web server configuration. This approach works well for standalone deployments where you want your MCP server to be the only service running on a port.

The **ASGI application** approach gives you more control and flexibility. Instead of running the server directly, you create an ASGI application that can be served by Uvicorn. This approach is better when you need advanced server features like multiple workers, custom middleware, or when you're integrating with existing web applications.

### Direct HTTP Server

The simplest way to get your MCP server online is to use the built-in `run()` method with HTTP transport. This approach handles all the server configuration for you and is ideal when you want a standalone MCP server without additional complexity.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool
def process_data(input: str) -> str:
    """Process data on the server"""
    return f"Processed: {input}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

Run your server with a simple Python command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
python server.py
```

Your server is now accessible at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (or use your server's actual IP address for remote access).

This approach is ideal when you want to get online quickly with minimal configuration. It's perfect for internal tools, development environments, or simple deployments where you don't need advanced server features. The built-in server handles all the HTTP details, letting you focus on your MCP implementation.

### ASGI Application

For production deployments, you'll often want more control over how your server runs. FastMCP can create a standard ASGI application that works with any ASGI server like Uvicorn, Gunicorn, or Hypercorn. This approach is particularly useful when you need to configure advanced server options, run multiple workers, or integrate with existing infrastructure.

```python app.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool
def process_data(input: str) -> str:
    """Process data on the server"""
    return f"Processed: {input}"

# Create ASGI application
app = mcp.http_app()
```

Run with any ASGI server - here's an example with Uvicorn:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Your server is accessible at the same URL: `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (or use your server's actual IP address for remote access).

The ASGI approach shines in production environments where you need reliability and performance. You can run multiple worker processes to handle concurrent requests, add custom middleware for logging or monitoring, integrate with existing deployment pipelines, or mount your MCP server as part of a larger application.

## Configuring Your Server

### Custom Path

By default, your MCP server is accessible at `/mcp/` on your domain. You can customize this path to fit your URL structure or avoid conflicts with existing endpoints. This is particularly useful when integrating MCP into an existing application or following specific API conventions.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Option 1: With mcp.run()
mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, path="/api/mcp/")

# Option 2: With ASGI app
app = mcp.http_app(path="/api/mcp/")
```

Now your server is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/mcp/`.

### Authentication

<Warning>
  Authentication is **highly recommended** for remote MCP servers. Some LLM clients require authentication for remote servers and will refuse to connect without it.
</Warning>

FastMCP supports multiple authentication methods to secure your remote server. See the [Authentication Overview](/servers/auth/authentication) for complete configuration options including Bearer tokens, JWT, and OAuth.

If you're mounting an authenticated server under a path prefix, see [Mounting Authenticated Servers](#mounting-authenticated-servers) below for important routing considerations.

### Health Checks

Health check endpoints are essential for monitoring your deployed server and ensuring it's responding correctly. FastMCP allows you to add custom routes alongside your MCP endpoints, making it easy to implement health checks that work with both deployment approaches.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

@mcp.custom_route("/health", methods=["GET"])
async def health_check(request):
    return JSONResponse({"status": "healthy", "service": "mcp-server"})
```

This health endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:8000/health` and can be used by load balancers, monitoring systems, or deployment platforms to verify your server is running.

### Custom Middleware

<VersionBadge version="2.3.2" />

Add custom Starlette middleware to your FastMCP ASGI apps:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# Create your FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

# Define middleware
middleware = [
    Middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
]

# Create ASGI app with middleware
http_app = mcp.http_app(middleware=middleware)
```

### CORS for Browser-Based Clients

<Tip>
  Most MCP clients, including those that you access through a browser like ChatGPT or Claude, don't need CORS configuration. Only enable CORS if you're working with an MCP client that connects directly from a browser, such as debugging tools or inspectors.
</Tip>

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is needed when JavaScript running in a web browser connects directly to your MCP server. This is different from using an LLM through a browser—in that case, the browser connects to the LLM service, and the LLM service connects to your MCP server (no CORS needed).

Browser-based MCP clients that need CORS include:

* **MCP Inspector** - Browser-based debugging tool for testing MCP servers
* **Custom browser-based MCP clients** - If you're building a web app that directly connects to MCP servers

For these scenarios, add CORS middleware with the specific headers required for MCP protocol:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

# Configure CORS for browser-based clients
middleware = [
    Middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins; use specific origins for security
        allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
        allow_headers=[
            "mcp-protocol-version",
            "mcp-session-id",
            "Authorization",
            "Content-Type",
        ],
        expose_headers=["mcp-session-id"],
    )
]

app = mcp.http_app(middleware=middleware)
```

**Key configuration details:**

* **`allow_origins`**: Specify exact origins (e.g., `["http://localhost:3000"]`) rather than `["*"]` for production deployments
* **`allow_headers`**: Must include `mcp-protocol-version`, `mcp-session-id`, and `Authorization` (for authenticated servers)
* **`expose_headers`**: Must include `mcp-session-id` so JavaScript can read the session ID from responses and send it in subsequent requests

Without `expose_headers=["mcp-session-id"]`, browsers will receive the session ID but JavaScript won't be able to access it, causing session management to fail.

<Warning>
  **Production Security**: Never use `allow_origins=["*"]` in production. Specify the exact origins of your browser-based clients. Using wildcards exposes your server to unauthorized access from any website.
</Warning>

## Integration with Web Frameworks

If you already have a web application running, you can add MCP capabilities by mounting a FastMCP server as a sub-application. This allows you to expose MCP tools alongside your existing API endpoints, sharing the same domain and infrastructure. The MCP server becomes just another route in your application, making it easy to manage and deploy.

### Mounting in Starlette

Mount your FastMCP server in a Starlette application:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount

# Create your FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def analyze(data: str) -> dict:
    return {"result": f"Analyzed: {data}"}

# Create the ASGI app
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')

# Create a Starlette app and mount the MCP server
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        Mount("/mcp-server", app=mcp_app),
        # Add other routes as needed
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)
```

The MCP endpoint will be available at `/mcp-server/mcp/` of the resulting Starlette app.

<Warning>
  For Streamable HTTP transport, you **must** pass the lifespan context from the FastMCP app to the resulting Starlette app, as nested lifespans are not recognized. Otherwise, the FastMCP server's session manager will not be properly initialized.
</Warning>

#### Nested Mounts

You can create complex routing structures by nesting mounts:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount

# Create your FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

# Create the ASGI app
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')

# Create nested application structure
inner_app = Starlette(routes=[Mount("/inner", app=mcp_app)])
app = Starlette(
    routes=[Mount("/outer", app=inner_app)],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)
```

In this setup, the MCP server is accessible at the `/outer/inner/mcp/` path.

### FastAPI Integration

For FastAPI-specific integration patterns including both mounting MCP servers into FastAPI apps and generating MCP servers from FastAPI apps, see the [FastAPI Integration guide](/integrations/fastapi).

Here's a quick example showing how to add MCP to an existing FastAPI application:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Your existing API
api = FastAPI()

@api.get("/api/status")
def status():
    return {"status": "ok"}

# Create your MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("API Tools")

@mcp.tool
def query_database(query: str) -> dict:
    """Run a database query"""
    return {"result": "data"}

# Mount MCP at /mcp
api.mount("/mcp", mcp.http_app())

# Run with: uvicorn app:api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Your existing API remains at `http://localhost:8000/api` while MCP is available at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

## Mounting Authenticated Servers

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

<Tip>
  This section only applies if you're **mounting an OAuth-protected FastMCP server under a path prefix** (like `/api`) inside another application using `Mount()`.

  If you're deploying your FastMCP server at root level without any `Mount()` prefix, the well-known routes are automatically included in `mcp.http_app()` and you don't need to do anything special.
</Tip>

OAuth specifications (RFC 8414 and RFC 9728) require discovery metadata to be accessible at well-known paths under the root level of your domain. When you mount an OAuth-protected FastMCP server under a path prefix like `/api`, this creates a routing challenge: your operational OAuth endpoints move under the prefix, but discovery endpoints must remain at the root.

<Warning>
  **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

  1. **Forgetting to mount `.well-known` routes at root** - FastMCP cannot do this automatically when your server is mounted under a path prefix. You must explicitly mount well-known routes at the root level.

  2. **Including mount prefix in both base\_url AND mcp\_path** - The mount prefix (like `/api`) should only be in `base_url`, not in `mcp_path`. Otherwise you'll get double paths.

     ✅ **Correct:**

     ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
     base_url = "http://localhost:8000/api"
     mcp_path = "/mcp"
     # Result: /api/mcp
     ```

     ❌ **Wrong:**

     ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
     base_url = "http://localhost:8000/api"
     mcp_path = "/api/mcp"
     # Result: /api/api/mcp (double prefix!)
     ```

  3. **Not setting issuer\_url when mounting** - Without `issuer_url` set to root level, OAuth discovery will attempt path-scoped discovery first (which will 404), adding unnecessary error logs.

  Follow the configuration instructions below to set up mounting correctly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **CORS Middleware Conflicts:**

  If you're integrating FastMCP into an existing application with its own CORS middleware, be aware that layering CORS middleware can cause conflicts (such as 404 errors on `.well-known` routes or OPTIONS requests).

  FastMCP and the MCP SDK already handle CORS for OAuth routes. If you need CORS on your own application routes, consider using the sub-app pattern: mount FastMCP and your routes as separate apps, each with their own middleware, rather than adding application-wide CORS middleware.
</Warning>

### Route Types

OAuth-protected MCP servers expose two categories of routes:

**Operational routes** handle the OAuth flow and MCP protocol:

* `/authorize` - OAuth authorization endpoint
* `/token` - Token exchange endpoint
* `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handler
* `/mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint

**Discovery routes** provide metadata for OAuth clients:

* `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` - Authorization server metadata
* `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/*` - Protected resource metadata

When you mount your MCP app under a prefix, operational routes move with it, but discovery routes must stay at root level for RFC compliance.

### Configuration Parameters

Three parameters control where routes are located and how they combine:

**`base_url`** tells clients where to find operational endpoints. This includes any Starlette `Mount()` path prefix (e.g., `/api`):

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
base_url="http://localhost:8000/api"  # Includes mount prefix
```

**`mcp_path`** is the internal FastMCP endpoint path, which gets appended to `base_url`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp_path="/mcp"  # Internal MCP path, NOT the mount prefix
```

**`issuer_url`** tells clients where to find discovery metadata. This should point to the root level of your server where well-known routes are mounted:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
issuer_url="http://localhost:8000"  # Root level, no prefix
```

**Key Invariant:** `base_url + mcp_path = actual externally-accessible MCP URL`

Example:

* `base_url`: `http://localhost:8000/api` (mount prefix `/api`)
* `mcp_path`: `/mcp` (internal path)
* Result: `http://localhost:8000/api/mcp` (final MCP endpoint)

Note that the mount prefix (`/api` from `Mount("/api", ...)`) goes in `base_url`, while `mcp_path` is just the internal MCP route. Don't include the mount prefix in both places or you'll get `/api/api/mcp`.

### Mounting Strategy

When mounting an OAuth-protected server under a path prefix, declare your URLs upfront to make the relationships clear:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount

# Define the routing structure
ROOT_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
MOUNT_PREFIX = "/api"
MCP_PATH = "/mcp"
```

Create the auth provider with both `issuer_url` and `base_url`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    issuer_url=ROOT_URL,  # Discovery metadata at root
    base_url=f"{ROOT_URL}{MOUNT_PREFIX}",  # Operational endpoints under prefix
)
```

Create the MCP app, which generates operational routes at the specified path:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP("Protected Server", auth=auth)
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path=MCP_PATH)
```

Retrieve the discovery routes from the auth provider. The `mcp_path` argument should match the path used when creating the MCP app:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
well_known_routes = auth.get_well_known_routes(mcp_path=MCP_PATH)
```

Finally, mount everything in the Starlette app with discovery routes at root and the MCP app under the prefix:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        *well_known_routes,  # Discovery routes at root level
        Mount(MOUNT_PREFIX, app=mcp_app),  # Operational routes under prefix
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)
```

This configuration produces the following URL structure:

* MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/mcp`
* OAuth authorization: `http://localhost:8000/api/authorize`
* OAuth callback: `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback`
* Authorization server metadata: `http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
* Protected resource metadata: `http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp`

### Complete Example

Here's a complete working example showing all the pieces together:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
import uvicorn

# Define routing structure
ROOT_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
MOUNT_PREFIX = "/api"
MCP_PATH = "/mcp"

# Create OAuth provider
auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    issuer_url=ROOT_URL,
    base_url=f"{ROOT_URL}{MOUNT_PREFIX}",
)

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Protected Server", auth=auth)

@mcp.tool
def analyze(data: str) -> dict:
    return {"result": f"Analyzed: {data}"}

# Create MCP app
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path=MCP_PATH)

# Get discovery routes for root level
well_known_routes = auth.get_well_known_routes(mcp_path=MCP_PATH)

# Assemble the application
app = Starlette(
    routes=[
        *well_known_routes,
        Mount(MOUNT_PREFIX, app=mcp_app),
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

For more details on OAuth authentication, see the [Authentication guide](/servers/auth).

## Production Deployment

### Running with Uvicorn

When deploying to production, you'll want to optimize your server for performance and reliability. Uvicorn provides several options to improve your server's capabilities:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run with basic configuration
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run with multiple workers for production
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

### Environment Variables

Production deployments should never hardcode sensitive information like API keys or authentication tokens. Instead, use environment variables to configure your server at runtime. This keeps your code secure and makes it easy to deploy the same code to different environments with different configurations.

Here's an example using bearer token authentication (though OAuth is recommended for production):

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import BearerTokenAuth

# Read configuration from environment
auth_token = os.environ.get("MCP_AUTH_TOKEN")
if auth_token:
    auth = BearerTokenAuth(token=auth_token)
    mcp = FastMCP("Production Server", auth=auth)
else:
    mcp = FastMCP("Production Server")

app = mcp.http_app()
```

Deploy with your secrets safely stored in environment variables:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=secret uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### OAuth Token Security

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

If you're using the [OAuth Proxy](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy), FastMCP issues its own JWT tokens to clients instead of forwarding upstream provider tokens. This maintains proper OAuth 2.0 token boundaries.

**Default Behavior (Development Only):**

By default, FastMCP automatically manages cryptographic keys:

* **Mac/Windows**: Keys are generated and stored in your system keyring, surviving server restarts. Suitable **only** for development and local testing.
* **Linux**: Keys are ephemeral (random salt at startup), so tokens are invalidated on restart.

This automatic approach is convenient for development but not suitable for production deployments.

**For Production:**

Production requires explicit key management to ensure tokens survive restarts and can be shared across multiple server instances. This requires the following two things working together:

1. **Explicit JWT signing key** for signing tokens issued to clients
2. **Persistent network-accessible storage** for upstream tokens (wrapped in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive data at rest)

**Configuration:**

Add two parameters to your auth provider:

```python {8-12} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    ),
    base_url="https://your-server.com"  # use HTTPS
)
```

Both parameters are required for production. Without an explicit signing key, keys are signed using a key derived from the client\_secret, which will cause invalidation upon rotation of the client secret. Without persistent storage, tokens are local to the server and won't be trusted across hosts. **Wrap your storage backend in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without encryption, tokens are stored in plaintext.

For more details on the token architecture and key management, see [OAuth Proxy Key and Storage Management](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#key-and-storage-management).

## Testing Your Deployment

Once your server is deployed, you'll need to verify it's accessible and functioning correctly. For comprehensive testing strategies including connectivity tests, client testing, and authentication testing, see the [Testing Your Server](/development/tests) guide.

## Hosting Your Server

This guide has shown you how to create an HTTP-accessible MCP server, but you'll still need a hosting provider to make it available on the internet. Your FastMCP server can run anywhere that supports Python web applications:

* **Cloud VMs** (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs)
* **Container platforms** (Cloud Run, Container Instances, ECS)
* **Platform-as-a-Service** (Railway, Render, Vercel)
* **Edge platforms** (Cloudflare Workers)
* **Kubernetes clusters** (self-managed or managed)

The key requirements are Python 3.10+ support and the ability to expose an HTTP port. Most providers will require you to package your server (requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.) according to their deployment format. For managed, zero-configuration deployment, see [FastMCP Cloud](/deployment/fastmcp-cloud).


# Running Your Server
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/running-server

Learn how to run your FastMCP server locally for development and testing

FastMCP servers can be run in different ways depending on your needs. This guide focuses on running servers locally for development and testing. For production deployment to a URL, see the [HTTP Deployment](/deployment/http) guide.

## The `run()` Method

Every FastMCP server needs to be started to accept connections. The simplest way to run a server is by calling the `run()` method on your FastMCP instance. This method starts the server and blocks until it's stopped, handling all the connection management for you.

<Tip>
  For maximum compatibility, it's best practice to place the `run()` call within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This ensures the server starts only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
</Tip>

```python {9-10} my_server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

You can now run this MCP server by executing `python my_server.py`.

## Transport Protocols

MCP servers communicate with clients through different transport protocols. Think of transports as the "language" your server speaks to communicate with clients. FastMCP supports three main transport protocols, each designed for specific use cases and deployment scenarios.

The choice of transport determines how clients connect to your server, what network capabilities are available, and how many clients can connect simultaneously. Understanding these transports helps you choose the right approach for your application.

### STDIO Transport (Default)

STDIO (Standard Input/Output) is the default transport for FastMCP servers. When you call `run()` without arguments, your server uses STDIO transport. This transport communicates through standard input and output streams, making it perfect for command-line tools and desktop applications like Claude Desktop.

With STDIO transport, the client spawns a new server process for each session and manages its lifecycle. The server reads MCP messages from stdin and writes responses to stdout. This is why STDIO servers don't stay running - they're started on-demand by the client.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # Uses STDIO transport by default
```

STDIO is ideal for:

* Local development and testing
* Claude Desktop integration
* Command-line tools
* Single-user applications

### HTTP Transport (Streamable)

HTTP transport turns your MCP server into a web service accessible via a URL. This transport uses the Streamable HTTP protocol, which allows clients to connect over the network. Unlike STDIO where each client gets its own process, an HTTP server can handle multiple clients simultaneously.

The Streamable HTTP protocol provides full bidirectional communication between client and server, supporting all MCP operations including streaming responses. This makes it the recommended choice for network-based deployments.

To use HTTP transport, specify it in the `run()` method along with networking options:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start an HTTP server on port 8000
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

Your server is now accessible at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`. This URL is the MCP endpoint that clients will connect to. HTTP transport enables:

* Network accessibility
* Multiple concurrent clients
* Integration with web infrastructure
* Remote deployment capabilities

For production HTTP deployment with authentication and advanced configuration, see the [HTTP Deployment](/deployment/http) guide.

### SSE Transport (Legacy)

Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport was the original HTTP-based transport for MCP. While still supported for backward compatibility, it has limitations compared to the newer Streamable HTTP transport. SSE only supports server-to-client streaming, making it less efficient for bidirectional communication.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # SSE transport - use HTTP instead for new projects
    mcp.run(transport="sse", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

We recommend using HTTP transport instead of SSE for all new projects. SSE remains available only for compatibility with older clients that haven't upgraded to Streamable HTTP.

### Choosing the Right Transport

Each transport serves different needs. STDIO is perfect when you need simple, local execution - it's what Claude Desktop and most command-line tools expect. HTTP transport is essential when you need network access, want to serve multiple clients, or plan to deploy your server remotely. SSE exists only for backward compatibility and shouldn't be used in new projects.

Consider your deployment scenario: Are you building a tool for local use? STDIO is your best choice. Need a centralized service that multiple clients can access? HTTP transport is the way to go.

## The FastMCP CLI

FastMCP provides a powerful command-line interface for running servers without modifying the source code. The CLI can automatically find and run your server with different transports, manage dependencies, and handle development workflows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py
```

The CLI automatically finds a FastMCP instance in your file (named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`) and runs it with the specified options. This is particularly useful for testing different transports or configurations without changing your code.

### Dependency Management

The CLI integrates with `uv` to manage Python environments and dependencies:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run with a specific Python version
fastmcp run server.py --python 3.11

# Run with additional packages
fastmcp run server.py --with pandas --with numpy

# Run with dependencies from a requirements file
fastmcp run server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt

# Combine multiple options
fastmcp run server.py --python 3.10 --with httpx --transport http

# Run within a specific project directory
fastmcp run server.py --project /path/to/project
```

<Note>
  When using `--python`, `--with`, `--project`, or `--with-requirements`, the server runs via `uv run` subprocess instead of using your local environment.
</Note>

### Passing Arguments to Servers

When servers accept command line arguments (using argparse, click, or other libraries), you can pass them after `--`:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run config_server.py -- --config config.json
fastmcp run database_server.py -- --database-path /tmp/db.sqlite --debug
```

This is useful for servers that need configuration files, database paths, API keys, or other runtime options.

For more CLI features including development mode with the MCP Inspector, see the [CLI documentation](/patterns/cli).

### Async Usage

FastMCP servers are built on async Python, but the framework provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs to fit your application's needs. The `run()` method we've been using is actually a synchronous wrapper around the async server implementation.

For applications that are already running in an async context, FastMCP provides the `run_async()` method:

```python {10-12} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async def main():
    # Use run_async() in async contexts
    await mcp.run_async(transport="http", port=8000)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

<Warning>
  The `run()` method cannot be called from inside an async function because it creates its own async event loop internally. If you attempt to call `run()` from inside an async function, you'll get an error about the event loop already running.

  Always use `run_async()` inside async functions and `run()` in synchronous contexts.
</Warning>

Both `run()` and `run_async()` accept the same transport arguments, so all the examples above apply to both methods.

## Custom Routes

When using HTTP transport, you might want to add custom web endpoints alongside your MCP server. This is useful for health checks, status pages, or simple APIs. FastMCP lets you add custom routes using the `@custom_route` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.custom_route("/health", methods=["GET"])
async def health_check(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    return PlainTextResponse("OK")

@mcp.tool
def process(data: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {data}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http")  # Health check at http://localhost:8000/health
```

Custom routes are served by the same web server as your MCP endpoint. They're available at the root of your domain while the MCP endpoint is at `/mcp/`. For more complex web applications, consider [mounting your MCP server into a FastAPI or Starlette app](/deployment/http#integration-with-web-frameworks).

## Alternative Initialization Patterns

The `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern works well for standalone scripts, but some deployment scenarios require different approaches. FastMCP handles these cases automatically.

### CLI-Only Servers

When using the FastMCP CLI, you don't need the `if __name__` block at all. The CLI will find your FastMCP instance and run it:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")  # CLI looks for 'mcp', 'server', or 'app'

@mcp.tool
def process(data: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {data}"

# No if __name__ block needed - CLI will find and run 'mcp'
```

### ASGI Applications

For ASGI deployment (running with Uvicorn or similar), you'll want to create an ASGI application object. This approach is common in production deployments where you need more control over the server configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# app.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

def create_app():
    mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def process(data: str) -> str:
        return f"Processed: {data}"
    
    return mcp.http_app()

app = create_app()  # Uvicorn will use this
```

See the [HTTP Deployment](/deployment/http) guide for more ASGI deployment patterns.


# Project Configuration
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/server-configuration

Use fastmcp.json for portable, declarative project configuration

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

FastMCP supports declarative configuration through `fastmcp.json` files. This is the canonical and preferred way to configure FastMCP projects, providing a single source of truth for server settings, dependencies, and deployment options that replaces complex command-line arguments.

The `fastmcp.json` file is designed to be a portable description of your server configuration that can be shared across environments and teams. When running from a `fastmcp.json` file, you can override any configuration values using CLI arguments.

## Overview

The `fastmcp.json` configuration file allows you to define all aspects of your FastMCP server in a structured, shareable format. Instead of remembering command-line arguments or writing shell scripts, you declare your server's configuration once and use it everywhere.

When you have a `fastmcp.json` file, running your server becomes as simple as:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run the server using the configuration
fastmcp run fastmcp.json

# Or if fastmcp.json exists in the current directory
fastmcp run
```

This configuration approach ensures reproducible deployments across different environments, from local development to production servers. It works seamlessly with Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions, and any MCP-compatible client.

## File Structure

The `fastmcp.json` configuration answers three fundamental questions about your server:

* **Source** = WHERE does your server code live?
* **Environment** = WHAT environment setup does it require?
* **Deployment** = HOW should the server run?

This conceptual model helps you understand the purpose of each configuration section and organize your settings effectively. The configuration file maps directly to these three concerns:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    // WHERE: Location of your server code
    "type": "filesystem",  // Optional, defaults to "filesystem"
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    // WHAT: Environment setup and dependencies
    "type": "uv",  // Optional, defaults to "uv"
    "python": ">=3.10",
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "numpy"]
  },
  "deployment": {
    // HOW: Runtime configuration
    "transport": "stdio",
    "log_level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

Only the `source` field is required. The `environment` and `deployment` sections are optional and provide additional configuration when needed.

### JSON Schema Support

FastMCP provides JSON schemas for IDE autocomplete and validation. Add the schema reference to your `fastmcp.json` for enhanced developer experience:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  }
}
```

Two schema URLs are available:

* **Version-specific**: `https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json`
* **Latest version**: `https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/latest.json`

Modern IDEs like VS Code will automatically provide autocomplete suggestions, validation, and inline documentation when the schema is specified.

### Source Configuration

The source configuration determines **WHERE** your server code lives. It tells FastMCP how to find and load your server, whether it's a local Python file, a remote repository, or hosted in the cloud. This section is required and forms the foundation of your configuration.

<Card icon="code" title="Source">
  <ParamField body="source" type="object" required>
    The server source configuration that determines where your server code lives.

    <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="filesystem">
      The source type identifier that determines which implementation to use. Currently supports `"filesystem"` for local files. Future releases will add support for `"git"` and `"cloud"` source types.
    </ParamField>

    <Expandable title="FileSystemSource">
      When `type` is `"filesystem"` (or omitted), the source points to a local Python file containing your FastMCP server:

      <ParamField body="path" type="string" required>
        Path to the Python file containing your FastMCP server.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="entrypoint" type="string">
        Name of the server instance or factory function within the module:

        * Can be a FastMCP server instance (e.g., `mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")`)
        * Can be a function with no arguments that returns a FastMCP server
        * If not specified, FastMCP searches for common names: `mcp`, `server`, or `app`
      </ParamField>

      **Example:**

      ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
      "source": {
        "type": "filesystem",
        "path": "src/server.py",
        "entrypoint": "mcp"
      }
      ```

      Note: File paths are resolved relative to the configuration file's location.
    </Expandable>
  </ParamField>
</Card>

<Note>
  **Future Source Types**

  Future releases will support additional source types:

  * **Git repositories** (`type: "git"`) for loading server code directly from version control
  * **FastMCP Cloud** (`type: "cloud"`) for hosted servers with automatic scaling and management
</Note>

### Environment Configuration

The environment configuration determines **WHAT** environment setup your server requires. It controls the build-time setup of your Python environment, ensuring your server runs with the exact Python version and dependencies it requires. This section creates isolated, reproducible environments across different systems.

FastMCP uses an extensible environment system with a base `Environment` class that can be implemented by different environment providers. Currently, FastMCP supports the `UVEnvironment` for Python environment management using `uv`'s powerful dependency resolver.

<Card icon="code" title="Environment">
  <ParamField body="environment" type="object">
    Optional environment configuration. When specified, FastMCP uses the appropriate environment implementation to set up your server's runtime.

    <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="uv">
      The environment type identifier that determines which implementation to use. Currently supports `"uv"` for Python environments managed by uv. If omitted, defaults to `"uv"`.
    </ParamField>

    <Expandable title="UVEnvironment">
      When `type` is `"uv"` (or omitted), the environment uses uv to manage Python dependencies:

      <ParamField body="python" type="string">
        Python version constraint. Examples:

        * Exact version: `"3.12"`
        * Minimum version: `">=3.10"`

      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="dependencies" type="list[str]">
        List of pip packages with optional version specifiers (PEP 508 format).

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "dependencies": ["pandas>=2.0", "requests", "httpx"]
        ```
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="requirements" type="string">
        Path to a requirements.txt file, resolved relative to the config file location.

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "requirements": "requirements.txt"
        ```
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="project" type="string">
        Path to a project directory containing pyproject.toml for uv project management.

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "project": "."
        ```
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="editable" type="list[string]">
        List of paths to packages to install in editable/development mode. Useful for local development when you want changes to be reflected immediately. Supports multiple packages for monorepo setups or shared libraries.

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "editable": ["."]
        ```

        Or with multiple packages:

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "editable": [".", "../shared-lib", "/path/to/another-package"]
        ```
      </ParamField>

      **Example:**

      ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
      "environment": {
        "type": "uv",
        "python": ">=3.10",
        "dependencies": ["pandas", "numpy"],
        "editable": ["."]
      }
      ```

      Note: When any UVEnvironment field is specified, FastMCP automatically creates an isolated environment using `uv` before running your server.
    </Expandable>
  </ParamField>
</Card>

When environment configuration is provided, FastMCP:

1. Detects the environment type (defaults to `"uv"` if not specified)
2. Creates an isolated environment using the appropriate provider
3. Installs the specified dependencies
4. Runs your server in this clean environment

This build-time setup ensures your server always has the dependencies it needs, without polluting your system Python or conflicting with other projects.

<Note>
  **Future Environment Types**

  Similar to source types, future releases may support additional environment types for different runtime requirements, such as Docker containers or language-specific environments beyond Python.
</Note>

### Deployment Configuration

The deployment configuration controls **HOW** your server runs. It defines the runtime behavior including network settings, environment variables, and execution context. These settings determine how your server operates when it executes, from transport protocols to logging levels.

Environment variables are included in this section because they're runtime configuration that affects how your server behaves when it executes, not how its environment is built. The deployment configuration is applied every time your server starts, controlling its operational characteristics.

<Card icon="code" title="Deployment Fields">
  <ParamField body="deployment" type="object">
    Optional runtime configuration for the server.

    <Expandable title="Deployment Fields">
      <ParamField body="transport" type="string" default="stdio">
        Protocol for client communication:

        * `"stdio"`: Standard input/output for desktop clients
        * `"http"`: Network-accessible HTTP server
        * `"sse"`: Server-sent events
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="host" type="string" default="127.0.0.1">
        Network interface to bind (HTTP transport only):

        * `"WARNING"`: Warning messages
        * `"ERROR"`: Error messages only
        * `"CRITICAL"`: Critical errors only
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="env" type="object">
        Environment variables to set when running the server. Supports `${VAR_NAME}` syntax for runtime interpolation.

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "secret-key",

        }
        ```
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="cwd" type="string">
        Working directory for the server process. Relative paths are resolved from the config file location.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="args" type="list[str]">
        Command-line arguments to pass to the server, passed after `--` to the server's argument parser.

        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "args": ["--config", "server-config.json"]
        ```
      </ParamField>
    </Expandable>
  </ParamField>
</Card>

#### Environment Variable Interpolation

The `env` field in deployment configuration supports runtime interpolation of environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. This enables dynamic configuration based on your deployment environment:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "deployment": {
    "env": {
      "API_URL": "https://api.${ENVIRONMENT}.example.com",
      "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASS}@${DB_HOST}/myapp",
      "CACHE_KEY": "myapp_${ENVIRONMENT}_${VERSION}"
    }
  }
}
```

When the server starts, FastMCP replaces `${ENVIRONMENT}`, `${DB_USER}`, etc. with values from your system's environment variables. If a variable doesn't exist, the placeholder is preserved as-is.

**Example**: If your system has `ENVIRONMENT=production` and `DB_HOST=db.example.com`:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
// Configuration
{
  "deployment": {
    "env": {
      "API_URL": "https://api.${ENVIRONMENT}.example.com",
      "DB_HOST": "${DB_HOST}"
    }
  }
}

// Result at runtime
{
  "API_URL": "https://api.production.example.com",
  "DB_HOST": "db.example.com"
}
```

This feature is particularly useful for:

* Deploying the same configuration across development, staging, and production
* Keeping sensitive values out of configuration files
* Building dynamic URLs and connection strings
* Creating environment-specific prefixes or suffixes

## Usage with CLI Commands

FastMCP automatically detects and uses a file specifically named `fastmcp.json` in the current directory, making server execution simple and consistent. Files with FastMCP configuration format but different names are not auto-detected and must be specified explicitly:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Auto-detect fastmcp.json in current directory
cd my-project
fastmcp run  # No arguments needed!

# Or specify a configuration file explicitly
fastmcp run prod.fastmcp.json

# Skip environment setup when already in a uv environment
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env

# Skip source preparation when source is already prepared
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-source

# Skip both environment and source preparation
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env --skip-source
```

### Pre-building Environments

You can use `fastmcp project prepare` to create a persistent uv project with all dependencies pre-installed:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Create a persistent environment
fastmcp project prepare fastmcp.json --output-dir ./env

# Use the pre-built environment to run the server
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --project ./env
```

This pattern separates environment setup (slow) from server execution (fast), useful for deployment scenarios.

### Using an Existing Environment

By default, FastMCP creates an isolated environment with `uv` based on your configuration. When you already have a suitable Python environment, use the `--skip-env` flag to skip environment creation:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env
```

**When you already have an environment:**

* You're in an activated virtual environment with all dependencies installed
* You're inside a Docker container with pre-installed dependencies
* You're in a CI/CD pipeline that pre-builds the environment
* You're using a system-wide installation with all required packages
* You're in a uv-managed environment (prevents infinite recursion)

This flag tells FastMCP: "I already have everything installed, just run the server."

### Using an Existing Source

When working with source types that require preparation (future support for git repositories or cloud sources), use the `--skip-source` flag when you already have the source code available:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-source
```

**When you already have the source:**

* You've previously cloned a git repository and don't need to re-fetch
* You have a cached copy of a cloud-hosted server
* You're in a CI/CD pipeline where source checkout is a separate step
* You're iterating locally on already-downloaded code

This flag tells FastMCP: "I already have the source code, skip any download/clone steps."

Note: For filesystem sources (local Python files), this flag has no effect since they don't require preparation.

The configuration file works with all FastMCP commands:

* **`run`** - Start the server in production mode
* **`dev`** - Launch with the Inspector UI for development
* **`inspect`** - View server capabilities and configuration
* **`install`** - Install to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP clients

When no file argument is provided, FastMCP searches the current directory for `fastmcp.json`. This means you can simply navigate to your project directory and run `fastmcp run` to start your server with all its configured settings.

### CLI Override Behavior

Command-line arguments take precedence over configuration file values, allowing ad-hoc adjustments without modifying the file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Config specifies port 3000, CLI overrides to 8080
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --port 8080

# Config specifies stdio, CLI overrides to HTTP
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --transport http

# Add extra dependencies not in config
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --with requests --with httpx
```

This precedence order enables:

* Quick testing of different settings
* Environment-specific overrides in deployment scripts
* Debugging with increased log levels
* Temporary configuration changes

### Custom Naming Patterns

You can use different configuration files for different environments:

* `fastmcp.json` - Default configuration
* `dev.fastmcp.json` - Development settings
* `prod.fastmcp.json` - Production settings
* `test_fastmcp.json` - Test configuration

Any file with "fastmcp.json" in the name is recognized as a configuration file.

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Configuration">
    A minimal configuration for a simple server:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    {
      "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
      "source": {
        "path": "server.py",
        "entrypoint": "mcp"
      }
    }
    ```

    This configuration explicitly specifies the server entrypoint (`mcp`), making it clear which server instance or factory function to use. Uses all defaults: STDIO transport, no special dependencies, standard logging.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Development Configuration">
    A configuration optimized for local development:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}

        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Production Configuration">
    A production-ready configuration with full dependency management:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    {
      "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",

        "requirements": "requirements/production.txt",
        "project": "."
      },
      // HOW should it run?
      "deployment": {
        "transport": "http",
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 3000,
        "path": "/api/mcp/",
        "log_level": "INFO",
        "env": {
          "ENV": "production",
          "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com",

        },
        "cwd": "/app",
        "args": ["--workers", "4"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Science Server">
    Configuration for a data analysis server with scientific packages:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    {
      "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
      "source": {
        "path": "analysis_server.py",

          "pandas>=2.0",
          "numpy",
          "scikit-learn",
          "matplotlib",
          "jupyterlab"
        ]
      },
      "deployment": {

          "MATPLOTLIB_BACKEND": "Agg",
          "DATA_PATH": "./datasets"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-Environment Setup">
    You can maintain multiple configuration files for different environments:

    **dev.fastmcp.json**:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    {
      "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
      "source": {
        "path": "server.py",
        "entrypoint": "mcp"
      },
      "deployment": {
        "transport": "http",
        "log_level": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
    ```

    **prod.fastmcp.json**:

    ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    {
      "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
      "source": {
        "path": "server.py",
        "entrypoint": "mcp"
      },
      "environment": {
        "requirements": "requirements/production.txt"
      },
      "deployment": {
        "transport": "http",
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "log_level": "WARNING"
      }
    }
    ```

    Run different configurations:

    ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    fastmcp run dev.fastmcp.json   # Development
    fastmcp run prod.fastmcp.json  # Production
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Migrating from CLI Arguments

If you're currently using command-line arguments or shell scripts, migrating to `fastmcp.json` simplifies your workflow. Here's how common CLI patterns map to configuration:

**CLI Command**:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
uv run --with pandas --with requests \
  fastmcp run server.py \
  --transport http \
  --port 8000 \
  --log-level INFO
```

**Equivalent fastmcp.json**:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "http",
    "port": 8000,
    "log_level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

Now simply run:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run  # Automatically finds and uses fastmcp.json
```

The configuration file approach provides better documentation, easier sharing, and consistent execution across different environments while maintaining the flexibility to override settings when needed.

Development workflow for FastMCP contributors

Contributing to FastMCP means joining a community that values clean, maintainable code and thoughtful API design. All contributions are valued - from fixing typos in documentation to implementing major features.

## Issues

### Issue First, Code Second

**Every pull request requires a corresponding issue - no exceptions.** This requirement creates a collaborative space where approach, scope, and alignment are established before code is written. Issues serve as design documents where maintainers and contributors discuss implementation strategy, identify potential conflicts with existing patterns, and ensure proposed changes advance FastMCP's vision.

**FastMCP is an opinionated framework, not a kitchen sink.** The maintainers have strong beliefs about what FastMCP should and shouldn't do. Just because something takes N lines of code and you want it in fewer lines doesn't mean FastMCP should take on the maintenance burden or endorse that pattern. This is judged at the maintainers' discretion.

Use issues to understand scope BEFORE opening PRs. The issue discussion determines whether a feature belongs in core, contrib, or not at all.

### Writing Good Issues

FastMCP is an extremely highly-trafficked repository maintained by a very small team. Issues that appear to transfer burden to maintainers without any effort to validate the problem will be closed. Please help the maintainers help you by always providing a minimal reproducible example and clearly describing the problem.

**LLM-generated issues will be closed immediately.** Issues that contain paragraphs of unnecessary explanation, verbose problem descriptions, or obvious LLM authorship patterns obfuscate the actual problem and transfer burden to maintainers.

Write clear, concise issues that:

* State the problem directly
* Provide a minimal reproducible example
* Skip unnecessary background or context
* Take responsibility for clear communication

Issues may be labeled "Invalid" simply due to confusion caused by verbosity or not adhering to the guidelines outlined here.

## Pull Requests

PRs that deviate from FastMCP's core principles will be rejected regardless of implementation quality. **PRs are NOT for iterating on ideas** - they should only be opened for ideas that already have a bias toward acceptance based on issue discussion.

### Development Environment

#### Installation

To contribute to FastMCP, you'll need to set up a development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp.git
cd fastmcp

# Install all dependencies including dev tools
uv sync

# Install prek hooks
uv run prek install
```

In addition, some development commands require [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to be installed.

Prek hooks will run automatically on every commit to catch issues before they reach CI. If you see failures, fix them before committing - never commit broken code expecting to fix it later.

### Development Standards

#### Scope

Large pull requests create review bottlenecks and quality risks. Unless you're fixing a discrete bug or making an incredibly well-scoped change, keep PRs small and focused.

A PR that changes 50 lines across 3 files can be thoroughly reviewed in minutes. A PR that changes 500 lines across 20 files requires hours of careful analysis and often hides subtle issues.

Breaking large features into smaller PRs:

* Creates better review experiences
* Makes git history clear
* Simplifies debugging with bisect
* Reduces merge conflicts
* Gets your code merged faster

#### Code Quality

FastMCP values clarity over cleverness. Every line you write will be maintained by someone else - possibly years from now, possibly without context about your decisions.

**PRs can be rejected for two opposing reasons:**

1. **Insufficient quality** - Code that doesn't meet our standards for clarity, maintainability, or idiomaticity
2. **Overengineering** - Code that is overbearing, unnecessarily complex, or tries to be too clever

The focus is on idiomatic, high-quality Python. FastMCP uses patterns like `NotSet` type as an alternative to `None` in certain situations - follow existing patterns.

#### Required Practices

**Full type annotations** on all functions and methods. They catch bugs before runtime and serve as inline documentation.

**Async/await patterns** for all I/O operations. Even if your specific use case doesn't need concurrency, consistency means users can compose features without worrying about blocking operations.

**Descriptive names** make code self-documenting. `auth_token` is clear; `tok` requires mental translation.

**Specific exception types** make error handling predictable. Catching `ValueError` tells readers exactly what error you expect. Never use bare `except` clauses.

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Complex one-liners** are hard to debug and modify. Break operations into clear steps.

**Mutable default arguments** cause subtle bugs. Use `None` as the default and create the mutable object inside the function.

**Breaking established patterns** confuses readers. If you must deviate, discuss in the issue first.

### Prek Checks

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Runs automatically on commit, or manually:
uv run prek run --all-files
```

This runs three critical tools:

* **Ruff**: Linting and formatting
* **Prettier**: Code formatting
* **ty**: Static type checking

Pytest runs separately as a distinct workflow step after prek checks pass. CI will reject PRs that fail these checks. Always run them locally first.

### Testing

Tests are documentation that shows how features work. Good tests give reviewers confidence and help future maintainers understand intent.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run specific test directory
uv run pytest tests/server/ -v

# Run all tests before submitting PR
uv run pytest
```

Every new feature needs tests. See the [Testing Guide](/development/tests) for patterns and requirements.

### Documentation

A feature doesn't exist unless it's documented. Note that FastMCP's hosted documentation always tracks the main branch - users who want historical documentation can clone the repo, checkout a specific tag, and host it themselves.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Preview documentation locally
just docs
```

Documentation requirements:

* **Explain concepts in prose first** - Code without context is just syntax
* **Complete, runnable examples** - Every code block should be copy-pasteable
* **Register in docs.json** - Makes pages appear in navigation
* **Version badges** - Mark when features were added using `<VersionBadge />`

#### SDK Documentation

FastMCP's SDK documentation is auto-generated from the source code docstrings and type annotations. It is automatically updated on every merge to main by a GitHub Actions workflow, so users are *not* responsible for keeping the documentation up to date. However, to generate it proactively, you can use the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
just api-ref-all
```

### Submitting Your PR

#### Before Submitting

1. **Run all checks**: `uv run prek run --all-files && uv run pytest`
2. **Keep scope small**: One feature or fix per PR
3. **Write clear description**: Your PR description becomes permanent documentation
4. **Update docs**: Include documentation for API changes

#### PR Description

Write PR descriptions that explain:

* What problem you're solving
* Why you chose this approach
* Any trade-offs or alternatives considered
* Migration path for breaking changes

Focus on the "why" - the code shows the "what". Keep it concise but complete.

#### What We Look For

**Framework Philosophy**: FastMCP is NOT trying to do all things or provide all shortcuts. Features are rejected when they don't align with the framework's vision, even if perfectly implemented. The burden of proof is on the PR to demonstrate value.

**Code Quality**: We verify code follows existing patterns. Consistency reduces cognitive load. When every module works similarly, developers understand new code quickly.

**Test Coverage**: Not every line needs testing, but every behavior does. Tests document intent and protect against regressions.

**Breaking Changes**: May be acceptable in minor versions but must be clearly documented. See the [versioning policy](/development/releases#versioning-policy).

## Special Modules

**`contrib`**: Community-maintained patterns and utilities. Original authors maintain their contributions. Not representative of the core framework.

**`experimental`**: Maintainer-developed features that may preview future functionality. Can break or be deleted at any time without notice. Pin your FastMCP version when using these features.


# Releases
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/development/releases

FastMCP versioning and release process

FastMCP releases frequently to deliver features quickly in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem. We use semantic versioning pragmatically - the Model Context Protocol is young, patterns are still emerging, and waiting for perfect stability would mean missing opportunities to empower developers with better tools.

## Versioning Policy

### Semantic Versioning

**Major (x.0.0)**: Complete API redesigns

Major versions represent fundamental shifts. FastMCP 2.x is entirely different from 1.x in both implementation and design philosophy.

**Minor (2.x.0)**: New features and evolution

<Warning>
  Unlike traditional semantic versioning, minor versions **may** include [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) when necessary for the ecosystem's evolution. This flexibility is essential in a young ecosystem where perfect backwards compatibility would prevent important improvements.
</Warning>

FastMCP always targets the most current MCP Protocol version. Breaking changes in the MCP spec or MCP SDK automatically flow through to FastMCP - we prioritize staying current with the latest features and conventions over maintaining compatibility with older protocol versions.

**Patch (2.0.x)**: Bug fixes and refinements

Patch versions contain only bug fixes without breaking changes. These are safe updates you can apply with confidence.

### Breaking Changes

We permit breaking changes in minor versions because the MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving. Refusing to break problematic APIs would accumulate design debt that eventually makes the framework unusable. Each breaking change represents a deliberate decision to keep FastMCP aligned with the ecosystem's evolution.

When breaking changes occur:

* They only happen in minor versions (e.g., 2.3.x to 2.4.0)
* Release notes explain what changed and how to migrate
* We provide deprecation warnings at least 1 minor version in advance when possible
* Changes must substantially benefit users to justify disruption

The public API is what's covered by our compatibility guarantees - these are the parts of FastMCP you can rely on to remain stable within a minor version. The public API consists of:

* `FastMCP` server class, `Client` class, and FastMCP `Context`
* Core MCP components: `Tool`, `Prompt`, `Resource`, `ResourceTemplate`, and transports
* Their public methods and documented behaviors

Everything else (utilities, private methods, internal modules) may change without notice. This boundary lets us refactor internals and improve implementation details without breaking your code. For production stability, pin to specific versions.

<Warning>
  The `fastmcp.server.auth` module was introduced in 2.12.0 and is exempted from this policy temporarily, meaning it is *expected* to have breaking changes even on patch versions. This is because auth is a rapidly evolving part of the MCP spec and it would be dangerous to be beholden to old decisions. Please pin your FastMCP version if using authentication in production.

  We expect this exemption to last through at least the 2.12.x and 2.13.x release series.
</Warning>

### Production Use

Pin to exact versions:

```
fastmcp==2.11.0  # Good
fastmcp>=2.11.0  # Bad - will install breaking changes
```

## Creating Releases

Our release process is intentionally simple:

1. Create GitHub release with tag `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `v2.11.0`)
2. Generate release notes automatically, and curate or add additional editorial information as needed
3. GitHub releases automatically trigger PyPI deployments

This automation lets maintainers focus on code quality rather than release mechanics.

### Release Cadence

We follow a feature-driven release cadence rather than a fixed schedule. Minor versions ship approximately every 3-4 weeks when significant functionality is ready.

Patch releases ship promptly for:

* Critical bug fixes
* Security updates (immediate release)
* Regression fixes

This approach means you get improvements as soon as they're ready rather than waiting for arbitrary release dates.

Testing patterns and requirements for FastMCP

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Good tests are the foundation of reliable software. In FastMCP, we treat tests as first-class documentation that demonstrates how features work while protecting against regressions. Every new capability needs comprehensive tests that demonstrate correctness.

## FastMCP Tests

### Running Tests

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/server/test_auth.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=fastmcp

# Skip integration tests for faster runs
uv run pytest -m "not integration"

# Skip tests that spawn processes
uv run pytest -m "not integration and not client_process"
```

Tests should complete in under 1 second unless marked as integration tests. This speed encourages running them frequently, catching issues early.

### Test Organization

Our test organization mirrors the `src/` directory structure, creating a predictable mapping between code and tests. When you're working on `src/fastmcp/server/auth.py`, you'll find its tests in `tests/server/test_auth.py`. In rare cases tests are split further - for example, the OpenAPI tests are so comprehensive they're split across multiple files.

### Test Markers

We use pytest markers to categorize tests that require special resources or take longer to run:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_github_api_integration():
    """Test GitHub API integration with real service."""
    token = os.getenv("FASTMCP_GITHUB_TOKEN")
    if not token:
        pytest.skip("FASTMCP_GITHUB_TOKEN not available")
    
    # Test against real GitHub API
    client = GitHubClient(token)
    repos = await client.list_repos("jlowin")
    assert "fastmcp" in [repo.name for repo in repos]

@pytest.mark.client_process
async def test_stdio_transport():
    """Test STDIO transport with separate process."""
    # This spawns a subprocess
    async with Client("python examples/simple_echo.py") as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("echo", {"message": "test"})
        assert result.content[0].text == "test"
```

## Writing Tests

### Test Requirements

Following these practices creates maintainable, debuggable test suites that serve as both documentation and regression protection.

#### Single Behavior Per Test

Each test should verify exactly one behavior. When it fails, you need to know immediately what broke. A test that checks five things gives you five potential failure points to investigate. A test that checks one thing points directly to the problem.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Good: Atomic Test theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_tool_registration():
      """Test that tools are properly registered with the server."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      @mcp.tool
      def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
          return a + b
      
      tools = mcp.list_tools()
      assert len(tools) == 1
      assert tools[0].name == "add"
  ```

  ```python Bad: Multi-Behavior Test theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_server_functionality():
      """Test multiple server features at once."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      # Tool registration
      @mcp.tool
      def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
          return a + b
      
      # Resource creation
      @mcp.resource("config://app")
      def get_config():
          return {"version": "1.0"}
      
      # Authentication setup
      mcp.auth = BearerTokenProvider({"token": "user"})
      
      # What exactly are we testing? If this fails, what broke?
      assert mcp.list_tools()
      assert mcp.list_resources()
      assert mcp.auth is not None
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Self-Contained Setup

Every test must create its own setup. Tests should be runnable in any order, in parallel, or in isolation. When a test fails, you should be able to run just that test to reproduce the issue.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Good: Self-Contained theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_tool_execution_with_error():
      """Test that tool errors are properly handled."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      @mcp.tool
      def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
          if b == 0:
              raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
          return a / b
      
      async with Client(mcp) as client:
          with pytest.raises(Exception):
              await client.call_tool("divide", {"a": 10, "b": 0})
  ```

  ```python Bad: Test Dependencies theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  # Global state that tests depend on
  test_server = None

  def test_setup_server():
      """Setup for other tests."""
      global test_server
      test_server = FastMCP("shared-server")

  def test_server_works():
      """Test server functionality."""
      # Depends on test_setup_server running first
      assert test_server is not None
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Clear Intent

Test names and assertions should make the verified behavior obvious. A developer reading your test should understand what feature it validates and how that feature should behave.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def test_authenticated_tool_requires_valid_token():
    """Test that authenticated users can access protected tools."""
    mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
    mcp.auth = BearerTokenProvider({"secret-token": "test-user"})
    
    @mcp.tool
    def protected_action() -> str:
        return "success"
    
    async with Client(mcp, auth=BearerAuth("secret-token")) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("protected_action", {})
        assert result.content[0].text == "success"
```

#### Using Fixtures

Use fixtures to create reusable data, server configurations, or other resources for your tests. Note that you should **not** open FastMCP clients in your fixtures as it can create hard-to-diagnose issues with event loops.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

@pytest.fixture
def weather_server():
    server = FastMCP("WeatherServer")
    
    @server.tool
    def get_temperature(city: str) -> dict:
        temps = {"NYC": 72, "LA": 85, "Chicago": 68}
        return {"city": city, "temp": temps.get(city, 70)}
    
    return server

async def test_temperature_tool(weather_server):
    async with Client(weather_server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("get_temperature", {"city": "LA"})
        assert result.data == {"city": "LA", "temp": 85}
```

#### Effective Assertions

Assertions should be specific and provide context on failure. When a test fails during CI, the assertion message should tell you exactly what went wrong.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Basic assertion - minimal context on failure
assert result.status == "success"

# Better - explains what was expected
assert result.status == "success", f"Expected successful operation, got {result.status}: {result.error}"
```

Try not to have too many assertions in a single test unless you truly need to check various aspects of the same behavior. In general, assertions of different behaviors should be in separate tests.

#### Inline Snapshots

FastMCP uses `inline-snapshot` for testing complex data structures. On first run of `pytest --inline-snapshot=create` with an empty `snapshot()`, pytest will auto-populate the expected value. To update snapshots after intentional changes, run `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix`. This is particularly useful for testing JSON schemas and API responses.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from inline_snapshot import snapshot

async def test_tool_schema_generation():
    """Test that tool schemas are generated correctly."""
    mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def calculate_tax(amount: float, rate: float = 0.1) -> dict:
        """Calculate tax on an amount."""
        return {"amount": amount, "tax": amount * rate, "total": amount * (1 + rate)}
    
    tools = mcp.list_tools()
    schema = tools[0].inputSchema
    
    # First run: snapshot() is empty, gets auto-populated
    # Subsequent runs: compares against stored snapshot
    assert schema == snapshot({
        "type": "object", 
        "properties": {
            "amount": {"type": "number"}, 
            "rate": {"type": "number", "default": 0.1}
        }, 
        "required": ["amount"]
    })
```

### In-Memory Testing

FastMCP uses in-memory transport for testing, where servers and clients communicate directly. The majority of functionality can be tested in a deterministic fashion this way. We use more complex setups only when testing transports themselves.

The in-memory transport runs the real MCP protocol implementation without network overhead. Instead of deploying your server or managing network connections, you pass your server instance directly to the client. Everything runs in the same Python process - you can set breakpoints anywhere and step through with your debugger.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# Create your server
server = FastMCP("WeatherServer")

@server.tool
def get_temperature(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current temperature for a city"""
    temps = {"NYC": 72, "LA": 85, "Chicago": 68}
    return {"city": city, "temp": temps.get(city, 70)}

async def test_weather_operations():
    # Pass server directly - no deployment needed
    async with Client(server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("get_temperature", {"city": "NYC"})
        assert result.data == {"city": "NYC", "temp": 72}
```

This pattern makes tests deterministic and fast - typically completing in milliseconds rather than seconds.

### Mocking External Dependencies

FastMCP servers are standard Python objects, so you can mock external dependencies using your preferred approach:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

async def test_database_tool():
    server = FastMCP("DataServer")
    
    # Mock the database
    mock_db = AsyncMock()
    mock_db.fetch_users.return_value = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
    ]
    
    @server.tool
    async def list_users() -> list:
        return await mock_db.fetch_users()
    
    async with Client(server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("list_users", {})
        assert len(result.data) == 2
        assert result.data[0]["name"] == "Alice"
        mock_db.fetch_users.assert_called_once()
```

### Testing Network Transports

While in-memory testing covers most unit testing needs, you'll occasionally need to test actual network transports like HTTP or SSE. FastMCP provides two approaches: in-process async servers (preferred), and separate subprocess servers (for special cases).

#### In-Process Network Testing (Preferred)

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For most network transport tests, use `run_server_async` as an async context manager. This runs the server as a task in the same process, providing fast, deterministic tests with full debugger support:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import run_server_async

def create_test_server() -> FastMCP:
    """Create a test server instance."""
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")

    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    return server

@pytest.fixture
async def http_server() -> str:
    """Start server in-process for testing."""
    server = create_test_server()
    async with run_server_async(server) as url:
        yield url

async def test_http_transport(http_server: str):
    """Test actual HTTP transport behavior."""
    async with Client(
        transport=StreamableHttpTransport(http_server)
    ) as client:
        result = await client.ping()
        assert result is True

        greeting = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert greeting.data == "Hello, World!"
```

The `run_server_async` context manager automatically handles server lifecycle and cleanup. This approach is faster than subprocess-based testing and provides better error messages.

#### Subprocess Testing (Special Cases)

For tests that require complete process isolation (like STDIO transport or testing subprocess behavior), use `run_server_in_process`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import run_server_in_process
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

def run_server(host: str, port: int) -> None:
    """Function to run in subprocess."""
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")
    
    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
    server.run(host=host, port=port)

@pytest.fixture
async def http_server():
    """Fixture that runs server in subprocess."""
    with run_server_in_process(run_server, transport="http") as url:
        yield f"{url}/mcp"

async def test_http_transport(http_server: str):
    """Test actual HTTP transport behavior."""
    async with Client(
        transport=StreamableHttpTransport(http_server)
    ) as client:
        result = await client.ping()
        assert result is True
```

The `run_server_in_process` utility handles server lifecycle, port allocation, and cleanup automatically. Use this only when subprocess isolation is truly necessary, as it's slower and harder to debug than in-process testing. FastMCP uses the `client_process` marker to isolate these tests in CI.

### Documentation Testing

Documentation requires the same validation as code. The `just docs` command launches a local Mintlify server that renders your documentation exactly as users will see it:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Start local documentation server with hot reload
just docs

# Or run Mintlify directly
mintlify dev
```

The local server watches for changes and automatically refreshes. This preview catches formatting issues and helps you see documentation as users will experience it.


# Upgrade Guide

Migration instructions for upgrading between FastMCP versions

This guide provides migration instructions for breaking changes and major updates when upgrading between FastMCP versions.

## v2.13.0

### OAuth Token Key Management

The OAuth proxy now issues its own JWT tokens to clients instead of forwarding upstream provider tokens. This improves security by maintaining proper token audience boundaries.

**What changed:**

The OAuth proxy now implements a token factory pattern - it receives tokens from your OAuth provider (GitHub, Google, etc.), encrypts and stores them, then issues its own FastMCP JWT tokens to clients. This requires cryptographic keys for JWT signing and token encryption.

**Default behavior (development):**

By default, FastMCP automatically manages keys based on your platform:

* **Mac/Windows**: Keys are auto-managed via system keyring, surviving server restarts with zero configuration. Suitable **only** for development and local testing.
* **Linux**: Keys are ephemeral (random salt at startup, regenerated on each restart).

This works fine for development and testing where re-authentication after restart is acceptable.

**For production:**

Production deployments must provide explicit keys and use persistent storage. Add these three things:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    base_url="https://your-server.com",

    # Explicit keys (required for production)
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],

    # Persistent network storage (required for production)
    client_storage=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379)
)
```

# Installation
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation



## Install FastMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FastMCP.

If you plan to use FastMCP in your project, you can add it as a dependency with:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
uv add fastmcp
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly with `pip` or `uv pip`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash uv theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  uv pip install fastmcp
  ```

  ```bash pip theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  pip install fastmcp
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

To verify that FastMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
$ fastmcp version

FastMCP version:                           2.11.3
MCP version:                               1.12.4
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FastMCP root path:            ~/Developer/fastmcp
```

### Dependency Licensing

<Info>
  FastMCP depends on Cyclopts for CLI functionality. Cyclopts v4 includes docutils as a transitive dependency, which has complex licensing that may trigger compliance reviews in some organizations.

  If this is a concern, you can install Cyclopts v5 alpha which removes this dependency:

  ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  pip install "cyclopts>=5.0.0a1"
  ```

  Alternatively, wait for the stable v5 release. See [this issue](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts/issues/672) for details.
</Info>

## Upgrading from the Official MCP SDK

Upgrading from the official MCP SDK's FastMCP 1.0 to FastMCP 2.0 is generally straightforward. The core server API is highly compatible, and in many cases, changing your import statement from `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP` will be sufficient.

```python {5} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Before
# from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# After
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
```

<Warning>
  Prior to `fastmcp==2.3.0` and `mcp==1.8.0`, the 2.x API always mirrored the official 1.0 API. However, as the projects diverge, this can not be guaranteed. You may see deprecation warnings if you attempt to use 1.0 APIs in FastMCP 2.x. Please refer to this documentation for details on new capabilities.
</Warning>

## Versioning Policy

FastMCP follows semantic versioning with pragmatic adaptations for the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions (e.g., 2.3.x to 2.4.0) when necessary to stay current with the MCP Protocol.

For production use, always pin to exact versions:

```
fastmcp==2.11.0  # Good
fastmcp>=2.11.0  # Bad - will install breaking changes
```

See the full [versioning and release policy](/development/releases#versioning-policy) for details on our public API, deprecation practices, and breaking change philosophy.

# Quickstart
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/quickstart



Welcome! This guide will help you quickly set up FastMCP, run your first MCP server, and deploy a server to FastMCP Cloud.

If you haven't already installed FastMCP, follow the [installation instructions](/getting-started/installation).

## Create a FastMCP Server

A FastMCP server is a collection of tools, resources, and other MCP components. To create a server, start by instantiating the `FastMCP` class.

Create a new file called `my_server.py` and add the following code:

```python my_server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
```

That's it! You've created a FastMCP server, albeit a very boring one. Let's add a tool to make it more interesting.

## Add a Tool

To add a tool that returns a simple greeting, write a function and decorate it with `@mcp.tool` to register it with the server:

```python my_server.py {5-7} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Run the Server

The simplest way to run your FastMCP server is to call its `run()` method. You can choose between different transports, like `stdio` for local servers, or `http` for remote access:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python my_server.py (stdio) {9, 10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")

  @mcp.tool
  def greet(name: str) -> str:
      return f"Hello, {name}!"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      mcp.run()
  ```

  ```python my_server.py (HTTP) {9, 10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")

  @mcp.tool
  def greet(name: str) -> str:
      return f"Hello, {name}!"

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This lets us run the server with `python my_server.py`. The stdio transport is the traditional way to connect MCP servers to clients, while the HTTP transport enables remote connections.

<Tip>
  Why do we need the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block?

  The `__main__` block is recommended for consistency and compatibility, ensuring your server works with all MCP clients that execute your server file as a script. Users who will exclusively run their server with the FastMCP CLI can omit it, as the CLI imports the server object directly.
</Tip>

### Using the FastMCP CLI

You can also use the `fastmcp run` command to start your server. Note that the FastMCP CLI **does not** execute the `__main__` block of your server file. Instead, it imports your server object and runs it with whatever transport and options you provide.

For example, to run this server with the default stdio transport (no matter how you called `mcp.run()`), you can use the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp
```

To run this server with the HTTP transport, you can use the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run my_server.py:mcp --transport http --port 8000
```

## Call Your Server

Once your server is running with HTTP transport, you can connect to it with a FastMCP client or any LLM client that supports the MCP protocol:

```python my_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp")

async def call_tool(name: str):
    async with client:
        result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": name})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(call_tool("Ford"))
```

Note that:

* FastMCP clients are asynchronous, so we need to use `asyncio.run` to run the client
* We must enter a client context (`async with client:`) before using the client
* You can make multiple client calls within the same context

## Deploy to FastMCP Cloud

[FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) is a hosting service run by the FastMCP team at [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/fastmcp). It is optimized to deploy authenticated FastMCP servers as quickly as possible, giving you a secure URL that you can plug into any LLM client.

<Info>
  FastMCP Cloud is **free for personal servers** and offers simple pay-as-you-go pricing for teams.
</Info>

To deploy your server, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Once you have one, you can deploy your server in three steps:

1. Push your `my_server.py` file to a GitHub repository
2. Sign in to [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) with your GitHub account
3. Create a new project from your repository and enter `my_server.py:mcp` as the server entrypoint

That's it! FastMCP Cloud will build and deploy your server, making it available at a URL like `https://your-project.fastmcp.app/mcp`. You can chat with it to test its functionality, or connect to it from any LLM client that supports the MCP protocol.

For more details, see the [FastMCP Cloud guide](/deployment/fastmcp-cloud).

**FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP applications.** The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect LLMs to tools and data, and FastMCP makes it production-ready with clean, Pythonic code:

```python {1} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Beyond Basic MCP

FastMCP pioneered Python MCP development, and FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into the [official MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) in 2024.

**This is FastMCP 2.0,** the actively maintained version that extends far beyond basic protocol implementation. While the SDK provides core functionality, FastMCP 2.0 delivers everything needed for production: advanced MCP patterns (server composition, proxying, OpenAPI/FastAPI generation, tool transformation), enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS, and more), deployment tools, testing frameworks, and comprehensive client libraries.

Ready to build? Start with our [installation guide](/getting-started/installation) or jump straight to the [quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart).

FastMCP is made with 💙 by [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/).

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. It may be easier to think of it as an API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

* Expose data through `Resources` (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
* Provide functionality through `Tools` (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
* Define interaction patterns through `Prompts` (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
* And more!

FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building, managing, and interacting with these servers.

## Why FastMCP?

FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details so you can focus on building. In most cases, decorating a Python function is all you need — FastMCP handles the rest.

🚀 **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development

🍀 **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate

🐍 **Pythonic**: Feels natural to Python developers

🔍 **Complete**: Everything for production — enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS), deployment tools, testing frameworks, client libraries, and more

FastMCP provides the shortest path from idea to production. Deploy locally, to the cloud with [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) (free for personal servers), or to your own infrastructure.

<Tip>
  **This documentation reflects FastMCP's `main` branch**, meaning it always reflects the latest development version. Features are generally marked with version badges (e.g. `New in version: 2.13.1`) to indicate when they were introduced. Note that this may include features that are not yet released.
</Tip>

## LLM-Friendly Docs

The FastMCP documentation is available in multiple LLM-friendly formats:

### MCP Server

The FastMCP docs are accessible via MCP! The server URL is `https://gofastmcp.com/mcp`.

In fact, you can use FastMCP to search the FastMCP docs:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    async with Client("https://gofastmcp.com/mcp") as client:
        result = await client.call_tool(
            name="SearchFastMcp", 
            arguments={"query": "deploy a FastMCP server"}
        )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Text Formats

The docs are also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/):

* [llms.txt](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) - A sitemap listing all documentation pages
* [llms-full.txt](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) - The entire documentation in one file (may exceed context windows)

Any page can be accessed as markdown by appending `.md` to the URL. For example, this page becomes `https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome.md`.

You can also copy any page as markdown by pressing "Cmd+C" (or "Ctrl+C" on Windows) on your keyboard.


# Anthropic API 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/anthropic

Connect FastMCP servers to the Anthropic API

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Anthropic's [Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) supports MCP servers as remote tool sources. This tutorial will show you how to create a FastMCP server and deploy it to a public URL, then how to call it from the Messages API.

<Tip>
  Currently, the MCP connector only accesses **tools** from MCP servers—it queries the `list_tools` endpoint and exposes those functions to Claude. Other MCP features like resources and prompts are not currently supported. You can read more about the MCP connector in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector).
</Tip>

## Create a Server

First, create a FastMCP server with the tools you want to expose. For this example, we'll create a server with a single tool that rolls dice.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

## Deploy the Server

Your server must be deployed to a public URL in order for Anthropic to access it. The MCP connector supports both SSE and Streamable HTTP transports.

For development, you can use tools like `ngrok` to temporarily expose a locally-running server to the internet. We'll do that for this example (you may need to install `ngrok` and create a free account), but you can use any other method to deploy your server.

Assuming you saved the above code as `server.py`, you can run the following two commands in two separate terminals to deploy your server and expose it to the internet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash FastMCP server theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  python server.py
  ```

  ```bash ngrok theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  ngrok http 8000
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  This exposes your unauthenticated server to the internet. Only run this command in a safe environment if you understand the risks.
</Warning>

## Call the Server

To use the Messages API with MCP servers, you'll need to install the Anthropic Python SDK (not included with FastMCP):

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install anthropic
```

You'll also need to authenticate with Anthropic. You can do this by setting the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. Consult the Anthropic SDK documentation for more information.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Here is an example of how to call your server from Python. Note that you'll need to replace `https://your-server-url.com` with the actual URL of your server. In addition, we use `/mcp/` as the endpoint because we deployed a streamable-HTTP server with the default path; you may need to use a different endpoint if you customized your server's deployment. **At this time you must also include the `extra_headers` parameter with the `anthropic-beta` header.**

```python {5, 13-22} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import anthropic
from rich import print

# Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
url = 'https://your-server-url.com'

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Roll a few dice!"}],
    mcp_servers=[
        {
            "type": "url",
            "url": f"{url}/mcp/",
            "name": "dice-server",
        }
    ],
    extra_headers={
        "anthropic-beta": "mcp-client-2025-04-04"
    }
)

print(response.content)
```

If you run this code, you'll see something like the following output:

```text  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
I'll roll some dice for you! Let me use the dice rolling tool.

I rolled 3 dice and got: 4, 2, 6

The results were 4, 2, and 6. Would you like me to roll again or roll a different number of dice?
```

## Authentication

<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

The MCP connector supports OAuth authentication through authorization tokens, which means you can secure your server while still allowing Anthropic to access it.

### Server Authentication

The simplest way to add authentication to the server is to use a bearer token scheme.

For this example, we'll quickly generate our own tokens with FastMCP's `RSAKeyPair` utility, but this may not be appropriate for production use. For more details, see the complete server-side [Token Verification](/servers/auth/token-verification) documentation.

We'll start by creating an RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair

key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")
```

<Warning>
  FastMCP's `RSAKeyPair` utility is for development and testing only.
</Warning>

Next, we'll create a `JWTVerifier` to authenticate the server.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier

auth = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=key_pair.public_key,
    audience="dice-server",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)
```

Here is a complete example that you can copy/paste. For simplicity and the purposes of this example only, it will print the token to the console. **Do NOT do this in production!**

```python server.py [expandable] theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair
import random

key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")

auth = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=key_pair.public_key,
    audience="dice-server",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"\n---\n\n🔑 Dice Roller access token:\n\n{access_token}\n\n---\n")
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

### Client Authentication

If you try to call the authenticated server with the same Anthropic code we wrote earlier, you'll get an error indicating that the server rejected the request because it's not authenticated.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Error code: 400 - {
    "type": "error", 
    "error": {
        "type": "invalid_request_error", 
        "message": "MCP server 'dice-server' requires authentication. Please provide an authorization_token.",
    },
}
```

To authenticate the client, you can pass the token using the `authorization_token` parameter in your MCP server configuration:

```python {8, 21} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import anthropic
from rich import print

# Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
url = 'https://your-server-url.com'

# Your access token (replace with your actual token)
access_token = 'your-access-token'

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Roll a few dice!"}],
    mcp_servers=[
        {
            "type": "url",
            "url": f"{url}/mcp/",
            "name": "dice-server",
            "authorization_token": access_token
        }
    ],
    extra_headers={
        "anthropic-beta": "mcp-client-2025-04-04"
    }
)

print(response.content)
```

You should now see the dice roll results in the output.


# Auth0 OAuth 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0

Secure your FastMCP server with Auth0 OAuth

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.4" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using **Auth0 OAuth**. While Auth0 does have support for Dynamic Client Registration, it is not enabled by default so this integration uses the [**OIDC Proxy**](/servers/auth/oidc-proxy) pattern to bridge Auth0's dynamic OIDC configuration with MCP's authentication requirements.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. An **[Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com/)** with access to create Applications
2. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

### Step 1: Create an Auth0 Application

Create an Application in your Auth0 settings to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Applications">
    Go to **Applications → Applications** in your Auth0 account.

    Click **"+ Create Application"** to create a new application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Application">
    * **Name**: Choose a name users will recognize (e.g., "My FastMCP Server")
    * **Choose an application type**: Choose "Single Page Web Applications"
    * Click **Create** to create the application
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Application">
    Select the "Settings" tab for your application, then find the "Application URIs" section.

    * **Allowed Callback URLs**: Your server URL + `/auth/callback` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`)
    * Click **Save** to save your changes

    <Warning>
      The callback URL must match exactly. The default path is `/auth/callback`, but you can customize it using the `redirect_path` parameter.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      If you want to use a custom callback path (e.g., `/auth/auth0/callback`), make sure to set the same path in both your Auth0 Application settings and the `redirect_path` parameter when configuring the Auth0Provider.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
    After creating the app, in the "Basic Information" section you'll see:

    * **Client ID**: A public identifier like `tv2ObNgaZAWWhhycr7Bz1LU2mxlnsmsB`
    * **Client Secret**: A private hidden value that should always be stored securely

    <Tip>
      Store these credentials securely. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Your Audience">
    Go to **Applications → APIs** in your Auth0 account.

    * Find the API that you want to use for your application
    * **API Audience**: A URL that uniquely identifies the API

    <Tip>
      Store this along with of the credentials above. Never commit this to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `Auth0Provider`.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.auth0 import Auth0Provider

# The Auth0Provider utilizes Auth0 OIDC configuration
auth_provider = Auth0Provider(
    config_url="https://.../.well-known/openid-configuration",  # Your Auth0 configuration URL
    client_id="tv2ObNgaZAWWhhycr7Bz1LU2mxlnsmsB",               # Your Auth0 application Client ID
    client_secret="vPYqbjemq...",                               # Your Auth0 application Client Secret
    audience="https://...",                                     # Your Auth0 API audience
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",                           # Must match your application configuration
    # redirect_path="/auth/callback"                            # Default value, customize if needed
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Auth0 Secured App", auth=auth_provider)

# Add a protected tool to test authentication
@mcp.tool
async def get_token_info() -> dict:
    """Returns information about the Auth0 token."""
    from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

    token = get_access_token()

    return {
        "issuer": token.claims.get("iss"),
        "audience": token.claims.get("aud"),
        "scope": token.claims.get("scope")
    }
```

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by Auth0 authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with your Auth0-protected server:

```python test_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    # The client will automatically handle Auth0 OAuth flows
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open Auth0 login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with Auth0!")

        # Test the protected tool
        result = await client.call_tool("get_token_info")
        print(f"Auth0 audience: {result['audience']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to Auth0's authorization page
2. After you authorize the app, you'll be redirected back
3. The client receives the token and can make authenticated requests

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key`, and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.auth0 import Auth0Provider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth_provider = Auth0Provider(
    config_url="https://.../.well-known/openid-configuration",

        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production Auth0 App", auth=auth_provider)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Environment Variables

# AuthKit 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit

Secure your FastMCP server with AuthKit by WorkOS

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using WorkOS's **AuthKit**, a complete authentication and user management solution. This integration uses the [**Remote OAuth**](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) pattern, where AuthKit handles user login and your FastMCP server validates the tokens.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. A **[WorkOS Account](https://workos.com/)** and a new **Project**.
2. An **[AuthKit](https://www.authkit.com/)** instance configured within your WorkOS project.
3. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

### Step 1: AuthKit Configuration

In your WorkOS Dashboard, enable AuthKit and configure the following settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Dynamic Client Registration">
    Go to **Applications → Configuration** and enable **Dynamic Client Registration**. This allows MCP clients register with your application automatically.

        <img src="https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=5849352618ef89da08cf452c5dcf38a8" alt="Enable Dynamic Client Registration" data-og-width="2644" width="2644" data-og-height="1588" height="1588" data-path="integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=afe3af1599ffac48411edaa7eb8ee35e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=fa6e286fd2e98a984dbed9dd30375e07 560w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=26ba396eef845948a2bbe7405716a419 840w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=5270b0b09891741087494f2819be6f19 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=604955d22d5556d3464f5b4919664c41 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/fastmcp/hUosZw7ujHZFemrG/integrations/images/authkit/enable_dcr.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=hUosZw7ujHZFemrG&q=85&s=a4e1627dd14ee7c1c2ad6b6628dc8520 2500w" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your AuthKit Domain">
    Find your **AuthKit Domain** on the configuration page. It will look like `https://your-project-12345.authkit.app`. You'll need this for your FastMCP server configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server file and use the `AuthKitProvider` to handle all the OAuth integration automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import AuthKitProvider

# The AuthKitProvider automatically discovers WorkOS endpoints
# and configures JWT token validation
auth_provider = AuthKitProvider(
    authkit_domain="https://your-project-12345.authkit.app",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000"  # Use your actual server URL
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="AuthKit Secured App", auth=auth_provider)
```

## Testing

To test your server, you can use the `fastmcp` CLI to run it locally. Assuming you've saved the above code to `server.py` (after replacing the `authkit_domain` and `base_url` with your actual values!), you can run the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Now, you can use a FastMCP client to test that you can reach your server after authenticating:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        assert await client.ping()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

# AWS Cognito OAuth 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito

Secure your FastMCP server with AWS Cognito user pools

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.4" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using **AWS Cognito user pools**. Since AWS Cognito doesn't support Dynamic Client Registration, this integration uses the [**OAuth Proxy**](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) pattern to bridge AWS Cognito's traditional OAuth with MCP's authentication requirements. It also includes robust JWT token validation, ensuring enterprise-grade authentication.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. An **[AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)** with access to create AWS Cognito user pools
2. Basic familiarity with AWS Cognito concepts (user pools, app clients)
3. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

### Step 1: Create an AWS Cognito User Pool and App Client

Set up AWS Cognito user pool with an app client to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to AWS Cognito">
    Go to the **[AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)** and ensure you're in your desired AWS region.

    Select **"User pools"** from the side navigation (click on the hamburger icon at the top left in case you don't see any), and click **"Create user pool"** to create a new user pool.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your Application">
    AWS Cognito now provides a streamlined setup experience:

    1. **Application type**: Select **"Traditional web application"** (this is the correct choice for FastMCP server-side authentication)
    2. **Name your application**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `FastMCP Server`)

    The traditional web application type automatically configures:

    * Server-side authentication with client secrets
    * Authorization code grant flow
    * Appropriate security settings for confidential clients

    <Info>
      Choose "Traditional web application" rather than SPA, Mobile app, or Machine-to-machine options. This ensures proper OAuth 2.0 configuration for FastMCP.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Options">
    AWS will guide you through configuration options:

    * **Sign-in identifiers**: Choose how users will sign in (email, username, or phone)
    * **Required attributes**: Select any additional user information you need
    * **Return URL**: Add your callback URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback` for development)

    <Tip>
      The simplified interface handles most OAuth security settings automatically based on your application type selection.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Create">
    Review your configuration and click **"Create user pool"**.

    After creation, you'll see your user pool details. Save these important values:

    * **User pool ID** (format: `eu-central-1_XXXXXXXXX`)
    * **Client ID** (found under → "Applications" → "App clients" in the side navigation → \<Your application name, e.g., `FastMCP Server`> → "App client information")
    * **Client Secret** (found under → "Applications" → "App clients" in the side navigation → \<Your application name, e.g., `FastMCP Server`> → "App client information")

    <Tip>
      The user pool ID and app client credentials are all you need for FastMCP configuration.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure OAuth Settings">
    Under "Login pages" in your app client's settings, you can double check and adjust the OAuth configuration:

    * **Allowed callback URLs**: Add your server URL + `/auth/callback` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`)
    * **Allowed sign-out URLs**: Optional, for logout functionality
    * **OAuth 2.0 grant types**: Ensure "Authorization code grant" is selected
    * **OpenID Connect scopes**: Select scopes your application needs (e.g., `openid`, `email`, `profile`)

    <Tip>
      For local development, you can use `http://localhost` URLs. For production, you must use HTTPS.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Resource Server">
    AWS Cognito requires a resource server entry to support OAuth with protected resources. Without this, token exchange will fail with an `invalid_grant` error.

    Navigate to **"Branding" → "Domain"** in the side navigation, then:

    1. Click **"Create resource server"**
    2. **Resource server name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `My MCP Server`)
    3. **Resource server identifier**: Enter your MCP endpoint URL exactly as it will be accessed (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp` for development, or `https://your-server.com/mcp` for production)
    4. Click **"Create resource server"**

    <Warning>
      The resource server identifier must exactly match your `base_url + mcp_path`. For the default configuration with `base_url="http://localhost:8000"` and `path="/mcp"`, use `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
    After setup, you'll have:

    * **User Pool ID**: Format like `eu-central-1_XXXXXXXXX`
    * **Client ID**: Your application's client identifier
    * **Client Secret**: Generated client secret (keep secure)
    * **AWS Region**: Where Your AWS Cognito user pool is located

    <Tip>
      Store these credentials securely. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `AWSCognitoProvider`, which handles AWS Cognito's JWT tokens and user claims automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.aws import AWSCognitoProvider
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

# The AWSCognitoProvider handles JWT validation and user claims
auth_provider = AWSCognitoProvider(
    user_pool_id="eu-central-1_XXXXXXXXX",   # Your AWS Cognito user pool ID
    aws_region="eu-central-1",               # AWS region (defaults to eu-central-1)
    client_id="your-app-client-id",          # Your app client ID
    client_secret="your-app-client-secret",  # Your app client Secret
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",        # Must match your callback URL
    # redirect_path="/auth/callback"         # Default value, customize if needed
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="AWS Cognito Secured App", auth=auth_provider)

# Add a protected tool to test authentication
@mcp.tool
async def get_access_token_claims() -> dict:
    """Get the authenticated user's access token claims."""
    token = get_access_token()
    return {
        "sub": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "username": token.claims.get("username"),
        "cognito:groups": token.claims.get("cognito:groups", []),
    }
```

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by AWS Cognito OAuth authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with Your AWS Cognito-protected server:

```python test_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    # The client will automatically handle AWS Cognito OAuth
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open AWS Cognito login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with AWS Cognito!")

        # Test the protected tool
        print("Calling protected tool: get_access_token_claims")
        result = await client.call_tool("get_access_token_claims")
        user_data = result.data
        print("Available access token claims:")
        print(f"- sub: {user_data.get('sub', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"- username: {user_data.get('username', 'N/A')}")
        print(f"- cognito:groups: {user_data.get('cognito:groups', [])}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to AWS Cognito's hosted UI login page
2. After you sign in (or sign up), you'll be redirected back to your MCP server
3. The client receives the JWT token and can make authenticated requests

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key`, and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.aws import AWSCognitoProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth_provider = AWSCognitoProvider(
    user_pool_id="eu-central-1_XXXXXXXXX",
    aws_region="eu-central-1",
    client_id="your-app-client-id",
    client_secret="your-app-client-secret",
    base_url="https://your-production-domain.com",

    # Production token management
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(
            host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
            port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"])
        ),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production AWS Cognito App", auth=auth_provider)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the AWS Cognito provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="AWS Cognito Secured App")

@mcp.tool
async def get_access_token_claims() -> dict:
    """Get the authenticated user's access token claims."""
    token = get_access_token()
    return {
        "sub": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "username": token.claims.get("username"),
        "cognito:groups": token.claims.get("cognito:groups", []),
    }
```

## Features

### JWT Token Validation

The AWS Cognito provider includes robust JWT token validation:

* **Signature Verification**: Validates tokens against AWS Cognito's public keys (JWKS)
* **Expiration Checking**: Automatically rejects expired tokens
* **Issuer Validation**: Ensures tokens come from your specific AWS Cognito user pool
* **Scope Enforcement**: Verifies required OAuth scopes are present

### User Claims and Groups

Access rich user information from AWS Cognito JWT tokens:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

@mcp.tool
async def admin_only_tool() -> str:
    """A tool only available to admin users."""
    token = get_access_token()
    user_groups = token.claims.get("cognito:groups", [])

    if "admin" not in user_groups:
        raise ValueError("This tool requires admin access")

    return "Admin access granted!"
```

### Enterprise Integration

Perfect for enterprise environments with:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integrate with corporate identity providers
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Leverage AWS Cognito's built-in MFA
* **User Groups**: Role-based access control through AWS Cognito groups
* **Custom Attributes**: Access custom user attributes defined in your AWS Cognito user pool
* **Compliance**: Meet enterprise security and compliance requirements


# Azure (Microsoft Entra ID) OAuth 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure

Secure your FastMCP server with Azure/Microsoft Entra OAuth

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using **Azure OAuth** (Microsoft Entra ID). Since Azure doesn't support Dynamic Client Registration, this integration uses the [**OAuth Proxy**](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) pattern to bridge Azure's traditional OAuth with MCP's authentication requirements. FastMCP validates Azure JWTs against your application's client\_id.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. An **[Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com/)** with access to create App registrations
2. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Your Azure tenant ID (found in Azure Portal under Microsoft Entra ID)

### Step 1: Create an Azure App Registration

Create an App registration in Azure Portal to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to App registrations">
    Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations**.

    Click **"New registration"** to create a new application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Application">
    Fill in the application details:

    * **Name**: Choose a name users will recognize (e.g., "My FastMCP Server")
    * **Supported account types**: Choose based on your needs:
      * **Single tenant**: Only users in your organization
      * **Multitenant**: Users in any Microsoft Entra directory
      * **Multitenant + personal accounts**: Any Microsoft account
    * **Redirect URI**: Select "Web" and enter your server URL + `/auth/callback` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`)

    <Warning>
      The redirect URI must match exactly. The default path is `/auth/callback`, but you can customize it using the `redirect_path` parameter. For local development, Azure allows `http://localhost` URLs. For production, you must use HTTPS.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      If you want to use a custom callback path (e.g., `/auth/azure/callback`), make sure to set the same path in both your Azure App registration and the `redirect_path` parameter when configuring the AzureProvider.
    </Tip>

    * **Expose an API**: Configure your Application ID URI and define scopes
      * Go to **Expose an API** in the App registration sidebar.
      * Click **Set** next to "Application ID URI" and choose one of:
        * Keep the default `api://{client_id}`
        * Set a custom value, following the supported formats (see [Identifier URI restrictions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/identifier-uri-restrictions))
      * Click **Add a scope** and create a scope your app will require, for example:
        * Scope name: `read` (or `write`, etc.)
        * Admin consent display name/description: as appropriate for your org
        * Who can consent: as needed (Admins only or Admins and users)

    * **Configure Access Token Version**: Ensure your app uses access token v2
      * Go to **Manifest** in the App registration sidebar.
      * Find the `requestedAccessTokenVersion` property and set it to `2`:
        ```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
        "api": {
            "requestedAccessTokenVersion": 2
        }
        ```
      * Click **Save** at the top of the manifest editor.

    <Warning>
      Access token v2 is required for FastMCP's Azure integration to work correctly. If this is not set, you may encounter authentication errors.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
      In FastMCP's `AzureProvider`, set `identifier_uri` to your Application ID URI (optional; defaults to `api://{client_id}`) and set `required_scopes` to the unprefixed scope names (e.g., `read`, `write`). During authorization, FastMCP automatically prefixes scopes with your `identifier_uri`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Client Secret">
    After registration, navigate to **Certificates & secrets** in your app's settings.

    * Click **"New client secret"**
    * Add a description (e.g., "FastMCP Server")
    * Choose an expiration period
    * Click **"Add"**

    <Warning>
      Copy the secret value immediately - it won't be shown again! You'll need to create a new secret if you lose it.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your Credentials">
    From the **Overview** page of your app registration, note:

    * **Application (client) ID**: A UUID like `835f09b6-0f0f-40cc-85cb-f32c5829a149`
    * **Directory (tenant) ID**: A UUID like `08541b6e-646d-43de-a0eb-834e6713d6d5`
    * **Client Secret**: The value you copied in the previous step

    <Tip>
      Store these credentials securely. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `AzureProvider`, which handles Azure's OAuth flow automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure import AzureProvider

# The AzureProvider handles Azure's token format and validation
auth_provider = AzureProvider(
    client_id="835f09b6-0f0f-40cc-85cb-f32c5829a149",  # Your Azure App Client ID
    client_secret="your-client-secret",                 # Your Azure App Client Secret
    tenant_id="08541b6e-646d-43de-a0eb-834e6713d6d5", # Your Azure Tenant ID (REQUIRED)
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",                   # Must match your App registration
    required_scopes=["your-scope"],                 # At least one scope REQUIRED - name of scope from your App
    # identifier_uri defaults to api://{client_id}
    # identifier_uri="api://your-api-id",
    # Optional: request additional upstream scopes in the authorize request
    # additional_authorize_scopes=["User.Read", "offline_access", "openid", "email"],
    # redirect_path="/auth/callback"                  # Default value, customize if needed
    # base_authority="login.microsoftonline.us"      # For Azure Government (default: login.microsoftonline.com)
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Azure Secured App", auth=auth_provider)

# Add a protected tool to test authentication
@mcp.tool
async def get_user_info() -> dict:
    """Returns information about the authenticated Azure user."""
    from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token
    
    token = get_access_token()
    # The AzureProvider stores user data in token claims
    return {
        "azure_id": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "email": token.claims.get("email"),
        "name": token.claims.get("name"),
        "job_title": token.claims.get("job_title"),
        "office_location": token.claims.get("office_location")
    }
```

<Note>
  **Important**: The `tenant_id` parameter is **REQUIRED**. Azure no longer supports using "common" for new applications due to security requirements. You must use one of:

  * **Your specific tenant ID**: Found in Azure Portal (e.g., `08541b6e-646d-43de-a0eb-834e6713d6d5`)
  * **"organizations"**: For work and school accounts only
  * **"consumers"**: For personal Microsoft accounts only

  Using your specific tenant ID is recommended for better security and control.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Important**: The `required_scopes` parameter is **REQUIRED** and must include at least one scope. Azure's OAuth API requires the `scope` parameter in all authorization requests - you cannot authenticate without specifying at least one scope. Use the unprefixed scope names from your Azure App registration (e.g., `["read", "write"]`). These scopes must be created under **Expose an API** in your App registration.
</Note>

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by Azure OAuth authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with your Azure-protected server:

```python test_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    # The client will automatically handle Azure OAuth
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open Azure login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with Azure!")
        
        # Test the protected tool
        result = await client.call_tool("get_user_info")
        print(f"Azure user: {result['email']}")
        print(f"Name: {result['name']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to Microsoft's authorization page
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account (work, school, or personal based on your tenant configuration)
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. After authorization, you'll be redirected back
5. The client receives the token and can make authenticated requests

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure import AzureProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth_provider = AzureProvider(
    client_id="835f09b6-0f0f-40cc-85cb-f32c5829a149",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    tenant_id="08541b6e-646d-43de-a0eb-834e6713d6d5",
    base_url="https://your-production-domain.com",
    required_scopes=["your-scope"],

    # Production token management
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(
            host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
            port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"])
        ),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production Azure App", auth=auth_provider)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

## Environment Variables

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the Azure provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
    Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure.AzureProvider` to use Azure authentication.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Azure-Specific Configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the Azure provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID" required>
    Your Azure App registration Client ID (e.g., `835f09b6-0f0f-40cc-85cb-f32c5829a149`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET" required>
    Your Azure App registration Client Secret
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID" required>
    Your Azure tenant ID (specific ID, "organizations", or "consumers")

    <Note>
      This is **REQUIRED**. Find your tenant ID in Azure Portal under Microsoft Entra ID → Overview.
    </Note>
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_BASE_URL" default="http://localhost:8000">
    Public URL where OAuth endpoints will be accessible (includes any mount path)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_ISSUER_URL" default="Uses BASE_URL">
    Issuer URL for OAuth metadata (defaults to `BASE_URL`). Set to root-level URL when mounting under a path prefix to avoid 404 logs. See [HTTP Deployment guide](/deployment/http#mounting-authenticated-servers) for details.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_REDIRECT_PATH" default="/auth/callback">
    Redirect path configured in your Azure App registration
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_REQUIRED_SCOPES" required>
    Comma-, space-, or JSON-separated list of required scopes for your API (at least one scope required). These are validated on tokens and used as defaults if the client does not request specific scopes. Use unprefixed scope names from your Azure App registration (e.g., `read,write`).

    <Note>
      Azure's OAuth API requires the `scope` parameter - you must provide at least one scope.
    </Note>
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_ADDITIONAL_AUTHORIZE_SCOPES" default="">
    Comma-, space-, or JSON-separated list of additional scopes to include in the authorization request without prefixing. Use this to request upstream scopes such as Microsoft Graph permissions. These are not used for token validation.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_IDENTIFIER_URI" default="api://{client_id}">
    Application ID URI used to prefix scopes during authorization.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_BASE_AUTHORITY" default="login.microsoftonline.com">
    Azure authority base URL. Override this to use Azure Government:

    * `login.microsoftonline.com` - Azure Public Cloud (default)
    * `login.microsoftonline.us` - Azure Government

    This setting affects all Azure OAuth endpoints (authorization, token, issuer, JWKS).
  </ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use the Azure provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure.AzureProvider

# Azure OAuth credentials
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=835f09b6-0f0f-40cc-85cb-f32c5829a149
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID=08541b6e-646d-43de-a0eb-834e6713d6d5
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_REQUIRED_SCOPES=read,write
# Optional custom API configuration
# FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_IDENTIFIER_URI=api://your-api-id
# Request additional upstream scopes (optional)
# FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AZURE_ADDITIONAL_AUTHORIZE_SCOPES=User.Read,Mail.Read
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="Azure Secured App")

@mcp.tool
async def protected_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """A tool that requires Azure authentication to access."""
    # Your tool implementation here
    return f"Processing authenticated request: {query}"
```


# ChatGPT 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/chatgpt

Connect FastMCP servers to ChatGPT in Chat and Deep Research modes

ChatGPT supports MCP servers through remote HTTP connections in two modes: **Chat mode** for interactive conversations and **Deep Research mode** for comprehensive information retrieval.

<Tip>
  **Developer Mode Required for Chat Mode**: To use MCP servers in regular ChatGPT conversations, you must first enable Developer Mode in your ChatGPT settings. This feature is available for ChatGPT Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users.
</Tip>

<Note>
  OpenAI's official MCP documentation and examples are built with **FastMCP v2**! Learn more from their [MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp) and [Developer Mode guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode).
</Note>

## Build a Server

First, let's create a simple FastMCP server:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import random

mcp = FastMCP("Demo Server")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(sides: int = 6) -> int:
    """Roll a dice with the specified number of sides."""
    return random.randint(1, sides)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

### Deploy Your Server

Your server must be accessible from the internet. For development, use `ngrok`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Terminal 1 theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  python server.py
  ```

  ```bash Terminal 2 theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  ngrok http 8000
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Note your public URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) for the next steps.

## Chat Mode

Chat mode lets you use MCP tools directly in ChatGPT conversations. See [OpenAI's Developer Mode guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode) for the latest requirements.

### Add to ChatGPT

#### 1. Enable Developer Mode

1. Open ChatGPT and go to **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Under **Advanced**, toggle **Developer Mode** to enabled

#### 2. Create Connector

1. In **Settings** → **Connectors**, click **Create**
2. Enter:
   * **Name**: Your server name
   * **Server URL**: `https://your-server.ngrok.io/mcp/`
3. Check **I trust this provider**
4. Add authentication if needed
5. Click **Create**

<Note>
  **Without Developer Mode**: If you don't have search/fetch tools, ChatGPT will reject the server. With Developer Mode enabled, you don't need search/fetch tools for Chat mode.
</Note>

#### 3. Use in Chat

1. Start a new chat
2. Click the **+** button → **More** → **Developer Mode**
3. **Enable your MCP server connector** (required - the connector must be explicitly added to each chat)
4. Now you can use your tools:

Example usage:

* "Roll a 20-sided dice"
* "Roll dice" (uses default 6 sides)

<Tip>
  The connector must be explicitly enabled in each chat session through Developer Mode. Once added, it remains active for the entire conversation.
</Tip>

### Skip Confirmations

Use `annotations={"readOnlyHint": True}` to skip confirmation prompts for read-only tools:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(annotations={"readOnlyHint": True})
def get_status() -> str:
    """Check system status."""
    return "All systems operational"

@mcp.tool()  # No annotation - ChatGPT may ask for confirmation
def delete_item(id: str) -> str:
    """Delete an item."""
    return f"Deleted {id}"
```

## Deep Research Mode

Deep Research mode provides systematic information retrieval with citations. See [OpenAI's MCP documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp) for the latest Deep Research specifications.

<Warning>
  **Search and Fetch Required**: Without Developer Mode, ChatGPT will reject any server that doesn't have both `search` and `fetch` tools. Even in Developer Mode, Deep Research only uses these two tools.
</Warning>

### Tool Implementation

Deep Research tools must follow this pattern:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool()
def search(query: str) -> dict:
    """
    Search for records matching the query.
    Must return {"ids": [list of string IDs]}
    """
    # Your search logic
    matching_ids = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
    return {"ids": matching_ids}

@mcp.tool()
def fetch(id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Fetch a complete record by ID.
    Return the full record data for ChatGPT to analyze.
    """
    # Your fetch logic
    return {
        "id": id,
        "title": "Record Title",
        "content": "Full record content...",
        "metadata": {"author": "Jane Doe", "date": "2024"}
    }
```

### Using Deep Research

1. Ensure your server is added to ChatGPT's connectors (same as Chat mode)
2. Start a new chat
3. Click **+** → **Deep Research**
4. Select your MCP server as a source
5. Ask research questions

ChatGPT will use your `search` and `fetch` tools to find and cite relevant information.


# Claude Code 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/claude-code

Install and use FastMCP servers in Claude Code

export const LocalFocusTip = () => {
  return <Tip>
            <strong>This integration focuses on running local FastMCP server files with STDIO transport.</strong> For remote servers running with HTTP or SSE transport, use your client's native configuration - FastMCP's integrations focus on simplifying the complex local setup with dependencies and <code>uv</code> commands.
        </Tip>;
};

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<LocalFocusTip />

Claude Code supports MCP servers through multiple transport methods including STDIO, SSE, and HTTP, allowing you to extend Claude's capabilities with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

## Requirements

This integration uses STDIO transport to run your FastMCP server locally. For remote deployments, you can run your FastMCP server with HTTP or SSE transport and configure it directly using Claude Code's built-in MCP management commands.

## Create a Server

The examples in this guide will use the following simple dice-rolling server, saved as `server.py`.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Install the Server

### FastMCP CLI

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

The easiest way to install a FastMCP server in Claude Code is using the `fastmcp install claude-code` command. This automatically handles the configuration, dependency management, and calls Claude Code's built-in MCP management system.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py
```

The install command supports the same `file.py:object` notation as the `run` command. If no object is specified, it will automatically look for a FastMCP server object named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in your file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# These are equivalent if your server object is named 'mcp'
fastmcp install claude-code server.py
fastmcp install claude-code server.py:mcp

# Use explicit object name if your server has a different name
fastmcp install claude-code server.py:my_custom_server
```

The command will automatically configure the server with Claude Code's `claude mcp add` command.

#### Dependencies

FastMCP provides flexible dependency management options for your Claude Code servers:

**Individual packages**: Use the `--with` flag to specify packages your server needs. You can use this flag multiple times:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with pandas --with requests
```

**Requirements file**: If you maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all your dependencies, use `--with-requirements` to install them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

**Editable packages**: For local packages under development, use `--with-editable` to install them in editable mode:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with-editable ./my-local-package
```

Alternatively, you can use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file (recommended):

```json fastmcp.json theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  }
}
```

#### Python Version and Project Configuration

Control the Python environment for your server with these options:

**Python version**: Use `--python` to specify which Python version your server requires. This ensures compatibility when your server needs specific Python features:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --python 3.11
```

**Project directory**: Use `--project` to run your server within a specific project context. This tells `uv` to use the project's configuration files and virtual environment:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --project /path/to/my-project
```

#### Environment Variables

If your server needs environment variables (like API keys), you must include them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --server-name "Weather Server" \
  --env API_KEY=your-api-key \
  --env DEBUG=true
```

Or load them from a `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --server-name "Weather Server" --env-file .env
```

<Warning>
  **Claude Code must be installed**. The integration looks for the Claude Code CLI at the default installation location (`~/.claude/local/claude`) and uses the `claude mcp add` command to register servers.
</Warning>

### Manual Configuration

For more control over the configuration, you can manually use Claude Code's built-in MCP management commands. This gives you direct control over how your server is launched:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Add a server with custom configuration
claude mcp add dice-roller -- uv run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Add with environment variables
claude mcp add weather-server -e API_KEY=secret -e DEBUG=true -- uv run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Add with specific scope (local, user, or project)
claude mcp add my-server --scope user -- uv run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py
```

You can also manually specify Python versions and project directories in your Claude Code commands:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# With specific Python version
claude mcp add ml-server -- uv run --python 3.11 --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Within a project directory
claude mcp add project-server -- uv run --project /path/to/project --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py
```

## Using the Server

Once your server is installed, you can start using your FastMCP server with Claude Code.

Try asking Claude something like:

> "Roll some dice for me"

Claude will automatically detect your `roll_dice` tool and use it to fulfill your request, returning something like:

> I'll roll some dice for you! Here are your results: \[4, 2, 6]
>
> You rolled three dice and got a 4, a 2, and a 6!

Claude Code can now access all the tools, resources, and prompts you've defined in your FastMCP server.

If your server provides resources, you can reference them with `@` mentions using the format `@server:protocol://resource/path`. If your server provides prompts, you can use them as slash commands with `/mcp__servername__promptname`.

<LocalFocusTip />

Claude Desktop supports MCP servers through local STDIO connections and remote servers (beta), allowing you to extend Claude's capabilities with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

<Note>
  Remote MCP server support is currently in beta and available for users on Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans (as of June 2025). Most users will still need to use local STDIO connections.
</Note>

<Note>
  This guide focuses specifically on using FastMCP servers with Claude Desktop. For general Claude Desktop MCP setup and official examples, see the [official Claude Desktop quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).
</Note>

## Requirements

Claude Desktop traditionally requires MCP servers to run locally using STDIO transport, where your server communicates with Claude through standard input/output rather than HTTP. However, users on certain plans now have access to remote server support as well.

<Tip>
  If you don't have access to remote server support or need to connect to remote servers, you can create a **proxy server** that runs locally via STDIO and forwards requests to remote HTTP servers. See the [Proxy Servers](#proxy-servers) section below.
</Tip>

## Create a Server

The examples in this guide will use the following simple dice-rolling server, saved as `server.py`.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Install the Server

### FastMCP CLI

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

The easiest way to install a FastMCP server in Claude Desktop is using the `fastmcp install claude-desktop` command. This automatically handles the configuration and dependency management.

<Tip>
  Prior to version 2.10.3, Claude Desktop could be managed by running `fastmcp install <path>` without specifying the client.
</Tip>

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py
```

The install command supports the same `file.py:object` notation as the `run` command. If no object is specified, it will automatically look for a FastMCP server object named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in your file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# These are equivalent if your server object is named 'mcp'
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py:mcp

# Use explicit object name if your server has a different name
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py:my_custom_server
```

After installation, restart Claude Desktop completely. You should see a hammer icon (🔨) in the bottom left of the input box, indicating that MCP tools are available.

#### Dependencies

FastMCP provides several ways to manage your server's dependencies when installing in Claude Desktop:

**Individual packages**: Use the `--with` flag to specify packages your server needs. You can use this flag multiple times:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --with pandas --with requests
```

**Requirements file**: If you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all your dependencies, use `--with-requirements` to install them all at once:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

**Editable packages**: For local packages in development, use `--with-editable` to install them in editable mode:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --with-editable ./my-local-package
```

Alternatively, you can use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file (recommended):

```json fastmcp.json theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  }
}
```

#### Python Version and Project Directory

FastMCP allows you to control the Python environment for your server:

**Python version**: Use `--python` to specify which Python version your server should run with. This is particularly useful when your server requires a specific Python version:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --python 3.11
```

**Project directory**: Use `--project` to run your server within a specific project directory. This ensures that `uv` will discover all `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files from that project:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --project /path/to/my-project
```

When you specify a project directory, all relative paths in your server will be resolved from that directory, and the project's virtual environment will be used.

#### Environment Variables

<Warning>
  Claude Desktop runs servers in a completely isolated environment with no access to your shell environment or locally installed applications. You must explicitly pass any environment variables your server needs.
</Warning>

If your server needs environment variables (like API keys), you must include them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --server-name "Weather Server" \
  --env API_KEY=your-api-key \
  --env DEBUG=true
```

Or load them from a `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --server-name "Weather Server" --env-file .env
```

<Warning>
  * **`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Claude Desktop runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
  * **On macOS, it is recommended to install `uv` globally with Homebrew** so that Claude Desktop will detect it: `brew install uv`. Installing `uv` with other methods may not make it accessible to Claude Desktop.
</Warning>

### Manual Configuration

For more control over the configuration, you can manually edit Claude Desktop's configuration file. You can open the configuration file from Claude's developer settings, or find it in the following locations:

* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

The configuration file is a JSON object with a `mcpServers` key, which contains the configuration for each MCP server.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

After updating the configuration file, restart Claude Desktop completely. Look for the hammer icon (🔨) to confirm your server is loaded.

#### Dependencies

If your server has dependencies, you can use `uv` or another package manager to set up the environment.

When manually configuring dependencies, the recommended approach is to use `uv` with FastMCP. The configuration uses `uv run` to create an isolated environment with your specified packages:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with", "fastmcp",
        "--with", "pandas",
        "--with", "requests", 
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "path/to/your/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also manually specify Python versions and project directories in your configuration. Add `--python` to use a specific Python version, or `--project` to run within a project directory:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--python", "3.11",
        "--project", "/path/to/project",
        "--with", "fastmcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "path/to/your/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The order of arguments matters: Python version and project settings come before package specifications, which come before the actual command to run.

<Warning>
  * **`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Claude Desktop runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
  * **On macOS, it is recommended to install `uv` globally with Homebrew** so that Claude Desktop will detect it: `brew install uv`. Installing `uv` with other methods may not make it accessible to Claude Desktop.
</Warning>

#### Environment Variables

You can also specify environment variables in the configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/weather_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Claude Desktop runs servers in a completely isolated environment with no access to your shell environment or locally installed applications. You must explicitly pass any environment variables your server needs.
</Warning>

## Remote Servers

Users on Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans have first-class remote server support via integrations. For other users, or as an alternative approach, FastMCP can create a proxy server that forwards requests to a remote HTTP server. You can install the proxy server in Claude Desktop.

Create a proxy server that connects to a remote HTTP server:

```python proxy_server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a proxy to a remote server
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(
    "https://example.com/mcp/sse", 
    name="Remote Server Proxy"
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run()  # Runs via STDIO for Claude Desktop
```

### Authentication

For authenticated remote servers, create an authenticated client following the guidance in the [client auth documentation](/clients/auth/bearer) and pass it to the proxy:

```python auth_proxy_server.py {7} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

# Create authenticated client
client = Client(
    "https://api.example.com/mcp/sse",
    auth=BearerAuth(token="your-access-token")
)

# Create proxy using the authenticated client
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(client, name="Authenticated Proxy")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run()
```


# Cursor 🤝 FastMCP

};

<LocalFocusTip />

Cursor supports MCP servers through multiple transport methods including STDIO, SSE, and Streamable HTTP, allowing you to extend Cursor's AI assistant with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

## Requirements

This integration uses STDIO transport to run your FastMCP server locally. For remote deployments, you can run your FastMCP server with HTTP or SSE transport and configure it directly in Cursor's settings.

## Create a Server

The examples in this guide will use the following simple dice-rolling server, saved as `server.py`.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Install the Server

### FastMCP CLI

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

The easiest way to install a FastMCP server in Cursor is using the `fastmcp install cursor` command. This automatically handles the configuration, dependency management, and opens Cursor with a deeplink to install the server.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py
```

#### Workspace Installation

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

By default, FastMCP installs servers globally for Cursor. You can also install servers to project-specific workspaces using the `--workspace` flag:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Install to current directory's .cursor/ folder
fastmcp install cursor server.py --workspace .

# Install to specific workspace
fastmcp install cursor server.py --workspace /path/to/project
```

This creates a `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration file in the specified workspace directory, allowing different projects to have their own MCP server configurations.

The install command supports the same `file.py:object` notation as the `run` command. If no object is specified, it will automatically look for a FastMCP server object named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in your file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# These are equivalent if your server object is named 'mcp'
fastmcp install cursor server.py
fastmcp install cursor server.py:mcp

# Use explicit object name if your server has a different name
fastmcp install cursor server.py:my_custom_server
```

After running the command, Cursor will open automatically and prompt you to install the server. The command will be `uv`, which is expected as this is a Python STDIO server. Click "Install" to confirm:

#### Dependencies

FastMCP offers multiple ways to manage dependencies for your Cursor servers:

**Individual packages**: Use the `--with` flag to specify packages your server needs. You can use this flag multiple times:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --with pandas --with requests
```

**Requirements file**: For projects with a `requirements.txt` file, use `--with-requirements` to install all dependencies at once:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

**Editable packages**: When developing local packages, use `--with-editable` to install them in editable mode:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --with-editable ./my-local-package
```

Alternatively, you can use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file (recommended):

```json fastmcp.json theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  }
}
```

#### Python Version and Project Configuration

Control your server's Python environment with these options:

**Python version**: Use `--python` to specify which Python version your server should use. This is essential when your server requires specific Python features:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --python 3.11
```

**Project directory**: Use `--project` to run your server within a specific project context. This ensures `uv` discovers all project configuration files and uses the correct virtual environment:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --project /path/to/my-project
```

#### Environment Variables

<Warning>
  Cursor runs servers in a completely isolated environment with no access to your shell environment or locally installed applications. You must explicitly pass any environment variables your server needs.
</Warning>

If your server needs environment variables (like API keys), you must include them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --server-name "Weather Server" \
  --env API_KEY=your-api-key \
  --env DEBUG=true
```

Or load them from a `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install cursor server.py --server-name "Weather Server" --env-file .env
```

<Warning>
  **`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Cursor runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
</Warning>

### Generate MCP JSON

<Note>
  **Use the first-class integration above for the best experience.** The MCP JSON generation is useful for advanced use cases, manual configuration, or integration with other tools.
</Note>

You can generate MCP JSON configuration for manual use:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Generate configuration and output to stdout
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --server-name "Dice Roller" --with pandas

# Copy configuration to clipboard for easy pasting
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --server-name "Dice Roller" --copy
```

This generates the standard `mcpServers` configuration format that can be used with any MCP-compatible client.

### Manual Configuration

For more control over the configuration, you can manually edit Cursor's configuration file. The configuration file is located at:

* **All platforms**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

The configuration file is a JSON object with a `mcpServers` key, which contains the configuration for each MCP server.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/your/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

After updating the configuration file, your server should be available in Cursor.

#### Dependencies

If your server has dependencies, you can use `uv` or another package manager to set up the environment.

When manually configuring dependencies, the recommended approach is to use `uv` with FastMCP. The configuration should use `uv run` to create an isolated environment with your specified packages:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with", "fastmcp",
        "--with", "pandas",
        "--with", "requests", 
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "path/to/your/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also manually specify Python versions and project directories in your configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dice-roller": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--python", "3.11",
        "--project", "/path/to/project",
        "--with", "fastmcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "path/to/your/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the order of arguments is important: Python version and project settings should come before package specifications.

<Warning>
  **`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Cursor runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
</Warning>

#### Environment Variables

You can also specify environment variables in the configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/weather_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Cursor runs servers in a completely isolated environment with no access to your shell environment or locally installed applications. You must explicitly pass any environment variables your server needs.
</Warning>

## Using the Server

Once your server is installed, you can start using your FastMCP server with Cursor's AI assistant.

Try asking Cursor something like:

> "Roll some dice for me"

Cursor will automatically detect your `roll_dice` tool and use it to fulfill your request, returning something like:

> 🎲 Here are your dice rolls: 4, 6, 4
>
> You rolled 3 dice with a total of 14! The 6 was a nice high roll there!

The AI assistant can now access all the tools, resources, and prompts you've defined in your FastMCP server.


# Descope 🤝 FastMCP

Secure your FastMCP server with Descope

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.4" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using [**Descope**](https://www.descope.com), a complete authentication and user management solution. This integration uses the [**Remote OAuth**](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) pattern, where Descope handles user login and your FastMCP server validates the tokens.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. To [sign up](https://www.descope.com/sign-up) for a Free Forever Descope account
2. Your **Project ID** from the [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
3. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

### Step 1: Configure Descope

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Dynamic Client Registration">
    1. Go to the [Inbound Apps page](https://app.descope.com/apps/inbound) of the Descope Console
    2. Click **DCR Settings**
    3. Enable **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**
    4. Define allowed scopes

    <Warning>
      DCR is required for FastMCP clients to automatically register with your authentication server.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your Project ID">
    Save your Project ID from [Project Settings](https://app.descope.com/settings/project):

    ```
    Project ID: P2abc...123
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your Descope configuration:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=P2abc...123      # Your Descope Project ID
DESCOPE_BASE_URL=https://api.descope.com   # Descope API URL
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000     # Your server's base URL
```

<Note>
  You can find your project's Descope Base URL in the [Multi-Region Support Guide](https://docs.descope.com/management/project-settings/multi-regional).
</Note>

### Step 3: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server file and use the DescopeProvider to handle all the OAuth integration automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope import DescopeProvider

# The DescopeProvider automatically discovers Descope endpoints
# and configures JWT token validation
auth_provider = DescopeProvider(
    project_id=DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID,        # Your Descope Project ID
    base_url=SERVER_URL,                  # Your server's public URL
    descope_base_url=DESCOPE_BASE_URL,    # Descope API base URL
)

# Create FastMCP server with auth
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Descope Protected Server", auth=auth_provider)

```

## Testing

To test your server, you can use the `fastmcp` CLI to run it locally. Assuming you've saved the above code to `server.py` (after replacing the `project_id`, `base_url`, and `descope_base_url` with your actual values!), you can run the following command:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Now, you can use a FastMCP client to test that you can reach your server after authenticating:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        assert await client.ping()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the Descope provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
    Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope.DescopeProvider` to use Descope authentication.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Descope-Specific Configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the Descope provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_PROJECT_ID" required>
    Your Descope Project ID from the [Descope Console](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_BASE_URL" required>
    Public URL of your FastMCP server (e.g., `https://your-server.com` or `http://localhost:8000` for development)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_DESCOPE_BASE_URL" default="https://api.descope.com">
    Descope API base URL for your [region/environment](https://docs.descope.com/management/project-settings/multi-regional)
  </ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use the Descope provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.descope.DescopeProvider

# Descope configuration
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_PROJECT_ID=P2abc...123
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_DESCOPEPROVIDER_DESCOPE_BASE_URL=https://api.descope.com
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Descope Protected Server")
```


# Eunomia Authorization 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/eunomia-authorization

Add policy-based authorization to your FastMCP servers with Eunomia

Add **policy-based authorization** to your FastMCP servers with one-line code addition with the **[Eunomia][eunomia-github] authorization middleware**.

Control which tools, resources and prompts MCP clients can view and execute on your server. Define dynamic JSON-based policies and obtain a comprehensive audit log of all access attempts and violations.

## How it Works

Exploiting FastMCP's [Middleware][fastmcp-middleare], the Eunomia middleware intercepts all MCP requests to your server and automatically maps MCP methods to authorization checks.

### Listing Operations

The middleware behaves as a filter for listing operations (`tools/list`, `resources/list`, `prompts/list`), hiding to the client components that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant EunomiaMiddleware as Eunomia Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant EunomiaServer as Eunomia Server

    MCPClient->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Listing Request (e.g., tools/list)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Listing Request
    MCPServer-->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Listing Response
    EunomiaMiddleware->>EunomiaServer: Authorization Checks
    EunomiaServer->>EunomiaMiddleware: Authorization Decisions
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: Filtered MCP Listing Response
```

### Execution Operations

The middleware behaves as a firewall for execution operations (`tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`), blocking operations that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant EunomiaMiddleware as Eunomia Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant EunomiaServer as Eunomia Server

    MCPClient->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Execution Request (e.g., tools/call)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>EunomiaServer: Authorization Check
    EunomiaServer->>EunomiaMiddleware: Authorization Decision
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Unauthorized Error (if denied)
    EunomiaMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Execution Request (if allowed)
    MCPServer-->>EunomiaMiddleware: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
    EunomiaMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
```

## Add Authorization to Your Server

<Note>
  Eunomia is an AI-specific authorization server that handles policy decisions. The server runs embedded within your MCP server by default for a zero-effort configuration, but can alternatively be run remotely for centralized policy decisions.
</Note>

### Create a Server with Authorization

First, install the `eunomia-mcp` package:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install eunomia-mcp
```

Then create a FastMCP server and add the Eunomia middleware in one line:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from eunomia_mcp import create_eunomia_middleware

# Create your FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Secure MCP Server 🔒")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Add middleware to your server
middleware = create_eunomia_middleware(policy_file="mcp_policies.json")
mcp.add_middleware(middleware)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Configure Access Policies

Use the `eunomia-mcp` CLI in your terminal to manage your authorization policies:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Create a default policy file
eunomia-mcp init

# Or create a policy file customized for your FastMCP server
eunomia-mcp init --custom-mcp "app.server:mcp"
```

This creates `mcp_policies.json` file that you can further edit to your access control needs.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Once edited, validate your policy file
eunomia-mcp validate mcp_policies.json
```

### Run the Server

Start your FastMCP server normally:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
python server.py
```

The middleware will now intercept all MCP requests and check them against your policies. Requests include agent identification through headers like `X-Agent-ID`, `X-User-ID`, `User-Agent`, or `Authorization` and an automatic mapping of MCP methods to authorization resources and actions.

# FastAPI 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/fastapi

Integrate FastMCP with FastAPI applications

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<Tip>
  **New in 2.11**: FastMCP is introducing a next-generation OpenAPI parser. The new parser has greatly improved performance and compatibility, and is also easier to maintain. To enable it, set the environment variable `FASTMCP_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_OPENAPI_PARSER=true`.

  The new parser is largely API-compatible with the existing implementation and will become the default in a future version. We encourage all users to test it and report any issues before it becomes the default.
</Tip>

FastMCP provides two powerful ways to integrate with FastAPI applications:

1. **[Generate an MCP server FROM your FastAPI app](#generating-an-mcp-server)** - Convert existing API endpoints into MCP tools
2. **[Mount an MCP server INTO your FastAPI app](#mounting-an-mcp-server)** - Add MCP functionality to your web application

<Tip>
  Generating MCP servers from OpenAPI is a great way to get started with FastMCP, but in practice LLMs achieve **significantly better performance** with well-designed and curated MCP servers than with auto-converted OpenAPI servers. This is especially true for complex APIs with many endpoints and parameters.

  We recommend using the FastAPI integration for bootstrapping and prototyping, not for mirroring your API to LLM clients. See the post [Stop Converting Your REST APIs to MCP](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/stop-converting-rest-apis-to-mcp) for more details.
</Tip>

<Note>
  FastMCP does *not* include FastAPI as a dependency; you must install it separately to use this integration.
</Note>

## Example FastAPI Application

Throughout this guide, we'll use this e-commerce API as our example (click the `Copy` button to copy it for use with other code blocks):

```python [expandable] theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Copy this FastAPI server into other code blocks in this guide

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Models
class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    category: str
    description: str | None = None

class ProductResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float
    category: str
    description: str | None = None

# Create FastAPI app
app = FastAPI(title="E-commerce API", version="1.0.0")

# In-memory database
products_db = {
    1: ProductResponse(
        id=1, name="Laptop", price=999.99, category="Electronics"
    ),
    2: ProductResponse(
        id=2, name="Mouse", price=29.99, category="Electronics"
    ),
    3: ProductResponse(
        id=3, name="Desk Chair", price=299.99, category="Furniture"
    ),
}
next_id = 4

@app.get("/products", response_model=list[ProductResponse])
def list_products(
    category: str | None = None,
    max_price: float | None = None,
) -> list[ProductResponse]:
    """List all products with optional filtering."""
    products = list(products_db.values())
    if category:
        products = [p for p in products if p.category == category]
    if max_price:
        products = [p for p in products if p.price <= max_price]
    return products

@app.get("/products/{product_id}", response_model=ProductResponse)
def get_product(product_id: int):
    """Get a specific product by ID."""
    if product_id not in products_db:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
    return products_db[product_id]

@app.post("/products", response_model=ProductResponse)
def create_product(product: Product):
    """Create a new product."""
    global next_id
    product_response = ProductResponse(id=next_id, **product.model_dump())
    products_db[next_id] = product_response
    next_id += 1
    return product_response

    del products_db[product_id]
    return {"message": "Product deleted"}
```

<Tip>
  All subsequent code examples in this guide assume you have the above FastAPI application code already defined. Each example builds upon this base application, `app`.
</Tip>

## Generating an MCP Server

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

One of the most common ways to bootstrap an MCP server is to generate it from an existing FastAPI application. FastMCP will expose your FastAPI endpoints as MCP components (tools, by default) in order to expose your API to LLM clients.

### Basic Conversion

Convert the FastAPI app to an MCP server with a single line:

```python {5} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Convert to MCP server
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Adding Components

Your converted MCP server is a full FastMCP instance, meaning you can add new tools, resources, and other components to it just like you would with any other FastMCP instance.

```python {8-11} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Convert to MCP server
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app)

# Add a new tool
@mcp.tool
def get_product(product_id: int) -> ProductResponse:
    """Get a product by ID."""
    return products_db[product_id]

# Run the MCP server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Interacting with the MCP Server

Once you've converted your FastAPI app to an MCP server, you can interact with it using the FastMCP client to test functionality before deploying it to an LLM-based application.

```python {3, } theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.client import Client
import asyncio

# Convert to MCP server
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app)

async def demo():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        # List available tools
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print(f"Available tools: {[t.name for t in tools]}")
        
        # Create a product
        result = await client.call_tool(
            "create_product_products_post",
            {
                "name": "Wireless Keyboard",
                "price": 79.99,
                "category": "Electronics",
                "description": "Bluetooth mechanical keyboard"
            }
        )
        print(f"Created product: {result.data}")
        
        # List electronics under $100
        result = await client.call_tool(
            "list_products_products_get",
            {"category": "Electronics", "max_price": 100}
        )
        print(f"Affordable electronics: {result.data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(demo())
```

### Custom Route Mapping

Because FastMCP's FastAPI integration is based on its [OpenAPI integration](/integrations/openapi), you can customize how endpoints are converted to MCP components in exactly the same way. For example, here we use a `RouteMap` to map all GET requests to MCP resources, and all POST/PUT/DELETE requests to MCP tools:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

# If using experimental parser, import from experimental module:
# from fastmcp.experimental.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

# Custom mapping rules
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(
    app=app,
    route_maps=[
        # GET with path params → ResourceTemplates
        RouteMap(
            methods=["GET"], 
            pattern=r".*\{.*\}.*", 
            mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE
        ),
        # Other GETs → Resources
        RouteMap(
            methods=["GET"], 
            pattern=r".*", 
            mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE
        ),
        # POST/PUT/DELETE → Tools (default)
    ],
)

# Now:
# - GET /products → Resource
# - GET /products/{id} → ResourceTemplate
# - POST/PUT/DELETE → Tools
```

<Tip>
  To learn more about customizing the conversion process, see the [OpenAPI Integration guide](/integrations/openapi).
</Tip>

### Authentication and Headers

You can configure headers and other client options via the `httpx_client_kwargs` parameter. For example, to add authentication to your FastAPI app, you can pass a `headers` dictionary to the `httpx_client_kwargs` parameter:

```python {27-31} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Add authentication to your FastAPI app
from fastapi import Depends, Header
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials

security = HTTPBearer()

def verify_token(credentials: HTTPAuthorizationCredentials = Depends(security)):
    if credentials.credentials != "secret-token":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication")
    return credentials.credentials

# Add a protected endpoint
@app.get("/admin/stats", dependencies=[Depends(verify_token)])
def get_admin_stats():
    return {
        "total_products": len(products_db),
        "categories": list(set(p.category for p in products_db.values()))
    }

# Create MCP server with authentication headers
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(
    app=app,
    httpx_client_kwargs={
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer secret-token",
        }
    }
)
```

## Mounting an MCP Server

<VersionBadge version="2.3.1" />

In addition to generating servers, FastMCP can facilitate adding MCP servers to your existing FastAPI application. You can do this by mounting the MCP ASGI application.

### Basic Mounting

To mount an MCP server, you can use the `http_app` method on your FastMCP instance. This will return an ASGI application that can be mounted to your FastAPI application.

```python {23-30} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Analytics Tools")

@mcp.tool
def analyze_pricing(category: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze pricing for a category."""
    products = [p for p in products_db.values() if p.category == category]
    if not products:
        return {"error": f"No products in {category}"}
    
    prices = [p.price for p in products]
    return {
        "category": category,
        "avg_price": round(sum(prices) / len(prices), 2),
        "min": min(prices),
        "max": max(prices),
    }

# Create ASGI app from MCP server
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')

# Key: Pass lifespan to FastAPI
app = FastAPI(title="E-commerce API", lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)

# Mount the MCP server
app.mount("/analytics", mcp_app)

# Now: API at /products/*, MCP at /analytics/mcp/
```

## Offering an LLM-Friendly API

A common pattern is to generate an MCP server from your FastAPI app and serve both interfaces from the same application. This provides an LLM-optimized interface alongside your regular API:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Assumes the FastAPI app from above is already defined
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastapi import FastAPI

# 1. Generate MCP server from your API
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app, name="E-commerce MCP")

# 2. Create the MCP's ASGI app
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')

# 3. Create a new FastAPI app that combines both sets of routes
combined_app = FastAPI(
    title="E-commerce API with MCP",
    routes=[
        *mcp_app.routes,  # MCP routes
        *app.routes,      # Original API routes
    ],
    lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan,
)

# Now you have:
# - Regular API: http://localhost:8000/products
# - LLM-friendly MCP: http://localhost:8000/mcp
# Both served from the same FastAPI application!
```

This approach lets you maintain a single codebase while offering both traditional REST endpoints and MCP-compatible endpoints for LLM clients.

## Key Considerations

### Operation IDs

FastAPI operation IDs become MCP component names. Always specify meaningful operation IDs:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Good - explicit operation_id
@app.get("/users/{user_id}", operation_id="get_user_by_id")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    return {"id": user_id}

# Less ideal - auto-generated name
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    return {"id": user_id}
```

### Lifespan Management

When mounting MCP servers, always pass the lifespan context:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Correct - lifespan passed
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')
app = FastAPI(lifespan=mcp_app.lifespan)
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)

# Incorrect - missing lifespan
app = FastAPI()
app.mount("/mcp", mcp.http_app())  # Session manager won't initialize
```

If you're mounting an authenticated MCP server under a path prefix, see [Mounting Authenticated Servers](/deployment/http#mounting-authenticated-servers) for important OAuth routing considerations.

### CORS Middleware

If your FastAPI app uses `CORSMiddleware` and you're mounting an OAuth-protected FastMCP server, avoid adding application-wide CORS middleware. FastMCP and the MCP SDK already handle CORS for OAuth routes, and layering CORS middleware can cause conflicts (such as 404 errors on `.well-known` routes or OPTIONS requests).

If you need CORS on your own FastAPI routes, use the sub-app pattern: mount your API and FastMCP as separate apps, each with their own middleware, rather than adding top-level `CORSMiddleware` to the combined application.

### Combining Lifespans

If your FastAPI app already has a lifespan (for database connections, startup tasks, etc.), you can't simply replace it with the MCP lifespan. Instead, you need to create a new lifespan function that manages both contexts. This ensures that both your app's initialization logic and the MCP server's session manager run properly:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Your existing lifespan
@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup
    print("Starting up the app...")
    # Initialize database, cache, etc.
    yield
    # Shutdown
    print("Shutting down the app...")

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Tools")
mcp_app = mcp.http_app(path='/mcp')

# Combine both lifespans
@asynccontextmanager
async def combined_lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Run both lifespans
    async with app_lifespan(app):
        async with mcp_app.lifespan(app):
            yield

# Use the combined lifespan
app = FastAPI(lifespan=combined_lifespan)
app.mount("/mcp", mcp_app)
```

This pattern ensures both your app's initialization logic and the MCP server's session manager are properly managed. The key is using nested `async with` statements - the inner context (MCP) will be initialized after the outer context (your app), and cleaned up before it. This maintains the correct initialization and cleanup order for all your resources.

### Performance Tips

1. **Use in-memory transport for testing** - Pass MCP servers directly to clients
2. **Design purpose-built MCP tools** - Better than auto-converting complex APIs
3. **Keep tool parameters simple** - LLMs perform better with focused interfaces

For more details on configuration options, see the [OpenAPI Integration guide](/integrations/openapi).


# Gemini SDK 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/gemini

Connect FastMCP servers to the Google Gemini SDK

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Google's Gemini API includes built-in support for MCP servers in their Python and JavaScript SDKs, allowing you to connect directly to MCP servers and use their tools seamlessly with Gemini models.

## Gemini Python SDK

Google's [Gemini Python SDK](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) can use FastMCP clients directly.

<Note>
  Google's MCP integration is currently experimental and available in the Python and JavaScript SDKs. The API automatically calls MCP tools when needed and can connect to both local and remote MCP servers.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Currently, Gemini's MCP support only accesses **tools** from MCP servers—it queries the `list_tools` endpoint and exposes those functions to the AI. Other MCP features like resources and prompts are not currently supported.
</Tip>

### Create a Server

First, create a FastMCP server with the tools you want to expose. For this example, we'll create a server with a single tool that rolls dice.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Call the Server

To use the Gemini API with MCP, you'll need to install the Google Generative AI SDK:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install google-genai
```

You'll also need to authenticate with Google. You can do this by setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. Consult the Gemini SDK documentation for more information.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Gemini's SDK interacts directly with the MCP client session. To call the server, you'll need to instantiate a FastMCP client, enter its connection context, and pass the client session to the Gemini SDK.

```python {5, 9, 15} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from google import genai
import asyncio

mcp_client = Client("server.py")
gemini_client = genai.Client()

async def main():    
    async with mcp_client:
        response = await gemini_client.aio.models.generate_content(
            model="gemini-2.0-flash",
            contents="Roll 3 dice!",
            config=genai.types.GenerateContentConfig(
                temperature=0,
                tools=[mcp_client.session],  # Pass the FastMCP client session
            ),
        )
        print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

If you run this code, you'll see output like:

```text  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Okay, I rolled 3 dice and got a 5, 4, and 1.
```

### Remote & Authenticated Servers

In the above example, we connected to our local server using `stdio` transport. Because we're using a FastMCP client, you can also connect to any local or remote MCP server, using any [transport](/clients/transports) or [auth](/clients/auth) method supported by FastMCP, simply by changing the client configuration.

For example, to connect to a remote, authenticated server, you can use the following client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import BearerAuth

mcp_client = Client(
    "https://my-server.com/mcp/",
    auth=BearerAuth("<your-token>"),
)
```

The rest of the code remains the same.


# Gemini CLI 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/gemini-cli

Install and use FastMCP servers in Gemini CLI

export const LocalFocusTip = () => {
  return <Tip>
            <strong>This integration focuses on running local FastMCP server files with STDIO transport.</strong> For remote servers running with HTTP or SSE transport, use your client's native configuration - FastMCP's integrations focus on simplifying the complex local setup with dependencies and <code>uv</code> commands.
        </Tip>;
};

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">

                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<LocalFocusTip />

Gemini CLI supports MCP servers through multiple transport methods including STDIO, SSE, and HTTP, allowing you to extend Gemini's capabilities with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

## Requirements

This integration uses STDIO transport to run your FastMCP server locally. For remote deployments, you can run your FastMCP server with HTTP or SSE transport and configure it directly using Gemini CLI's built-in MCP management commands.

## Create a Server

The examples in this guide will use the following simple dice-rolling server, saved as `server.py`.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Install the Server

### FastMCP CLI

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

The easiest way to install a FastMCP server in Gemini CLI is using the `fastmcp install gemini-cli` command. This automatically handles the configuration, dependency management, and calls Gemini CLI's built-in MCP management system.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py
```

The install command supports the same `file.py:object` notation as the `run` command. If no object is specified, it will automatically look for a FastMCP server object named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in your file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# These are equivalent if your server object is named 'mcp'
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py:mcp

# Use explicit object name if your server has a different name
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py:my_custom_server
```

The command will automatically configure the server with Gemini CLI's `gemini mcp add` command.

#### Dependencies

FastMCP provides flexible dependency management options for your Gemini CLI servers:

**Individual packages**: Use the `--with` flag to specify packages your server needs. You can use this flag multiple times:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --with pandas --with requests
```

**Requirements file**: If you maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all your dependencies, use `--with-requirements` to install them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

**Editable packages**: For local packages under development, use `--with-editable` to install them in editable mode:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --with-editable ./my-local-package
```

Alternatively, you can use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file (recommended):

```json fastmcp.json theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  }
}
```

#### Python Version and Project Configuration

Control the Python environment for your server with these options:

**Python version**: Use `--python` to specify which Python version your server requires. This ensures compatibility when your server needs specific Python features:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --python 3.11
```

**Project directory**: Use `--project` to run your server within a specific project context. This tells `uv` to use the project's configuration files and virtual environment:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --project /path/to/my-project
```

#### Environment Variables

If your server needs environment variables (like API keys), you must include them:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --server-name "Weather Server" \
  --env API_KEY=your-api-key \
  --env DEBUG=true
```

Or load them from a `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install gemini-cli server.py --server-name "Weather Server" --env-file .env
```

<Warning>
  **Gemini CLI must be installed**. The integration looks for the Gemini CLI and uses the `gemini mcp add` command to register servers.
</Warning>

### Manual Configuration

For more control over the configuration, you can manually use Gemini CLI's built-in MCP management commands. This gives you direct control over how your server is launched:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Add a server with custom configuration
gemini mcp add dice-roller uv -- run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Add with environment variables
gemini mcp add weather-server -e API_KEY=secret -e DEBUG=true uv -- run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Add with specific scope (user, or project)
gemini mcp add my-server --scope user uv -- run --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py
```

You can also manually specify Python versions and project directories in your Gemini CLI commands:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# With specific Python version
gemini mcp add ml-server uv -- run --python 3.11 --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py

# Within a project directory
gemini mcp add project-server uv -- run --project /path/to/project --with fastmcp fastmcp run server.py
```

## Using the Server

Once your server is installed, you can start using your FastMCP server with Gemini CLI.

Try asking Gemini something like:

> "Roll some dice for me"

Gemini will automatically detect your `roll_dice` tool and use it to fulfill your request.

Gemini CLI can now access all the tools and prompts you've defined in your FastMCP server.

If your server provides prompts, you can use them as slash commands with `/prompt_name`.


# GitHub OAuth 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github

Secure your FastMCP server with GitHub OAuth

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using **GitHub OAuth**. Since GitHub doesn't support Dynamic Client Registration, this integration uses the [**OAuth Proxy**](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) pattern to bridge GitHub's traditional OAuth with MCP's authentication requirements.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. A **[GitHub Account](https://github.com/)** with access to create OAuth Apps
2. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

### Step 1: Create a GitHub OAuth App

Create an OAuth App in your GitHub settings to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to OAuth Apps">
    Go to **Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps** in your GitHub account, or visit [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers).

    Click **"New OAuth App"** to create a new application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your OAuth App">
    Fill in the application details:

    * **Application name**: Choose a name users will recognize (e.g., "My FastMCP Server")
    * **Homepage URL**: Your application's homepage or documentation URL
    * **Authorization callback URL**: Your server URL + `/auth/callback` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`)

    <Warning>
      The callback URL must match exactly. The default path is `/auth/callback`, but you can customize it using the `redirect_path` parameter. For local development, GitHub allows `http://localhost` URLs. For production, you must use HTTPS.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      If you want to use a custom callback path (e.g., `/auth/github/callback`), make sure to set the same path in both your GitHub OAuth App settings and the `redirect_path` parameter when configuring the GitHubProvider.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
    After creating the app, you'll see:

    * **Client ID**: A public identifier like `Ov23liAbcDefGhiJkLmN`
    * **Client Secret**: Click "Generate a new client secret" and save the value securely

    <Tip>
      Store these credentials securely. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `GitHubProvider`, which handles GitHub's OAuth quirks automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider

# The GitHubProvider handles GitHub's token format and validation
auth_provider = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="Ov23liAbcDefGhiJkLmN",  # Your GitHub OAuth App Client ID
    client_secret="github_pat_...",     # Your GitHub OAuth App Client Secret
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",   # Must match your OAuth App configuration
    # redirect_path="/auth/callback"   # Default value, customize if needed
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="GitHub Secured App", auth=auth_provider)

# Add a protected tool to test authentication
@mcp.tool
async def get_user_info() -> dict:
    """Returns information about the authenticated GitHub user."""
    from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token
    
    token = get_access_token()
    # The GitHubProvider stores user data in token claims
    return {
        "github_user": token.claims.get("login"),
        "name": token.claims.get("name"),
        "email": token.claims.get("email")
    }
```

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by GitHub OAuth authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with your GitHub-protected server:

```python test_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    # The client will automatically handle GitHub OAuth
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open GitHub login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with GitHub!")
        
        # Test the protected tool
        result = await client.call_tool("get_user_info")
        print(f"GitHub user: {result['github_user']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to GitHub's authorization page
2. After you authorize the app, you'll be redirected back
3. The client receives the token and can make authenticated requests

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth_provider = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="Ov23liAbcDefGhiJkLmN",
    client_secret="github_pat_...",
    base_url="https://your-production-domain.com",

    # Production token management
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(
            host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
            port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"])
        ),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production GitHub App", auth=auth_provider)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

## Environment Variables

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the GitHub provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
    Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider` to use GitHub authentication.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### GitHub-Specific Configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the GitHub provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID" required>
    Your GitHub OAuth App Client ID (e.g., `Ov23liAbcDefGhiJkLmN`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET" required>
    Your GitHub OAuth App Client Secret
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL" default="http://localhost:8000">
    Public URL where OAuth endpoints will be accessible (includes any mount path)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_ISSUER_URL" default="Uses BASE_URL">
    Issuer URL for OAuth metadata (defaults to `BASE_URL`). Set to root-level URL when mounting under a path prefix to avoid 404 logs. See [HTTP Deployment guide](/deployment/http#mounting-authenticated-servers) for details.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_REDIRECT_PATH" default="/auth/callback">
    Redirect path configured in your GitHub OAuth App
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_REQUIRED_SCOPES" default="[&#x22;user&#x22;]">
    Comma-, space-, or JSON-separated list of required GitHub scopes (e.g., `user repo` or `["user","repo"]`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS" default="10">
    HTTP request timeout for GitHub API calls
  </ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use the GitHub provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider

# GitHub OAuth credentials
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liAbcDefGhiJkLmN
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=github_pat_...
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_REQUIRED_SCOPES=user,repo
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="GitHub Secured App")

@mcp.tool
async def list_repos() -> list[str]:
    """List the authenticated user's repositories."""
    # Your tool implementation here
    pass
```


# Google OAuth 🤝 FastMCP

This guide shows you how to secure your FastMCP server using **Google OAuth**. Since Google doesn't support Dynamic Client Registration, this integration uses the [**OAuth Proxy**](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) pattern to bridge Google's traditional OAuth with MCP's authentication requirements.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. A **[Google Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)** with access to create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
2. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

### Step 1: Create a Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in your Google Cloud Console to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen">
    Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and select your project (or create a new one).

    First, configure the OAuth consent screen by navigating to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**. Choose "External" for testing or "Internal" for G Suite organizations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID">
    Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials** and click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** → **"OAuth client ID"**.

    Configure your OAuth client:

    * **Application type**: Web application
    * **Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "FastMCP Server")
    * **Authorized JavaScript origins**: Add your server's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
    * **Authorized redirect URIs**: Add your server URL + `/auth/callback` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`)

    <Warning>
      The redirect URI must match exactly. The default path is `/auth/callback`, but you can customize it using the `redirect_path` parameter. For local development, Google allows `http://localhost` URLs with various ports. For production, you must use HTTPS.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      If you want to use a custom callback path (e.g., `/auth/google/callback`), make sure to set the same path in both your Google OAuth Client settings and the `redirect_path` parameter when configuring the GoogleProvider.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
    After creating the client, you'll receive:

    * **Client ID**: A string ending in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`
    * **Client Secret**: A string starting with `GOCSPX-`

    Download the JSON credentials or copy these values securely.

    <Tip>
      Store these credentials securely. Never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `GoogleProvider`, which handles Google's OAuth flow automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider

# The GoogleProvider handles Google's token format and validation
auth_provider = GoogleProvider(
    client_id="123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com",  # Your Google OAuth Client ID
    client_secret="GOCSPX-abc123...",                  # Your Google OAuth Client Secret
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",                  # Must match your OAuth configuration
    required_scopes=[                                  # Request user information
        "openid",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
    ],
    # redirect_path="/auth/callback"                  # Default value, customize if needed
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Google Secured App", auth=auth_provider)

# Add a protected tool to test authentication
@mcp.tool
async def get_user_info() -> dict:
    """Returns information about the authenticated Google user."""
    from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token
    
    token = get_access_token()
    # The GoogleProvider stores user data in token claims
    return {
        "google_id": token.claims.get("sub"),
        "email": token.claims.get("email"),
        "name": token.claims.get("name"),
        "picture": token.claims.get("picture"),
        "locale": token.claims.get("locale")
    }
```

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by Google OAuth authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with your Google-protected server:

```python test_client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():
    # The client will automatically handle Google OAuth
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open Google login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with Google!")
        
        # Test the protected tool
        result = await client.call_tool("get_user_info")
        print(f"Google user: {result['email']}")
        print(f"Name: {result['name']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to Google's authorization page
2. Sign in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions
3. After authorization, you'll be redirected back
4. The client receives the token and can make authenticated requests

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth_provider = GoogleProvider(
    client_id="123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    client_secret="GOCSPX-abc123...",
    base_url="https://your-production-domain.com",
    required_scopes=["openid", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"],

    # Production token management
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(
            host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
            port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"])
        ),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production Google App", auth=auth_provider)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

## Environment Variables

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

### Provider Selection

Setting this environment variable allows the Google provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
    Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google.GoogleProvider` to use Google authentication.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Google-Specific Configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the Google provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID" required>
    Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID (e.g., `123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET" required>
    Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret (e.g., `GOCSPX-abc123...`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_BASE_URL" default="http://localhost:8000">
    Public URL where OAuth endpoints will be accessible (includes any mount path)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_ISSUER_URL" default="Uses BASE_URL">
    Issuer URL for OAuth metadata (defaults to `BASE_URL`). Set to root-level URL when mounting under a path prefix to avoid 404 logs. See [HTTP Deployment guide](/deployment/http#mounting-authenticated-servers) for details.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_PATH" default="/auth/callback">
    Redirect path configured in your Google OAuth Client
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_REQUIRED_SCOPES" default="[]">
    Comma-, space-, or JSON-separated list of required Google scopes (e.g., `"openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"` or `["openid", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"]`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS" default="10">
    HTTP request timeout for Google API calls
  </ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env` file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use the Google provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google.GoogleProvider

# Google OAuth credentials
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-abc123...
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_REQUIRED_SCOPES=openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="Google Secured App")

@mcp.tool
async def protected_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """A tool that requires Google authentication to access."""
    # Your tool implementation here
    return f"Processing authenticated request: {query}"
```


# MCP JSON Configuration 🤝 FastMCP

};

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

FastMCP can generate standard MCP JSON configuration files that work with any MCP-compatible client including Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and other applications that support the Model Context Protocol.

## MCP JSON Configuration Standard

The MCP JSON configuration format is an **emergent standard** that has developed across the MCP ecosystem. This format defines how MCP clients should configure and launch MCP servers, providing a consistent way to specify server commands, arguments, and environment variables.

### Configuration Structure

The standard uses a `mcpServers` object where each key represents a server name and the value contains the server's configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "executable",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Server Configuration Fields

#### `command` (required)

The executable command to run the MCP server. This should be an absolute path or a command available in the system PATH.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "command": "python"
}
```

#### `args` (optional)

An array of command-line arguments passed to the server executable. Arguments are passed in order.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "args": ["server.py", "--verbose", "--port", "8080"]
}
```

#### `env` (optional)

An object containing environment variables to set when launching the server. All values must be strings.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "secret-key",
    "DEBUG": "true",
    "PORT": "8080"
  }
}
```

### Client Adoption

This format is widely adopted across the MCP ecosystem:

* **Claude Desktop**: Uses `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
* **Cursor**: Uses `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
* **VS Code**: Uses workspace `.vscode/mcp.json`
* **Other clients**: Many MCP-compatible applications follow this standard

## Overview

<Note>
  **For the best experience, use FastMCP's first-class integrations:** [`fastmcp install claude-code`](/integrations/claude-code), [`fastmcp install claude-desktop`](/integrations/claude-desktop), or [`fastmcp install cursor`](/integrations/cursor). Use MCP JSON generation for advanced use cases and unsupported clients.
</Note>

The `fastmcp install mcp-json` command generates configuration in the standard `mcpServers` format used across the MCP ecosystem. This is useful when:

* **Working with unsupported clients** - Any MCP client not directly integrated with FastMCP
* **CI/CD environments** - Automated configuration generation for deployments
* **Configuration sharing** - Easy distribution of server setups to team members
* **Custom tooling** - Integration with your own MCP management tools
* **Manual setup** - When you prefer to manually configure your MCP client

## Basic Usage

Generate configuration and output to stdout (useful for piping):

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py
```

This outputs the server configuration JSON with the server name as the root key:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "My Server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "fastmcp", 
      "fastmcp",
      "run",
      "/absolute/path/to/server.py"
    ]
  }
}
```

To use this in a client configuration file, add it to the `mcpServers` object in your client's configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "My Server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "fastmcp", 
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "/absolute/path/to/server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  When using `--python`, `--project`, or `--with-requirements`, the generated configuration will include these options in the `uv run` command, ensuring your server runs with the correct Python version and dependencies.
</Note>

<Note>
  Different MCP clients may have specific configuration requirements or formatting needs. Always consult your client's documentation to ensure proper integration.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

### Server Naming

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use server's built-in name (from FastMCP constructor)
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py

# Override with custom name
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --name "Custom Server Name"
```

### Dependencies

Add Python packages your server needs:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Single package
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --with pandas

# Multiple packages  
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --with pandas --with requests --with httpx

# Editable local package
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --with-editable ./my-package

# From requirements file
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

You can also use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file (recommended):

```json fastmcp.json theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "matplotlib", "seaborn"]
  }
}
```

Then simply install with:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json fastmcp.json
```

### Environment Variables

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Individual environment variables
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py \
  --env API_KEY=your-secret-key \
  --env DEBUG=true

# Load from .env file
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --env-file .env
```

### Python Version and Project Directory

Specify Python version or run within a specific project:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use specific Python version
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --python 3.11

# Run within a project directory
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --project /path/to/project
```

### Server Object Selection

Use the same `file.py:object` notation as other FastMCP commands:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Auto-detects server object (looks for 'mcp', 'server', or 'app')
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py

# Explicit server object
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py:my_custom_server
```

## Clipboard Integration

Copy configuration directly to your clipboard for easy pasting:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --copy
```

<Note>
  The `--copy` flag requires the `pyperclip` Python package. If not installed, you'll see an error message with installation instructions.
</Note>

## Usage Examples

### Basic Server

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json dice_server.py
```

Output:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "Dice Server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "fastmcp",
      "fastmcp", 
      "run",
      "/home/user/dice_server.py"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Production Server with Dependencies

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json api_server.py \
  --name "Production API Server" \
  --with requests \
  --with python-dotenv \
  --env API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
  --env TIMEOUT=30
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json ml_server.py \
  --name "ML Analysis Server" \
  --python 3.11 \
  --with-requirements requirements.txt \
  --project /home/user/ml-project \
  --env GPU_DEVICE=0
```

Output:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "Production API Server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "fastmcp",
      "--with",
      "python-dotenv", 
      "--with",
      "requests",
      "fastmcp",
      "run", 
      "/home/user/api_server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
      "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com",
      "TIMEOUT": "30"
    }
  }
}
```

The advanced configuration example generates:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "ML Analysis Server": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--python",
      "3.11",
      "--project",
      "/home/user/ml-project",
      "--with",
      "fastmcp",
      "--with-requirements",
      "requirements.txt",
      "fastmcp",
      "run",
      "/home/user/ml_server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
      "GPU_DEVICE": "0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Pipeline Usage

Save configuration to file:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py > mcp-config.json
```

Use in shell scripts:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
#!/bin/bash
CONFIG=$(fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --name "CI Server")
echo "$CONFIG" | jq '."CI Server".command'
# Output: "uv"
```

## Integration with MCP Clients

The generated configuration works with any MCP-compatible application:

### Claude Desktop

<Note>
  **Prefer [`fastmcp install claude-desktop`](/integrations/claude-desktop)** for automatic installation. Use MCP JSON for advanced configuration needs.
</Note>

Copy the `mcpServers` object into `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Cursor

<Note>
  **Prefer [`fastmcp install cursor`](/integrations/cursor)** for automatic installation. Use MCP JSON for advanced configuration needs.
</Note>

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

### VS Code

Add to your workspace's `.vscode/mcp.json` file

### Custom Applications

Use the JSON configuration with any application that supports the MCP protocol

## Configuration Format

The generated configuration outputs a server object with the server name as the root key:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "<server-name>": {
    "command": "<executable>",
    "args": ["<arg1>", "<arg2>", "..."],
    "env": {
      "<ENV_VAR>": "<value>"
    }
  }
}
```

To use this in an MCP client, add it to the client's `mcpServers` configuration object.

**Fields:**

* `command`: The executable to run (always `uv` for FastMCP servers)
* `args`: Command-line arguments including dependencies and server path
* `env`: Environment variables (only included if specified)

<Warning>
  **All file paths in the generated configuration are absolute paths**. This ensures the configuration works regardless of the working directory when the MCP client starts the server.
</Warning>

## Requirements

* **uv**: Must be installed and available in your system PATH
* **pyperclip** (optional): Required only for `--copy` functionality

Install uv if not already available:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# macOS
brew install uv

# Linux/Windows  
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```


# OpenAI API 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openai

Connect FastMCP servers to the OpenAI API

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

## Responses API

OpenAI's [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) supports [MCP servers](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp) as remote tool sources, allowing you to extend AI capabilities with custom functions.

<Note>
  The Responses API is a distinct API from OpenAI's Completions API or Assistants API. At this time, only the Responses API supports MCP.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Currently, the Responses API only accesses **tools** from MCP servers—it queries the `list_tools` endpoint and exposes those functions to the AI agent. Other MCP features like resources and prompts are not currently supported.
</Tip>

### Create a Server

First, create a FastMCP server with the tools you want to expose. For this example, we'll create a server with a single tool that rolls dice.

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

### Deploy the Server

Your server must be deployed to a public URL in order for OpenAI to access it.

For development, you can use tools like `ngrok` to temporarily expose a locally-running server to the internet. We'll do that for this example (you may need to install `ngrok` and create a free account), but you can use any other method to deploy your server.

Assuming you saved the above code as `server.py`, you can run the following two commands in two separate terminals to deploy your server and expose it to the internet:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash FastMCP server theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  python server.py
  ```

  ```bash ngrok theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  ngrok http 8000
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  This exposes your unauthenticated server to the internet. Only run this command in a safe environment if you understand the risks.
</Warning>

### Call the Server

To use the Responses API, you'll need to install the OpenAI Python SDK (not included with FastMCP):

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install openai
```

You'll also need to authenticate with OpenAI. You can do this by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Consult the OpenAI SDK documentation for more information.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Here is an example of how to call your server from Python. Note that you'll need to replace `https://your-server-url.com` with the actual URL of your server. In addition, we use `/mcp/` as the endpoint because we deployed a streamable-HTTP server with the default path; you may need to use a different endpoint if you customized your server's deployment.

```python {4, 11-16} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from openai import OpenAI

# Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
url = 'https://your-server-url.com'

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "dice_server",
            "server_url": f"{url}/mcp/",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="Roll a few dice!",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

If you run this code, you'll see something like the following output:

```text  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
You rolled 3 dice and got the following results: 6, 4, and 2!
```

### Authentication

<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

The Responses API can include headers to authenticate the request, which means you don't have to worry about your server being publicly accessible.

#### Server Authentication

The simplest way to add authentication to the server is to use a bearer token scheme.

For this example, we'll quickly generate our own tokens with FastMCP's `RSAKeyPair` utility, but this may not be appropriate for production use. For more details, see the complete server-side [Token Verification](/servers/auth/token-verification) documentation.

We'll start by creating an RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair

key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")
```

<Warning>
  FastMCP's `RSAKeyPair` utility is for development and testing only.
</Warning>

Next, we'll create a `JWTVerifier` to authenticate the server.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier

auth = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=key_pair.public_key,
    audience="dice-server",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)
```

Here is a complete example that you can copy/paste. For simplicity and the purposes of this example only, it will print the token to the console. **Do NOT do this in production!**

```python server.py [expandable] theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import JWTVerifier
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import RSAKeyPair
import random

key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()
access_token = key_pair.create_token(audience="dice-server")

auth = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=key_pair.public_key,
    audience="dice-server",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller", auth=auth)

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"\n---\n\n🔑 Dice Roller access token:\n\n{access_token}\n\n---\n")
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

#### Client Authentication

If you try to call the authenticated server with the same OpenAI code we wrote earlier, you'll get an error like this:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pythonAPIStatusError: Error code: 424 - {
    "error": {
        "message": "Error retrieving tool list from MCP server: 'dice_server'. Http status code: 401 (Unauthorized)",
        "type": "external_connector_error",
        "param": "tools",
        "code": "http_error"
    }
}
```

As expected, the server is rejecting the request because it's not authenticated.

To authenticate the client, you can pass the token in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

```python {4, 7, 19-21} [expandable] theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from openai import OpenAI

# Your server URL (replace with your actual URL)
url = 'https://your-server-url.com'

# Your access token (replace with your actual token)
access_token = 'your-access-token'

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "dice_server",
            "server_url": f"{url}/mcp/",
            "require_approval": "never",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"
            }
        },
    ],
    input="Roll a few dice!",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

You should now see the dice roll results in the output.


# OpenAPI 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openapi

Generate MCP servers from any OpenAPI specification

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

<Tip>
  **New in 2.11**: FastMCP is introducing a next-generation OpenAPI parser. The new parser has greatly improved performance and compatibility, and is also easier to maintain. To enable it, set the environment variable `FASTMCP_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_OPENAPI_PARSER=true`.

  The new parser is largely API-compatible with the existing implementation and will become the default in a future version. We encourage all users to test it and report any issues before it becomes the default.
</Tip>

FastMCP can automatically generate an MCP server from any OpenAPI specification, allowing AI models to interact with existing APIs through the MCP protocol. Instead of manually creating tools and resources, you provide an OpenAPI spec and FastMCP intelligently converts API endpoints into the appropriate MCP components.

<Tip>
  Generating MCP servers from OpenAPI is a great way to get started with FastMCP, but in practice LLMs achieve **significantly better performance** with well-designed and curated MCP servers than with auto-converted OpenAPI servers. This is especially true for complex APIs with many endpoints and parameters.

  We recommend using the FastAPI integration for bootstrapping and prototyping, not for mirroring your API to LLM clients. See the post [Stop Converting Your REST APIs to MCP](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/stop-converting-rest-apis-to-mcp) for more details.
</Tip>

## Create a Server

To convert an OpenAPI specification to an MCP server, use the `FastMCP.from_openapi()` class method:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an HTTP client for your API
client = httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="https://api.example.com")

# Load your OpenAPI spec 
openapi_spec = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/openapi.json").json()

# Create the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=openapi_spec,
    client=client,
    name="My API Server"
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Authentication

If your API requires authentication, configure it on the HTTP client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Bearer token authentication
api_client = httpx.AsyncClient(
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}
)

# Create MCP server with authenticated client
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec, 
    client=api_client,
    timeout=30.0  # 30 second timeout for all requests
)
```

## Route Mapping

By default, FastMCP converts **every endpoint** in your OpenAPI specification into an MCP **Tool**. This provides a simple, predictable starting point that ensures all your API's functionality is immediately available to the vast majority of LLM clients which only support MCP tools.

While this is a pragmatic default for maximum compatibility, you can easily customize this behavior. Internally, FastMCP uses an ordered list of `RouteMap` objects to determine how to map OpenAPI routes to various MCP component types.

Each `RouteMap` specifies a combination of methods, patterns, and tags, as well as a corresponding MCP component type. Each OpenAPI route is checked against each `RouteMap` in order, and the first one that matches every criteria is used to determine its converted MCP type. A special type, `EXCLUDE`, can be used to exclude routes from the MCP server entirely.

* **Methods**: HTTP methods to match (e.g. `["GET", "POST"]` or `"*"` for all)
* **Pattern**: Regex pattern to match the route path (e.g. `r"^/users/.*"` or `r".*"` for all)
* **Tags**: A set of OpenAPI tags that must all be present. An empty set (`{}`) means no tag filtering, so the route matches regardless of its tags.
* **MCP type**: What MCP component type to create (`TOOL`, `RESOURCE`, `RESOURCE_TEMPLATE`, or `EXCLUDE`)
* **MCP tags**: A set of custom tags to add to components created from matching routes

Here is FastMCP's default rule:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

DEFAULT_ROUTE_MAPPINGS = [
    # All routes become tools
    RouteMap(mcp_type=MCPType.TOOL),
]
```

<Tip>
  **Experimental Parser**: If you're using the new parser (enabled via `FASTMCP_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_OPENAPI_PARSER=true`), import from the experimental module instead:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp.experimental.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType
  ```

  The API is identical, but the implementation provides better performance and serverless compatibility.
</Tip>

### Custom Route Maps

When creating your FastMCP server, you can customize routing behavior by providing your own list of `RouteMap` objects. Your custom maps are processed before the default route maps, and routes will be assigned to the first matching custom map.

For example, prior to FastMCP 2.8.0, GET requests were automatically mapped to `Resource` and `ResourceTemplate` components based on whether they had path parameters. (This was changed solely for client compatibility reasons.) You can restore this behavior by providing custom route maps:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

# Restore pre-2.8.0 semantic mapping
semantic_maps = [
    # GET requests with path parameters become ResourceTemplates
    RouteMap(methods=["GET"], pattern=r".*\{.*\}.*", mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE),
    # All other GET requests become Resources
    RouteMap(methods=["GET"], pattern=r".*", mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE),
]

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_maps=semantic_maps,
)
```

With these maps, `GET` requests are handled semantically, and all other methods (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.) will fall through to the default rule and become `Tool`s.

Here is a more complete example that uses custom route maps to convert all `GET` endpoints under `/analytics/` to tools while excluding all admin endpoints and all routes tagged "internal". All other routes will be handled by the default rules:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_maps=[
        # Analytics `GET` endpoints are tools
        RouteMap(
            methods=["GET"], 
            pattern=r"^/analytics/.*", 
            mcp_type=MCPType.TOOL,
        ),

        # Exclude all admin endpoints
        RouteMap(
            pattern=r"^/admin/.*", 
            mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE,
        ),

        # Exclude all routes tagged "internal"
        RouteMap(
            tags={"internal"},
            mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE,
        ),
    ],
)
```

<Tip>
  The default route maps are always applied after your custom maps, so you do not have to create route maps for every possible route.
</Tip>

### Excluding Routes

To exclude routes from the MCP server, use a route map to assign them to `MCPType.EXCLUDE`.

You can use this to remove sensitive or internal routes by targeting them specifically:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_maps=[
        RouteMap(pattern=r"^/admin/.*", mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
        RouteMap(tags={"internal"}, mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
    ],
)
```

Or you can use a catch-all rule to exclude everything that your maps don't handle explicitly:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_maps=[
        # custom mapping logic goes here
        # ... your specific route maps ...
        # exclude all remaining routes
        RouteMap(mcp_type=MCPType.EXCLUDE),
    ],
)
```

<Tip>
  Using a catch-all exclusion rule will prevent the default route mappings from being applied, since it will match every remaining route. This is useful if you want to explicitly allow-list certain routes.
</Tip>

### Advanced Route Mapping

<VersionBadge version="2.5.0" />

For advanced use cases that require more complex logic, you can provide a `route_map_fn` callable. After the route map logic is applied, this function is called on each matched route and its assigned MCP component type. It can optionally return a different component type to override the mapped assignment. If it returns `None`, the assigned type is used.

In addition to more precise targeting of methods, patterns, and tags, this function can access any additional OpenAPI metadata about the route.

<Tip>
  The `route_map_fn` is called on all routes, even those that matched `MCPType.EXCLUDE` in your custom maps. This gives you an opportunity to customize the mapping or even override an exclusion.
</Tip>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType, HTTPRoute

def custom_route_mapper(route: HTTPRoute, mcp_type: MCPType) -> MCPType | None:
    """Advanced route type mapping."""
    # Convert all admin routes to tools regardless of HTTP method
    if "/admin/" in route.path:
        return MCPType.TOOL

    elif "internal" in route.tags:
        return MCPType.EXCLUDE
    
    # Convert user detail routes to templates even if they're POST
    elif route.path.startswith("/users/") and route.method == "POST":
        return MCPType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE
    
    # Use defaults for all other routes
    return None

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_map_fn=custom_route_mapper,
)
```

## Customization

### Component Names

<VersionBadge version="2.5.0" />

FastMCP automatically generates names for MCP components based on the OpenAPI specification. By default, it uses the `operationId` from your OpenAPI spec, up to the first double underscore (`__`).

All component names are automatically:

* **Slugified**: Spaces and special characters are converted to underscores or removed
* **Truncated**: Limited to 56 characters maximum to ensure compatibility
* **Unique**: If multiple components have the same name, a number is automatically appended to make them unique

For more control over component names, you can provide an `mcp_names` dictionary that maps `operationId` values to your desired names. The `operationId` must be exactly as it appears in the OpenAPI spec. The provided name will always be slugified and truncated.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    mcp_names={
        "list_users__with_pagination": "user_list",
        "create_user__admin_required": "create_user", 
        "get_user_details__admin_required": "user_detail",
    }
)
```

Any `operationId` not found in `mcp_names` will use the default strategy (operationId up to the first `__`).

### Tags

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

FastMCP provides several ways to add tags to your MCP components, allowing you to categorize and organize them for better discoverability and filtering. Tags are combined from multiple sources to create the final set of tags on each component.

#### RouteMap Tags

You can add custom tags to components created from specific routes using the `mcp_tags` parameter in `RouteMap`. These tags will be applied to all components created from routes that match that particular route map.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.openapi import RouteMap, MCPType

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    route_maps=[
        # Add custom tags to all POST endpoints
        RouteMap(
            methods=["POST"],
            pattern=r".*",
            mcp_type=MCPType.TOOL,
            mcp_tags={"write-operation", "api-mutation"}
        ),
        
        # Add different tags to detail view endpoints
        RouteMap(
            methods=["GET"],
            pattern=r".*\{.*\}.*",
            mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE,
            mcp_tags={"detail-view", "parameterized"}
        ),
        
        # Add tags to list endpoints
        RouteMap(
            methods=["GET"],
            pattern=r".*",
            mcp_type=MCPType.RESOURCE,
            mcp_tags={"list-data", "collection"}
        ),
    ],
)
```

#### Global Tags

You can add tags to **all** components by providing a `tags` parameter when creating your MCP server. These global tags will be applied to every component created from your OpenAPI specification.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    tags={"api-v2", "production", "external"}
)
```

#### OpenAPI Tags in Client Meta

FastMCP automatically includes OpenAPI tags from your specification in the component's metadata. These tags are available to MCP clients through the `_meta._fastmcp.tags` field, allowing clients to filter and organize components based on the original OpenAPI tagging:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json {5} OpenAPI spec with tags theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "get": {
          "tags": ["users", "public"],
          "operationId": "list_users",
          "summary": "List all users"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```python {6-9} Access OpenAPI tags in MCP client theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async with client:
      tools = await client.list_tools()
      for tool in tools:
          if hasattr(tool, '_meta') and tool._meta:
              # OpenAPI tags are now available in _fastmcp namespace!
              fastmcp_meta = tool._meta.get('_fastmcp', {})
              openapi_tags = fastmcp_meta.get('tags', [])
              if 'users' in openapi_tags:
                  print(f"Found user-related tool: {tool.name}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This makes it easy for clients to understand and organize API endpoints based on their original OpenAPI categorization.

### Advanced Customization

<VersionBadge version="2.5.0" />

By default, FastMCP creates MCP components using a variety of metadata from the OpenAPI spec, such as incorporating the OpenAPI description into the MCP component description.

At times you may want to modify those MCP components in a variety of ways, such as adding LLM-specific instructions or tags. For fine-grained customization, you can provide a `mcp_component_fn` when creating the MCP server. After each MCP component has been created, this function is called on it and has the opportunity to modify it in-place.

<Tip>
  Your `mcp_component_fn` is expected to modify the component in-place, not to return a new component. The result of the function is ignored.
</Tip>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.openapi import (
    HTTPRoute, 
    OpenAPITool, 
    OpenAPIResource, 
    OpenAPIResourceTemplate,
)

# If using experimental parser, import from experimental module:
# from fastmcp.experimental.server.openapi import (
#     HTTPRoute,
#     OpenAPITool,
#     OpenAPIResource,
#     OpenAPIResourceTemplate,
# )

def customize_components(
    route: HTTPRoute, 
    component: OpenAPITool | OpenAPIResource | OpenAPIResourceTemplate,
) -> None:
    # Add custom tags to all components
    component.tags.add("openapi")
    
    # Customize based on component type
    if isinstance(component, OpenAPITool):
        component.description = f"🔧 {component.description} (via API)"
    
    if isinstance(component, OpenAPIResource):
        component.description = f"📊 {component.description}"
        component.tags.add("data")

mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(
    openapi_spec=spec,
    client=client,
    mcp_component_fn=customize_components,
)
```

## Request Parameter Handling

FastMCP intelligently handles different types of parameters in OpenAPI requests:

### Query Parameters

By default, FastMCP only includes query parameters that have non-empty values. Parameters with `None` values or empty strings are automatically filtered out.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# When calling this tool...
await client.call_tool("search_products", {
    "category": "electronics",  # ✅ Included
    "min_price": 100,           # ✅ Included  
    "max_price": None,          # ❌ Excluded
    "brand": "",                # ❌ Excluded
})

# The HTTP request will be: GET /products?category=electronics&min_price=100
```

### Path Parameters

Path parameters are typically required by REST APIs. FastMCP:

* Filters out `None` values
* Validates that all required path parameters are provided
* Raises clear errors for missing required parameters

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# ✅ This works
await client.call_tool("get_user", {"user_id": 123})

# ❌ This raises: "Missing required path parameters: {'user_id'}"
await client.call_tool("get_user", {"user_id": None})
```

### Array Parameters

FastMCP handles array parameters according to OpenAPI specifications:

* **Query arrays**: Serialized based on the `explode` parameter (default: `True`)
* **Path arrays**: Serialized as comma-separated values (OpenAPI 'simple' style)

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Query array with explode=true (default)
# ?tags=red&tags=blue&tags=green

# Query array with explode=false  
# ?tags=red,blue,green

# Path array (always comma-separated)
# /items/red,blue,green
```

### Headers

Header parameters are automatically converted to strings and included in the HTTP request.


# Permit.io Authorization 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/permit

Add fine-grained authorization to your FastMCP servers with Permit.io

Add **policy-based authorization** to your FastMCP servers with one-line code addition with the **[Permit.io][permit-github] authorization middleware**.

Control which tools, resources and prompts MCP clients can view and execute on your server. Define dynamic policies using Permit.io's powerful RBAC, ABAC, and REBAC capabilities, and obtain comprehensive audit logs of all access attempts and violations.

## How it Works

Leveraging FastMCP's [Middleware][fastmcp-middleware], the Permit.io middleware intercepts all MCP requests to your server and automatically maps MCP methods to authorization checks against your Permit.io policies; covering both server methods and tool execution.

### Policy Mapping

The middleware automatically maps MCP methods to Permit.io resources and actions:

* **MCP server methods** (e.g., `tools/list`, `resources/read`):
  * **Resource**: `{server_name}_{component}` (e.g., `myserver_tools`)
  * **Action**: The method verb (e.g., `list`, `read`)
* **Tool execution** (method `tools/call`):

*Example: In Permit.io, the 'Admin' role is granted permissions on resources and actions as mapped by the middleware. For example, 'greet', 'greet-jwt', and 'login' are actions on the 'mcp\_server' resource, and 'list' is an action on the 'mcp\_server\_tools' resource.*

> **Note:**
> Don't forget to assign the relevant role (e.g., Admin, User) to the user authenticating to your MCP server (such as the user in the JWT) in the Permit.io Directory. Without the correct role assignment, users will not have access to the resources and actions you've configured in your policies.

### Listing Operations

The middleware behaves as a filter for listing operations (`tools/list`, `resources/list`, `prompts/list`), hiding to the client components that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant PermitMiddleware as Permit.io Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant PermitPDP as Permit.io PDP

    MCPClient->>PermitMiddleware: MCP Listing Request (e.g., tools/list)
    PermitMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Listing Request
    MCPServer-->>PermitMiddleware: MCP Listing Response
    PermitMiddleware->>PermitPDP: Authorization Checks
    PermitPDP->>PermitMiddleware: Authorization Decisions
    PermitMiddleware-->>MCPClient: Filtered MCP Listing Response
```

### Execution Operations

The middleware behaves as an enforcement point for execution operations (`tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`), blocking operations that are not authorized by the defined policies.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant MCPClient as MCP Client
    participant PermitMiddleware as Permit.io Middleware
    participant MCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant PermitPDP as Permit.io PDP

    MCPClient->>PermitMiddleware: MCP Execution Request (e.g., tools/call)
    PermitMiddleware->>PermitPDP: Authorization Check
    PermitPDP->>PermitMiddleware: Authorization Decision
    PermitMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Unauthorized Error (if denied)
    PermitMiddleware->>MCPServer: MCP Execution Request (if allowed)
    MCPServer-->>PermitMiddleware: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
    PermitMiddleware-->>MCPClient: MCP Execution Response (if allowed)
```

## Add Authorization to Your Server

<Note>
  Permit.io is a cloud-native authorization service. You need a Permit.io account and a running Policy Decision Point (PDP) for the middleware to function. You can run the PDP locally with Docker or use Permit.io's cloud PDP.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

1. **Permit.io Account**: Sign up at [permit.io](https://permit.io)
2. **PDP Setup**: Run the Permit.io PDP locally or use the cloud PDP (RBAC only)
3. **API Key**: Get your Permit.io API key from the dashboard

### Run the Permit.io PDP

Run the PDP locally with Docker:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
docker run -p 7766:7766 permitio/pdp:latest
```

Or use the cloud PDP URL: `https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io`

### Create a Server with Authorization

First, install the `permit-fastmcp` package:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Using UV (recommended)
uv add permit-fastmcp

# Using pip
pip install permit-fastmcp
```

Then create a FastMCP server and add the Permit.io middleware:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from permit_fastmcp.middleware.middleware import PermitMcpMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("Secure FastMCP Server 🔒")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

# Add Permit.io authorization middleware
mcp.add_middleware(PermitMcpMiddleware(
    permit_pdp_url="http://localhost:7766",
    permit_api_key="your-permit-api-key"
))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http")
```

### Configure Access Policies

Create your authorization policies in the Permit.io dashboard:

1. **Create Resources**: Define resources like `mcp_server` and `mcp_server_tools`
2. **Define Actions**: Add actions like `greet`, `add`, `list`, `read`
3. **Create Roles**: Define roles like `Admin`, `User`, `Guest`
4. **Assign Permissions**: Grant roles access to specific resources and actions
5. **Assign Users**: Assign roles to users in the Permit.io Directory

For step-by-step setup instructions and troubleshooting, see [Getting Started & FAQ](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).

#### Example Policy Configuration

Policies are defined in the Permit.io dashboard, but you can also use the [Permit.io Terraform provider](https://github.com/permitio/terraform-provider-permitio) to define policies in code.

```terraform  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Resources
resource "permitio_resource" "mcp_server" {
  name = "mcp_server"
  key  = "mcp_server"
  
  actions = {
    "greet" = { name = "greet" }
    "add"   = { name = "add" }
  }
}

resource "permitio_resource" "mcp_server_tools" {
  name = "mcp_server_tools"
  key  = "mcp_server_tools"
  
  actions = {
    "list" = { name = "list" }
  }
}

# Roles
resource "permitio_role" "Admin" {
  key         = "Admin"
  name        = "Admin"
  permissions = [
    "mcp_server:greet",
    "mcp_server:add", 
    "mcp_server_tools:list"
  ]
}
```

You can also use the [Permit.io CLI](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli), [API](https://api.permit.io/scalar) or [SDKs](https://github.com/permitio/permit-python) to manage policies, as well as writing policies directly in REGO (Open Policy Agent's policy language).

For complete policy examples including ABAC and RBAC configurations, see [Example Policies](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/tree/main/docs/example_policies).

### Identity Management

The middleware supports multiple identity extraction modes:

* **Fixed Identity**: Use a fixed identity for all requests
* **Header-based**: Extract identity from HTTP headers
* **JWT-based**: Extract and verify JWT tokens
* **Source-based**: Use the MCP context source field

For detailed identity mode configuration and environment variables, see [Identity Modes & Environment Variables](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/docs/identity-modes.md).

#### JWT Authentication Example

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os

# Configure JWT identity extraction
os.environ["PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_MODE"] = "jwt"
os.environ["PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_JWT_SECRET"] = "your-jwt-secret"

mcp.add_middleware(PermitMcpMiddleware(
    permit_pdp_url="http://localhost:7766",
    permit_api_key="your-permit-api-key"
))
```

### ABAC Policies with Tool Arguments

The middleware supports Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policies that can evaluate tool arguments as attributes. Tool arguments are automatically flattened as individual attributes (e.g., `arg_name`, `arg_number`) for granular policy conditions.

*Example: Create dynamic resources with conditions like `resource.arg_number greater-than 10` to allow the `conditional-greet` tool only when the number argument exceeds 10.*

#### Example: Conditional Access

Create a dynamic resource with conditions like `resource.arg_number greater-than 10` to allow the `conditional-greet` tool only when the number argument exceeds 10.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def conditional_greet(name: str, number: int) -> str:
    """Greet a user only if number > 10"""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Your number is {number}"
```

*Example: The Admin role is granted access to the "conditional-greet" action on the "Big-greets" dynamic resource, while other tools like "greet", "greet-jwt", and "login" are granted on the base "mcp\_server" resource.*

For comprehensive ABAC configuration and advanced policy examples, see [ABAC Policies with Tool Arguments](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/docs/policy-mapping.md#abac-policies-with-tool-arguments).

### Run the Server

Start your FastMCP server normally:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
python server.py
```

The middleware will now intercept all MCP requests and check them against your Permit.io policies. Requests include user identification through the configured identity mode and automatic mapping of MCP methods to authorization resources and actions.

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure the middleware using environment variables:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Permit.io configuration
export PERMIT_MCP_PERMIT_PDP_URL="http://localhost:7766"
export PERMIT_MCP_PERMIT_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Identity configuration
export PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_MODE="jwt"
export PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

# Method configuration
export PERMIT_MCP_KNOWN_METHODS='["tools/list","tools/call"]'
export PERMIT_MCP_BYPASSED_METHODS='["initialize","ping"]'

# Logging configuration
export PERMIT_MCP_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING="true"
```

For a complete list of all configuration options and environment variables, see [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/docs/configuration-reference.md).

### Custom Middleware Configuration

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from permit_fastmcp.middleware.middleware import PermitMcpMiddleware

middleware = PermitMcpMiddleware(
    permit_pdp_url="http://localhost:7766",
    permit_api_key="your-api-key",
    enable_audit_logging=True,
    bypass_methods=["initialize", "ping", "health/*"]
)

mcp.add_middleware(middleware)
```

For advanced configuration options and custom middleware extensions, see [Advanced Configuration](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/docs/advanced-configuration.md).

## Example: Complete JWT Authentication Server

See the [example server](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/permit_fastmcp/example_server/example.py) for a full implementation with JWT-based authentication. For additional examples and usage patterns, see [Example Server](https://github.com/permitio/permit-fastmcp/blob/main/permit_fastmcp/example_server/):

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from permit_fastmcp.middleware.middleware import PermitMcpMiddleware
import jwt
import datetime

# Configure JWT identity extraction
os.environ["PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_MODE"] = "jwt"
os.environ["PERMIT_MCP_IDENTITY_JWT_SECRET"] = "mysecretkey"

mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")

@mcp.tool
def login(username: str, password: str) -> str:
    """Login to get a JWT token"""
    if username == "admin" and password == "password":
        token = jwt.encode(
            {"sub": username, "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)},
            "mysecretkey",
            algorithm="HS256"
        )
        return f"Bearer {token}"
    raise Exception("Invalid credentials")

@mcp.tool
def greet_jwt(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Greet a user by extracting their name from JWT"""
    # JWT extraction handled by middleware
    return "Hello, authenticated user!"

mcp.add_middleware(PermitMcpMiddleware(
    permit_pdp_url="http://localhost:7766",
    permit_api_key="your-permit-api-key"
))

if __name__ == "__main__":

# Scalekit 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit

Secure your FastMCP server with Scalekit

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.5" />

Install auth stack to your FastMCP server with [Scalekit](https://scalekit.com) using the [Remote OAuth](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) pattern: Scalekit handles user authentication, and the MCP server validates issued tokens.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin

1. Get a [Scalekit account](https://app.scalekit.com/) and grab API credentials such as **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Environment URL** from *Dashboard > Developers > Settings*.
2. Have your FastMCP server's endpoint ready (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp`)

### Step 1: Configure MCP server in Scalekit environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register MCP server and set environment">
    In your Scalekit dashboard:

    1. Open the **MCP Servers** section, then select **Create new server**
    2. Enter server details: a name, a resource identifier, and the desired MCP client authentication settings
    3. Save, then copy the **Resource ID** (for example, res\_92015146095)

    In your FastMCP project's `.env`:

    ```sh  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL=<YOUR_APP_ENVIRONMENT_URL>
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID> # skc_7008EXAMPLE46
    SCALEKIT_RESOURCE_ID=<YOUR_APP_RESOURCE_ID> # res_926EXAMPLE5878
    MCP_URL=http://localhost:8000/mcp
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add auth to FastMCP server

Create your FastMCP server file and use the ScalekitProvider to handle all the OAuth integration automatically:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.scalekit import ScalekitProvider

# Discovers Scalekit endpoints and set up JWT token validation
auth_provider = ScalekitProvider(
    environment_url=SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL,    # Scalekit environment URL
    client_id=SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID,                # OAuth client ID
    resource_id=SCALEKIT_RESOURCE_ID,            # Resource server ID
    mcp_url=SERVER_URL,                          # Is also aud claim
)

# Create FastMCP server with auth
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Scalekit Protected Server", auth=auth_provider)

@mcp.tool
def auth_status() -> dict:
    """Show Scalekit authentication status."""
    # Extract user claims from the JWT
    return {
        "message": "This tool requires authentication via Scalekit",
        "authenticated": True,
        "provider": "Scalekit"
    }

```

## Testing

### Start the MCP server

```sh  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
uv run python server.py
```

Use any MCP client (for example, mcp-inspector, Claude, VS Code, or Windsurf) to connect to the running serve. Verify that authentication succeeds and requests are authorized as expected.

### Provider selection

Setting this environment variable allows the Scalekit provider to be used automatically without explicitly instantiating it in code.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" default="Not set">
    Set to `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.scalekit.ScalekitProvider` to use Scalekit authentication.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Scalekit-specific configuration

These environment variables provide default values for the Scalekit provider, whether it's instantiated manually or configured via `FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH`.

<Card>
  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_ENVIRONMENT_URL" required>
    Your Scalekit environment URL from the Admin Portal (e.g., `https://your-env.scalekit.com`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_CLIENT_ID" required>
    Your Scalekit OAuth application client ID from the Applications section
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_RESOURCE_ID" required>
    Your Scalekit resource server ID from the Resources section
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_MCP_URL" required>
    Public URL of your FastMCP server (e.g., `https://your-server.com` or `http://localhost:8000/mcp` for development)
  </ParamField>
</Card>

Example `.env`:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Use the Scalekit provider
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.scalekit.ScalekitProvider

# Scalekit configuration
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_ENVIRONMENT_URL=https://your-env.scalekit.com
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=skc_123
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_RESOURCE_ID=res_456
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_SCALEKITPROVIDER_MCP_URL=https://your-server.com/mcp
```

With environment variables set, your server code simplifies to:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication is automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Scalekit Protected Server")

@mcp.tool
def protected_action() -> str:
    """A tool that requires authentication."""
    return "Access granted via Scalekit!"
```

## Capabilities

Scalekit supports OAuth 2.1 with Dynamic Client Registration for MCP clients and enterprise SSO, and provides built‑in JWT validation and security controls.

**OAuth 2.1/DCR**: clients self‑register, use PKCE, and work with the Remote OAuth pattern without pre‑provisioned credentials.

**Validation and SSO**: tokens are verified (keys, RS256, issuer, audience, expiry), and SAML, OIDC, OAuth 2.0, ADFS, Azure AD, and Google Workspace are supported; use HTTPS in production and review auth logs as needed.

## Debugging

Enable detailed logging to troubleshoot authentication issues:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Token inspection

You can inspect JWT tokens in your tools to understand the user context:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.context import request_ctx
import jwt

@mcp.tool
def inspect_token() -> dict:
    """Inspect the current JWT token claims."""
    context = request_ctx.get()

    # Extract token from Authorization header
    if hasattr(context, 'request') and hasattr(context.request, 'headers'):
        auth_header = context.request.headers.get('authorization', '')
        if auth_header.startswith('Bearer '):
            token = auth_header[7:]
            # Decode without verification (already verified by provider)
            claims = jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})
            return claims

    return {"error": "No token found"}
```


# WorkOS 🤝 FastMCP
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos

Authenticate FastMCP servers with WorkOS Connect

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>

        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

Secure your FastMCP server with WorkOS Connect authentication. This integration uses the OAuth Proxy pattern to handle authentication through WorkOS Connect while maintaining compatibility with MCP clients.

<Note>
  This guide covers WorkOS Connect applications. For Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) with AuthKit, see the [AuthKit integration](/integrations/authkit) instead.
</Note>

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

1. A **[WorkOS Account](https://workos.com/)** with access to create OAuth Apps
2. Your FastMCP server's URL (can be localhost for development, e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

### Step 1: Create a WorkOS OAuth App

Create an OAuth App in your WorkOS dashboard to get the credentials needed for authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create OAuth Application">
    In your WorkOS dashboard:

    1. Navigate to **Applications**
    2. Click **Create Application**
    3. Select **OAuth Application**
    4. Name your application
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Credentials">
    In your OAuth application settings:

    1. Copy your **Client ID** (starts with `client_`)
    2. Click **Generate Client Secret** and save it securely
    3. Copy your **AuthKit Domain** (e.g., `https://your-app.authkit.app`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Redirect URI">
    In the **Redirect URIs** section:

    * Add: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback` (for development)
    * For production, add your server's public URL + `/auth/callback`

    <Warning>
      The callback URL must match exactly. The default path is `/auth/callback`, but you can customize it using the `redirect_path` parameter.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: FastMCP Configuration

Create your FastMCP server using the `WorkOSProvider`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import WorkOSProvider

# Configure WorkOS OAuth
auth = WorkOSProvider(
    client_id="client_YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    authkit_domain="https://your-app.authkit.app",
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    required_scopes=["openid", "profile", "email"]
)

mcp = FastMCP("WorkOS Protected Server", auth=auth)

@mcp.tool
def protected_tool(message: str) -> str:
    """This tool requires authentication."""
    return f"Authenticated user says: {message}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

## Testing

### Running the Server

Start your FastMCP server with HTTP transport to enable OAuth flows:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py --transport http --port 8000
```

Your server is now running and protected by WorkOS OAuth authentication.

### Testing with a Client

Create a test client that authenticates with your WorkOS-protected server:

```python client.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
import asyncio

async def main():    
    # The client will automatically handle WorkOS OAuth
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # First-time connection will open WorkOS login in your browser
        print("✓ Authenticated with WorkOS!")
        
        # Test the protected tool
        result = await client.call_tool("protected_tool", {"message": "Hello!"})
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run the client for the first time:

1. Your browser will open to WorkOS's authorization page
2. After you authorize the app, you'll be redirected back
3. The client receives the token and can make authenticated requests

<Info>
  The client caches tokens locally, so you won't need to re-authenticate for subsequent runs unless the token expires or you explicitly clear the cache.
</Info>

## Production Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments with persistent token management across server restarts, configure `jwt_signing_key`, and `client_storage`:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import WorkOSProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Production setup with encrypted persistent token storage
auth = WorkOSProvider(
    client_id="client_YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    authkit_domain="https://your-app.authkit.app",
    base_url="https://your-production-domain.com",
    required_scopes=["openid", "profile", "email"],

    # Production token management
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(
            host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
            port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"])
        ),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Production WorkOS App", auth=auth)
```

<Note>
  Parameters (`jwt_signing_key` and `client_storage`) work together to ensure tokens and client registrations survive server restarts. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. Store secrets in environment variables and use a persistent storage backend like Redis for distributed deployments.

  For complete details on these parameters, see the [OAuth Proxy documentation](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#configuration-parameters).
</Note>

## Environment Variables

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.

## `fastmcp run`

Run a FastMCP server directly or proxy a remote server.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py
```

<Tip>
  By default, this command runs the server directly in your current Python environment. You are responsible for ensuring all dependencies are available. When using `--python`, `--with`, `--project`, or `--with-requirements` options, it runs the server via `uv run` subprocess instead.
</Tip>

### Options

| Option              | Flag                  | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transport           | `--transport`, `-t`   | Transport protocol to use (`stdio`, `http`, or `sse`)                           |
| Host                | `--host`              | Host to bind to when using http transport (default: 127.0.0.1)                  |
| Port                | `--port`, `-p`        | Port to bind to when using http transport (default: 8000)                       |
| Path                | `--path`              | Path to bind to when using http transport (default: `/mcp/` or `/sse/` for SSE) |
| Log Level           | `--log-level`, `-l`   | Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)                               |
| No Banner           | `--no-banner`         | Disable the startup banner display                                              |

| Project Directory   | `--project`           | Run the command within the given project directory                              |
| Requirements File   | `--with-requirements` | Requirements file to install dependencies from                                  |

### Entrypoints

<VersionBadge version="2.3.5" />

The `fastmcp run` command supports the following entrypoints:

1. **[Inferred server instance](#inferred-server-instance)**: `server.py` - imports the module and looks for a FastMCP server instance named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. Errors if no such object is found.
2. **[Explicit server entrypoint](#explicit-server-entrypoint)**: `server.py:custom_name` - imports and uses the specified server entrypoint
3. **[Factory function](#factory-function)**: `server.py:create_server` - calls the specified function (sync or async) to create a server instance
4. **[Remote server proxy](#remote-server-proxy)**: `https://example.com/mcp-server` - connects to a remote server and creates a **local proxy server**
5. **[FastMCP configuration file](#fastmcp-configuration)**: `fastmcp.json` - runs servers using FastMCP's declarative configuration format (auto-detects files in current directory)
6. **MCP configuration file**: `mcp.json` - runs servers defined in a standard MCP configuration file

<Warning>
  Note: When using `fastmcp run` with a local file, it **completely ignores** the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block. This means:

  * Any setup code in `__main__` will NOT run
  * Server configuration in `__main__` is bypassed
  * `fastmcp run` finds your server entrypoint/factory and runs it with its own transport settings

  If you need setup code to run, use the **factory pattern** instead.
</Warning>

#### Inferred Server Instance

If you provide a path to a file, `fastmcp run` will load the file and look for a FastMCP server instance stored as a variable named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. If no such object is found, it will raise an error.

For example, if you have a file called `server.py` with the following content:

```python server.py theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
```

You can run it with:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py
```

#### Explicit Server Entrypoint

If your server is stored as a variable with a custom name, or you want to be explicit about which server to run, you can use the following syntax to load a specific server entrypoint:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py:custom_name
```

For example, if you have a file called `server.py` with the following content:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

my_server = FastMCP("CustomServer")

@my_server.tool
def hello() -> str:
    return "Hello from custom server!"
```

You can run it with:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py:my_server
```

#### Factory Function

<VersionBadge version="2.11.2" />

Since `fastmcp run` ignores the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, you can use a factory function to run setup code before your server starts. Factory functions are called without any arguments and must return a FastMCP server instance. Both sync and async factory functions are supported.

The syntax for using a factory function is the same as for an explicit server entrypoint: `fastmcp run server.py:factory_fn`. FastMCP will automatically detect that you have identified a function rather than a server Instance

For example, if you have a file called `server.py` with the following content:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

async def create_server() -> FastMCP:
    mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        return x + y
    
    # Setup that runs with fastmcp run
    tool = await mcp.get_tool("add")
    tool.disable()
    
    return mcp
```

You can run it with:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run server.py:create_server
```

#### Remote Server Proxy

FastMCP run can also start a local proxy server that connects to a remote server. This is useful when you want to run a remote server locally for testing or development purposes, or to use with a client that doesn't support direct connections to remote servers.

To start a local proxy, you can use the following syntax:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run https://example.com/mcp
```

#### FastMCP Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.11.4" />

FastMCP supports declarative configuration through `fastmcp.json` files. When you run `fastmcp run` without arguments, it automatically looks for a `fastmcp.json` file in the current directory:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Auto-detect fastmcp.json in current directory
fastmcp run

# Or explicitly specify a configuration file
fastmcp run my-config.fastmcp.json
```

The configuration file handles dependencies, environment variables, and transport settings. Command-line arguments override configuration file values:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Override port from config file
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --port 8080

# Skip environment setup when already in a uv environment
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env
```

<Note>
  The `--skip-env` flag is useful when:

  * You're already in an activated virtual environment
  * You're inside a Docker container with pre-installed dependencies
  * You're in a uv-managed environment (prevents infinite recursion)
  * You want to test the server without environment setup
</Note>

See [Server Configuration](/deployment/server-configuration) for detailed documentation on fastmcp.json.

#### MCP Configuration

FastMCP can also run servers defined in a standard MCP configuration file. This is useful when you want to run multiple servers from a single file, or when you want to use a client that doesn't support direct connections to remote servers.

To run a MCP configuration file, you can use the following syntax:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run mcp.json
```

This will run all the servers defined in the file.

## `fastmcp dev`

Run a MCP server with the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) for testing.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp dev server.py
```

<Tip>
  This command always runs your server via `uv run` subprocess (never your local environment) to work with the MCP Inspector. Dependencies can be:

  * Specified using `--with` and/or `--with-editable` options
  * Defined in a `fastmcp.json` configuration file
  * Available in a uv-managed project

  When using `fastmcp.json`, the dev command automatically uses the configured dependencies.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The `dev` command is a shortcut for testing a server over STDIO only. When the Inspector launches, you may need to:

  1. Select "STDIO" from the transport dropdown
  2. Connect manually

  This command does not support HTTP testing. To test a server over Streamable HTTP or SSE:

  1. Start your server manually with the appropriate transport using either the command line:
     ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
     fastmcp run server.py --transport http
     ```
     or by setting the transport in your code:
     ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
     python server.py  # Assuming your __main__ block sets Streamable HTTP transport
     ```
  2. Open the MCP Inspector separately and connect to your running server
</Warning>

### Entrypoints

The `dev` command supports local FastMCP server files and configuration:

1. **Inferred server instance**: `server.py` - imports the module and looks for a FastMCP server instance named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. Errors if no such object is found.
2. **Explicit server entrypoint**: `server.py:custom_name` - imports and uses the specified server entrypoint
3. **Factory function**: `server.py:create_server` - calls the specified function (sync or async) to create a server instance
4. **FastMCP configuration**: `fastmcp.json` - uses FastMCP's declarative configuration (auto-detects in current directory)

<Warning>
  The `dev` command **only supports local files and fastmcp.json** - no URLs, remote servers, or standard MCP configuration files.
</Warning>

**Examples**

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run dev server with editable mode and additional packages
fastmcp dev server.py -e . --with pandas --with matplotlib

# Run dev server with fastmcp.json configuration (auto-detects)
fastmcp dev

# Run dev server with explicit fastmcp.json file
fastmcp dev dev.fastmcp.json

# Run dev server with specific Python version
fastmcp dev server.py --python 3.11

# Run dev server with requirements file
fastmcp dev server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt

# Run dev server within a specific project directory
fastmcp dev server.py --project /path/to/project
```

## `fastmcp install`

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

Install a MCP server in MCP client applications. FastMCP currently supports the following clients:

* **Claude Code** - Installs via Claude Code's built-in MCP management system
* **Claude Desktop** - Installs via direct configuration file modification
* **Cursor** - Installs via deeplink that opens Cursor for user confirmation
* **MCP JSON** - Generates standard MCP JSON configuration for manual use

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp install claude-code server.py
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py
fastmcp install cursor server.py
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py
```

Note that for security reasons, MCP clients usually run every server in a completely isolated environment. Therefore, all dependencies must be explicitly specified using the `--with` and/or `--with-editable` options (following `uv` conventions) or by attaching them to your server in code via the `dependencies` parameter. You should not assume that the MCP server will have access to your local environment.

<Warning>
  **`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Both Claude Desktop and Cursor run in isolated environments and need `uv` to manage dependencies. On macOS, install `uv` globally with Homebrew for Claude Desktop compatibility: `brew install uv`.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Python Version Considerations**: The install commands now support the `--python` option to specify a Python version directly. You can also use `--project` to run within a specific project directory or `--with-requirements` to install dependencies from a requirements file.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **FastMCP `install` commands focus on local server files with STDIO transport.** For remote servers running with HTTP or SSE transport, use your client's native configuration - FastMCP's value is simplifying the complex local setup with dependencies and `uv` commands.
</Tip>

### Entrypoints

The `install` command supports local FastMCP server files and configuration:

1. **Inferred server instance**: `server.py` - imports the module and looks for a FastMCP server instance named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. Errors if no such object is found.
2. **Explicit server entrypoint**: `server.py:custom_name` - imports and uses the specified server entrypoint
3. **Factory function**: `server.py:create_server` - calls the specified function (sync or async) to create a server instance
4. **FastMCP configuration**: `fastmcp.json` - uses FastMCP's declarative configuration with dependencies and settings

<Note>
  Factory functions are particularly useful for install commands since they allow setup code to run that would otherwise be ignored when the MCP client runs your server. When using fastmcp.json, dependencies are automatically handled.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The `install` command **only supports local files and fastmcp.json** - no URLs, remote servers, or standard MCP configuration files. For remote servers, use your MCP client's native configuration.
</Warning>

**Examples**

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Auto-detects server entrypoint (looks for 'mcp', 'server', or 'app')
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py

# Install with fastmcp.json configuration (auto-detects)
fastmcp install claude-desktop

# Install with explicit fastmcp.json file
fastmcp install claude-desktop my-config.fastmcp.json

# Uses specific server entrypoint
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py:my_server

# With custom name and dependencies
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py:my_server --server-name "My Analysis Server" --with pandas

# Install in Claude Code with environment variables
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --env API_KEY=secret --env DEBUG=true

# Install in Cursor with environment variables
fastmcp install cursor server.py --env API_KEY=secret --env DEBUG=true

# Install with environment file
fastmcp install cursor server.py --env-file .env

# Install with specific Python version
fastmcp install claude-desktop server.py --python 3.11

# Install with requirements file
fastmcp install claude-code server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt

# Install within a project directory
fastmcp install cursor server.py --project /path/to/project

# Generate MCP JSON configuration
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --name "My Server" --with pandas

# Copy JSON configuration to clipboard
fastmcp install mcp-json server.py --copy
```

### MCP JSON Generation

The `mcp-json` subcommand generates standard MCP JSON configuration that can be used with any MCP-compatible client. This is useful when:

* Working with MCP clients not directly supported by FastMCP
* Creating configuration for CI/CD environments
* Sharing server configurations with others
* Integration with custom tooling

The generated JSON follows the standard MCP server configuration format used by Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients, with the server name as the root key:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "server-name": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "--with",
      "fastmcp",
      "fastmcp",
      "run",
      "/path/to/server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  To use this configuration with your MCP client, you'll typically need to add it to the client's `mcpServers` object. Consult your client's documentation for any specific configuration requirements or formatting needs.
</Note>

**Options specific to mcp-json:**

| Option            | Flag     | Description                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Copy to Clipboard | `--copy` | Copy configuration to clipboard instead of printing to stdout |

## `fastmcp inspect`

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

Inspect a FastMCP server to view summary information or generate a detailed JSON report.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Show text summary
fastmcp inspect server.py

# Output FastMCP JSON to stdout
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp

# Save MCP JSON to file (format required with -o)
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o manifest.json
```

### Options

| Option      | Flag             | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Format      | `--format`, `-f` | Output format: `fastmcp` (FastMCP-specific) or `mcp` (MCP protocol). Required when using `-o` |
| Output File | `--output`, `-o` | Save JSON report to file instead of stdout. Requires `--format`                               |

### Output Formats

#### FastMCP Format (`--format fastmcp`)

The default and most comprehensive format, includes all FastMCP-specific metadata:

* Server name, instructions, and version
* FastMCP version and MCP version
* Tool tags and enabled status
* Output schemas for tools
* Annotations and custom metadata
* Uses snake\_case field names
* **Use this for**: Complete server introspection and debugging FastMCP servers

#### MCP Protocol Format (`--format mcp`)

Shows exactly what MCP clients will see via the protocol:

* Only includes standard MCP protocol fields
* Matches output from `client.list_tools()`, `client.list_prompts()`, etc.
* Uses camelCase field names (e.g., `inputSchema`)
* Excludes FastMCP-specific fields like tags and enabled status
* **Use this for**: Debugging client visibility and ensuring MCP compatibility

### Entrypoints

The `inspect` command supports local FastMCP server files and configuration:

1. **Inferred server instance**: `server.py` - imports the module and looks for a FastMCP server instance named `mcp`, `server`, or `app`. Errors if no such object is found.
2. **Explicit server entrypoint**: `server.py:custom_name` - imports and uses the specified server entrypoint
3. **Factory function**: `server.py:create_server` - calls the specified function (sync or async) to create a server instance
4. **FastMCP configuration**: `fastmcp.json` - inspects servers defined with FastMCP's declarative configuration

<Warning>
  The `inspect` command **only supports local files and fastmcp.json** - no URLs, remote servers, or standard MCP configuration files.
</Warning>

### Examples

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Show text summary (no JSON output)
fastmcp inspect server.py
# Output: 
# Server: MyServer
# Instructions: A helpful MCP server
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# Components:
#   Tools: 5
#   Prompts: 2
#   Resources: 3
#   Templates: 1
#
# Environment:
#   FastMCP: 2.0.0
#   MCP: 1.0.0
#
# Use --format [fastmcp|mcp] for complete JSON output

# Output FastMCP format to stdout
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp

# Specify server entrypoint
fastmcp inspect server.py:my_server

# Output MCP protocol format to stdout
fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp

# Save to file (format required)
fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp -o server-manifest.json

# Save MCP format with custom server object
fastmcp inspect server.py:my_server --format mcp -o mcp-manifest.json

# Error: format required with output file
fastmcp inspect server.py -o output.json
# Error: --format is required when using -o/--output
```

## `fastmcp project prepare`

Create a persistent uv project directory from a fastmcp.json file's environment configuration. This allows you to pre-install all dependencies once and reuse them with the `--project` flag.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp project prepare fastmcp.json --output-dir ./env
```

### Options

| Option           | Flag           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output Directory | `--output-dir` | **Required.** Directory where the persistent uv project will be created |

### Usage Pattern

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Step 1: Prepare the environment (installs dependencies)
fastmcp project prepare fastmcp.json --output-dir ./my-env

# Step 2: Run using the prepared environment (fast, no dependency installation)
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --project ./my-env
```

The prepare command creates a uv project with:

* A `pyproject.toml` containing all dependencies from the fastmcp.json
* A `.venv` with all packages pre-installed
* A `uv.lock` file for reproducible environments

This is useful when you want to separate environment setup from server execution, such as in deployment scenarios where dependencies are installed once and the server is run multiple times.

## `fastmcp version`

Display version information about FastMCP and related components.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp version
```

### Options

| Option            | Flag     | Description                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Copy to Clipboard | `--copy` | Copy version information to clipboard |


# Contrib Modules
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/contrib

Community-contributed modules extending FastMCP

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.2.1" />

FastMCP includes a `contrib` package that holds community-contributed modules. These modules extend FastMCP's functionality but aren't officially maintained by the core team.

Contrib modules provide additional features, integrations, or patterns that complement the core FastMCP library. They offer a way for the community to share useful extensions while keeping the core library focused and maintainable.

The available modules can be viewed in the [contrib directory](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/tree/main/src/fastmcp/contrib).

## Usage

To use a contrib module, import it from the `fastmcp.contrib` package:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.contrib import my_module
```

## Important Considerations

* **Stability**: Modules in `contrib` may have different testing requirements or stability guarantees compared to the core library.
* **Compatibility**: Changes to core FastMCP might break modules in `contrib` without explicit warnings in the main changelog.
* **Dependencies**: Contrib modules may have additional dependencies not required by the core library. These dependencies are typically documented in the module's README or separate requirements files.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the `contrib` package! If you have a module that extends FastMCP in a useful way, consider contributing it:

1. Create a new directory in `src/fastmcp/contrib/` for your module
2. Add proper tests for your module in `tests/contrib/`
3. Include comprehensive documentation in a README.md file, including usage and examples, as well as any additional dependencies or installation instructions
4. Submit a pull request

The ideal contrib module:

* Solves a specific use case or integration need
* Follows FastMCP coding standards
* Includes thorough documentation and examples
* Has comprehensive tests
* Specifies any additional dependencies


# Decorating Methods
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/decorating-methods

Properly use instance methods, class methods, and static methods with FastMCP decorators.

FastMCP's decorator system is designed to work with functions, but you may see unexpected behavior if you try to decorate an instance or class method. This guide explains the correct approach for using methods with all FastMCP decorators (`@tool`, `@resource`, and `@prompt`).

## Why Are Methods Hard?

When you apply a FastMCP decorator like `@tool`, `@resource`, or `@prompt` to a method, the decorator captures the function at decoration time. For instance methods and class methods, this poses a challenge because:

1. For instance methods: The decorator gets the unbound method before any instance exists
2. For class methods: The decorator gets the function before it's bound to the class

This means directly decorating these methods doesn't work as expected. In practice, the LLM would see parameters like `self` or `cls` that it cannot provide values for.

Additionally, **FastMCP decorators return objects (Tool, Resource, or Prompt instances) rather than the original function**. This means that when you decorate a method directly, the method becomes the returned object and is no longer callable by your code:

<Warning>
  **Don't do this!**

  The method will no longer be callable from Python, and the tool won't be callable by LLMs.

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}

  from fastmcp import FastMCP
  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @mcp.tool
      def my_method(self, x: int) -> int:
          return x * 2

  obj = MyClass()
  obj.my_method(5)  # Fails - my_method is a Tool, not a function
  ```
</Warning>

This is another important reason to register methods functionally after defining the class.

## Recommended Patterns

### Instance Methods

<Warning>
  **Don't do this!**

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @mcp.tool  # This won't work correctly
      def add(self, x, y):
          return x + y
  ```
</Warning>

When the decorator is applied this way, it captures the unbound method. When the LLM later tries to use this component, it will see `self` as a required parameter, but it won't know what to provide for it, causing errors or unexpected behavior.

<Check>
  **Do this instead**:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      def add(self, x, y):
          return x + y

  # Create an instance first, then register the bound methods
  obj = MyClass()
  mcp.tool(obj.add)

  # Now you can call it without 'self' showing up as a parameter
  await mcp._mcp_call_tool('add', {'x': 1, 'y': 2})  # Returns 3
  ```
</Check>

This approach works because:

1. You first create an instance of the class (`obj`)
2. When you access the method through the instance (`obj.add`), Python creates a bound method where `self` is already set to that instance
3. When you register this bound method, the system sees a callable that only expects the appropriate parameters, not `self`

### Class Methods

The behavior of decorating class methods depends on the order of decorators:

<Warning>
  **Don't do this** (decorator order matters):

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @classmethod
      @mcp.tool  # This won't work but won't raise an error
      def from_string_v1(cls, s):
          return cls(s)
      
      @mcp.tool
      @classmethod  # This will raise a helpful ValueError
      def from_string_v2(cls, s):
          return cls(s)
  ```
</Warning>

* If `@classmethod` comes first, then `@mcp.tool`: No error is raised, but it won't work correctly
* If `@mcp.tool` comes first, then `@classmethod`: FastMCP will detect this and raise a helpful `ValueError` with guidance

<Check>
  **Do this instead**:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @classmethod
      def from_string(cls, s):
          return cls(s)

  # Register the class method after the class is defined
  mcp.tool(MyClass.from_string)
  ```
</Check>

This works because:

1. The `@classmethod` decorator is applied properly during class definition
2. When you access `MyClass.from_string`, Python provides a special method object that automatically binds the class to the `cls` parameter
3. When registered, only the appropriate parameters are exposed to the LLM, hiding the implementation detail of the `cls` parameter

### Static Methods

Static methods "work" with FastMCP decorators, but this is not recommended because the FastMCP decorator will not return a callable method. Therefore, you should register static methods the same way as other methods.

<Warning>
  **This is not recommended, though it will work.**

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @mcp.tool
      @staticmethod
      def utility(x, y):
          return x + y
  ```
</Warning>

This works because `@staticmethod` converts the method to a regular function, which the FastMCP decorator can then properly process. However, this is not recommended because the FastMCP decorator will not return a callable staticmethod. Therefore, you should register static methods the same way as other methods.

<Check>
  **Prefer this pattern:**

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  class MyClass:
      @staticmethod
      def utility(x, y):
          return x + y

  # This also works
  mcp.tool(MyClass.utility)
  ```
</Check>

## Additional Patterns

### Creating Components at Class Initialization

You can automatically register instance methods when creating an object:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

class ComponentProvider:
    def __init__(self, mcp_instance):
        # Register methods
        mcp_instance.tool(self.tool_method)
        mcp_instance.resource("resource://data")(self.resource_method)
    
    def tool_method(self, x):
        return x * 2
    
    def resource_method(self):
        return "Resource data"

# The methods are automatically registered when creating the instance
provider = ComponentProvider(mcp)
```

This pattern is useful when:

* You want to encapsulate registration logic within the class itself
* You have multiple related components that should be registered together
* You want to ensure that methods are always properly registered when creating an instance

The class automatically registers its methods during initialization, ensuring they're properly bound to the instance before registration.

## Summary

The current behavior of FastMCP decorators with methods is:

* **Static methods**: Can be decorated directly and work perfectly with all FastMCP decorators
* **Class methods**: Cannot be decorated directly and will raise a helpful `ValueError` with guidance
* **Instance methods**: Should be registered after creating an instance using the decorator calls

For class and instance methods, you should register them after creating the instance or class to ensure proper method binding. This ensures that the methods are properly bound before being registered.

Understanding these patterns allows you to effectively organize your components into classes while maintaining proper method binding, giving you the benefits of object-oriented design without sacrificing the simplicity of FastMCP's decorator system.


# Testing your FastMCP Server
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/testing

How to test your FastMCP server.

The best way to ensure a reliable and maintainable FastMCP Server is to test it! The FastMCP Client combined with Pytest provides a simple and powerful way to test your FastMCP servers.

## Prerequisites

Testing FastMCP servers requires `pytest-asyncio` to handle async test functions and fixtures. Install it as a development dependency:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

We recommend configuring pytest to automatically handle async tests by setting the asyncio mode to `auto` in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

This eliminates the need to decorate every async test with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

## Testing with Pytest Fixtures

Using Pytest Fixtures, you can wrap your FastMCP Server in a Client instance that makes interacting with your server fast and easy. This is especially useful when building your own MCP Servers and enables a tight development loop by allowing you to avoid using a separate tool like MCP Inspector during development:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp.client import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import FastMCPTransport

from my_project.main import mcp

@pytest.fixture
async def main_mcp_client():
    async with Client(transport=mcp) as mcp_client:
        yield mcp_client

async def test_list_tools(main_mcp_client: Client[FastMCPTransport]):
    list_tools = await main_mcp_client.list_tools()

    assert len(list_tools) == 5
```

We recommend the [inline-snapshot library](https://github.com/15r10nk/inline-snapshot) for asserting complex data structures coming from your MCP Server. This library allows you to write tests that are easy to read and understand, and are also easy to update when the data structure changes.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from inline_snapshot import snapshot

async def test_list_tools(main_mcp_client: Client[FastMCPTransport]):
    list_tools = await main_mcp_client.list_tools()

    assert list_tools == snapshot()
```

Simply run `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix,create` to fill in the `snapshot()` with actual data.

<Tip>
  For values that change you can leverage the [dirty-equals](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/dirty-equals) library to perform flexible equality assertions on dynamic or non-deterministic values.
</Tip>

Using the pytest `parametrize` decorator, you can easily test your tools with a wide variety of inputs.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from my_project.main import mcp

from fastmcp.client import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import FastMCPTransport
@pytest.fixture
async def main_mcp_client():
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        yield client


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "first_number, second_number, expected",
    [
        (1, 2, 3),
        (2, 3, 5),
        (3, 4, 7),
    ],
)
async def test_add(
    first_number: int,
    second_number: int,
    expected: int,
    main_mcp_client: Client[FastMCPTransport],
):
    result = await main_mcp_client.call_tool(
        name="add", arguments={"x": first_number, "y": second_number}
    )
    assert result.data is not None
    assert isinstance(result.data, int)
    assert result.data == expected
```

<Tip>
  The [FastMCP Repository contains thousands of tests](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/tree/main/tests) for the FastMCP Client and Server. Everything from connecting to remote MCP servers, to testing tools, resources, and prompts is covered, take a look for inspiration!

# Tool Transformation
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/tool-transformation

Create enhanced tool variants with modified schemas, argument mappings, and custom behavior.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

Tool transformation allows you to create new, enhanced tools from existing ones. This powerful feature enables you to adapt tools for different contexts, simplify complex interfaces, or add custom logic without duplicating code.

## Why Transform Tools?

Often, an existing tool is *almost* perfect for your use case, but it might have:

* A confusing description (or no description at all).
* Argument names or descriptions that are not intuitive for an LLM (e.g., `q` instead of `query`).
* Unnecessary parameters that you want to hide from the LLM.
* A need for input validation before the original tool is called.
* A need to modify or format the tool's output.

Instead of rewriting the tool from scratch, you can **transform** it to fit your needs.

## Basic Transformation

The primary way to create a transformed tool is with the `Tool.from_tool()` class method. At its simplest, you can use it to change a tool's top-level metadata like its `name`, `description`, or `tags`.

In the following simple example, we take a generic `search` tool and adjust its name and description to help an LLM client better understand its purpose.

```python {13-21} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool

mcp = FastMCP()

# The original, generic tool
@mcp.tool
def search(query: str, category: str = "all") -> list[dict]:
    """Searches for items in the database."""
    return database.search(query, category)

# Create a more domain-specific version by changing its metadata
product_search_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    search,
    name="find_products",
    description="""
        Search for products in the e-commerce catalog. 
        Use this when customers ask about finding specific items, 
        checking availability, or browsing product categories.
        """,
)

mcp.add_tool(product_search_tool)
```

<Tip>
  When you transform a tool, the original tool remains registered on the server. To avoid confusing an LLM with two similar tools, you can disable the original one:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP
  from fastmcp.tools import Tool

  mcp = FastMCP()

  # The original, generic tool
  @mcp.tool
  def search(query: str, category: str = "all") -> list[dict]:
      ...

  # Create a more domain-specific version
  product_search_tool = Tool.from_tool(search, ...)
  mcp.add_tool(product_search_tool)

  # Disable the original tool
  search.disable()
  ```
</Tip>

Now, clients see a tool named `find_products` with a clear, domain-specific purpose and relevant tags, even though it still uses the original generic `search` function's logic.

### Parameters

The `Tool.from_tool()` class method is the primary way to create a transformed tool. It takes the following parameters:

* `tool`: The tool to transform. This is the only required argument.
* `name`: An optional name for the new tool.
* `description`: An optional description for the new tool.
* `transform_args`: A dictionary of `ArgTransform` objects, one for each argument you want to modify.
* `transform_fn`: An optional function that will be called instead of the parent tool's logic.
* `output_schema`: Control output schema and structured outputs (see [Output Schema Control](#output-schema-control)).
* `tags`: An optional set of tags for the new tool.
* `annotations`: An optional set of `ToolAnnotations` for the new tool.
* `serializer`: An optional function that will be called to serialize the result of the new tool.
* `meta`: Control meta information for the tool. Use `None` to remove meta, any dict to set meta, or leave unset to inherit from parent.

The result is a new `TransformedTool` object that wraps the parent tool and applies the transformations you specify. You can add this tool to your MCP server using its `add_tool()` method.

## Modifying Arguments

To modify a tool's parameters, provide a dictionary of `ArgTransform` objects to the `transform_args` parameter of `Tool.from_tool()`. Each key is the name of the *original* argument you want to modify.

<Tip>
  You only need to provide a `transform_args` entry for arguments you want to modify. All other arguments will be passed through unchanged.
</Tip>

### The ArgTransform Class

To modify an argument, you need to create an `ArgTransform` object. This object has the following parameters:

* `name`: The new name for the argument.
* `description`: The new description for the argument.
* `default`: The new default value for the argument.
* `default_factory`: A function that will be called to generate a default value for the argument. This is useful for arguments that need to be generated for each tool call, such as timestamps or unique IDs.
* `hide`: Whether to hide the argument from the LLM.
* `required`: Whether the argument is required, usually used to make an optional argument be required instead.
* `type`: The new type for the argument.

<Tip>
  Certain combinations of parameters are not allowed. For example, you can only use `default_factory` with `hide=True`, because dynamic defaults cannot be represented in a JSON schema for the client. You can only set required=True for arguments that do not declare a default value.
</Tip>

### Descriptions

By far the most common reason to transform a tool, after its own description, is to improve its argument descriptions. A good description is crucial for helping an LLM understand how to use a parameter correctly. This is especially important when wrapping tools from external APIs, whose argument descriptions may be missing or written for developers, not LLMs.

In this example, we add a helpful description to the `user_id` argument:

```python {16-19} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def find_user(user_id: str):
    """Finds a user by their ID."""
    ...

new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    find_user,
    transform_args={
        "user_id": ArgTransform(
            description=(
                "The unique identifier for the user, "
                "usually in the format 'usr-xxxxxxxx'."
            )
        )
    }
)
```

### Names

At times, you may want to rename an argument to make it more intuitive for an LLM.

For example, in the following example, we take a generic `q` argument and expand it to `search_query`:

```python {15} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def search(q: str):
    """Searches for items in the database."""
    return database.search(q)

new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    search,
    transform_args={
        "q": ArgTransform(name="search_query")
    }
)
```

### Default Values

You can update the default value for any argument using the `default` parameter. Here, we change the default value of the `y` argument to 10:

```python{15}  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return x + y

new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    add,
    transform_args={
        "y": ArgTransform(default=10)
    }
)
```

Default values are especially useful in combination with hidden arguments.

### Hiding Arguments

Sometimes a tool requires arguments that shouldn't be exposed to the LLM, such as API keys, configuration flags, or internal IDs. You can hide these parameters using `hide=True`. Note that you can only hide arguments that have a default value (or for which you provide a new default), because the LLM can't provide a value at call time.

<Tip>
  To pass a constant value to the parent tool, combine `hide=True` with `default=<value>`.
</Tip>

```python {19-20} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str, api_key: str):
    """Sends an email."""
    ...
    
# Create a simplified version that hides the API key
new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    send_email,
    name="send_notification",
    transform_args={
        "api_key": ArgTransform(
            hide=True, 
            default=os.environ.get("EMAIL_API_KEY"),
        )
    }
)
```

The LLM now only sees the `to`, `subject`, and `body` parameters. The `api_key` is supplied automatically from an environment variable.

For values that must be generated for each tool call (like timestamps or unique IDs), use `default_factory`, which is called with no arguments every time the tool is called. For example,

```python {3-4} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
transform_args = {
    'timestamp': ArgTransform(
        hide=True,
        default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(),
    )
}
```

<Warning>
  `default_factory` can only be used with `hide=True`. This is because visible parameters need static defaults that can be represented in a JSON schema for the client.
</Warning>

### Meta Information

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

You can control meta information on transformed tools using the `meta` parameter. Meta information is additional data about the tool that doesn't affect its functionality but can be used by clients for categorization, routing, or other purposes.

```python {15-17} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def analyze_data(data: str) -> dict:
    """Analyzes the provided data."""
    return {"result": f"Analysis of {data}"}

# Add custom meta information
enhanced_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    analyze_data,
    name="enhanced_analyzer",
    meta={
        "category": "analytics",
        "priority": "high",
        "requires_auth": True
    }
)

mcp.add_tool(enhanced_tool)
```

You can also remove meta information entirely:

```python {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Remove meta information from parent tool
simplified_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    analyze_data,
    name="simple_analyzer", 
    meta=None  # Removes any meta information
)
```

If you don't specify the `meta` parameter, the transformed tool inherits the parent tool's meta information.

### Required Values

In rare cases where you want to make an optional argument required, you can set `required=True`. This has no effect if the argument was already required.

```python {3} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
transform_args = {
    'user_id': ArgTransform(
        required=True,
    )
}
```

## Modifying Tool Behavior

<Warning>
  With great power comes great responsibility. Modifying tool behavior is a very advanced feature.
</Warning>

In addition to changing a tool's schema, advanced users can also modify its behavior. This is useful for adding validation logic, or for post-processing the tool's output.

The `from_tool()` method takes a `transform_fn` parameter, which is an async function that replaces the parent tool's logic and gives you complete control over the tool's execution.

### The Transform Function

The `transform_fn` is an async function that **completely replaces** the parent tool's logic.

Critically, the transform function's arguments are used to determine the new tool's final schema. Any arguments that are not already present in the parent tool schema OR the `transform_args` will be added to the new tool's schema. Note that when `transform_args` and your function have the same argument name, the `transform_args` metadata will take precedence, if provided.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def my_custom_logic(user_input: str, max_length: int = 100) -> str:
    # Your custom logic here - this completely replaces the parent tool
    return f"Custom result for: {user_input[:max_length]}"

Tool.from_tool(transform_fn=my_custom_logic)
```

<Tip>
  The name / docstring of the `transform_fn` are ignored. Only its arguments are used to determine the final schema.
</Tip>

### Calling the Parent Tool

Most of the time, you don't want to completely replace the parent tool's behavior. Instead, you want to add validation, modify inputs, or post-process outputs while still leveraging the parent tool's core functionality. For this, FastMCP provides the special `forward()` and `forward_raw()` functions.

Both `forward()` and `forward_raw()` are async functions that let you call the parent tool from within your `transform_fn`:

* **`forward()`** (recommended): Automatically handles argument mapping based on your `ArgTransform` configurations. Call it with the transformed argument names.
* **`forward_raw()`**: Bypasses all transformation and calls the parent tool directly with its original argument names. This is rarely needed unless you're doing complex argument manipulation, perhaps without `arg_transforms`.

The most common transformation pattern is to validate (potentially renamed) arguments before calling the parent tool. Here's an example that validates that `x` and `y` are positive before calling the parent tool:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using forward()">
    In the simplest case, your parent tool and your transform function have the same arguments. You can call `forward()` with the same argument names as the parent tool:

    ```python {15} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.tools import Tool
    from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import forward

    mcp = FastMCP()

    @mcp.tool
    def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        """Adds two numbers."""
        return x + y

    async def ensure_positive(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        if x <= 0 or y <= 0:
            raise ValueError("x and y must be positive")
        return await forward(x=x, y=y)

    new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
        add,
        transform_fn=ensure_positive,
    )

    mcp.add_tool(new_tool)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using forward() with renamed args">
    When your transformed tool has different argument names than the parent tool, you can call `forward()` with the renamed arguments and it will automatically map the arguments to the parent tool's arguments:

    ```python {15, 20-23} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.tools import Tool
    from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import forward

    mcp = FastMCP()

    @mcp.tool
    def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        """Adds two numbers."""
        return x + y

    async def ensure_positive(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:
            raise ValueError("a and b must be positive")
        return await forward(a=a, b=b)

    new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
        add,
        transform_fn=ensure_positive,
        transform_args={
            "x": ArgTransform(name="a"),
            "y": ArgTransform(name="b"),
        }
    )

    mcp.add_tool(new_tool)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using forward_raw()">
    Finally, you can use `forward_raw()` to bypass all argument mapping and call the parent tool directly with its original argument names.

    ```python {15, 20-23} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.tools import Tool
    from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import forward

    mcp = FastMCP()

    @mcp.tool
    def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
        """Adds two numbers."""
        return x + y

    async def ensure_positive(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        if a <= 0 or b <= 0:
            raise ValueError("a and b must be positive")
        return await forward_raw(x=a, y=b)

    new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
        add,
        transform_fn=ensure_positive,
        transform_args={
            "x": ArgTransform(name="a"),
            "y": ArgTransform(name="b"),
        }
    )

    mcp.add_tool(new_tool)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Passing Arguments with \*\*kwargs

If your `transform_fn` includes `**kwargs` in its signature, it will receive **all arguments from the parent tool after `ArgTransform` configurations have been applied**. This is powerful for creating flexible validation functions that don't require you to add every argument to the function signature.

In the following example, we wrap a parent tool that accepts two arguments `x` and `y`. These are renamed to `a` and `b` in the transformed tool, and the transform only validates `a`, passing the other argument through as `**kwargs`.

```python {12, 15} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import forward, ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return x + y

async def ensure_a_positive(a: int, **kwargs) -> int:
    if a <= 0:
        raise ValueError("a must be positive")
    return await forward(a=a, **kwargs)

new_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    add,
    transform_fn=ensure_a_positive,
    transform_args={
        "x": ArgTransform(name="a"),
        "y": ArgTransform(name="b"),
    }
)

mcp.add_tool(new_tool)
```

<Tip>
  In the above example, `**kwargs` receives the renamed argument `b`, not the original argument `y`. It is therefore recommended to use with `forward()`, not `forward_raw()`.
</Tip>

## Modifying MCP Tools with MCPConfig

When running MCP Servers under FastMCP with `MCPConfig`, you can also apply a subset of tool transformations
directly in the MCPConfig json file.

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http",
            "tools": {
                "weather_get_forecast": {
                    "name": "miami_weather",
                    "description": "Get the weather for Miami",
                    "meta": {
                        "category": "weather",
                        "location": "miami"
                    },
                    "arguments": {
                        "city": {
                            "name": "city",
                            "default": "Miami",
                            "hide": True,
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `tools` section is a dictionary of tool names to tool configurations. Each tool configuration is a
dictionary of tool properties.

See the [MCPConfigTransport](/clients/transports#tool-transformation-with-fastmcp-and-mcpconfig) documentation for more details.

## Output Schema Control

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

Transformed tools inherit output schemas from their parent by default, but you can control this behavior:

**Inherit from Parent (Default)**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Tool.from_tool(parent_tool, name="renamed_tool")
```

The transformed tool automatically uses the parent tool's output schema and structured output behavior.

**Custom Output Schema**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Tool.from_tool(parent_tool, output_schema={
    "type": "object", 
    "properties": {"status": {"type": "string"}}
})
```

Provide your own schema that differs from the parent. The tool must return data matching this schema.

**Remove Output Schema**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
Tool.from_tool(parent_tool, output_schema=None)
```

Removes the output schema declaration. Automatic structured content still works for object-like returns (dict, dataclass, Pydantic models) but primitive types won't be structured.

**Full Control with Transform Functions**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def custom_output(**kwargs) -> ToolResult:
    result = await forward(**kwargs)
    return ToolResult(content=[...], structured_content={...})

Tool.from_tool(parent_tool, transform_fn=custom_output)
```

Use a transform function returning `ToolResult` for complete control over both content blocks and structured outputs.

## Common Patterns

Tool transformation is a flexible feature that supports many powerful patterns. Here are a few common use cases to give you ideas.

### Exposing Client Methods as Tools

A powerful use case for tool transformation is exposing methods from existing Python clients (GitHub clients, API clients, database clients, etc.) directly as MCP tools. This pattern eliminates boilerplate wrapper functions and treats tools as annotations around client methods.

**Without Tool Transformation**, you typically create wrapper functions that duplicate annotations:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def get_repository(
    owner: Annotated[str, "The owner of the repository."],
    repo: Annotated[str, "The name of the repository."],
) -> Repository:
    """Get basic information about a GitHub repository."""
    return await github_client.get_repository(owner=owner, repo=repo)
```

**With Tool Transformation**, you can wrap the client method directly:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP("GitHub Tools")

# Wrap a client method directly as a tool
get_repo_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    tool=Tool.from_function(fn=github_client.get_repository),
    description="Get basic information about a GitHub repository.",
    transform_args={
        "owner": ArgTransform(description="The owner of the repository."),
        "repo": ArgTransform(description="The name of the repository."),
    }
)

mcp.add_tool(get_repo_tool)
```

This pattern keeps the implementation in your client and treats the tool as an annotation layer, avoiding duplicate code.

#### Hiding Client-Specific Arguments

Client methods often have internal parameters (debug flags, auth tokens, rate limit settings) that shouldn't be exposed to LLMs. Use `hide=True` with a default value to handle these automatically:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
get_issues_tool = Tool.from_tool(
    tool=Tool.from_function(fn=github_client.get_issues),
    description="Get issues from a GitHub repository.",
    transform_args={
        "owner": ArgTransform(description="The owner of the repository."),
        "repo": ArgTransform(description="The name of the repository."),
        "limit": ArgTransform(description="Maximum number of issues to return."),
        # Hide internal parameters
        "include_debug_info": ArgTransform(hide=True, default=False),
        "error_on_not_found": ArgTransform(hide=True, default=True),
    }
)

mcp.add_tool(get_issues_tool)
```

The LLM only sees `owner`, `repo`, and `limit`. Internal parameters are supplied automatically.

#### Reusable Argument Patterns

When wrapping multiple client methods, you can define reusable argument transformations. This scales well for larger tool sets and keeps annotations consistent:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.tools import Tool
from fastmcp.tools.tool_transform import ArgTransform

mcp = FastMCP("GitHub Tools")

# Define reusable argument patterns
OWNER_ARG = ArgTransform(description="The repository owner.")
REPO_ARG = ArgTransform(description="The repository name.")
LIMIT_ARG = ArgTransform(description="Maximum number of items to return.")
HIDE_ERROR = ArgTransform(hide=True, default=True)

def create_github_tools(client):
    """Create tools from GitHub client methods with shared argument patterns."""

    owner_repo_args = {
        "owner": OWNER_ARG,
        "repo": REPO_ARG,
    }

    error_args = {
        "error_on_not_found": HIDE_ERROR,
    }

    return [
        Tool.from_tool(
            tool=Tool.from_function(fn=client.get_repository),
            description="Get basic information about a GitHub repository.",
            transform_args={**owner_repo_args, **error_args}
        ),
        Tool.from_tool(
            tool=Tool.from_function(fn=client.get_issue),
            description="Get a specific issue from a repository.",
            transform_args={
                **owner_repo_args,
                "issue_number": ArgTransform(description="The issue number."),
                "limit_comments": LIMIT_ARG,
                **error_args,
            }
        ),
        Tool.from_tool(
            tool=Tool.from_function(fn=client.get_pull_request),
            description="Get a specific pull request from a repository.",
            transform_args={
                **owner_repo_args,
                "pull_request_number": ArgTransform(description="The PR number."),
                "limit_comments": LIMIT_ARG,
                **error_args,
            }
        ),
    ]

# Add all tools to the server
for tool in create_github_tools(github_client):
    mcp.add_tool(tool)
```

This pattern provides several benefits:

* **No duplicate implementation**: Logic stays in the client
* **Consistent annotations**: Reusable argument patterns ensure consistency
* **Easy maintenance**: Update the client, not wrapper functions
* **Scalable**: Easily add new tools by wrapping additional client methods

### Adapting Remote or Generated Tools

This is one of the most common reasons to use tool transformation. Tools from remote MCP servers (via a [proxy](/servers/proxy)) or generated from an [OpenAPI spec](/integrations/openapi) are often too generic for direct use by an LLM. You can use transformation to create a simpler, more intuitive version for your specific needs.

### Chaining Transformations

You can chain transformations by using an already transformed tool as the parent for a new transformation. This lets you build up complex behaviors in layers, for example, first renaming arguments, and then adding validation logic to the renamed tool.

### Context-Aware Tool Factories

You can write functions that act as "factories," generating specialized versions of a tool for different contexts. For example, you could create a `get_my_data` tool that is specific to the currently logged-in user by hiding the `user_id` parameter and providing it automatically.

## Functions

### `with_argv` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L67" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
with_argv(args: list[str] | None)
```

Temporarily replace sys.argv if args provided.

This context manager is used at the CLI boundary to inject
server arguments when needed, without mutating sys.argv deep
in the source loading logic.

Args are provided without the script name, so we preserve sys.argv\[0]
and replace the rest.

### `version` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L90" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
version()
```

Display version information and platform details.

### `dev` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L128" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
dev(server_spec: str | None = None) -> None
```

Run an MCP server with the MCP Inspector for development.

**Args:**

* `server_spec`: Python file to run, optionally with :object suffix, or None to auto-detect fastmcp.json

### `run` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L306" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
run(server_spec: str | None = None, *server_args: str) -> None
```

Run an MCP server or connect to a remote one.

The server can be specified in several ways:

1. Module approach: "server.py" - runs the module directly, looking for an object named 'mcp', 'server', or 'app'
2. Import approach: "server.py:app" - imports and runs the specified server object
3. URL approach: "[http://server-url](http://server-url)" - connects to a remote server and creates a proxy
4. MCPConfig file: "mcp.json" - runs as a proxy server for the MCP Servers in the MCPConfig file
5. FastMCP config: "fastmcp.json" - runs server using FastMCP configuration
6. No argument: looks for fastmcp.json in current directory

Server arguments can be passed after -- :
fastmcp run server.py -- --config config.json --debug

**Args:**

* `server_spec`: Python file, object specification (file:obj), config file, URL, or None to auto-detect

### `inspect` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L540" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
inspect(server_spec: str | None = None) -> None
```

Inspect an MCP server and display information or generate a JSON report.

This command analyzes an MCP server. Without flags, it displays a text summary.
Use --format to output complete JSON data.

**Examples:**

# Show text summary

fastmcp inspect server.py

# Output FastMCP format JSON to stdout

fastmcp inspect server.py --format fastmcp

# Save MCP protocol format to file (format required with -o)

fastmcp inspect server.py --format mcp -o manifest.json

# Inspect from fastmcp.json configuration

fastmcp inspect fastmcp.json
fastmcp inspect  # auto-detect fastmcp.json

**Args:**

* `server_spec`: Python file to inspect, optionally with :object suffix, or fastmcp.json

### `prepare` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/cli/cli.py#L785" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
prepare(config_path: Annotated[str | None, cyclopts.Parameter(help='Path to fastmcp.json configuration file')] = None, output_dir: Annotated[str | None, cyclopts.Parameter(help='Directory to create the persistent environment in')] = None, skip_source: Annotated[bool, cyclopts.Parameter(help='Skip source preparation (e.g., git clone)')] = False) -> None
```

Prepare a FastMCP project by creating a persistent uv environment.

This command creates a persistent uv project with all dependencies installed:

* Creates a pyproject.toml with dependencies from the config
* Installs all Python packages into a .venv
* Prepares the source (git clone, download, etc.) unless --skip-source

After running this command, you can use:
fastmcp run \<config> --project \<output-dir>

This is useful for:

* CI/CD pipelines with separate build and run stages
* Docker images where you prepare during build
* Production deployments where you want fast startup times

Holds all session-related state for a Client instance.

This allows clean separation of configuration (which is copied) from
session state (which should be fresh for each new client instance).

### `Client` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/client.py#L107" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

MCP client that delegates connection management to a Transport instance.

The Client class is responsible for MCP protocol logic, while the Transport
handles connection establishment and management. Client provides methods for
working with resources, prompts, tools and other MCP capabilities.

This client supports reentrant context managers (multiple concurrent
`async with client:` blocks) using reference counting and background session
management. This allows efficient session reuse in any scenario with
nested or concurrent client usage.

MCP SDK 1.10 introduced automatic list\_tools() calls during call\_tool()
execution. This created a race condition where events could be reset while
other tasks were waiting on them, causing deadlocks. The issue was exposed
in proxy scenarios but affects any reentrant usage.

The solution uses reference counting to track active context managers,
a background task to manage the session lifecycle, events to coordinate
between tasks, and ensures all session state changes happen within a lock.
Events are only created when needed, never reset outside locks.

This design prevents race conditions where tasks wait on events that get
replaced by other tasks, ensuring reliable coordination in concurrent scenarios.

**Args:**

* `transport`:
  Connection source specification, which can be:

  * ClientTransport: Direct transport instance
  * FastMCP: In-process FastMCP server
  * AnyUrl or str: URL to connect to
  * Path: File path for local socket
  * MCPConfig: MCP server configuration
  * dict: Transport configuration
* `roots`: Optional RootsList or RootsHandler for filesystem access
* `sampling_handler`: Optional handler for sampling requests
* `log_handler`: Optional handler for log messages
* `message_handler`: Optional handler for protocol messages
* `progress_handler`: Optional handler for progress notifications
* `timeout`: Optional timeout for requests (seconds or timedelta)
* `init_timeout`: Optional timeout for initial connection (seconds or timedelta).
  Set to 0 to disable. If None, uses the value in the FastMCP global settings.

**Examples:**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Connect to FastMCP server
client = Client("http://localhost:8080")

async with client:
    # List available resources

manager unless `auto_initialize=False` was set during client construction.
Manual calls to this method are only needed when auto-initialization is disabled.

**Args:**

* `timeout`: Optional timeout for the initialization request (seconds or timedelta).
  If None, uses the client's init\_timeout setting.

# transports

## Functions

### `infer_transport` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/transports.py#L1026" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
infer_transport(transport: ClientTransport | FastMCP | FastMCP1Server | AnyUrl | Path | MCPConfig | dict[str, Any] | str) -> ClientTransport
```

Infer the appropriate transport type from the given transport argument.

This function attempts to infer the correct transport type from the provided
argument, handling various input types and converting them to the appropriate
ClientTransport subclass.

The function supports these input types:

* ClientTransport: Used directly without modification
* FastMCP or FastMCP1Server: Creates an in-memory FastMCPTransport
* Path or str (file path): Creates PythonStdioTransport (.py) or NodeStdioTransport (.js)
* AnyUrl or str (URL): Creates StreamableHttpTransport (default) or SSETransport (for /sse endpoints)
* MCPConfig or dict: Creates MCPConfigTransport, potentially connecting to multiple servers

For HTTP URLs, they are assumed to be Streamable HTTP URLs unless they end in `/sse`.

For MCPConfig with multiple servers, a composite client is created where each server
is mounted with its name as prefix. This allows accessing tools and resources from multiple
servers through a single unified client interface, using naming patterns like
`servername_toolname` for tools and `protocol://servername/path` for resources.
If the MCPConfig contains only one server, a direct connection is established without prefixing.

**Examples:**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Connect to a local Python script
transport = infer_transport("my_script.py")

# Connect to a remote server via HTTP
transport = infer_transport("http://example.com/mcp")

# Connect to multiple servers using MCPConfig
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {"url": "http://weather.example.com/mcp"},
        "calendar": {"url": "http://calendar.example.com/mcp"}
    }
}
transport = infer_transport(config)
```

Abstract base class for different MCP client transport mechanisms.

A Transport is responsible for establishing and managing connections
to an MCP server, and providing a ClientSession within an async context.

**Methods:**

#### `connect_session` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/transports.py#L86" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
connect_session(self, **session_kwargs: Unpack[SessionKwargs]) -> AsyncIterator[ClientSession]
```

Establishes a connection and yields an active ClientSession.

The ClientSession is *not* expected to be initialized in this context manager.

The session is guaranteed to be valid only within the scope of the
async context manager. Connection setup and teardown are handled
within this context.

**Args:**

In-memory transport for FastMCP servers.

This transport connects directly to a FastMCP server instance in the same
Python process. It works with both FastMCP 2.x servers and FastMCP 1.0
servers from the low-level MCP SDK. This is particularly useful for unit
tests or scenarios where client and server run in the same runtime.

**Methods:**

#### `connect_session` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/transports.py#L842" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Transport for connecting to one or more MCP servers defined in an MCPConfig.

This transport provides a unified interface to multiple MCP servers defined in an MCPConfig
object or dictionary matching the MCPConfig schema. It supports two key scenarios:

1. If the MCPConfig contains exactly one server, it creates a direct transport to that server.
2. If the MCPConfig contains multiple servers, it creates a composite client by mounting
   all servers on a single FastMCP instance, with each server's name, by default, used as its mounting prefix.

In the multi-server case, tools are accessible with the prefix pattern `{server_name}_{tool_name}`
and resources with the pattern `protocol://{server_name}/path/to/resource`.

This is particularly useful for creating clients that need to interact with multiple specialized
MCP servers through a single interface, simplifying client code.

**Examples:**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.utilities.mcp_config import MCPConfig

# Create a config with multiple servers
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        },
        "calendar": {
            "url": "https://calendar-api.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        }
    }
}

# Create a client with the config
client = Client(config)

async with client:
    # Access tools with prefixes
    weather = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "London"})
    events = await client.call_tool("calendar_list_events", {"date": "2023-06-01"})

    # Access resources with prefixed URIs
    icons = await client.read_resource("weather://weather/icons/sunny")
```

# `fastmcp.mcp_config`

Canonical MCP Configuration Format.

This module defines the standard configuration format for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
It provides a client-agnostic, extensible format that can be used across all MCP implementations.

The configuration format supports both stdio and remote (HTTP/SSE) transports, with comprehensive
field definitions for server metadata, authentication, and execution parameters.

Example configuration:

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "my-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@my/mcp-server"],
            "env": {"API_KEY": "secret"},
            "timeout": 30000,
            "description": "My MCP server"
        }
    }
}
```

A resource that defers data loading by wrapping a function.

The function is only called when the resource is read, allowing for lazy loading
of potentially expensive data. This is particularly useful when listing resources,
as the function won't be called until the resource is actually accessed.

The function can return:

* str for text content (default)
* bytes for binary content
* other types will be converted to JSON

**Methods:**

#### `from_function` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/resources/resource.py#L174" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

#### `get_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/auth.py#L78" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
get_routes(self, mcp_path: str | None = None) -> list[Route]
```

Get all routes for this authentication provider.

This includes both well-known discovery routes and operational routes.
Each provider is responsible for creating whatever routes it needs:

* TokenVerifier: typically no routes (default implementation)
* RemoteAuthProvider: protected resource metadata routes
* OAuthProvider: full OAuth authorization server routes
* Custom providers: whatever routes they need

**Args:**

* `mcp_path`: The path where the MCP endpoint is mounted (e.g., "/mcp")
  This is used to advertise the resource URL in metadata, but the
  provider does not create the actual MCP endpoint route.

**Returns:**

* List of all routes for this provider (excluding the MCP endpoint itself)

#### `get_well_known_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/auth.py#L101" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

# oauth_proxy
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-auth-oauth_proxy



# `fastmcp.server.auth.oauth_proxy`

OAuth Proxy Provider for FastMCP.

This provider acts as a transparent proxy to an upstream OAuth Authorization Server,
handling Dynamic Client Registration locally while forwarding all other OAuth flows.
This enables authentication with upstream providers that don't support DCR or have
restricted client registration policies.

Key features:

* Proxies authorization and token endpoints to upstream server
* Implements local Dynamic Client Registration with fixed upstream credentials
* Validates tokens using upstream JWKS
* Maintains minimal local state for bookkeeping
* Enhanced logging with request correlation

This implementation is based on the OAuth 2.1 specification and is designed for
production use with enterprise identity providers.

the corresponding upstream token when tools need to access upstream APIs.

### `ProxyDCRClient` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L181" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Client for DCR proxy with configurable redirect URI validation.

This special client class is critical for the OAuth proxy to work correctly
with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). Here's why it exists:

## Problem:

When MCP clients use OAuth, they dynamically register with random localhost
ports (e.g., [http://localhost:55454/callback](http://localhost:55454/callback)). The OAuth proxy needs to:

1. Accept these dynamic redirect URIs from clients based on configured patterns
2. Use its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream provider (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Forward the authorization code back to the client's dynamic URI

## Solution:

This class validates redirect URIs against configurable patterns,
while the proxy internally uses its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream
provider. This allows the flow to work even when clients reconnect with
different ports or when tokens are cached.

Without proper validation, clients could get "Redirect URI not registered" errors
when trying to authenticate with cached tokens, or security vulnerabilities could
arise from accepting arbitrary redirect URIs.

**Methods:**

#### `validate_redirect_uri` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L210" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
validate_redirect_uri(self, redirect_uri: AnyUrl | None) -> AnyUrl
```

Validate redirect URI against allowed patterns.

Since we're acting as a proxy and clients register dynamically,
we validate their redirect URIs against configurable patterns.
This is essential for cached token scenarios where the client may
reconnect with a different port.

### `TokenHandler` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L383" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

TokenHandler that returns OAuth 2.1 compliant error responses.

The MCP SDK always returns HTTP 400 for all client authentication issues.
However, OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3 and the MCP specification require that
invalid or expired tokens MUST receive a HTTP 401 response.

This handler extends the base MCP SDK TokenHandler to transform client
authentication failures into OAuth 2.1 compliant responses:

* Changes 'unauthorized\_client' to 'invalid\_client' error code
* Returns HTTP 401 status code instead of 400 for client auth failures

Per OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3: "The authorization server MAY return an HTTP 401
(Unauthorized) status code to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes
are supported."

Per MCP spec: "Invalid or expired tokens MUST receive a HTTP 401 response."

**Methods:**

#### `response` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L402" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
response(self, obj: TokenSuccessResponse | TokenErrorResponse)
```

Override response method to provide OAuth 2.1 compliant error handling.

### `OAuthProxy` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L432" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

OAuth provider that presents a DCR-compliant interface while proxying to non-DCR IDPs.

## Purpose

MCP clients expect OAuth providers to support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR),
where clients can register themselves dynamically and receive unique credentials.
Most enterprise IDPs (Google, GitHub, Azure AD, etc.) don't support DCR and require
pre-registered OAuth applications with fixed credentials.

This proxy bridges that gap by:

* Presenting a full DCR-compliant OAuth interface to MCP clients
* Translating DCR registration requests to use pre-configured upstream credentials
* Proxying all OAuth flows to the upstream IDP with appropriate translations
* Managing the state and security requirements of both protocols

## Architecture Overview

The proxy maintains a single OAuth app registration with the upstream provider
while allowing unlimited MCP clients to register and authenticate dynamically.
It implements the complete OAuth 2.1 + DCR specification for clients while
translating to whatever OAuth variant the upstream provider requires.

## Key Translation Challenges Solved

1. Dynamic Client Registration:
   * MCP clients expect to register dynamically and get unique credentials
   * Upstream IDPs require pre-registered apps with fixed credentials
   * Solution: Accept DCR requests, return shared upstream credentials

2. Dynamic Redirect URIs:
   * MCP clients use random localhost ports that change between sessions
   * Upstream IDPs require fixed, pre-registered redirect URIs
   * Solution: Use proxy's fixed callback URL with upstream, forward to client's dynamic URI

3. Authorization Code Mapping:
   * Upstream returns codes for the proxy's redirect URI
   * Clients expect codes for their own redirect URIs
   * Solution: Exchange upstream code server-side, issue new code to client

4. State Parameter Collision:
   * Both client and proxy need to maintain state through the flow
   * Only one state parameter available in OAuth
   * Solution: Use transaction ID as state with upstream, preserve client's state

5. Token Management:
   * Clients may expect different token formats/claims than upstream provides
   * Need to track tokens for revocation and refresh
   * Solution: Store token relationships, forward upstream tokens transparently

## OAuth Flow Implementation

1. Client Registration (DCR):
   * Accept any client registration request
   * Store ProxyDCRClient that accepts dynamic redirect URIs

2. Authorization:
   * Store transaction mapping client details to proxy flow
   * Redirect to upstream with proxy's fixed redirect URI
   * Use transaction ID as state parameter with upstream

3. Upstream Callback:
   * Exchange upstream authorization code for tokens (server-side)
   * Generate new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
   * Redirect to client's original dynamic redirect URI

4. Token Exchange:
   * Validate client's code and PKCE verifier
   * Return previously obtained upstream tokens
   * Clean up one-time use authorization code

5. Token Refresh:
   * Forward refresh requests to upstream using authlib
   * Handle token rotation if upstream issues new refresh token
   * Update local token mappings

## State Management

The proxy maintains minimal but crucial state:

* \_oauth\_transactions: Active authorization flows with client context
* \_client\_codes: Authorization codes with PKCE challenges and upstream tokens
* \_access\_tokens, \_refresh\_tokens: Token storage for revocation
* Token relationship mappings for cleanup and rotation

## Security Considerations

* PKCE enforced end-to-end (client to proxy, proxy to upstream)
* Authorization codes are single-use with short expiry
* Transaction IDs are cryptographically random
* All state is cleaned up after use to prevent replay
* Token validation delegates to upstream provider

## Provider Compatibility

Works with any OAuth 2.0 provider that supports:

* Authorization code flow
* Fixed redirect URI (configured in provider's app settings)
* Standard token endpoint

Handles provider-specific requirements:

* Google: Ensures minimum scope requirements
* GitHub: Compatible with OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps
* Azure AD: Handles tenant-specific endpoints
* Generic: Works with any spec-compliant provider

When a client registers, we create a ProxyDCRClient that is more
forgiving about validating redirect URIs, since the DCR client's
redirect URI will likely be localhost or unknown to the proxied IDP. The
proxied IDP only knows about this server's fixed redirect URI.

#### `authorize` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L876" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
authorize(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, params: AuthorizationParams) -> str
```

Start OAuth transaction and route through consent interstitial.

Flow:

1. Store transaction with client details and PKCE (if forwarding)
2. Return local /consent URL; browser visits consent first
3. Consent handler redirects to upstream IdP if approved/already approved

If consent is disabled (require\_authorization\_consent=False), skip the consent screen
and redirect directly to the upstream IdP.

#### `load_authorization_code` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L951" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
load_authorization_code(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, authorization_code: str) -> AuthorizationCode | None
```

Load authorization code for validation.

Look up our client code and return authorization code object
with PKCE challenge for validation.

#### `exchange_authorization_code` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L994" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
exchange_authorization_code(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, authorization_code: AuthorizationCode) -> OAuthToken
```

Exchange authorization code for FastMCP-issued tokens.

Implements the token factory pattern:

1. Retrieves upstream tokens from stored authorization code
2. Extracts user identity from upstream token
3. Encrypts and stores upstream tokens
4. Issues FastMCP-signed JWT tokens
5. Returns FastMCP tokens (NOT upstream tokens)

PKCE validation is handled by the MCP framework before this method is called.

#### `load_refresh_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L1159" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
load_refresh_token(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, refresh_token: str) -> RefreshToken | None
```

Load refresh token from local storage.

#### `exchange_refresh_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L1167" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
exchange_refresh_token(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, refresh_token: RefreshToken, scopes: list[str]) -> OAuthToken
```

Exchange FastMCP refresh token for new FastMCP access token.

Implements two-tier refresh:

1. Verify FastMCP refresh token
2. Look up upstream token via JTI mapping
3. Refresh upstream token with upstream provider
4. Update stored upstream token
5. Issue new FastMCP access token
6. Keep same FastMCP refresh token (unless upstream rotates)

#### `load_access_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L1368" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
load_access_token(self, token: str) -> AccessToken | None
```

Validate FastMCP JWT by swapping for upstream token.

This implements the token swap pattern:

1. Verify FastMCP JWT signature (proves it's our token)
2. Look up upstream token via JTI mapping
3. Decrypt upstream token
4. Validate upstream token with provider (GitHub API, JWT validation, etc.)
5. Return upstream validation result

The FastMCP JWT is a reference token - all authorization data comes
from validating the upstream token via the TokenVerifier.

#### `revoke_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L1424" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
revoke_token(self, token: AccessToken | RefreshToken) -> None
```

Revoke token locally and with upstream server if supported.

Removes tokens from local storage and attempts to revoke them with
the upstream server if a revocation endpoint is configured.

#### `get_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L1468" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
get_routes(self, mcp_path: str | None = None) -> list[Route]
```

Get OAuth routes with custom handlers for better error UX.

This method creates standard OAuth routes and replaces:

* /authorize endpoint: Enhanced error responses for unregistered clients
* /token endpoint: OAuth 2.1 compliant error codes

**Args:**

* `mcp_path`: The path where the MCP endpoint is mounted (e.g., "/mcp")
  This is used to advertise the resource URL in metadata.

Microsoft accounts depending on the tenant configuration.

Scope Handling:

* required\_scopes: Provide unprefixed scope names (e.g., \["read", "write"])
  → Automatically prefixed with identifier\_uri during initialization
  → Validated on all tokens and advertised to MCP clients
* additional\_authorize\_scopes: Provide full format (e.g., \["User.Read"])
  → NOT prefixed, NOT validated, NOT advertised to clients
  → Used to request Microsoft Graph or other upstream API permissions

Features:

* OAuth proxy to Azure/Microsoft identity platform
* JWT validation using tenant issuer and JWKS
* Supports tenant configurations: specific tenant ID, "organizations", or "consumers"
* Custom API scopes and Microsoft Graph scopes in a single provider

Setup:

1. Create an App registration in Azure Portal
2. Configure Web platform redirect URI: [http://localhost:8000/auth/callback](http://localhost:8000/auth/callback) (or your custom path)
3. Add an Application ID URI under "Expose an API" (defaults to api://{client_id})
4. Add custom scopes (e.g., "read", "write") under "Expose an API"
5. Set access token version to 2 in the App manifest: "requestedAccessTokenVersion": 2
6. Create a client secret
7. Get Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and client secret

# `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.introspection`

OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662) provider for FastMCP.

This module provides token verification for opaque tokens using the OAuth 2.0
Token Introspection protocol defined in RFC 7662. It allows FastMCP servers to
validate tokens issued by authorization servers that don't use JWT format.

Example:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.introspection import IntrospectionTokenVerifier

# Verify opaque tokens via RFC 7662 introspection
verifier = IntrospectionTokenVerifier(
    introspection_url="https://auth.example.com/oauth/introspect",
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    required_scopes=["read", "write"]
)

mcp = FastMCP("My Protected Server", auth=verifier)
```

### `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/providers/introspection.py#L65" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection verifier (RFC 7662).

This verifier validates opaque tokens by calling an OAuth 2.0 token introspection
endpoint. Unlike JWT verification which is stateless, token introspection requires
a network call to the authorization server for each token validation.

The verifier authenticates to the introspection endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth
with the provided client\_id and client\_secret, as specified in RFC 7662.

Use this when:

* Your authorization server issues opaque (non-JWT) tokens
* You need to validate tokens from Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, or other OAuth servers
* Your tokens require real-time revocation checking
* Your authorization server supports RFC 7662 introspection

**Methods:**

#### `verify_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/providers/introspection.py#L184" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
verify_token(self, token: str) -> AccessToken | None
```

Verify a bearer token using OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662).

This method makes a POST request to the introspection endpoint with the token,
authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth with the client credentials.

**Args:**

* `token`: The opaque token string to validate

**Returns:**

* AccessToken object if valid and active, None if invalid, inactive, or expired

JWT token verifier supporting both asymmetric (RSA/ECDSA) and symmetric (HMAC) algorithms.

This verifier validates JWT tokens using various signing algorithms:

* **Asymmetric algorithms** (RS256/384/512, ES256/384/512, PS256/384/512):
  Uses public/private key pairs. Ideal for external clients and services where
  only the authorization server has the private key.
* **Symmetric algorithms** (HS256/384/512): Uses a shared secret for both
  signing and verification. Perfect for internal microservices and trusted
  environments where the secret can be securely shared.

Use this when:

* You have JWT tokens issued by an external service (asymmetric)
* You need JWKS support for automatic key rotation (asymmetric)
* You have internal microservices sharing a secret key (symmetric)
* Your tokens contain standard OAuth scopes and claims

**Methods:**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
load_access_token(self, token: str) -> AccessToken | None
```

Validate a JWT bearer token and return an AccessToken when the token is valid.

**Args:**

* `token`: The JWT bearer token string to validate.

**Returns:**

* AccessToken | None: An AccessToken populated from token claims if the token is valid; `None` if the token is expired, has an invalid signature or format, fails issuer/audience/scope validation, or any other validation error occurs.

#### `verify_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/providers/jwt.py#L485" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Simple static token verifier for testing and development.

This verifier validates tokens against a predefined dictionary of valid token
strings and their associated claims. When a token string matches a key in the
dictionary, the verifier returns the corresponding claims as if the token was
validated by a real authorization server.

Use this when:

* You're developing or testing locally without a real OAuth server
* You need predictable tokens for automated testing
* You want to simulate different users/scopes without complex setup
* You're prototyping and need simple API key-style authentication

WARNING: Never use this in production - tokens are stored in plain text!

# `fastmcp.server.context`

## Functions

### `set_context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/context.py#L94" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
set_context(context: Context) -> Generator[Context, None, None]
```

## Classes

### `LogData` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/context.py#L70" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Data object for passing log arguments to client-side handlers.

This provides an interface to match the Python standard library logging,
for compatibility with structured logging.

### `Context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/context.py#L103" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Context object providing access to MCP capabilities.

This provides a cleaner interface to MCP's RequestContext functionality.
It gets injected into tool and resource functions that request it via type hints.

To use context in a tool function, add a parameter with the Context type annotation:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@server.tool
async def my_tool(x: int, ctx: Context) -> str:
    # Log messages to the client
    await ctx.info(f"Processing {x}")
    await ctx.debug("Debug info")
    await ctx.warning("Warning message")
    await ctx.error("Error message")

    # Report progress
    await ctx.report_progress(50, 100, "Processing")

    # Access resources
    data = await ctx.read_resource("resource://data")

    # Get request info
    request_id = ctx.request_id
    client_id = ctx.client_id

    # Manage state across the request
    ctx.set_state("key", "value")
    value = ctx.get_state("key")

    return str(x)
```

State Management:
Context objects maintain a state dictionary that can be used to store and share
data across middleware and tool calls within a request. When a new context
is created (nested contexts), it inherits a copy of its parent's state, ensuring
that modifications in child contexts don't affect parent contexts.

The context parameter name can be anything as long as it's annotated with Context.
The context is optional - tools that don't need it can omit the parameter.

```

Send an elicitation request to the client and await the response.

Call this method at any time to request additional information from
the user through the client. The client must support elicitation,
or the request will error.

Note that the MCP protocol only supports simple object schemas with
primitive types. You can provide a dataclass, TypedDict, or BaseModel to
comply. If you provide a primitive type, an object schema with a single
"value" field will be generated for the MCP interaction and
automatically deconstructed into the primitive type upon response.

If the response\_type is None, the generated schema will be that of an
empty object in order to comply with the MCP protocol requirements.
Clients must send an empty object ("{}")in response.

**Args:**

* `message`: A human-readable message explaining what information is needed
* `response_type`: The type of the response, which should be a primitive
  type or dataclass or BaseModel. If it is a primitive type, an
  object schema with a single "value" field will be generated.

The response caching middleware offers a simple way to cache responses to mcp methods. The Middleware
supports cache invalidation via notifications from the server. The Middleware implements TTL-based caching
but cache implementations may offer additional features like LRU eviction, size limits, and more.

When items are retrieved from the cache they will no longer be the original objects, but rather no-op objects
this means that response caching may not be compatible with other middleware that expects original subclasses.

Notes:

* Caches `tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`, `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and `prompts/list` requests.
* Cache keys are derived from method name and arguments.

**Args:**

* `name_or_fn`: Either a function (when used as @tool), a string name, or None
* `name`: Optional name for the tool (keyword-only, alternative to name\_or\_fn)
* `description`: Optional description of what the tool does
* `tags`: Optional set of tags for categorizing the tool
* `output_schema`: Optional JSON schema for the tool's output

```

Add a resource or template to the server from a function.

If the URI contains parameters (e.g. "resource://{param}") or the function
has parameters, it will be registered as a template resource.

**Args:**

* `fn`: The function to register as a resource
* `uri`: The URI for the resource
* `name`: Optional name for the resource
* `description`: Optional description of the resource
* `mime_type`: Optional MIME type for the resource
* `tags`: Optional set of tags for categorizing the resource

#### `resource` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/server.py#L1618" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
resource(self, uri: str) -> Callable[[AnyFunction], Resource | ResourceTemplate]
```

Decorator to register a function as a resource.

The function will be called when the resource is read to generate its content.
The function can return:

* str for text content
* bytes for binary content
* other types will be converted to JSON

Resources can optionally request a Context object by adding a parameter with the
Context type annotation. The context provides access to MCP capabilities like
logging, progress reporting, and session information.

If the URI contains parameters (e.g. "resource://{param}") or the function
has parameters, it will be registered as a template resource.

**Args:**

* `uri`: URI for the resource (e.g. "resource://my-resource" or "resource://{param}")
* `name`: Optional name for the resource
* `description`: Optional description of the resource
* `mime_type`: Optional MIME type for the resource
* `tags`: Optional set of tags for categorizing the resource
* `enabled`: Optional boolean to enable or disable the resource
* `annotations`: Optional annotations about the resource's behavior
* `meta`: Optional meta information about the resource

**Examples:**

Register a resource with a custom name:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@server.resource("resource://my-resource")
def get_data() -> str:
    return "Hello, world!"

@server.resource("resource://my-resource")

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mount(self, server: FastMCP[LifespanResultT], prefix: str | None = None, as_proxy: bool | None = None) -> None
```

Mount another FastMCP server on this server with an optional prefix.

Unlike importing (with import\_server), mounting establishes a dynamic connection
between servers. When a client interacts with a mounted server's objects through
the parent server, requests are forwarded to the mounted server in real-time.
This means changes to the mounted server are immediately reflected when accessed
through the parent.

When a server is mounted with a prefix:

* Tools from the mounted server are accessible with prefixed names.
  Example: If server has a tool named "get\_weather", it will be available as "prefix\_get\_weather".
* Resources are accessible with prefixed URIs.
  Example: If server has a resource with URI "weather://forecast", it will be available as
  "weather://prefix/forecast".
* Templates are accessible with prefixed URI templates.
  Example: If server has a template with URI "weather://location/{id}", it will be available
  as "weather://prefix/location/{id}".
* Prompts are accessible with prefixed names.
  Example: If server has a prompt named "weather\_prompt", it will be available as
  "prefix\_weather\_prompt".

When a server is mounted without a prefix (prefix=None), its tools, resources, templates,
and prompts are accessible with their original names. Multiple servers can be mounted
without prefixes, and they will be tried in order until a match is found.

There are two modes for mounting servers:

1. Direct mounting (default when server has no custom lifespan): The parent server
   directly accesses the mounted server's objects in-memory for better performance.
   In this mode, no client lifecycle events occur on the mounted server, including
   lifespan execution.

2. Proxy mounting (default when server has a custom lifespan): The parent server
   treats the mounted server as a separate entity and communicates with it via a
   Client transport. This preserves all client-facing behaviors, including lifespan
   execution, but with slightly higher overhead.

**Args:**

* `server`: The FastMCP server to mount.
* `prefix`: Optional prefix to use for the mounted server's objects. If None,
  the server's objects are accessible with their original names.
* `as_proxy`: Whether to treat the mounted server as a proxy. If None (default),
  automatically determined based on whether the server has a custom lifespan
  (True if it has a custom lifespan, False otherwise).
* `tool_separator`: Deprecated. Separator character for tool names.
* `resource_separator`: Deprecated. Separator character for resource URIs.
* `prompt_separator`: Deprecated. Separator character for prompt names.

#### `import_server` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/server.py#L2334" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import_server(self, server: FastMCP[LifespanResultT], prefix: str | None = None, tool_separator: str | None = None, resource_separator: str | None = None, prompt_separator: str | None = None) -> None
```

Import the MCP objects from another FastMCP server into this one,
optionally with a given prefix.

Note that when a server is *imported*, its objects are immediately
registered to the importing server. This is a one-time operation and
future changes to the imported server will not be reflected in the
importing server. Server-level configurations and lifespans are not imported.

When a server is imported with a prefix:

* The tools are imported with prefixed names
  Example: If server has a tool named "get\_weather", it will be
  available as "prefix\_get\_weather"
* The resources are imported with prefixed URIs using the new format
  Example: If server has a resource with URI "weather://forecast", it will
  be available as "weather://prefix/forecast"
* The templates are imported with prefixed URI templates using the new format
  Example: If server has a template with URI "weather://location/{id}", it will
  be available as "weather://prefix/location/{id}"
* The prompts are imported with prefixed names
  Example: If server has a prompt named "weather\_prompt", it will be available as
  "prefix\_weather\_prompt"

When a server is imported without a prefix (prefix=None), its tools, resources,
templates, and prompts are imported with their original names.

**Args:**

* `server`: The FastMCP server to import
* `prefix`: Optional prefix to use for the imported server's objects. If None,
  objects are imported with their original names.
* `tool_separator`: Deprecated. Separator for tool names.
* `resource_separator`: Deprecated and ignored. Prefix is now
  applied using the protocol://prefix/path format
* `prompt_separator`: Deprecated. Separator for prompt names.

## Functions

### `forward` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L37" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
forward(**kwargs: Any) -> ToolResult
```

Forward to parent tool with argument transformation applied.

This function can only be called from within a transformed tool's custom
function. It applies argument transformation (renaming, validation) before
calling the parent tool.

For example, if the parent tool has args `x` and `y`, but the transformed
tool has args `a` and `b`, and an `transform_args` was provided that maps `x` to
`a` and `y` to `b`, then `forward(a=1, b=2)` will call the parent tool with
`x=1` and `y=2`.

**Args:**

* `**kwargs`: Arguments to forward to the parent tool (using transformed names).

**Returns:**

* The ToolResult from the parent tool execution.

**Raises:**

* `RuntimeError`: If called outside a transformed tool context.
* `TypeError`: If provided arguments don't match the transformed schema.

### `forward_raw` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L67" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
forward_raw(**kwargs: Any) -> ToolResult
```

Forward directly to parent tool without transformation.

This function bypasses all argument transformation and validation, calling the parent
tool directly with the provided arguments. Use this when you need to call the parent
with its original parameter names and structure.

For example, if the parent tool has args `x` and `y`, then `forward_raw(x=1,
y=2)` will call the parent tool with `x=1` and `y=2`.

**Args:**

* `**kwargs`: Arguments to pass directly to the parent tool (using original names).

**Returns:**

* The ToolResult from the parent tool execution.

**Raises:**

* `RuntimeError`: If called outside a transformed tool context.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
apply_transformations_to_tools(tools: dict[str, Tool], transformations: dict[str, ToolTransformConfig]) -> dict[str, Tool]
```

Apply a list of transformations to a list of tools. Tools that do not have any transformations
are left unchanged.

### `ArgTransform` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L94" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Configuration for transforming a parent tool's argument.

This class allows fine-grained control over how individual arguments are transformed
when creating a new tool from an existing one. You can rename arguments, change their
descriptions, add default values, or hide them from clients while passing constants.

**Examples:**

Rename argument 'old\_name' to 'new\_name'

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(name="new_name")
```

Change description only

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(description="Updated description")
```

Add a default value (makes argument optional)

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(default=42)
```

Add a default factory (makes argument optional)

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(default_factory=lambda: time.time())
```

Change the type

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(type=str)
```

Hide the argument entirely from clients

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(hide=True)
```

Hide argument but pass a constant value to parent

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(hide=True, default="constant_value")
```

Hide argument but pass a factory-generated value to parent

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(hide=True, default_factory=lambda: uuid.uuid4().hex)
```

Make an optional parameter required (removes any default)

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(required=True)
```

Combine multiple transformations

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ArgTransform(name="new_name", description="New desc", default=None, type=int)
```

### `TransformedTool` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L232" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

A tool that is transformed from another tool.

This class represents a tool that has been created by transforming another tool.
It supports argument renaming, schema modification, custom function injection,
structured output control, and provides context for the forward() and forward\_raw() functions.

The transformation can be purely schema-based (argument renaming, dropping, etc.)
or can include a custom function that uses forward() to call the parent tool
with transformed arguments. Output schemas and structured outputs are automatically
inherited from the parent tool but can be overridden or disabled.

**Methods:**

#### `run` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L259" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
run(self, arguments: dict[str, Any]) -> ToolResult
```

Run the tool with context set for forward() functions.

This method executes the tool's function while setting up the context
that allows forward() and forward\_raw() to work correctly within custom
functions.

**Args:**

* `arguments`: Dictionary of arguments to pass to the tool's function.

**Returns:**

* ToolResult object containing content and optional structured output.

#### `from_tool` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/tools/tool_transform.py#L364" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from_tool(cls, tool: Tool, name: str | None = None, title: str | NotSetT | None = NotSet, description: str | NotSetT | None = NotSet, tags: set[str] | None = None, transform_fn: Callable[..., Any] | None = None, transform_args: dict[str, ArgTransform] | None = None, annotations: ToolAnnotations | NotSetT | None = NotSet, output_schema: dict[str, Any] | Literal[False] | NotSetT | None = NotSet, serializer: Callable[[Any], str] | NotSetT | None = NotSet, meta: dict[str, Any] | NotSetT | None = NotSet, enabled: bool | None = None) -> TransformedTool
```

Create a transformed tool from a parent tool.

**Args:**

* `tool`: The parent tool to transform.

* `transform_args`: Optional transformations for parent tool arguments.
  Only specified arguments are transformed, others pass through unchanged:
* Simple rename (str)
* Complex transformation (rename/description/default/drop) (ArgTransform)
* Drop the argument (None)
* `description`: New description. Defaults to parent's description.
* `tags`: New tags. Defaults to parent's tags.
* `annotations`: New annotations. Defaults to parent's annotations.
* `output_schema`: Control output schema for structured outputs:
* None (default): Inherit from transform\_fn if available, then parent tool
* dict: Use custom output schema
* False: Disable output schema and structured outputs
* `serializer`: New serializer. Defaults to parent's serializer.
* `meta`: Control meta information:
* NotSet (default): Inherit from parent tool
* dict: Use custom meta information
* None: Remove meta information

**Returns:**

* TransformedTool with the specified transformations.

# `fastmcp.utilities.json_schema_type`

Convert JSON Schema to Python types with validation.

The json\_schema\_to\_type function converts a JSON Schema into a Python type that can be used
for validation with Pydantic. It supports:

* Basic types (string, number, integer, boolean, null)
* Complex types (arrays, objects)
* Format constraints (date-time, email, uri)
* Numeric constraints (minimum, maximum, multipleOf)
* String constraints (minLength, maxLength, pattern)
* Array constraints (minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems)
* Object properties with defaults
* References and recursive schemas
* Enums and constants
* Union types

Example:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
        "age": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"}
    },
    "required": ["name", "age"]
}

# Name is optional and will be inferred from schema's "title" property if not provided
Person = json_schema_to_type(schema)
# Creates a validated dataclass with name, age, and optional email fields
```

**Args:**

* `schema`: A JSON Schema dictionary defining the type structure and validation rules
* `name`: Optional name for object schemas. Only allowed when schema type is "object".
  If not provided for objects, name will be inferred from schema's "title"
  property or default to "Root".

**Returns:**

* A Python type (typically a dataclass for objects) with Pydantic validation

**Raises:**

* `ValueError`: If a name is provided for a non-object schema

**Examples:**

Create a dataclass from an object schema:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Person",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},

        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"}
    },
    "required": ["name", "age"]
}

Person = json_schema_to_type(schema)
# Creates a dataclass with name, age, and optional email fields:
# @dataclass
# class Person:
#     name: str
#     age: int
#     email: str | None = None
```

Person(name="John", age=30)

Create a scalar type with constraints:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
schema = {
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 3,
    "pattern": "^[A-Z][a-z]+$"
}

NameType = json_schema_to_type(schema)
# Creates Annotated[str, StringConstraints(min_length=3, pattern="^[A-Z][a-z]+$")]

@dataclass

# Authentication
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/authentication

Secure your FastMCP server with flexible authentication patterns, from simple API keys to full OAuth 2.1 integration with external identity providers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

Authentication in MCP presents unique challenges that differ from traditional web applications. MCP clients need to discover authentication requirements automatically, negotiate OAuth flows without user intervention, and work seamlessly across different identity providers. FastMCP addresses these challenges by providing authentication patterns that integrate with the MCP protocol while remaining simple to implement and deploy.

<Tip>
  Authentication applies only to FastMCP's HTTP-based transports (`http` and `sse`). The STDIO transport inherits security from its local execution environment.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Authentication is rapidly evolving in MCP.** The specification and best practices are changing quickly. FastMCP aims to provide stable, secure patterns that adapt to these changes while keeping your code simple and maintainable.
</Warning>

## MCP Authentication Challenges

Traditional web authentication assumes a human user with a browser who can interact with login forms and consent screens. MCP clients are often automated systems that need to authenticate without human intervention. This creates several unique requirements:

**Automatic Discovery**: MCP clients must discover authentication requirements by examining server metadata rather than encountering login redirects.

**Programmatic OAuth**: OAuth flows must work without human interaction, relying on pre-configured credentials or Dynamic Client Registration.

**Token Management**: Clients need to obtain, refresh, and manage tokens automatically across multiple MCP servers.

**Protocol Integration**: Authentication must integrate cleanly with MCP's transport mechanisms and error handling.

These challenges mean that not all authentication approaches work well with MCP. The patterns that do work fall into three categories based on the level of authentication responsibility your server assumes.

## Authentication Responsibility

Authentication responsibility exists on a spectrum. Your MCP server can validate tokens created elsewhere, coordinate with external identity providers, or handle the complete authentication lifecycle internally. Each approach involves different trade-offs between simplicity, security, and control.

### Token Validation

Your server validates tokens but delegates their creation to external systems. This approach treats your MCP server as a pure resource server that trusts tokens signed by known issuers.

Token validation works well when you already have authentication infrastructure that can issue structured tokens like JWTs. Your existing API gateway, microservices platform, or enterprise SSO system becomes the source of truth for user identity, while your MCP server focuses on its core functionality.

The key insight is that token validation separates authentication (proving who you are) from authorization (determining what you can do). Your MCP server receives proof of identity in the form of a signed token and makes access decisions based on the claims within that token.

This pattern excels in microservices architectures where multiple services need to validate the same tokens, or when integrating MCP servers into existing systems that already handle user authentication.

### External Identity Providers

Your server coordinates with established identity providers to create seamless authentication experiences for MCP clients. This approach leverages OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols to delegate user authentication while maintaining control over authorization decisions.

External identity providers handle the complex aspects of authentication: user credential verification, multi-factor authentication, account recovery, and security monitoring. Your MCP server receives tokens from these trusted providers and validates them using the provider's public keys.

The MCP protocol's support for Dynamic Client Registration makes this pattern particularly powerful. MCP clients can automatically discover your authentication requirements and register themselves with your identity provider without manual configuration.

This approach works best for production applications that need enterprise-grade authentication features without the complexity of building them from scratch. It scales well across multiple applications and provides consistent user experiences.

### Full OAuth Implementation

Your server implements a complete OAuth 2.0 authorization server, handling everything from user credential verification to token lifecycle management. This approach provides maximum control at the cost of significant complexity.

Full OAuth implementation means building user interfaces for login and consent, implementing secure credential storage, managing token lifecycles, and maintaining ongoing security updates. The complexity extends beyond initial implementation to include threat monitoring, compliance requirements, and keeping pace with evolving security best practices.

This pattern makes sense only when you need complete control over the authentication process, operate in air-gapped environments, or have specialized requirements that external providers cannot meet.

## FastMCP Authentication Providers

FastMCP translates these authentication responsibility levels into a variety of concrete classes that handle the complexities of MCP protocol integration. You can build on these classes to handle the complexities of MCP protocol integration.

### TokenVerifier

`TokenVerifier` provides pure token validation without OAuth metadata endpoints. This class focuses on the essential task of determining whether a token is valid and extracting authorization information from its claims.

The implementation handles JWT signature verification, expiration checking, and claim extraction. It validates tokens against known issuers and audiences, ensuring that tokens intended for your server are not accepted by other systems.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

auth = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://your-auth-system.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://your-auth-system.com", 
    audience="your-mcp-server"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected Server", auth=auth)
```

This example configures token validation against a JWT issuer. The `JWTVerifier` will fetch public keys from the JWKS endpoint and validate incoming tokens against those keys. Only tokens with the correct issuer and audience claims will be accepted.

`TokenVerifier` works well when you control both the token issuer and your MCP server, or when integrating with existing JWT-based infrastructure.

→ **Complete guide**: [Token Verification](/servers/auth/token-verification)

### RemoteAuthProvider

`RemoteAuthProvider` enables authentication with identity providers that **support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**, such as Descope and WorkOS AuthKit. With DCR, MCP clients can automatically register themselves with the identity provider and obtain credentials without any manual configuration.

This class combines token validation with OAuth discovery metadata. It extends `TokenVerifier` functionality by adding OAuth 2.0 protected resource endpoints that advertise your authentication requirements. MCP clients examine these endpoints to understand which identity providers you trust and how to obtain valid tokens.

The key requirement is that your identity provider must support DCR - the ability for clients to dynamically register and obtain credentials. This is what enables the seamless, automated authentication flow that MCP requires.

For example, the built-in `AuthKitProvider` uses WorkOS AuthKit, which fully supports DCR:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import AuthKitProvider

auth = AuthKitProvider(
    authkit_domain="https://your-project.authkit.app",
    base_url="https://your-fastmcp-server.com"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Enterprise Server", auth=auth)
```

This example uses WorkOS AuthKit as the external identity provider. The `AuthKitProvider` automatically configures token validation against WorkOS and provides the OAuth metadata that MCP clients need for automatic authentication.

`RemoteAuthProvider` is ideal for production applications when your identity provider supports Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). This enables fully automated authentication without manual client configuration.

→ **Complete guide**: [Remote OAuth](/servers/auth/remote-oauth)

### OAuthProxy

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

`OAuthProxy` enables authentication with OAuth providers that **don't support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**, such as GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, and most traditional enterprise identity systems.

When identity providers require manual app registration and fixed credentials, `OAuthProxy` bridges the gap. It presents a DCR-compliant interface to MCP clients (accepting any registration request) while using your pre-registered credentials with the upstream provider. The proxy handles the complexity of callback forwarding, enabling dynamic client callbacks to work with providers that require fixed redirect URIs.

This class solves the fundamental incompatibility between MCP's expectation of dynamic registration and traditional OAuth providers' requirement for manual app registration.

For example, the built-in `GitHubProvider` extends `OAuthProxy` to work with GitHub's OAuth system:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="Ov23li...",  # Your GitHub OAuth App ID
    client_secret="abc123...",  # Your GitHub OAuth App Secret
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="GitHub-Protected Server", auth=auth)
```

This example uses the GitHub provider, which extends `OAuthProxy` with GitHub-specific token validation. The proxy handles the complete OAuth flow while making GitHub's non-DCR authentication work seamlessly with MCP clients.

`OAuthProxy` is essential when integrating with OAuth providers that don't support DCR. This includes most established providers like GitHub, Google, and Azure, which require manual app registration through their developer consoles.

→ **Complete guide**: [OAuth Proxy](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy)

### OAuthProvider

`OAuthProvider` implements a complete OAuth 2.0 authorization server within your MCP server. This class handles the full authentication lifecycle from user credential verification to token management.

The implementation provides all required OAuth endpoints including authorization, token, and discovery endpoints. It manages client registration, user consent, and token lifecycle while integrating with your user storage and authentication logic.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.oauth import MyOAuthProvider

auth = MyOAuthProvider(
    user_store=your_user_database,
    client_store=your_client_registry,
    # Additional configuration...
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Auth Server", auth=auth)
```

This example shows the basic structure of a custom OAuth provider. The actual implementation requires significant additional configuration for user management, client registration, and security policies.

`OAuthProvider` should be used only when you have specific requirements that external providers cannot meet and the expertise to implement OAuth securely.

## Configuration Approaches

FastMCP supports both programmatic configuration for maximum flexibility and environment-based configuration for deployment simplicity.

### Programmatic Configuration

Programmatic configuration provides complete control over authentication settings and allows for complex initialization logic. This approach works well during development and when you need to customize authentication behavior based on runtime conditions.

Authentication providers are instantiated directly in your code with their required parameters. This makes dependencies explicit and allows your IDE to provide helpful autocompletion and type checking.

### Environment Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

Environment-based configuration separates authentication settings from application code, enabling the same codebase to work across different deployment environments without modification.

FastMCP automatically detects authentication configuration from environment variables when no explicit `auth` parameter is provided. The configuration system supports all authentication providers and their various options.

#### Provider Configuration

Authentication providers are configured by specifying the full module path to the provider class:

<ParamField path="FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH" type="string">
  The full module path to the authentication provider class. Examples:

  * `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider` - GitHub OAuth
  * `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google.GoogleProvider` - Google OAuth
  * `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt.JWTVerifier` - JWT token verification
  * `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos.WorkOSProvider` - WorkOS OAuth
  * `fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos.AuthKitProvider` - WorkOS AuthKit
  * `mycompany.auth.CustomProvider` - Your custom provider class
</ParamField>

When using providers like GitHub or Google, you'll need to set provider-specific environment variables:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# GitHub OAuth
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="Ov23li..."
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="github_pat_..."

# Google OAuth
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google.GoogleProvider
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="123456.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOCSPX-..."
```

#### Provider-Specific Configuration

Each provider has its own configuration options set through environment variables:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# JWT Token Verification
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt.JWTVerifier
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_JWKS_URI="https://auth.example.com/jwks"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_ISSUER="https://auth.example.com"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE="mcp-server"

# Custom Provider
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=mycompany.auth.CustomProvider
# Plus any environment variables your custom provider expects
```

With these environment variables set, creating an authenticated FastMCP server requires no additional configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server")
```

This approach simplifies deployment pipelines and follows twelve-factor app principles for configuration management.

## Choosing Your Implementation

The authentication approach you choose depends on your existing infrastructure, security requirements, and operational constraints.

**For OAuth providers without DCR support (GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, most enterprise systems), use OAuth Proxy.** These providers require manual app registration through their developer consoles. OAuth Proxy bridges the gap by presenting a DCR-compliant interface to MCP clients while using your fixed credentials with the provider. The proxy's callback forwarding pattern enables dynamic client ports to work with providers that require fixed redirect URIs.

**For identity providers with DCR support (Descope, WorkOS AuthKit, modern auth platforms), use RemoteAuthProvider.** These providers allow clients to dynamically register and obtain credentials without manual configuration. This enables the fully automated authentication flow that MCP is designed for, providing the best user experience and simplest implementation.

**Token validation works well when you already have authentication infrastructure that issues structured tokens.** If your organization already uses JWT-based systems, API gateways, or enterprise SSO that can generate tokens, this approach integrates seamlessly while keeping your MCP server focused on its core functionality. The simplicity comes from leveraging existing investment in authentication infrastructure.

**Full OAuth implementation should be avoided unless you have compelling reasons that external providers cannot address.** Air-gapped environments, specialized compliance requirements, or unique organizational constraints might justify this approach, but it requires significant security expertise and ongoing maintenance commitment. The complexity extends far beyond initial implementation to include threat monitoring, security updates, and keeping pace with evolving attack vectors.

FastMCP's architecture supports migration between these approaches as your requirements evolve. You can integrate with existing token systems initially and migrate to external identity providers as your application scales, or implement custom solutions when your requirements outgrow standard patterns.


# Full OAuth Server
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/full-oauth-server

Build a self-contained authentication system where your FastMCP server manages users, issues tokens, and validates them.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

<Warning>
  **This is an extremely advanced pattern that most users should avoid.** Building a secure OAuth 2.1 server requires deep expertise in authentication protocols, cryptography, and security best practices. The complexity extends far beyond initial implementation to include ongoing security monitoring, threat response, and compliance maintenance.

  **Use [Remote OAuth](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) instead** unless you have compelling requirements that external identity providers cannot meet, such as air-gapped environments or specialized compliance needs.
</Warning>

The Full OAuth Server pattern exists to support the MCP protocol specification's requirements. Your FastMCP server becomes both an Authorization Server and Resource Server, handling the complete authentication lifecycle from user login to token validation.

This documentation exists for completeness - the vast majority of applications should use external identity providers instead.

## OAuthProvider

FastMCP provides the `OAuthProvider` abstract class that implements the OAuth 2.1 specification. To use this pattern, you must subclass `OAuthProvider` and implement all required abstract methods.

<Note>
  `OAuthProvider` handles OAuth endpoints, protocol flows, and security requirements, but delegates all storage, user management, and business logic to your implementation of the abstract methods.
</Note>

## Required Implementation

You must implement these abstract methods to create a functioning OAuth server:

Each method must handle storage, validation, security, and error cases according to the OAuth 2.1 specification. The implementation complexity is substantial and requires expertise in OAuth security considerations.

<Warning>
  **Security Notice:** OAuth server implementation involves numerous security considerations including PKCE, state parameters, redirect URI validation, token binding, replay attack prevention, and secure storage requirements. Mistakes can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

# OAuth Proxy
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy

Bridge traditional OAuth providers to work seamlessly with MCP's authentication flow.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

The OAuth proxy enables FastMCP servers to authenticate with OAuth providers that **don't support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**. This includes virtually all traditional OAuth providers: GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, Discord, Facebook, and most enterprise identity systems. For providers that do support DCR (like Descope and WorkOS AuthKit), use [`RemoteAuthProvider`](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) instead.

MCP clients expect to register automatically and obtain credentials on the fly, but traditional providers require manual app registration through their developer consoles. The OAuth proxy bridges this gap by presenting a DCR-compliant interface to MCP clients while using your pre-registered credentials with the upstream provider. When a client attempts to register, the proxy returns your fixed credentials. When a client initiates authorization, the proxy handles the complexity of callback forwarding—storing the client's dynamic callback URL, using its own fixed callback with the provider, then forwarding back to the client after token exchange.

This approach enables any MCP client (whether using random localhost ports or fixed URLs like Claude.ai) to authenticate with any traditional OAuth provider, all while maintaining full OAuth 2.1 and PKCE security.

<Note>
  For providers that support OIDC discovery (Auth0, Google with OIDC
  configuration, Azure AD), consider using [`OIDC
    Proxy`](/servers/auth/oidc-proxy) for automatic configuration. OIDC Proxy
  extends the OAuth proxy to automatically discover endpoints from the provider's
  `/.well-known/openid-configuration` URL, simplifying setup.
</Note>

## Implementation

### Provider Setup Requirements

Before using the OAuth proxy, you need to register your application with your OAuth provider:

1. **Register your application** in the provider's developer console (GitHub Settings, Google Cloud Console, Azure Portal, etc.)
2. **Configure the redirect URI** as your FastMCP server URL plus your chosen callback path:
   * Default: `https://your-server.com/auth/callback`
   * Custom: `https://your-server.com/your/custom/path` (if you set `redirect_path`)
   * Development: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`
3. **Obtain your credentials**: Client ID and Client Secret
4. **Note the OAuth endpoints**: Authorization URL and Token URL (usually found in the provider's OAuth documentation)

<Warning>
  The redirect URI you configure with your provider must exactly match your
  FastMCP server's URL plus the callback path. If you customize `redirect_path`
  in the OAuth proxy, update your provider's redirect URI accordingly.
</Warning>

### Basic Setup

Here's how to implement the OAuth proxy with any provider:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import OAuthProxy
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

# Configure token verification for your provider
# See the Token Verification guide for provider-specific setups
token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://your-provider.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://your-provider.com",
    audience="your-app-id"
)

# Create the OAuth proxy
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # Provider's OAuth endpoints (from their documentation)
    upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://provider.com/oauth/authorize",
    upstream_token_endpoint="https://provider.com/oauth/token",

    # Your registered app credentials
    upstream_client_id="your-client-id",
    upstream_client_secret="your-client-secret",

    # Token validation (see Token Verification guide)
    token_verifier=token_verifier,

    # Your FastMCP server's public URL
    base_url="https://your-server.com",

    # Optional: customize the callback path (default is "/auth/callback")
    # redirect_path="/custom/callback",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

### Configuration Parameters

<Card icon="code" title="OAuthProxy Parameters">
  <ParamField body="upstream_authorization_endpoint" type="str" required>
    URL of your OAuth provider's authorization endpoint (e.g., `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="upstream_token_endpoint" type="str" required>
    URL of your OAuth provider's token endpoint (e.g.,
    `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="upstream_client_id" type="str" required>
    Client ID from your registered OAuth application
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="upstream_client_secret" type="str" required>
    Client secret from your registered OAuth application
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="token_verifier" type="TokenVerifier" required>
    A [`TokenVerifier`](/servers/auth/token-verification) instance to validate the
    provider's tokens
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="base_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str" required>
    Public URL where OAuth endpoints will be accessible, **including any mount path** (e.g., `https://your-server.com/api`).

    This URL is used to construct OAuth callback URLs and operational endpoints. When mounting under a path prefix, include that prefix in `base_url`. Use `issuer_url` separately to specify where auth server metadata is located (typically at root level).
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="redirect_path" type="str" default="/auth/callback">
    Path for OAuth callbacks. Must match the redirect URI configured in your OAuth
    application
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="upstream_revocation_endpoint" type="str | None">
    Optional URL of provider's token revocation endpoint
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="issuer_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str | None">
    Issuer URL for OAuth authorization server metadata (defaults to `base_url`).

    When mounting your MCP server under a path prefix (e.g., `/api`), set this to your root-level URL to avoid 404 logs during OAuth discovery. MCP clients try path-scoped discovery first per RFC 8414, which will fail if your auth server metadata is at the root level.

    **Example with mounting:**

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    auth = GitHubProvider(
        base_url="http://localhost:8000/api",  # OAuth endpoints under /api
        issuer_url="http://localhost:8000"     # Auth server metadata at root
    )
    ```

    Without `issuer_url`, clients will attempt `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/api` (404) before falling back to `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (success). Setting `issuer_url` to the root eliminates the 404 attempt.

    **When to use:**

    * **Default (`None`)**: Use `base_url` as issuer - simple deployments at root path
    * **Root-level URL**: Mounting under a path prefix - avoids 404 logs

    See the [HTTP Deployment guide](/deployment/http#mounting-authenticated-servers) for complete mounting examples.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="service_documentation_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str | None">
    Optional URL to your service documentation
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="forward_pkce" type="bool" default="True">
    Whether to forward PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to the upstream OAuth
    provider. When enabled and the client uses PKCE, the proxy generates its own
    PKCE parameters to send upstream while separately validating the client's
    PKCE. This ensures end-to-end PKCE security at both layers (client-to-proxy
    and proxy-to-upstream). - `True` (default): Forward PKCE for providers that
    support it (Google, Azure, AWS, GitHub, etc.) - `False`: Disable only if upstream
    provider doesn't support PKCE
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="token_endpoint_auth_method" type="str | None">
    Token endpoint authentication method for the upstream OAuth server. Controls
    how the proxy authenticates when exchanging authorization codes and refresh
    tokens with the upstream provider. - `"client_secret_basic"`: Send credentials
    in Authorization header (most common) - `"client_secret_post"`: Send
    credentials in request body (required by some providers) - `"none"`: No
    authentication (for public clients) - `None` (default): Uses authlib's default
    (typically `"client_secret_basic"`) Set this if your provider requires a
    specific authentication method and the default doesn't work.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="allowed_client_redirect_uris" type="list[str] | None">
    List of allowed redirect URI patterns for MCP clients. Patterns support
    wildcards (e.g., `"http://localhost:*"`, `"https://*.example.com/*"`). -
    `None` (default): All redirect URIs allowed (for MCP/DCR compatibility) -
    Empty list `[]`: No redirect URIs allowed - Custom list: Only matching
    patterns allowed These patterns apply to MCP client loopback redirects, NOT
    the upstream OAuth app redirect URI.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="valid_scopes" type="list[str] | None">
    List of all possible valid scopes for the OAuth provider. These are advertised
    to clients through the `/.well-known` endpoints. Defaults to `required_scopes`
    from your TokenVerifier if not specified.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="extra_authorize_params" type="dict[str, str] | None">
    Additional parameters to forward to the upstream authorization endpoint. Useful for provider-specific parameters that aren't part of the standard OAuth2 flow.

    For example, Auth0 requires an `audience` parameter to issue JWT tokens:

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    extra_authorize_params={"audience": "https://api.example.com"}
    ```

    These parameters are added to every authorization request sent to the upstream provider.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="extra_token_params" type="dict[str, str] | None">
    Additional parameters to forward to the upstream token endpoint during code exchange and token refresh. Useful for provider-specific requirements during token operations.

    For example, some providers require additional context during token exchange:

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    extra_token_params={"audience": "https://api.example.com"}
    ```

    These parameters are included in all token requests to the upstream provider.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="client_storage" type="AsyncKeyValue | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

    Storage backend for persisting OAuth client registrations and upstream tokens.

    **Default behavior:**
    By default, clients are automatically persisted to an encrypted disk store, allowing them to survive server restarts as long as the filesystem remains accessible. This means MCP clients only need to register once and can reconnect seamlessly. The disk store is encrypted using a key derived from the JWT Signing Key (which is derived from the upstream client secret by default). For client registrations to survive upstream client secret rotation, you should provide a JWT Signing Key or your own client\_storage.

    For production deployments with multiple servers or cloud deployments, see [Storage Backends](/servers/storage-backends) for available options.

    <Warning>
      **When providing custom storage**, wrap it in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest:

      ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
      from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
      from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
      from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
      import os

      auth = OAuthProxy(
          ...,
          jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
          client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
              key_value=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379),
              fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
          )
      )
      ```

      Without encryption, upstream OAuth tokens are stored in plaintext.
    </Warning>

    Testing with in-memory storage (unencrypted):

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from key_value.aio.stores.memory import MemoryStore

    # Use in-memory storage for testing (clients lost on restart)
    auth = OAuthProxy(..., client_storage=MemoryStore())
    ```
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="jwt_signing_key" type="str | bytes | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

    Secret used to sign FastMCP JWT tokens issued to clients. Accepts any string or bytes - will be derived into a proper 32-byte cryptographic key using HKDF.

    **Default behavior (`None`):**
    Derives a 32-byte key using PBKDF2 from the upstream client secret.

    **For production:**
    Provide an explicit secret (e.g., from environment variable) to use a fixed key instead of the key derived from the upstream client secret. This allows you to manage keys securely in cloud environments, allows keys to work across multiple instances, and allows you to rotate keys without losing client registrations.

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    import os

    auth = OAuthProxy(
        ...,
        jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],  # Any sufficiently complex string!
        client_storage=RedisStore(...)  # Persistent storage
    )
    ```

    See [HTTP Deployment - OAuth Token Security](/deployment/http#oauth-token-security) for complete production setup.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="require_authorization_consent" type="bool" default="True">
    Whether to require user consent before authorizing MCP clients. When enabled (default), users see a consent screen that displays which client is requesting access, preventing [confused deputy attacks](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#confused-deputy-problem) by ensuring users explicitly approve new clients.

    **Default behavior (True):**
    Users see a consent screen on first authorization. Consent choices are remembered via signed cookies, so users only need to approve each client once. This protects against malicious clients impersonating the user.

    **Disabling consent (False):**
    Authorization proceeds directly to the upstream provider without user confirmation. Only use this for local development or testing environments where the security trade-off is acceptable.

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    # Development/testing only - skip consent screen
    auth = OAuthProxy(
        ...,
        require_authorization_consent=False  # ⚠️ Security warning: only for local/testing
    )
    ```

    <Warning>
      Disabling consent removes an important security layer. Only disable for local development or testing environments where you fully control all connecting clients.
    </Warning>
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Using Built-in Providers

FastMCP includes pre-configured providers for common services:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-github-app-id",
    client_secret="your-github-app-secret",
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

Available providers include `GitHubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and others. These handle token verification automatically.

### Token Verification

The OAuth proxy requires a compatible `TokenVerifier` to validate tokens from your provider. Different providers use different token formats:

* **JWT tokens** (Google, Azure): Use `JWTVerifier` with the provider's JWKS endpoint
* **Opaque tokens with RFC 7662 introspection** (Auth0, Okta, WorkOS): Use `IntrospectionTokenVerifier`
* **Opaque tokens (provider-specific)** (GitHub, Discord): Use provider-specific verifiers like `GitHubTokenVerifier`

See the [Token Verification guide](/servers/auth/token-verification) for detailed setup instructions for your provider.

### Scope Configuration

OAuth scopes control what permissions your application requests from users. They're configured through your `TokenVerifier` (required for the OAuth proxy to validate tokens from your provider). Set `required_scopes` to automatically request the permissions your application needs:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
JWTVerifier(..., required_scopes = ["read:user", "write:data"])
```

Dynamic clients created by the proxy will automatically include these scopes in their authorization requests. See the [Token Verification](#token-verification) section below for detailed setup.

### Custom Parameters

Some OAuth providers require additional parameters beyond the standard OAuth2 flow. Use `extra_authorize_params` and `extra_token_params` to pass provider-specific requirements. For example, Auth0 requires an `audience` parameter to issue JWT tokens instead of opaque tokens:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
auth = OAuthProxy(
    upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://your-domain.auth0.com/authorize",
    upstream_token_endpoint="https://your-domain.auth0.com/oauth/token",
    upstream_client_id="your-auth0-client-id",
    upstream_client_secret="your-auth0-client-secret",

    # Auth0-specific audience parameter
    extra_authorize_params={"audience": "https://your-api-identifier.com"},
    extra_token_params={"audience": "https://your-api-identifier.com"},

    token_verifier=JWTVerifier(
        jwks_uri="https://your-domain.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
        issuer="https://your-domain.auth0.com/",
        audience="https://your-api-identifier.com"
    ),
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)
```

The proxy also automatically forwards RFC 8707 `resource` parameters from MCP clients to upstream providers that support them.

## OAuth Flow

    Note over Client, Proxy: Token Exchange
    Client->>Proxy: 11. POST /token with code<br/>code_verifier=CLIENT_VERIFIER
    Proxy-->>Client: 12. Returns stored provider tokens
```

The flow diagram above illustrates the complete OAuth proxy pattern. Let's understand each phase:

### Registration Phase

When an MCP client calls `/register` with its dynamic callback URL, the proxy responds with your pre-configured upstream credentials. The client stores these credentials believing it has registered a new app. Meanwhile, the proxy records the client's callback URL for later use.

### Authorization Phase

The client initiates OAuth by redirecting to the proxy's `/authorize` endpoint. The proxy:

1. Stores the client's transaction with its PKCE challenge
2. Generates its own PKCE parameters for upstream security
3. Shows the user a consent page with the client's details, redirect URI, and requested scopes
4. If the user approves (or the client was previously approved), redirects to the upstream provider using the fixed callback URL

This dual-PKCE approach maintains end-to-end security at both the client-to-proxy and proxy-to-provider layers. The consent step protects against confused deputy attacks by ensuring you explicitly approve each client before it can complete authorization.

### Callback Phase

After user authorization, the provider redirects back to the proxy's fixed callback URL. The proxy:

1. Exchanges the authorization code for tokens with the provider
2. Stores these tokens temporarily
3. Generates a new authorization code for the client
4. Redirects to the client's original dynamic callback URL

### Token Exchange Phase

Finally, the client exchanges its authorization code with the proxy to receive the provider's tokens. The proxy validates the client's PKCE verifier before returning the stored tokens.

This entire flow is transparent to the MCP client—it experiences a standard OAuth flow with dynamic registration, unaware that a proxy is managing the complexity behind the scenes.

### Token Architecture

The OAuth proxy implements a **token factory pattern**: instead of directly forwarding tokens from the upstream OAuth provider, it issues its own JWT tokens to MCP clients. This maintains proper OAuth 2.0 token audience boundaries and enables better security controls.

**How it works:**

When an MCP client completes authorization, the proxy:

1. **Receives upstream tokens** from the OAuth provider (GitHub, Google, etc.)
2. **Encrypts and stores** these tokens using Fernet encryption (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
3. **Issues FastMCP JWT tokens** to the client, signed with HS256

The FastMCP JWT contains minimal claims: issuer, audience, client ID, scopes, expiration, and a unique token identifier (JTI). The JTI acts as a reference linking to the encrypted upstream token.

**Token validation:**

When a client makes an MCP request with its FastMCP token:

1. **FastMCP validates the JWT** signature, expiration, issuer, and audience
2. **Looks up the upstream token** using the JTI from the validated JWT
3. **Decrypts and validates** the upstream token with the provider

This two-tier validation ensures that FastMCP tokens can only be used with this server (via audience validation) while maintaining full upstream token security.

**Token expiry alignment:**

FastMCP token lifetimes match the upstream token lifetimes. When the upstream token expires, the FastMCP token also expires, maintaining consistent security boundaries.

**Refresh tokens:**

The proxy issues its own refresh tokens that map to upstream refresh tokens. When a client uses a FastMCP refresh token, the proxy refreshes the upstream token and issues a new FastMCP access token.

### PKCE Forwarding

The OAuth proxy automatically handles PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) when working with providers that support or require it. The proxy generates its own PKCE parameters to send upstream while separately validating the client's PKCE, ensuring end-to-end security at both layers.

This is enabled by default via the `forward_pkce` parameter and works seamlessly with providers like Google, Azure AD, and GitHub. Only disable it for legacy providers that don't support PKCE:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Disable PKCE forwarding only if upstream doesn't support it
auth = OAuthProxy(
    ...,
    forward_pkce=False  # Default is True
)
```

### Redirect URI Validation

While the OAuth proxy accepts all redirect URIs by default (for DCR compatibility), you can restrict which clients can connect by specifying allowed patterns:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Allow only localhost clients (common for development)
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # ... other parameters ...
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=[
        "http://localhost:*",
        "http://127.0.0.1:*"
    ]
)

# Allow specific known clients
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # ... other parameters ...
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=[
        "http://localhost:*",
        "https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback",
        "https://*.mycompany.com/auth/*"  # Wildcard patterns supported
    ]
)
```

Check your server logs for "Client registered with redirect\_uri" messages to identify what URLs your clients use.

## Security

### Key and Storage Management

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

The OAuth proxy requires cryptographic keys for JWT signing and storage encryption, plus persistent storage to maintain valid tokens across server restarts.

**Default behavior (appropriate for development only):**

* **Mac/Windows**: FastMCP automatically generates keys and stores them in your system keyring. Storage defaults to disk. Tokens survive server restarts. This is **only** suitable for development and local testing.
* **Linux**: Keys are ephemeral (random salt at startup). Storage defaults to memory. Tokens become invalid on server restart.

**For production:**
Configure the following parameters together: provide a unique `jwt_signing_key` (for signing FastMCP JWTs), and a shared `client_storage` backend (for storing tokens). Both are required for production deployments. Use a network-accessible storage backend like Redis or DynamoDB rather than local disk storage. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** (see the `client_storage` parameter documentation above for examples). The keys accept any secret string and derive proper cryptographic keys using HKDF. See [OAuth Token Security](/deployment/http#oauth-token-security) and [Storage Backends](/servers/storage-backends) for complete production setup.

### Confused Deputy Attacks

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

A confused deputy attack allows a malicious client to steal your authorization by tricking you into granting it access under your identity.

The OAuth proxy works by bridging DCR clients to traditional auth providers, which means that multiple MCP clients connect through a single upstream OAuth application. An attacker can exploit this shared application by registering a malicious client with their own redirect URI, then sending you an authorization link. When you click it, your browser goes through the OAuth flow—but since you may have already authorized this OAuth app before, the provider might auto-approve the request. The authorization code then gets sent to the attacker's redirect URI instead of a legitimate client, giving them access under your credentials.

#### Mitigation

FastMCP's OAuth proxy requires you to explicitly consent whenever any new or unrecognized client attempts to connect to your server. Before any authorization happens, you see a consent page showing the client's details, redirect URI, and requested scopes. This gives you the opportunity to review and deny suspicious requests. Once you approve a client, it's remembered so you don't see the consent page again for that client. The consent mechanism is implemented with CSRF tokens and cryptographically signed cookies to prevent tampering.

The consent page automatically displays your server's name, icon, and website URL, if available. These visual identifiers help users confirm they're authorizing the correct server.

## Environment Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, configure the OAuth proxy through environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Specify the provider implementation
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider

# Provider-specific credentials
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="Ov23li..."
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="abc123..."
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL="https://your-production-server.com"
```

With environment configuration, your server code simplifies to:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server")

@mcp.tool
def protected_tool(data: str) -> str:
    """This tool is now protected by OAuth."""
    return f"Processed: {data}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```


# OIDC Proxy
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oidc-proxy

Bridge OIDC providers to work seamlessly with MCP's authentication flow.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.12.4" />

The OIDC proxy enables FastMCP servers to authenticate with OIDC providers that **don't support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)** out of the box. This includes OAuth providers like: Auth0, Google, Azure, AWS, etc. For providers that do support DCR (like WorkOS AuthKit), use [`RemoteAuthProvider`](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) instead.

The OIDC proxy is built upon [`OAuthProxy`](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) so it has all the same functionality under the covers.

## Implementation

### Provider Setup Requirements

Before using the OIDC proxy, you need to register your application with your OAuth provider:

1. **Register your application** in the provider's developer console (Auth0 Applications, Google Cloud Console, Azure Portal, etc.)
2. **Configure the redirect URI** as your FastMCP server URL plus your chosen callback path:
   * Default: `https://your-server.com/auth/callback`
   * Custom: `https://your-server.com/your/custom/path` (if you set `redirect_path`)
   * Development: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`
3. **Obtain your credentials**: Client ID and Client Secret

<Warning>
  The redirect URI you configure with your provider must exactly match your
  FastMCP server's URL plus the callback path. If you customize `redirect_path`
  in the OIDC proxy, update your provider's redirect URI accordingly.
</Warning>

### Basic Setup

Here's how to implement the OIDC proxy with any provider:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.oidc_proxy import OIDCProxy

# Create the OIDC proxy
auth = OIDCProxy(
    # Provider's configuration URL
    config_url="https://provider.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",

    # Your registered app credentials
    client_id="your-client-id",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",

    # Your FastMCP server's public URL
    base_url="https://your-server.com",

    # Optional: customize the callback path (default is "/auth/callback")
    # redirect_path="/custom/callback",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

### Configuration Parameters

<Card icon="code" title="OIDCProxy Parameters">
  <ParamField body="config_url" type="str" required>
    URL of your OAuth provider's OIDC configuration
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="client_id" type="str" required>

    Client secret from your registered OAuth application
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="base_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str" required>
    Public URL of your FastMCP server (e.g., `https://your-server.com`)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="strict" type="bool | None">
    Strict flag for configuration validation. When True, requires all OIDC
    mandatory fields.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="audience" type="str | None">
    Audience parameter for OIDC providers that require it (e.g., Auth0). This is
    typically your API identifier.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="timeout_seconds" type="int | None" default="10">
    HTTP request timeout in seconds for fetching OIDC configuration
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="token_verifier" type="TokenVerifier | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

    Custom token verifier for validating tokens. When provided, FastMCP uses your custom verifier instead of creating a default `JWTVerifier`.

    Cannot be used with `algorithm` or `required_scopes` parameters - configure these on your verifier instead. The verifier's `required_scopes` are automatically loaded and advertised.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="algorithm" type="str | None">
    JWT algorithm to use for token verification (e.g., "RS256"). If not specified,
    uses the provider's default. Only used when `token_verifier` is not provided.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="required_scopes" type="list[str] | None">
    List of OAuth scopes for token validation. These are automatically
    included in authorization requests. Only used when `token_verifier` is not provided.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="redirect_path" type="str" default="/auth/callback">
    Path for OAuth callbacks. Must match the redirect URI configured in your OAuth
    application
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="allowed_client_redirect_uris" type="list[str] | None">
    List of allowed redirect URI patterns for MCP clients. Patterns support wildcards (e.g., `"http://localhost:*"`, `"https://*.example.com/*"`).

    * `None` (default): All redirect URIs allowed (for MCP/DCR compatibility)
    * Empty list `[]`: No redirect URIs allowed
    * Custom list: Only matching patterns allowed

    These patterns apply to MCP client loopback redirects, NOT the upstream OAuth app redirect URI.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="token_endpoint_auth_method" type="str | None">
    Token endpoint authentication method for the upstream OAuth server. Controls how the proxy authenticates when exchanging authorization codes and refresh tokens with the upstream provider.

    * `"client_secret_basic"`: Send credentials in Authorization header (most common)
    * `"client_secret_post"`: Send credentials in request body (required by some providers)
    * `"none"`: No authentication (for public clients)
    * `None` (default): Uses authlib's default (typically `"client_secret_basic"`)

    Set this if your provider requires a specific authentication method and the default doesn't work.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="jwt_signing_key" type="str | bytes | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

    Secret used to sign FastMCP JWT tokens issued to clients. Accepts any string or bytes - will be derived into a proper 32-byte cryptographic key using HKDF.

    **Default behavior (`None`):**

    * **Mac/Windows**: Auto-managed via system keyring. Keys are generated once and persisted, surviving server restarts with zero configuration. Keys are automatically derived from server attributes, so this approach, while convenient, is **only** suitable for development and local testing. For production, you must provide an explicit secret.
    * **Linux**: Ephemeral (random salt at startup). Tokens become invalid on server restart, triggering client re-authentication.

    **For production:**
    Provide an explicit secret (e.g., from environment variable) to use a fixed key instead of the auto-generated one.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="client_storage" type="AsyncKeyValue | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

    Storage backend for persisting OAuth client registrations and upstream tokens.

    **Default behavior:**

    * **Mac/Windows**: Encrypted DiskStore in your platform's data directory (derived from `platformdirs`)
    * **Linux**: MemoryStore (ephemeral - clients lost on restart)

    By default on Mac/Windows, clients are automatically persisted to encrypted disk storage, allowing them to survive server restarts as long as the filesystem remains accessible. This means MCP clients only need to register once and can reconnect seamlessly. On Linux where keyring isn't available, ephemeral storage is used to match the ephemeral key strategy.

    For production deployments with multiple servers or cloud deployments, use a network-accessible storage backend rather than local disk storage. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest.** See [Storage Backends](/servers/storage-backends) for available options.

    Testing with in-memory storage (unencrypted):

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from key_value.aio.stores.memory import MemoryStore

    # Use in-memory storage for testing (clients lost on restart)
    auth = OIDCProxy(..., client_storage=MemoryStore())
    ```

    Production with encrypted Redis storage:

    ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
    from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    import os

    auth = OIDCProxy(
        ...,
        jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
        client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
            key_value=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379),
            fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
        )
    )
    ```
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Using Built-in Providers

FastMCP includes pre-configured OIDC providers for common services:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.auth0 import Auth0Provider

auth = Auth0Provider(
    config_url="https://.../.well-known/openid-configuration",
    client_id="your-auth0-client-id",
    client_secret="your-auth0-client-secret",
    audience="https://...",
    base_url="https://localhost:8000"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

Available providers include `Auth0Provider` at present.

### Scope Configuration

OAuth scopes are configured with `required_scopes` to automatically request the permissions your application needs.

Dynamic clients created by the proxy will automatically include these scopes in their authorization requests.

## Environment Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

For production deployments, configure the OIDC proxy through environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Specify the provider implementation
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.auth0.Auth0Provider

# Provider-specific credentials
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTH0_CONFIG_URL=https://.../.well-known/openid-configuration
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=tv2ObNgaZAWWhhycr7Bz1LU2mxlnsmsB
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=vPYqbjemq...
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://...
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_AUTH0_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8000
```

With environment configuration, your server code simplifies to:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server")

@mcp.tool
def protected_tool(data: str) -> str:
    """This tool is now protected by OAuth."""
    return f"Processed: {data}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```


# Remote OAuth
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/remote-oauth

Integrate your FastMCP server with external identity providers like Descope, WorkOS, Auth0, and corporate SSO systems.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

Remote OAuth integration allows your FastMCP server to leverage external identity providers that **support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**. With DCR, MCP clients can automatically register themselves with the identity provider and obtain credentials without any manual configuration. This provides enterprise-grade authentication with fully automated flows, making it ideal for production applications with modern identity providers.

<Tip>
  **When to use RemoteAuthProvider vs OAuth Proxy:**

  * **RemoteAuthProvider**: For providers WITH Dynamic Client Registration (Descope, WorkOS AuthKit, modern OIDC providers)
  * **OAuth Proxy**: For providers WITHOUT Dynamic Client Registration (GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, Discord, etc.)

  RemoteAuthProvider requires DCR support for fully automated client registration and authentication.
</Tip>

## DCR-Enabled Providers

RemoteAuthProvider works with identity providers that support **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)** - a critical capability that enables automated authentication flows:

| Feature                 | DCR Providers (RemoteAuth)           | Non-DCR Providers (OAuth Proxy)           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Client Registration** | Automatic via API                    | Manual in provider console                |
| **Credentials**         | Dynamic per client                   | Fixed app credentials                     |
| **Configuration**       | Zero client config                   | Pre-shared credentials                    |
| **Examples**            | Descope, WorkOS AuthKit, modern OIDC | GitHub, Google, Azure                     |
| **FastMCP Class**       | `RemoteAuthProvider`                 | [`OAuthProxy`](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) |

If your provider doesn't support DCR (most traditional OAuth providers), you'll need to use [`OAuth Proxy`](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) instead, which bridges the gap between MCP's DCR expectations and fixed OAuth credentials.

## The Remote OAuth Challenge

Traditional OAuth flows assume human users with web browsers who can interact with login forms, consent screens, and redirects. MCP clients operate differently - they're often automated systems that need to authenticate programmatically without human intervention.

This creates several unique requirements that standard OAuth implementations don't address well:

**Automatic Discovery**: MCP clients must discover authentication requirements by examining server metadata rather than encountering HTTP redirects. They need to know which identity provider to use and how to reach it before making any authenticated requests.

**Programmatic Registration**: Clients need to register themselves with identity providers automatically. Manual client registration doesn't work when clients might be dynamically created tools or services.

**Seamless Token Management**: Clients must obtain, store, and refresh tokens without user interaction. The authentication flow needs to work in headless environments where no human is available to complete OAuth consent flows.

**Protocol Integration**: The authentication process must integrate cleanly with MCP's JSON-RPC transport layer and error handling mechanisms.

These requirements mean that your MCP server needs to do more than just validate tokens - it needs to provide discovery metadata that enables MCP clients to understand and navigate your authentication requirements automatically.

## MCP Authentication Discovery

MCP authentication discovery relies on well-known endpoints that clients can examine to understand your authentication requirements. Your server becomes a bridge between MCP clients and your chosen identity provider.

The core discovery endpoint is `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, which tells clients that your server requires OAuth authentication and identifies the authorization servers you trust. This endpoint contains static metadata that points clients to your identity provider without requiring any dynamic lookups.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant FastMCPServer as FastMCP Server
    participant ExternalIdP as Identity Provider

    Client->>FastMCPServer: 1. GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
    FastMCPServer-->>Client: 2. "Use https://my-idp.com for auth"
    
    note over Client, ExternalIdP: Client goes directly to the IdP
    Client->>ExternalIdP: 3. Authenticate & get token via DCR
    ExternalIdP-->>Client: 4. Access token
    
    Client->>FastMCPServer: 5. MCP request with Bearer token
    FastMCPServer->>FastMCPServer: 6. Verify token signature
    FastMCPServer-->>Client: 7. MCP response
```

This flow separates concerns cleanly: your MCP server handles resource protection and token validation, while your identity provider handles user authentication and token issuance. The client coordinates between these systems using standardized OAuth discovery mechanisms.

## FastMCP Remote Authentication

<VersionBadge version="2.11.1" />

FastMCP provides `RemoteAuthProvider` to handle the complexities of remote OAuth integration. This class combines token validation capabilities with the OAuth discovery metadata that MCP clients require.

### RemoteAuthProvider

`RemoteAuthProvider` works by composing a [`TokenVerifier`](/servers/auth/token-verification) with authorization server information. A `TokenVerifier` is another FastMCP authentication class that focuses solely on token validation - signature verification, expiration checking, and claim extraction. The `RemoteAuthProvider` takes that token validation capability and adds the OAuth discovery endpoints that enable MCP clients to automatically find and authenticate with your identity provider.

This composition pattern means you can use any token validation strategy while maintaining consistent OAuth discovery behavior:

* **JWT tokens**: Use `JWTVerifier` for self-contained tokens
* **Opaque tokens**: Use `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` for RFC 7662 introspection
* **Custom validation**: Implement your own `TokenVerifier` subclass

The separation allows you to change token validation approaches without affecting the client discovery experience.

The class automatically generates the required OAuth metadata endpoints using the MCP SDK's standardized route creation functions. This ensures compatibility with MCP clients while reducing the implementation complexity for server developers.

### Basic Implementation

Most applications can use `RemoteAuthProvider` directly without subclassing. The implementation requires a `TokenVerifier` instance, a list of trusted authorization servers, and your server's URL for metadata generation.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import RemoteAuthProvider
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier
from pydantic import AnyHttpUrl

# Configure token validation for your identity provider
token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://auth.yourcompany.com",
    audience="mcp-production-api"
)

# Create the remote auth provider
auth = RemoteAuthProvider(
    token_verifier=token_verifier,
    authorization_servers=[AnyHttpUrl("https://auth.yourcompany.com")],
    base_url="https://api.yourcompany.com",  # Your server base URL
    # Optional: customize allowed client redirect URIs (defaults to localhost only)
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=["http://localhost:*", "http://127.0.0.1:*"]
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Company API", auth=auth)
```

This configuration creates a server that accepts tokens issued by `auth.yourcompany.com` and provides the OAuth discovery metadata that MCP clients need. The `JWTVerifier` handles token validation using your identity provider's public keys, while the `RemoteAuthProvider` generates the required OAuth endpoints.

The `authorization_servers` list tells MCP clients which identity providers you trust. The `base_url` identifies your server in OAuth metadata, enabling proper token audience validation. **Important**: The `base_url` should point to your server base URL - for example, if your MCP server is accessible at `https://api.yourcompany.com/mcp`, use `https://api.yourcompany.com` as the base URL.

### Custom Endpoints

You can extend `RemoteAuthProvider` to add additional endpoints beyond the standard OAuth protected resource metadata. These don't have to be OAuth-specific - you can add any endpoints your authentication integration requires.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import httpx
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.routing import Route

class CompanyAuthProvider(RemoteAuthProvider):
    def __init__(self):
        token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
            jwks_uri="https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
            issuer="https://auth.yourcompany.com",
            audience="mcp-production-api"
        )
        
        super().__init__(
            token_verifier=token_verifier,
            authorization_servers=[AnyHttpUrl("https://auth.yourcompany.com")],
            base_url="https://api.yourcompany.com"  # Your server base URL
        )
    
    def get_routes(self) -> list[Route]:
        """Add custom endpoints to the standard protected resource routes."""
        
        # Get the standard OAuth protected resource routes
        routes = super().get_routes()
        
        # Add authorization server metadata forwarding for client convenience
        async def authorization_server_metadata(request):
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(
                    "https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server"
                )
                response.raise_for_status()
                return JSONResponse(response.json())
        
        routes.append(
            Route("/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server", authorization_server_metadata)
        )
        
        return routes

mcp = FastMCP(name="Company API", auth=CompanyAuthProvider())
```

This pattern uses `super().get_routes()` to get the standard protected resource routes, then adds additional endpoints as needed. A common use case is providing authorization server metadata forwarding, which allows MCP clients to discover your identity provider's capabilities through your MCP server rather than contacting the identity provider directly.

## WorkOS AuthKit Integration

WorkOS AuthKit provides an excellent example of remote OAuth integration. The `AuthKitProvider` demonstrates how to implement both token validation and OAuth metadata forwarding in a production-ready package.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import AuthKitProvider

auth = AuthKitProvider(
    authkit_domain="https://your-project.authkit.app",
    base_url="https://your-mcp-server.com"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected Application", auth=auth)
```

The `AuthKitProvider` automatically configures JWT validation against WorkOS's public keys and provides both protected resource metadata and authorization server metadata forwarding. This implementation handles the complete remote OAuth integration with minimal configuration.

WorkOS's support for Dynamic Client Registration makes it particularly well-suited for MCP applications. Clients can automatically register themselves with your WorkOS project and obtain the credentials needed for authentication without manual intervention.

→ **Complete WorkOS tutorial**: [AuthKit Integration Guide](/integrations/authkit)

## Client Redirect URI Security

<Note>
  `RemoteAuthProvider` also supports the `allowed_client_redirect_uris` parameter for controlling which redirect URIs are accepted from MCP clients during DCR:

  * `None` (default): Only localhost patterns allowed
  * Custom list: Specify allowed patterns with wildcard support
  * Empty list `[]`: Allow all (not recommended)

  This provides defense-in-depth even though DCR providers typically validate redirect URIs themselves.

## Implementation Considerations

Remote OAuth integration requires careful attention to several technical details that affect reliability and security.

**Token Validation Performance**: Your server validates every incoming token by checking signatures against your identity provider's public keys. Consider implementing key caching and rotation handling to minimize latency while maintaining security.

**Error Handling**: Network issues with your identity provider can affect token validation. Implement appropriate timeouts, retry logic, and graceful degradation to maintain service availability during identity provider outages.

**Audience Validation**: Ensure that tokens intended for your server are not accepted by other applications. Proper audience validation prevents token misuse across different services in your ecosystem.

**Scope Management**: Map token scopes to your application's permission model consistently. Consider how scope changes affect existing tokens and plan for smooth permission updates.

The complexity of these considerations reinforces why external identity providers are recommended over custom OAuth implementations. Established providers handle these technical details with extensive testing and operational experience.


# Token Verification

Protect your server by validating bearer tokens issued by external systems.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span>

        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

Token verification enables your FastMCP server to validate bearer tokens issued by external systems without participating in user authentication flows. Your server acts as a pure resource server, focusing on token validation and authorization decisions while delegating identity management to other systems in your infrastructure.

<Note>
  Token verification operates somewhat outside the formal MCP authentication flow, which expects OAuth-style discovery. It's best suited for internal systems, microservices architectures, or when you have full control over token generation and distribution.
</Note>

## Understanding Token Verification

Token verification addresses scenarios where authentication responsibility is distributed across multiple systems. Your MCP server receives structured tokens containing identity and authorization information, validates their authenticity, and makes access control decisions based on their contents.

This pattern emerges naturally in microservices architectures where a central authentication service issues tokens that multiple downstream services validate independently. It also works well when integrating MCP servers into existing systems that already have established token-based authentication mechanisms.

### The Token Verification Model

Token verification treats your MCP server as a resource server in OAuth terminology. The key insight is that token validation and token issuance are separate concerns that can be handled by different systems.

**Token Issuance**: Another system (API gateway, authentication service, or identity provider) handles user authentication and creates signed tokens containing identity and permission information.

**Token Validation**: Your MCP server receives these tokens, verifies their authenticity using cryptographic signatures, and extracts authorization information from their claims.

**Access Control**: Based on token contents, your server determines what resources, tools, and prompts the client can access.

This separation allows your MCP server to focus on its core functionality while leveraging existing authentication infrastructure. The token acts as a portable proof of identity that travels with each request.

### Token Security Considerations

Token-based authentication relies on cryptographic signatures to ensure token integrity. Your MCP server validates tokens using public keys corresponding to the private keys used for token creation. This asymmetric approach means your server never needs access to signing secrets.

Token validation must address several security requirements: signature verification ensures tokens haven't been tampered with, expiration checking prevents use of stale tokens, and audience validation ensures tokens intended for your server aren't accepted by other systems.

The challenge in MCP environments is that clients need to obtain valid tokens before making requests, but the MCP protocol doesn't provide built-in discovery mechanisms for token endpoints. Clients must obtain tokens through separate channels or prior configuration.

## TokenVerifier Class

FastMCP provides the `TokenVerifier` class to handle token validation complexity while remaining flexible about token sources and validation strategies.

`TokenVerifier` focuses exclusively on token validation without providing OAuth discovery metadata. This makes it ideal for internal systems where clients already know how to obtain tokens, or for microservices that trust tokens from known issuers.

The class validates token signatures, checks expiration timestamps, and extracts authorization information from token claims. It supports various token formats and validation strategies while maintaining a consistent interface for authorization decisions.

You can subclass `TokenVerifier` to implement custom validation logic for specialized token formats or validation requirements. The base class handles common patterns while allowing extension for unique use cases.

## JWT Token Verification

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) represent the most common token format for modern applications. FastMCP's `JWTVerifier` validates JWTs using industry-standard cryptographic techniques and claim validation.

### JWKS Endpoint Integration

JWKS endpoint integration provides the most flexible approach for production systems. The verifier automatically fetches public keys from a JSON Web Key Set endpoint, enabling automatic key rotation without server configuration changes.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

# Configure JWT verification against your identity provider
verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://auth.yourcompany.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://auth.yourcompany.com",
    audience="mcp-production-api"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected API", auth=verifier)
```

This configuration creates a server that validates JWTs issued by `auth.yourcompany.com`. The verifier periodically fetches public keys from the JWKS endpoint and validates incoming tokens against those keys. Only tokens with the correct issuer and audience claims will be accepted.

The `issuer` parameter ensures tokens come from your trusted authentication system, while `audience` validation prevents tokens intended for other services from being accepted by your MCP server.

### Symmetric Key Verification (HMAC)

Symmetric key verification uses a shared secret for both signing and validation, making it ideal for internal microservices and trusted environments where the same secret can be securely distributed to both token issuers and validators.

This approach is commonly used in microservices architectures where services share a secret key, or when your authentication service and MCP server are both managed by the same organization. The HMAC algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512) provide strong security when the shared secret is properly managed.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

# Use a shared secret for symmetric key verification
verifier = JWTVerifier(
    public_key="your-shared-secret-key-minimum-32-chars",  # Despite the name, this accepts symmetric secrets
    issuer="internal-auth-service",
    audience="mcp-internal-api",
    algorithm="HS256"  # or HS384, HS512 for stronger security
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Internal API", auth=verifier)
```

The verifier will validate tokens signed with the same secret using the specified HMAC algorithm. This approach offers several advantages for internal systems:

* **Simplicity**: No key pair management or certificate distribution
* **Performance**: HMAC operations are typically faster than RSA
* **Compatibility**: Works well with existing microservice authentication patterns

<Note>
  The parameter is named `public_key` for backwards compatibility, but when using HMAC algorithms (HS256/384/512), it accepts the symmetric secret string.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Security Considerations for Symmetric Keys:**

  * Use a strong, randomly generated secret (minimum 32 characters recommended)
  * Never expose the secret in logs, error messages, or version control
  * Implement secure key distribution and rotation mechanisms
  * Consider using asymmetric keys (RSA/ECDSA) for external-facing APIs
</Warning>

### Static Public Key Verification

Static public key verification works when you have a fixed RSA or ECDSA signing key and don't need automatic key rotation. This approach is primarily useful for development environments or controlled deployments where JWKS endpoints aren't available.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

# Use a static public key for token verification
public_key_pem = """-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"""

verifier = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=public_key_pem,
    issuer="https://auth.yourcompany.com",
    audience="mcp-production-api"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected API", auth=verifier)
```

This configuration validates tokens using a specific RSA or ECDSA public key. The key must correspond to the private key used by your token issuer. While less flexible than JWKS endpoints, this approach can be useful in development environments or when testing with fixed keys.

## Opaque Token Verification

Many authorization servers issue opaque tokens rather than self-contained JWTs. Opaque tokens are random strings that carry no information themselves - the authorization server maintains their state and validation requires querying the server. FastMCP supports opaque token validation through OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662).

### Understanding Opaque Tokens

Opaque tokens differ fundamentally from JWTs in their verification model. Where JWTs carry signed claims that can be validated locally, opaque tokens require network calls to the issuing authorization server for validation. The authorization server maintains token state and can revoke tokens immediately, providing stronger security guarantees for sensitive operations.

This approach trades performance (network latency on each validation) for security and flexibility. Authorization servers can revoke opaque tokens instantly, implement complex authorization logic, and maintain detailed audit logs of token usage. Many enterprise OAuth providers default to opaque tokens for these security advantages.

### Token Introspection Protocol

RFC 7662 standardizes how resource servers validate opaque tokens. The protocol defines an introspection endpoint where resource servers authenticate using client credentials and receive token metadata including active status, scopes, expiration, and subject identity.

FastMCP implements this protocol through the `IntrospectionTokenVerifier` class, handling authentication, request formatting, and response parsing according to the specification.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.introspection import IntrospectionTokenVerifier

# Configure introspection with your OAuth provider
verifier = IntrospectionTokenVerifier(
    introspection_url="https://auth.yourcompany.com/oauth/introspect",
    client_id="mcp-resource-server",
    client_secret="your-client-secret",
    required_scopes=["api:read", "api:write"]
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected API", auth=verifier)
```

The verifier authenticates to the introspection endpoint using HTTP Basic Auth with your client credentials. When a request arrives with a bearer token, FastMCP queries the introspection endpoint to determine if the token is active and has sufficient scopes.

## Development and Testing

Development environments often need simpler token management without the complexity of full JWT infrastructure. FastMCP provides tools specifically designed for these scenarios.

### Static Token Verification

Static token verification enables rapid development by accepting predefined tokens with associated claims. This approach eliminates the need for token generation infrastructure during development and testing.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import StaticTokenVerifier

# Define development tokens and their associated claims
verifier = StaticTokenVerifier(
    tokens={
        "dev-alice-token": {
            "client_id": "alice@company.com",
            "scopes": ["read:data", "write:data", "admin:users"]
        },
        "dev-guest-token": {
            "client_id": "guest-user",
            "scopes": ["read:data"]
        }
    },
    required_scopes=["read:data"]
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Development Server", auth=verifier)
```

Clients can now authenticate using `Authorization: Bearer dev-alice-token` headers. The server will recognize the token and load the associated claims for authorization decisions. This approach enables immediate development without external dependencies.

<Warning>
  Static token verification stores tokens as plain text and should never be used in production environments. It's designed exclusively for development and testing scenarios.
</Warning>

### Debug/Custom Token Verification

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

The `DebugTokenVerifier` provides maximum flexibility for testing and special cases where standard token verification isn't applicable. It delegates validation to a user-provided callable, making it useful for prototyping, testing scenarios, or handling opaque tokens without introspection endpoints.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.debug import DebugTokenVerifier

# Accept all tokens (useful for rapid development)
verifier = DebugTokenVerifier()

mcp = FastMCP(name="Development Server", auth=verifier)
```

By default, `DebugTokenVerifier` accepts any non-empty token as valid. This eliminates authentication barriers during early development, allowing you to focus on core functionality before adding security.

For more controlled testing, provide custom validation logic:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.debug import DebugTokenVerifier

# Synchronous validation - check token prefix
verifier = DebugTokenVerifier(
    validate=lambda token: token.startswith("dev-"),
    client_id="development-client",
    scopes=["read", "write"]
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Development Server", auth=verifier)
```

The validation callable can also be async, enabling database lookups or external service calls:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.debug import DebugTokenVerifier

# Asynchronous validation - check against cache
async def validate_token(token: str) -> bool:
    # Check if token exists in Redis, database, etc.
    return await redis.exists(f"valid_tokens:{token}")

verifier = DebugTokenVerifier(
    validate=validate_token,
    client_id="api-client",
    scopes=["api:access"]
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Custom API", auth=verifier)
```

**Use Cases:**

* **Testing**: Accept any token during integration tests without setting up token infrastructure
* **Prototyping**: Quickly validate concepts without authentication complexity
* **Opaque tokens without introspection**: When you have tokens from an IDP that provides no introspection endpoint, and you're willing to accept tokens without validation (validation happens later at the upstream service)
* **Custom token formats**: Implement validation for non-standard token formats or legacy systems

<Warning>
  `DebugTokenVerifier` bypasses standard security checks. Only use in controlled environments (development, testing) or when you fully understand the security implications. For production, use proper JWT or introspection-based verification.
</Warning>

### Test Token Generation

Test token generation helps when you need to test JWT verification without setting up complete identity infrastructure. FastMCP includes utilities for generating test key pairs and signed tokens.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier, RSAKeyPair

# Generate a key pair for testing
key_pair = RSAKeyPair.generate()

# Configure your server with the public key
verifier = JWTVerifier(
    public_key=key_pair.public_key,
    issuer="https://test.yourcompany.com",
    audience="test-mcp-server"
)

# Generate a test token using the private key
test_token = key_pair.create_token(
    subject="test-user-123",
    issuer="https://test.yourcompany.com", 
    audience="test-mcp-server",
    scopes=["read", "write", "admin"]
)

print(f"Test token: {test_token}")
```

This pattern enables comprehensive testing of JWT validation logic without depending on external token issuers. The generated tokens are cryptographically valid and will pass all standard JWT validation checks.

## Environment Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

FastMCP supports both programmatic and environment-based configuration for token verification, enabling flexible deployment across different environments.

Environment-based configuration separates authentication settings from application code, following twelve-factor app principles and simplifying deployment pipelines.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Enable JWT verification
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt.JWTVerifier

# For asymmetric verification with JWKS endpoint:
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_JWKS_URI="https://auth.company.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_ISSUER="https://auth.company.com"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE="mcp-production-api"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_REQUIRED_SCOPES="read:data,write:data"

# OR for symmetric key verification (HMAC):
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="your-shared-secret-key-minimum-32-chars"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"  # or HS384, HS512
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_ISSUER="internal-auth-service"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE="mcp-internal-api"
```

With these environment variables configured, your FastMCP server automatically enables JWT verification:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="Production API")
```

This approach enables the same codebase to run across development, staging, and production environments with different authentication requirements. Development might use static tokens while production uses JWT verification, all controlled through environment configuration.


# Server Composition
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/composition

Combine multiple FastMCP servers into a single, larger application using mounting and importing.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

As your MCP applications grow, you might want to organize your tools, resources, and prompts into logical modules or reuse existing server components. FastMCP supports composition through two methods:

* **`import_server`**: For a one-time copy of components with prefixing (static composition).
* **`mount`**: For creating a live link where the main server delegates requests to the subserver (dynamic composition).

## Why Compose Servers?

* **Modularity**: Break down large applications into smaller, focused servers (e.g., a `WeatherServer`, a `DatabaseServer`, a `CalendarServer`).
* **Reusability**: Create common utility servers (e.g., a `TextProcessingServer`) and mount them wherever needed.
* **Teamwork**: Different teams can work on separate FastMCP servers that are later combined.
* **Organization**: Keep related functionality grouped together logically.

### Importing vs Mounting

The choice of importing or mounting depends on your use case and requirements.

| Feature              | Importing                                                  | Mounting                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**           | `FastMCP.import_server(server, prefix=None)`               | `FastMCP.mount(server, prefix=None)`        |
| **Composition Type** | One-time copy (static)                                     | Live link (dynamic)                         |
| **Updates**          | Changes to subserver NOT reflected                         | Changes to subserver immediately reflected  |
| **Performance**      | Fast - no runtime delegation                               | Slower - affected by slowest mounted server |
| **Prefix**           | Optional - omit for original names                         | Optional - omit for original names          |
| **Best For**         | Bundling finalized components, performance-critical setups | Modular runtime composition                 |

### Proxy Servers

FastMCP supports [MCP proxying](/servers/proxy), which allows you to mirror a local or remote server in a local FastMCP instance. Proxies are fully compatible with both importing and mounting.

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

You can also create proxies from configuration dictionaries that follow the MCPConfig schema, which is useful for quickly connecting to one or more remote servers. See the [Proxy Servers documentation](/servers/proxy#configuration-based-proxies) for details on configuration-based proxying. Note that MCPConfig follows an emerging standard and its format may evolve over time.

Prefixing rules for tools, prompts, resources, and templates are identical across importing, mounting, and proxies.

## Importing (Static Composition)

The `import_server()` method copies all components (tools, resources, templates, prompts) from one `FastMCP` instance (the *subserver*) into another (the *main server*). An optional `prefix` can be provided to avoid naming conflicts. If no prefix is provided, components are imported without modification. When multiple servers are imported with the same prefix (or no prefix), the most recently imported server's components take precedence.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

# Define subservers
weather_mcp = FastMCP(name="WeatherService")

@weather_mcp.tool
def get_forecast(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get weather forecast."""
    return {"city": city, "forecast": "Sunny"}

@weather_mcp.resource("data://cities/supported")
def list_supported_cities() -> list[str]:
    """List cities with weather support."""
    return ["London", "Paris", "Tokyo"]

# Define main server
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainApp")

# Import subserver
async def setup():
    await main_mcp.import_server(weather_mcp, prefix="weather")

# Result: main_mcp now contains prefixed components:
# - Tool: "weather_get_forecast"
# - Resource: "data://weather/cities/supported" 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(setup())
    main_mcp.run()
```

### How Importing Works

When you call `await main_mcp.import_server(subserver, prefix={whatever})`:

1. **Tools**: All tools from `subserver` are added to `main_mcp` with names prefixed using `{prefix}_`.
   * `subserver.tool(name="my_tool")` becomes `main_mcp.tool(name="{prefix}_my_tool")`.
2. **Resources**: All resources are added with both URIs and names prefixed.
   * URI: `subserver.resource(uri="data://info")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="data://{prefix}/info")`.
   * Name: `resource.name` becomes `"{prefix}_{resource.name}"`.
3. **Resource Templates**: Templates are prefixed similarly to resources.
   * URI: `subserver.resource(uri="data://{id}")` becomes `main_mcp.resource(uri="data://{prefix}/{id}")`.
   * Name: `template.name` becomes `"{prefix}_{template.name}"`.
4. **Prompts**: All prompts are added with names prefixed using `{prefix}_`.
   * `subserver.prompt(name="my_prompt")` becomes `main_mcp.prompt(name="{prefix}_my_prompt")`.

Note that `import_server` performs a **one-time copy** of components. Changes made to the `subserver` *after* importing **will not** be reflected in `main_mcp`. The `subserver`'s `lifespan` context is also **not** executed by the main server.

<Tip>
  The `prefix` parameter is optional. If omitted, components are imported without modification.
</Tip>

#### Importing Without Prefixes

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

You can also import servers without specifying a prefix, which copies components using their original names:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}

from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

# Define subservers
weather_mcp = FastMCP(name="WeatherService")

@weather_mcp.tool
def get_forecast(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get weather forecast."""
    return {"city": city, "forecast": "Sunny"}

@weather_mcp.resource("data://cities/supported")
def list_supported_cities() -> list[str]:
    """List cities with weather support."""
    return ["London", "Paris", "Tokyo"]

# Define main server
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainApp")

# Import subserver
async def setup():
    # Import without prefix - components keep original names
    await main_mcp.import_server(weather_mcp)

# Result: main_mcp now contains:
# - Tool: "get_forecast" (original name preserved)
# - Resource: "data://cities/supported" (original URI preserved)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(setup())
    main_mcp.run()
```

#### Conflict Resolution

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

When importing multiple servers with the same prefix, or no prefix, components from the **most recently imported** server take precedence.

## Mounting (Live Linking)

The `mount()` method creates a **live link** between the `main_mcp` server and the `subserver`. Instead of copying components, requests for components matching the optional `prefix` are **delegated** to the `subserver` at runtime. If no prefix is provided, the subserver's components are accessible without prefixing. When multiple servers are mounted with the same prefix (or no prefix), the most recently mounted server takes precedence for conflicting component names.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# Define subserver
dynamic_mcp = FastMCP(name="DynamicService")

@dynamic_mcp.tool
def initial_tool():
    """Initial tool demonstration."""
    return "Initial Tool Exists"

# Mount subserver (synchronous operation)
main_mcp = FastMCP(name="MainAppLive")
main_mcp.mount(dynamic_mcp, prefix="dynamic")

# Add a tool AFTER mounting - it will be accessible through main_mcp
@dynamic_mcp.tool
def added_later():
    """Tool added after mounting."""
    return "Tool Added Dynamically!"

# Testing access to mounted tools
async def test_dynamic_mount():
    tools = await main_mcp.get_tools()
    print("Available tools:", list(tools.keys()))
    # Shows: ['dynamic_initial_tool', 'dynamic_added_later']
    
    async with Client(main_mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("dynamic_added_later")
        print("Result:", result.data)
        # Shows: "Tool Added Dynamically!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_dynamic_mount())
```

### How Mounting Works

When mounting is configured:

1. **Live Link**: The parent server establishes a connection to the mounted server.
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to the mounted server are immediately reflected when accessed through the parent.
3. **Prefixed Access**: The parent server uses prefixes to route requests to the mounted server.
4. **Delegation**: Requests for components matching the prefix are delegated to the mounted server at runtime.

The same prefixing rules apply as with `import_server` for naming tools, resources, templates, and prompts. This includes prefixing both the URIs/keys and the names of resources and templates for better identification in multi-server configurations.

<Tip>
  The `prefix` parameter is optional. If omitted, components are mounted without modification.
</Tip>

#### Performance Considerations

Due to the "live link", operations like `list_tools()` on the parent server will be impacted by the speed of the slowest mounted server. In particular, HTTP-based mounted servers can introduce significant latency (300-400ms vs 1-2ms for local tools), and this slowdown affects the whole server, not just interactions with the HTTP-proxied tools. If performance is important, importing tools via [`import_server()`](#importing-static-composition) may be a more appropriate solution as it copies components once at startup rather than delegating requests at runtime.

#### Mounting Without Prefixes

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

You can also mount servers without specifying a prefix, which makes components accessible without prefixing. This works identically to [importing without prefixes](#importing-without-prefixes), including [conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution).

### Direct vs. Proxy Mounting

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

FastMCP supports two mounting modes:

1. **Direct Mounting** (default): The parent server directly accesses the mounted server's objects in memory.
   * No client lifecycle events occur on the mounted server
   * The mounted server's lifespan context is not executed
   * Communication is handled through direct method calls
2. **Proxy Mounting**: The parent server treats the mounted server as a separate entity and communicates with it through a client interface.
   * Full client lifecycle events occur on the mounted server
   * The mounted server's lifespan is executed when a client connects
   * Communication happens via an in-memory Client transport

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Direct mounting (default when no custom lifespan)
main_mcp.mount(api_server, prefix="api")

# Proxy mounting (preserves full client lifecycle)
main_mcp.mount(api_server, prefix="api", as_proxy=True)

# Mounting without a prefix (components accessible without prefixing)
main_mcp.mount(api_server)
```

FastMCP automatically uses proxy mounting when the mounted server has a custom lifespan, but you can override this behavior with the `as_proxy` parameter.

#### Interaction with Proxy Servers

When using `FastMCP.as_proxy()` to create a proxy server, mounting that server will always use proxy mounting:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Create a proxy for a remote server
remote_proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(Client("http://example.com/mcp"))

# Mount the proxy (always uses proxy mounting)
main_server.mount(remote_proxy, prefix="remote")

## Tag Filtering with Composition

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

When using `include_tags` or `exclude_tags` on a parent server, these filters apply **recursively** to all components, including those from mounted or imported servers. This allows you to control which components are exposed at the parent level, regardless of how your application is composed.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# Create a subserver with tools tagged for different environments
api_server = FastMCP(name="APIServer")

@api_server.tool(tags={"production"})
def prod_endpoint() -> str:
    """Production-ready endpoint."""
    return "Production data"

@api_server.tool(tags={"development"})
def dev_endpoint() -> str:
    """Development-only endpoint."""
    return "Debug data"

# Mount the subserver with production tag filtering at parent level
prod_app = FastMCP(name="ProductionApp", include_tags={"production"})
prod_app.mount(api_server, prefix="api")

# Test the filtering
async def test_filtering():
    async with Client(prod_app) as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        print("Available tools:", [t.name for t in tools])
        # Shows: ['api_prod_endpoint']
        # The 'api_dev_endpoint' is filtered out

        # Calling the filtered tool raises an error
        try:
            await client.call_tool("api_dev_endpoint")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Filtered tool not accessible: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_filtering())
```

### How Recursive Filtering Works

Tag filters apply in the following order:

1. **Child Server Filters**: Each mounted/imported server first applies its own `include_tags`/`exclude_tags` to its components.
2. **Parent Server Filters**: The parent server then applies its own `include_tags`/`exclude_tags` to all components, including those from child servers.

This ensures that parent server tag policies act as a global policy for everything the parent server exposes, no matter how your application is composed.

<Note>
  This filtering applies to both **listing** (e.g., `list_tools()`) and **execution** (e.g., `call_tool()`). Filtered components are neither visible nor executable through the parent server.
</Note>

## Resource Prefix Formats

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

When mounting or importing servers, resource URIs are usually prefixed to avoid naming conflicts. FastMCP supports two different formats for resource prefixes:

### Path Format (Default)

In path format, prefixes are added to the path component of the URI:

```
resource://prefix/path/to/resource
```

This is the default format since FastMCP 2.4. This format is recommended because it avoids issues with URI protocol restrictions (like underscores not being allowed in protocol names).

### Protocol Format (Legacy)

In protocol format, prefixes are added as part of the protocol:

```
prefix+resource://path/to/resource
```

This was the default format in FastMCP before 2.4. While still supported, it's not recommended for new code as it can cause problems with prefix names that aren't valid in URI protocols.

### Configuring the Prefix Format

You can configure the prefix format globally in code:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import fastmcp
fastmcp.settings.resource_prefix_format = "protocol" 
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
FASTMCP_RESOURCE_PREFIX_FORMAT=protocol
```

Or per-server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a server that uses legacy protocol format
server = FastMCP("LegacyServer", resource_prefix_format="protocol")

# Create a server that uses new path format
server = FastMCP("NewServer", resource_prefix_format="path")
```

When mounting or importing servers, the prefix format of the parent server is used.

<Note>
  When mounting servers, custom HTTP routes defined with `@server.custom_route()` are also forwarded to the parent server, making them accessible through the parent's HTTP application.
</Note>


# MCP Context
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context

Access MCP capabilities like logging, progress, and resources within your MCP objects.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

When defining FastMCP [tools](/servers/tools), [resources](/servers/resources), resource templates, or [prompts](/servers/prompts), your functions might need to interact with the underlying MCP session or access advanced server capabilities. FastMCP provides the `Context` object for this purpose.

## What Is Context?

The `Context` object provides a clean interface to access MCP features within your functions, including:

* **Logging**: Send debug, info, warning, and error messages back to the client
* **Progress Reporting**: Update the client on the progress of long-running operations
* **Resource Access**: List and read data from resources registered with the server
* **Prompt Access**: List and retrieve prompts registered with the server
* **LLM Sampling**: Request the client's LLM to generate text based on provided messages
* **User Elicitation**: Request structured input from users during tool execution
* **State Management**: Store and share data between middleware and the handler within a single request
* **Request Information**: Access metadata about the current request
* **Server Access**: When needed, access the underlying FastMCP server instance

## Accessing the Context

### Via Dependency Injection

To use the context object within any of your functions, simply add a parameter to your function signature and type-hint it as `Context`. FastMCP will automatically inject the context instance when your function is called.

**Key Points:**

* The parameter name (e.g., `ctx`, `context`) doesn't matter, only the type hint `Context` is important.
* The context parameter can be placed anywhere in your function's signature; it will not be exposed to MCP clients as a valid parameter.
* The context is optional - functions that don't need it can omit the parameter entirely.
* Context methods are async, so your function usually needs to be async as well.
* The type hint can be a union (`Context | None`) or use `Annotated[]` and it will still work properly.
* **Each MCP request receives a new context object.** Context is scoped to a single request; state or data set in one request will not be available in subsequent requests.
* Context is only available during a request; attempting to use context methods outside a request will raise errors. If you need to debug or call your context methods outside of a request, you can type your variable as `Context | None=None` to avoid missing argument errors.

#### Tools

```python {1, 6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="Context Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def process_file(file_uri: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Processes a file, using context for logging and resource access."""
    # Context is available as the ctx parameter
    return "Processed file"
```

#### Resources and Templates

<VersionBadge version="2.2.5" />

```python {1, 6, 12} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="Context Demo")

@mcp.resource("resource://user-data")
async def get_user_data(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Fetch personalized user data based on the request context."""
    # Context is available as the ctx parameter
    return {"user_id": "example"}

@mcp.resource("resource://users/{user_id}/profile")
async def get_user_profile(user_id: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Fetch user profile with context-aware logging."""
    # Context is available as the ctx parameter
    return {"id": user_id}
```

#### Prompts

<VersionBadge version="2.2.5" />

```python {1, 6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="Context Demo")

@mcp.prompt
async def data_analysis_request(dataset: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generate a request to analyze data with contextual information."""
    # Context is available as the ctx parameter
    return f"Please analyze the following dataset: {dataset}"
```

### Via Runtime Dependency Function

<VersionBadge version="2.2.11" />

While the simplest way to access context is through function parameter injection as shown above, there are cases where you need to access the context in code that may not be easy to modify to accept a context parameter, or that is nested deeper within your function calls.

FastMCP provides dependency functions that allow you to retrieve the active context from anywhere within a server request's execution flow:

```python {2,9} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_context

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dependency Demo")

# Utility function that needs context but doesn't receive it as a parameter
async def process_data(data: list[float]) -> dict:
    # Get the active context - only works when called within a request
    ctx = get_context()    
    await ctx.info(f"Processing {len(data)} data points")
    
@mcp.tool
async def analyze_dataset(dataset_name: str) -> dict:
    # Call utility function that uses context internally
    data = load_data(dataset_name)
    await process_data(data)
```

**Important Notes:**

* The `get_context` function should only be used within the context of a server request. Calling it outside of a request will raise a `RuntimeError`.
* The `get_context` function is server-only and should not be used in client code.

## Context Capabilities

FastMCP provides several advanced capabilities through the context object. Each capability has dedicated documentation with comprehensive examples and best practices:

### Logging

Send debug, info, warning, and error messages back to the MCP client for visibility into function execution.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
await ctx.debug("Starting analysis")
await ctx.info(f"Processing {len(data)} items") 
await ctx.warning("Deprecated parameter used")
await ctx.error("Processing failed")
```

See [Server Logging](/servers/logging) for complete documentation and examples.

### Client Elicitation

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

Request structured input from clients during tool execution, enabling interactive workflows and progressive disclosure. This is a new feature in the 6/18/2025 MCP spec.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
result = await ctx.elicit("Enter your name:", response_type=str)
if result.action == "accept":
    name = result.data
```

See [User Elicitation](/servers/elicitation) for detailed examples and supported response types.

### LLM Sampling

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Request the client's LLM to generate text based on provided messages, useful for leveraging AI capabilities within your tools.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
response = await ctx.sample("Analyze this data", temperature=0.7)
```

See [LLM Sampling](/servers/sampling) for comprehensive usage and advanced techniques.

### Progress Reporting

Update clients on the progress of long-running operations, enabling progress indicators and better user experience.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
await ctx.report_progress(progress=50, total=100)  # 50% complete
```

See [Progress Reporting](/servers/progress) for detailed patterns and examples.

### Resource Access

List and read data from resources registered with your FastMCP server, allowing access to files, configuration, or dynamic content.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# List available resources
resources = await ctx.list_resources()

# Read a specific resource
content_list = await ctx.read_resource("resource://config")
content = content_list[0].content
```

**Method signatures:**

* **`ctx.list_resources() -> list[MCPResource]`**: <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" /> Returns list of all available resources
* **`ctx.read_resource(uri: str | AnyUrl) -> list[ReadResourceContents]`**: Returns a list of resource content parts

### Prompt Access

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

List and retrieve prompts registered with your FastMCP server, allowing tools and middleware to discover and use available prompts programmatically.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# List available prompts
prompts = await ctx.list_prompts()

# Get a specific prompt with arguments
result = await ctx.get_prompt("analyze_data", {"dataset": "users"})
messages = result.messages
```

**Method signatures:**

* **`ctx.list_prompts() -> list[MCPPrompt]`**: Returns list of all available prompts
* **`ctx.get_prompt(name: str, arguments: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> GetPromptResult`**: Get a specific prompt with optional arguments

### State Management

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

Store and share data between middleware and handlers within a single MCP request. Each MCP request (such as calling a tool, reading a resource, listing tools, or listing resources) receives its own context object with isolated state. Context state is particularly useful for passing information from [middleware](/servers/middleware) to your handlers.

To store a value in the context state, use `ctx.set_state(key, value)`. To retrieve a value, use `ctx.get_state(key)`.

<Warning>
  Context state is scoped to a single MCP request. Each operation (tool call, resource read, list operation, etc.) receives a new context object. State set during one request will not be available in subsequent requests. For persistent data storage across requests, use external storage mechanisms like databases, files, or in-memory caches.
</Warning>

This simplified example shows how to use MCP middleware to store user info in the context state, and how to access that state in a tool:

```python {7-8, 16-17} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class UserAuthMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):

        # Middleware stores user info in context state
        context.fastmcp_context.set_state("user_id", "user_123")
        context.fastmcp_context.set_state("permissions", ["read", "write"])

        return await call_next(context)

@mcp.tool
async def secure_operation(data: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Tool can access state set by middleware."""

    user_id = ctx.get_state("user_id")  # "user_123"
    permissions = ctx.get_state("permissions")  # ["read", "write"]
    
    if "write" not in permissions:
        return "Access denied"
    
    return f"Processing {data} for user {user_id}"
```

**Method signatures:**

* **`ctx.set_state(key: str, value: Any) -> None`**: Store a value in the context state
* **`ctx.get_state(key: str) -> Any`**: Retrieve a value from the context state (returns None if not found)

**State Inheritance:**
When a new context is created (nested contexts), it inherits a copy of its parent's state. This ensures that:

* State set on a child context never affects the parent context
* State set on a parent context after the child context is initialized is not propagated to the child context

This makes state management predictable and prevents unexpected side effects between nested operations.

### Change Notifications

<VersionBadge version="2.9.1" />

FastMCP automatically sends list change notifications when components (such as tools, resources, or prompts) are added, removed, enabled, or disabled. In rare cases where you need to manually trigger these notifications, you can use the context methods:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def custom_tool_management(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Example of manual notification after custom tool changes."""
    # After making custom changes to tools
    await ctx.send_tool_list_changed()
    await ctx.send_resource_list_changed()
    await ctx.send_prompt_list_changed()
    return "Notifications sent"
```

These methods are primarily used internally by FastMCP's automatic notification system and most users will not need to invoke them directly.

### FastMCP Server

To access the underlying FastMCP server instance, you can use the `ctx.fastmcp` property:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def my_tool(ctx: Context) -> None:
    # Access the FastMCP server instance
    server_name = ctx.fastmcp.name
    ...
```

### MCP Request

Access metadata about the current request and client.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def request_info(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Return information about the current request."""
    return {
        "request_id": ctx.request_id,
        "client_id": ctx.client_id or "Unknown client"
    }
```

**Available Properties:**

* **`ctx.request_id -> str`**: Get the unique ID for the current MCP request
* **`ctx.client_id -> str | None`**: Get the ID of the client making the request, if provided during initialization
* **`ctx.session_id -> str | None`**: Get the MCP session ID for session-based data sharing (HTTP transports only)

#### Request Context Availability

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

The `ctx.request_context` property provides access to the underlying MCP request context, but returns `None` when the MCP session has not been established yet. This typically occurs:

* During middleware execution in the `on_request` hook before the MCP handshake completes
* During the initialization phase of client connections

The MCP request context is distinct from the HTTP request. For HTTP transports, HTTP request data may be available even when the MCP session is not yet established.

To safely access the request context in situations where it may not be available:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_request

mcp = FastMCP(name="Session Aware Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def session_info(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Return session information when available."""

    # Check if MCP session is available
    if ctx.request_context:
        # MCP session available - can access MCP-specific attributes
        return {
            "session_id": ctx.session_id,
            "request_id": ctx.request_id,
            "has_meta": ctx.request_context.meta is not None
        }
    else:
        # MCP session not available - use HTTP helpers for request data (if using HTTP transport)
        request = get_http_request()
        return {
            "message": "MCP session not available",
            "user_agent": request.headers.get("user-agent", "Unknown")
        }
```

For HTTP request access that works regardless of MCP session availability (when using HTTP transports), use the [HTTP request helpers](#http-requests) like `get_http_request()` and `get_http_headers()`.

#### Client Metadata

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

Clients can send contextual information with their requests using the `meta` parameter. This metadata is accessible through `ctx.request_context.meta` and is available for all MCP operations (tools, resources, prompts).

The `meta` field is `None` when clients don't provide metadata. When provided, metadata is accessible via attribute access (e.g., `meta.user_id`) rather than dictionary access. The structure of metadata is determined by the client making the request.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Send an email, logging metadata about the request."""

    # Access client-provided metadata
    meta = ctx.request_context.meta

    if meta:
        # Meta is accessed as an object with attribute access
        user_id = meta.user_id if hasattr(meta, 'user_id') else None
        trace_id = meta.trace_id if hasattr(meta, 'trace_id') else None

        # Use metadata for logging, observability, etc.
        if trace_id:
            log_with_trace(f"Sending email for user {user_id}", trace_id)

    # Send the email...
    return f"Email sent to {to}"
```

<Warning>
  The MCP request is part of the low-level MCP SDK and intended for advanced use cases. Most users will not need to use it directly.
</Warning>

## Runtime Dependencies

### HTTP Requests

<VersionBadge version="2.2.11" />

The recommended way to access the current HTTP request is through the `get_http_request()` dependency function:

```python {2, 3, 11} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_request
from starlette.requests import Request

mcp = FastMCP(name="HTTP Request Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def user_agent_info() -> dict:
    """Return information about the user agent."""
    # Get the HTTP request
    request: Request = get_http_request()
    
    # Access request data
    user_agent = request.headers.get("user-agent", "Unknown")
    client_ip = request.client.host if request.client else "Unknown"
    
    return {
        "user_agent": user_agent,
        "client_ip": client_ip,
        "path": request.url.path,
    }
```

This approach works anywhere within a request's execution flow, not just within your MCP function. It's useful when:

1. You need access to HTTP information in helper functions
2. You're calling nested functions that need HTTP request data
3. You're working with middleware or other request processing code

### HTTP Headers

<VersionBadge version="2.2.11" />

If you only need request headers and want to avoid potential errors, you can use the `get_http_headers()` helper:

```python {2, 10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_headers

mcp = FastMCP(name="Headers Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def safe_header_info() -> dict:
    """Safely get header information without raising errors."""
    # Get headers (returns empty dict if no request context)
    headers = get_http_headers()
    
    # Get authorization header
    auth_header = headers.get("authorization", "")
    is_bearer = auth_header.startswith("Bearer ")
    
    return {
        "user_agent": headers.get("user-agent", "Unknown"),
        "content_type": headers.get("content-type", "Unknown"),
        "has_auth": bool(auth_header),
        "auth_type": "Bearer" if is_bearer else "Other" if auth_header else "None",
        "headers_count": len(headers)
    }
```

By default, `get_http_headers()` excludes problematic headers like `host` and `content-length`. To include all headers, use `get_http_headers(include_all=True)`.

### Access Tokens

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

When using authentication with your FastMCP server, you can access the authenticated user's access token information using the `get_access_token()` dependency function:

```python {2, 10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token, AccessToken

mcp = FastMCP(name="Auth Token Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def get_user_info() -> dict:
    """Get information about the authenticated user."""
    # Get the access token (None if not authenticated)
    token: AccessToken | None = get_access_token()
    
    if token is None:
        return {"authenticated": False}
    
    return {
        "authenticated": True,
        "client_id": token.client_id,
        "scopes": token.scopes,
        "expires_at": token.expires_at,
        "token_claims": token.claims,  # JWT claims or custom token data
    }
```

This is particularly useful when you need to:

1. **Access user identification** - Get the `client_id` or subject from token claims
2. **Check permissions** - Verify scopes or custom claims before performing operations
3. **Multi-tenant applications** - Extract tenant information from token claims
4. **Audit logging** - Track which user performed which actions

#### Working with Token Claims

The `claims` field contains all the data from the original token (JWT claims for JWT tokens, or custom data for other token types):

```python {2, 3, 9, 12, 15} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token

mcp = FastMCP(name="Multi-tenant Demo")

@mcp.tool
async def get_tenant_data(resource_id: str) -> dict:
    """Get tenant-specific data using token claims."""
    token: AccessToken | None = get_access_token()
    
    # Extract tenant ID from token claims
    tenant_id = token.claims.get("tenant_id") if token else None
    
    # Extract user ID from standard JWT subject claim
    user_id = token.claims.get("sub") if token else None
    
    # Use tenant and user info to authorize and filter data
    if not tenant_id:
        raise ValueError("No tenant information in token")
    
    return {
        "resource_id": resource_id,
        "tenant_id": tenant_id,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "data": f"Tenant-specific data for {tenant_id}",
    }
```


# User Elicitation
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/elicitation

Request structured input from users during tool execution through the MCP context.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

User elicitation allows MCP servers to request structured input from users during tool execution. Instead of requiring all inputs upfront, tools can interactively ask for missing parameters, clarification, or additional context as needed.

<Tip>
  Most of the examples in this document assume you have a FastMCP server instance named `mcp` and show how to use the `ctx.elicit` method to request user input from an `@mcp.tool`-decorated function.
</Tip>

## What is Elicitation?

Elicitation enables tools to pause execution and request specific information from users. This is particularly useful for:

* **Missing parameters**: Ask for required information not provided initially
* **Clarification requests**: Get user confirmation or choices for ambiguous scenarios
* **Progressive disclosure**: Collect complex information step-by-step
* **Dynamic workflows**: Adapt tool behavior based on user responses

For example, a file management tool might ask "Which directory should I create?" or a data analysis tool might request "What date range should I analyze?"

### Basic Usage

Use the `ctx.elicit()` method within any tool function to request user input:

```python {14-17} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from dataclasses import dataclass

mcp = FastMCP("Elicitation Server")

@dataclass
class UserInfo:
    name: str
    age: int

@mcp.tool
async def collect_user_info(ctx: Context) -> str:

## Elicitation Actions

The elicitation result contains an `action` field indicating how the user responded:

* **`accept`**: User provided valid input - data is available in the `data` field
* **`decline`**: User chose not to provide the requested information and the data field is `None`
* **`cancel`**: User cancelled the entire operation and the data field is `None`

```python {5, 7} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def my_tool(ctx: Context) -> str:
    result = await ctx.elicit("Choose an action")

    if result.action == "accept":
        return "Accepted!"
    elif result.action == "decline":
        return "Declined!"
    else:
        return "Cancelled!"
```

FastMCP also provides typed result classes for pattern matching on the `action` field:

```python {1-5, 12, 14, 16} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.elicitation import (
    AcceptedElicitation, 
    DeclinedElicitation, 
    CancelledElicitation,
)

@mcp.tool
async def pattern_example(ctx: Context) -> str:
    result = await ctx.elicit("Enter your name:", response_type=str)
    
    match result:
        case AcceptedElicitation(data=name):
            return f"Hello {name}!"
        case DeclinedElicitation():
            return "No name provided"
        case CancelledElicitation():
            return "Operation cancelled"
```

## Response Types

The server must send a schema to the client indicating the type of data it expects in response to the elicitation request. If the request is `accept`-ed, the client must send a response that matches the schema.

The MCP spec only supports a limited subset of JSON Schema types for elicitation responses. Specifically, it only supports JSON  **objects** with **primitive** properties including `string`, `number` (or `integer`), `boolean` and `enum` fields.

FastMCP makes it easy to request a broader range of types, including scalars (e.g. `str`) or no response at all, by automatically wrapping them in MCP-compatible object schemas.

### Scalar Types

You can request simple scalar data types for basic input, such as a string, integer, or boolean.

When you request a scalar type, FastMCP automatically wraps it in an object schema for MCP spec compatibility. Clients will see a corresponding schema requesting a single "value" field of the requested type. Once clients respond, the provided object is "unwrapped" and the scalar value is returned to your tool function as the `data` field of the `ElicitationResult` object.

As a developer, this means you do not have to worry about creating or accessing a structured object when you only need a scalar value.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python {4} title="Request a string" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  async def get_user_name(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Get the user's name."""
      result = await ctx.elicit("What's your name?", response_type=str)
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"Hello, {result.data}!"
      return "No name provided"
  ```

  ```python {4} title="Request an integer" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  async def pick_a_number(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Pick a number."""
      result = await ctx.elicit("Pick a number!", response_type=int)
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"You picked {result.data}"
      return "No number provided"
  ```

  ```python {4} title="Request a boolean" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  async def pick_a_boolean(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Pick a boolean."""
      result = await ctx.elicit("True or false?", response_type=bool)
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"You picked {result.data}"
      return "No boolean provided"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### No Response

Sometimes, the goal of an elicitation is to simply get a user to approve or reject an action. In this case, you can pass `None` as the response type to indicate that no response is expected. In order to comply with the MCP spec, the client will see a schema requesting an empty object in response. In this case, the `data` field of the `ElicitationResult` object will be `None` when the user accepts the elicitation.

```python {4} title="No response" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def approve_action(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Approve an action."""
    result = await ctx.elicit("Approve this action?", response_type=None)

    if result.action == "accept":
        return do_action()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Action rejected")
```

### Constrained Options

Often you'll want to constrain the user's response to a specific set of values. You can do this by using a `Literal` type or a Python enum as the response type, or by passing a list of strings to the `response_type` parameter as a convenient shortcut.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python {6} title="Using a list of strings" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  async def set_priority(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Set task priority level."""
      result = await ctx.elicit(
          "What priority level?", 
          response_type=["low", "medium", "high"],
      )
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"Priority set to: {result.data}"
  ```

  ```python {1, 8} title="Using a Literal type" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from typing import Literal

  @mcp.tool
  async def set_priority(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Set task priority level."""
      result = await ctx.elicit(
          "What priority level?", 
          response_type=Literal["low", "medium", "high"]
      )
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"Priority set to: {result.data}"
      return "No priority set"
  ```

  ```python {1, 11} title="Using a Python enum" theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from enum import Enum

  class Priority(Enum):
      LOW = "low"
      MEDIUM = "medium"
      HIGH = "high"   

  @mcp.tool
  async def set_priority(ctx: Context) -> str:
      """Set task priority level."""
      result = await ctx.elicit("What priority level?", response_type=Priority)
      
      if result.action == "accept":
          return f"Priority set to: {result.data.value}"
      return "No priority set"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Structured Responses

You can request structured data with multiple fields by using a dataclass, typed dict, or Pydantic model as the response type. Note that the MCP spec only supports shallow objects with scalar (string, number, boolean) or enum properties.

```python {1, 16, 20} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Literal

@dataclass
class TaskDetails:
    title: str
    description: str
    priority: Literal["low", "medium", "high"]
    due_date: str

@mcp.tool
async def create_task(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Create a new task with user-provided details."""
    result = await ctx.elicit(
        "Please provide task details",
        response_type=TaskDetails
    )
    
    if result.action == "accept":
        task = result.data
        return f"Created task: {task.title} (Priority: {task.priority})"
    return "Task creation cancelled"
```

## Multi-Turn Elicitation

Tools can make multiple elicitation calls to gather information progressively:

```python {6, 11, 16-19} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def plan_meeting(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Plan a meeting by gathering details step by step."""
    
    # Get meeting title
    title_result = await ctx.elicit("What's the meeting title?", response_type=str)
    if title_result.action != "accept":
        return "Meeting planning cancelled"
    
    # Get duration
    duration_result = await ctx.elicit("Duration in minutes?", response_type=int)
    if duration_result.action != "accept":
        return "Meeting planning cancelled"
    
    # Get priority
    priority_result = await ctx.elicit(
        "Is this urgent?", 
        response_type=Literal["yes", "no"]
    )
    if priority_result.action != "accept":
        return "Meeting planning cancelled"
    
    urgent = priority_result.data == "yes"
    return f"Meeting '{title_result.data}' planned for {duration_result.data} minutes (Urgent: {urgent})"
```

## Client Requirements

Elicitation requires the client to implement an elicitation handler. See [Client Elicitation](/clients/elicitation) for details on how clients can handle these requests.

If a client doesn't support elicitation, calls to `ctx.elicit()` will raise an error indicating that elicitation is not supported.


# Icons
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/icons

Add visual icons to your servers, tools, resources, and prompts

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.14.0" />

Icons provide visual representations for your MCP servers and components, helping client applications present better user interfaces. When displayed in MCP clients, icons help users quickly identify and navigate your server's capabilities.

## Icon Format

Icons use the standard MCP Icon type from the MCP protocol specification. Each icon specifies:

* **src**: URL or data URI pointing to the icon image
* **mimeType** (optional): MIME type of the image (e.g., "image/png", "image/svg+xml")
* **sizes** (optional): Array of size descriptors (e.g., \["48x48"], \["any"])

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from mcp.types import Icon

icon = Icon(
    src="https://example.com/icon.png",
    mimeType="image/png",
    sizes=["48x48"]
)
```

## Server Icons

Add icons and a website URL to your server for display in client applications:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import Icon

mcp = FastMCP(
    name="WeatherService",
    website_url="https://weather.example.com",
    icons=[
        Icon(
            src="https://weather.example.com/icon-48.png",
            mimeType="image/png",
            sizes=["48x48"]
        ),
        Icon(
            src="https://weather.example.com/icon-96.png",
            mimeType="image/png",
            sizes=["96x96"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

Server icons appear in MCP client interfaces to help users identify your server among others they may have installed.

## Component Icons

Icons can be added to individual tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts:

### Tool Icons

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from mcp.types import Icon

@mcp.tool(
    icons=[Icon(src="https://example.com/calculator-icon.png")]
)
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b
```

### Resource Icons

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource(
    "config://settings",
    icons=[Icon(src="https://example.com/config-icon.png")]
)
def get_settings() -> dict:
    """Retrieve application settings."""
    return {"theme": "dark", "language": "en"}
```

### Resource Template Icons

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource(
    "user://{user_id}/profile",
    icons=[Icon(src="https://example.com/user-icon.png")]
)
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> dict:
    """Get a user's profile."""
    return {"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}"}
```

### Prompt Icons

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt(
    icons=[Icon(src="https://example.com/prompt-icon.png")]
)
def analyze_code(code: str):
    """Create a prompt for code analysis."""
    return f"Please analyze this code:\n\n{code}"
```

## Using Data URIs

For small icons or when you want to embed the icon directly, use data URIs:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from mcp.types import Icon
from fastmcp.utilities.types import Image

# SVG icon as data URI
svg_icon = Icon(
    src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyNCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNCI+PHBhdGggZD0iTTEyIDJDNi40OCAyIDIgNi40OCAyIDEyczQuNDggMTAgMTAgMTAgMTAtNC40OCAxMC0xMFMxNy41MiAyIDEyIDJ6Ii8+PC9zdmc+",
    mimeType="image/svg+xml"
)

@mcp.tool(icons=[svg_icon])
def my_tool() -> str:
    """A tool with an embedded SVG icon."""
    return "result"

# Generating a data URI from a local image file.
img = Image(path="./assets/brand/favicon.png")
icon = Icon(src=img.to_data_uri())

@mcp.tool(icons=[icon])
def file_icon_tool() -> str:
    """A tool with an icon generated from a local file."""
    return "result"
```


# Client Logging
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/logging

Send log messages back to MCP clients through the context.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<Tip>
  This documentation covers **MCP client logging** - sending messages from your server to MCP clients. For standard server-side logging (e.g., writing to files, console), use `fastmcp.utilities.logging.get_logger()` or Python's built-in `logging` module.
</Tip>

Server logging allows MCP tools to send debug, info, warning, and error messages back to the client. This provides visibility into function execution and helps with debugging during development and operation.

## Why Use Server Logging?

Server logging is essential for:

* **Debugging**: Send detailed execution information to help diagnose issues
* **Progress visibility**: Keep users informed about what the tool is doing
* **Error reporting**: Communicate problems and their context to clients
* **Audit trails**: Create records of tool execution for compliance or analysis

Unlike standard Python logging, MCP server logging sends messages directly to the client, making them visible in the client's interface or logs.

### Basic Usage

Use the context logging methods within any tool function:

```python {8-9, 13, 17, 21} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("LoggingDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def analyze_data(data: list[float], ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Analyze numerical data with comprehensive logging."""
    await ctx.debug("Starting analysis of numerical data")
    await ctx.info(f"Analyzing {len(data)} data points")
    
    try:
        if not data:
            await ctx.warning("Empty data list provided")
            return {"error": "Empty data list"}
        
        result = sum(data) / len(data)
        await ctx.info(f"Analysis complete, average: {result}")
        return {"average": result, "count": len(data)}
        
    except Exception as e:
        await ctx.error(f"Analysis failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

## Structured Logging with `extra`

All logging methods (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `log`) now accept an `extra` parameter, which is a dictionary of arbitrary data. This allows you to send structured data to the client, which is useful for creating rich, queryable logs.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def process_transaction(transaction_id: str, amount: float, ctx: Context):
    await ctx.info(
        f"Processing transaction {transaction_id}",
        extra={
            "transaction_id": transaction_id,
            "amount": amount,
            "currency": "USD"
        }
    )
    # ... processing logic ...
```

## Server Logs

Client Logging in the form of `ctx.log()` and its convenience methods (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`) are meant for sending messages to the MCP clients. Messages sent to clients are also logged to the server's log at `DEBUG` level. Enable debug logging on the server or enable debug logging on the `fastmcp.server.context.to_client` logger to see these messages in the server's log.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import logging

from fastmcp.utilities.logging import get_logger

to_client_logger = get_logger(name="fastmcp.server.context.to_client")
to_client_logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Log Levels

### Debug

Use for detailed information that's typically only useful when diagnosing problems:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def process_file(file_path: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Process a file with detailed debug logging."""
    await ctx.debug(f"Starting to process file: {file_path}")
    await ctx.debug("Checking file permissions")
    
    # File processing logic
    await ctx.debug("File processing completed successfully")
    return "File processed"
```

### Info

Use for general information about normal program execution:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def backup_database(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Backup database with progress information."""
    await ctx.info("Starting database backup")
    await ctx.info("Connecting to database")
    await ctx.info("Backup completed successfully")
    return "Database backed up"
```

### Warning

Use for potentially harmful situations that don't prevent execution:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def validate_config(config: dict, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Validate configuration with warnings for deprecated options."""
    if "old_api_key" in config:
        await ctx.warning(
            "Using deprecated 'old_api_key' field. Please use 'api_key' instead",
            extra={"deprecated_field": "old_api_key"}
        )
    
    if config.get("timeout", 30) > 300:
        await ctx.warning(
            "Timeout value is very high (>5 minutes), this may cause issues",
            extra={"timeout_value": config.get("timeout")}
        )
    
    return {"status": "valid", "warnings": "see logs"}
```

### Error

Use for error events that might still allow the application to continue:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def batch_process(items: list[str], ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Process multiple items, logging errors for failed items."""
    successful = 0
    failed = 0
    
    for item in items:
        try:
            # Process item
            successful += 1
        except Exception as e:
            await ctx.error(
                f"Failed to process item '{item}': {str(e)}",
                extra={"failed_item": item}
            )
            failed += 1
    
    return {"successful": successful, "failed": failed}
```

## Client Handling

Log messages are sent to the client through the MCP protocol. How clients handle these messages depends on their implementation:

* **Development clients**: May display logs in real-time for debugging
* **Production clients**: May store logs for later analysis or display to users
* **Integration clients**: May forward logs to external logging systems

See [Client Logging](/clients/logging) for details on how clients can handle server log messages.


# MCP Middleware

MCP middleware is a powerful concept that allows you to add cross-cutting functionality to your FastMCP server. Unlike traditional web middleware, MCP middleware is designed specifically for the Model Context Protocol, providing hooks for different types of MCP operations like tool calls, resource reads, and prompt requests.

<Tip>
  MCP middleware is a FastMCP-specific concept and is not part of the official MCP protocol specification. This middleware system is designed to work with FastMCP servers and may not be compatible with other MCP implementations.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  MCP middleware is a brand new concept and may be subject to breaking changes in future versions.
</Warning>

## What is MCP Middleware?

MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify MCP requests and responses as they flow through your server. Think of it as a pipeline where each piece of middleware can inspect what's happening, make changes, and then pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

Common use cases for MCP middleware include:

* **Authentication and Authorization**: Verify client permissions before executing operations
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Track usage patterns and performance metrics
* **Rate Limiting**: Control request frequency per client or operation type
* **Request/Response Transformation**: Modify data before it reaches tools or after it leaves
* **Caching**: Store frequently requested data to improve performance
* **Error Handling**: Provide consistent error responses across your server

## How Middleware Works

FastMCP middleware operates on a pipeline model. When a request comes in, it flows through your middleware in the order they were added to the server. Each middleware can:

1. **Inspect the incoming request** and its context
2. **Modify the request** before passing it to the next middleware or handler
3. **Execute the next middleware/handler** in the chain by calling `call_next()`
4. **Inspect and modify the response** before returning it
5. **Handle errors** that occur during processing

The key insight is that middleware forms a chain where each piece decides whether to continue processing or stop the chain entirely.

If you're familiar with ASGI middleware, the basic structure of FastMCP middleware will feel familiar. At its core, middleware is a callable class that receives a context object containing information about the current JSON-RPC message and a handler function to continue the middleware chain.

It's important to understand that MCP operates on the [JSON-RPC specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/basic/transports/). While FastMCP presents requests and responses in a familiar way, these are fundamentally JSON-RPC messages, not HTTP request/response pairs like you might be used to in web applications. FastMCP middleware works with all [transport types](/clients/transports), including local stdio transport and HTTP transports, though not all middleware implementations are compatible across all transports (e.g., middleware that inspects HTTP headers won't work with stdio transport).

The most fundamental way to implement middleware is by overriding the `__call__` method on the `Middleware` base class:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class RawMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def __call__(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        # This method receives ALL messages regardless of type
        print(f"Raw middleware processing: {context.method}")
        result = await call_next(context)
        print(f"Raw middleware completed: {context.method}")
        return result
```

This gives you complete control over every message that flows through your server, but requires you to handle all message types manually.

## Middleware Hooks

To make it easier for users to target specific types of messages, FastMCP middleware provides a variety of specialized hooks. Instead of implementing the raw `__call__` method, you can override specific hook methods that are called only for certain types of operations, allowing you to target exactly the level of specificity you need for your middleware logic.

### Hook Hierarchy and Execution Order

FastMCP provides multiple hooks that are called with varying levels of specificity. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for effective middleware design.

When a request comes in, **multiple hooks may be called for the same request**, going from general to specific:

1. **`on_message`** - Called for ALL MCP messages (both requests and notifications)
2. **`on_request` or `on_notification`** - Called based on the message type
3. **Operation-specific hooks** - Called for specific MCP operations like `on_call_tool`

For example, when a client calls a tool, your middleware will receive **multiple hook calls**:

1. `on_message` and `on_request` for any initial tool discovery operations (list\_tools)
2. `on_message` (because it's any MCP message) for the tool call itself
3. `on_request` (because tool calls expect responses) for the tool call itself
4. `on_call_tool` (because it's specifically a tool execution) for the tool call itself

Note that the MCP SDK may perform additional operations like listing tools for caching purposes, which will trigger additional middleware calls beyond just the direct tool execution.

This hierarchy allows you to target your middleware logic with the right level of specificity. Use `on_message` for broad concerns like logging, `on_request` for authentication, and `on_call_tool` for tool-specific logic like performance monitoring.

### Available Hooks

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

* `on_message`: Called for all MCP messages (requests and notifications)

* `on_request`: Called specifically for MCP requests (that expect responses)

* `on_notification`: Called specifically for MCP notifications (fire-and-forget)

* `on_call_tool`: Called when tools are being executed

* `on_read_resource`: Called when resources are being read

* `on_get_prompt`: Called when prompts are being retrieved

* `on_list_tools`: Called when listing available tools

* `on_list_resources`: Called when listing available resources

* `on_list_resource_templates`: Called when listing resource templates

* `on_list_prompts`: Called when listing available prompts

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

* `on_initialize`: Called when a client connects and initializes the session (returns `None`)

<Note>
  The `on_initialize` hook receives the client's initialization request but **returns `None`** rather than a result. The initialization response is handled internally by the MCP protocol and cannot be modified by middleware. This hook is useful for client detection, logging connections, or initializing session state, but not for modifying the initialization handshake itself.
</Note>

### MCP Session Availability in Middleware

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

The MCP session and request context are not available during certain phases like initialization. When middleware runs during these phases, `context.fastmcp_context.request_context` returns `None` rather than the full MCP request context.

This typically occurs when:

* The `on_request` hook fires during client initialization
* The MCP handshake hasn't completed yet

To handle this in middleware, check if the MCP request context is available before accessing MCP-specific attributes. Note that the MCP request context is distinct from the HTTP request - for HTTP transports, you can use HTTP helpers to access request data even when the MCP session is not available:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class SessionAwareMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        ctx = context.fastmcp_context

        if ctx.request_context:
            # MCP session available - can access session-specific attributes
            session_id = ctx.session_id
            request_id = ctx.request_id
        else:
            # MCP session not available yet - use HTTP helpers for request data (if using HTTP transport)
            from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_http_headers
            headers = get_http_headers()
            # Access HTTP data for auth, logging, etc.

        return await call_next(context)
```

For HTTP request data (headers, client IP, etc.) when using HTTP transports, use `get_http_request()` or `get_http_headers()` from `fastmcp.server.dependencies`, which work regardless of MCP session availability. See [HTTP Requests](/servers/context#http-requests) for details.

## Component Access in Middleware

Understanding how to access component information (tools, resources, prompts) in middleware is crucial for building powerful middleware functionality. The access patterns differ significantly between listing operations and execution operations.

### Listing Operations vs Execution Operations

FastMCP middleware handles two types of operations differently:

**Listing Operations** (`on_list_tools`, `on_list_resources`, `on_list_prompts`, etc.):

* Middleware receives **FastMCP component objects** with full metadata
* These objects include FastMCP-specific properties like `tags` that can be accessed directly from the component
* The result contains complete component information before it's converted to MCP format
* Tags are included in the component's `meta` field in the listing response returned to MCP clients

**Execution Operations** (`on_call_tool`, `on_read_resource`, `on_get_prompt`):

* Middleware runs **before** the component is executed
* The middleware result is either the execution result or an error if the component wasn't found
* Component metadata isn't directly available in the hook parameters

### Accessing Component Metadata During Execution

If you need to check component properties (like tags) during execution operations, use the FastMCP server instance available through the context:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

class TagBasedMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        # Access the tool object to check its metadata
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            try:
                tool = await context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_tool(context.message.name)
                
                # Check if this tool has a "private" tag
                if "private" in tool.tags:
                    raise ToolError("Access denied: private tool")
                    
                # Check if tool is enabled
                if not tool.enabled:
                    raise ToolError("Tool is currently disabled")
                    
            except Exception:
                # Tool not found or other error - let execution continue
                # and handle the error naturally
                pass
        
        return await call_next(context)
```

The same pattern works for resources and prompts:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.exceptions import ResourceError, PromptError

class ComponentAccessMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_read_resource(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            try:
                resource = await context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_resource(context.message.uri)
                if "restricted" in resource.tags:
                    raise ResourceError("Access denied: restricted resource")
            except Exception:
                pass
        return await call_next(context)
    
    async def on_get_prompt(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        if context.fastmcp_context:
            try:
                prompt = await context.fastmcp_context.fastmcp.get_prompt(context.message.name)
                if not prompt.enabled:
                    raise PromptError("Prompt is currently disabled")
            except Exception:
                pass
        return await call_next(context)
```

### Working with Listing Results

For listing operations, the middleware `call_next` function returns a list of FastMCP components prior to being converted to MCP format. You can filter or modify this list and return it to the client. For example:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class ListingFilterMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_list_tools(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        result = await call_next(context)
        
        # Filter out tools with "private" tag
        filtered_tools = [
            tool for tool in result 
            if "private" not in tool.tags
        ]
        
        # Return modified list
        return filtered_tools
```

This filtering happens before the components are converted to MCP format and returned to the client. Tags are accessible both during filtering and are included in the component's `meta` field in the final listing response.

<Tip>
  When filtering components in listing operations, ensure you also prevent execution of filtered components in the corresponding execution hooks (`on_call_tool`, `on_read_resource`, `on_get_prompt`) to maintain consistency.
</Tip>

### Tool Call Denial

You can deny access to specific tools by raising a `ToolError` in your middleware. This is the correct way to block tool execution, as it integrates properly with the FastMCP error handling system.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

class AuthMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        tool_name = context.message.name
        
        # Deny access to restricted tools
        if tool_name.lower() in ["delete", "admin_config"]:
            raise ToolError("Access denied: tool requires admin privileges")
        
        # Allow other tools to proceed
        return await call_next(context)
```

<Warning>
  When denying tool calls, always raise `ToolError` rather than returning `ToolResult` objects or other values. `ToolError` ensures proper error propagation through the middleware chain and converts to the correct MCP error response format.
</Warning>

### Tool Call Modification

For execution operations like tool calls, you can modify arguments before execution or transform results afterward:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class ToolCallMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_call_tool(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        # Modify arguments before execution
        if context.message.name == "calculate":
            # Ensure positive inputs
            if context.message.arguments.get("value", 0) < 0:
                context.message.arguments["value"] = abs(context.message.arguments["value"])
        
        result = await call_next(context)
        
        # Transform result after execution
        if context.message.name == "get_data":
            # Add metadata to result
            if result.structured_content:
                result.structured_content["processed_at"] = "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        
        return result
```

<Tip>
  For more complex tool rewriting scenarios, consider using [Tool Transformation](/patterns/tool-transformation) patterns which provide a more structured approach to creating modified tool variants.
</Tip>

### Anatomy of a Hook

Every middleware hook follows the same pattern. Let's examine the `on_message` hook to understand the structure:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def on_message(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
    # 1. Pre-processing: Inspect and optionally modify the request
    print(f"Processing {context.method}")
    
    # 2. Chain continuation: Call the next middleware/handler
    result = await call_next(context)
    
    # 3. Post-processing: Inspect and optionally modify the response
    print(f"Completed {context.method}")
    
    # 4. Return the result (potentially modified)
    return result
```

### Hook Parameters

Every hook receives two parameters:

1. **`context: MiddlewareContext`** - Contains information about the current request:
   * `context.method` - The MCP method name (e.g., "tools/call")
   * `context.source` - Where the request came from ("client" or "server")
   * `context.type` - Message type ("request" or "notification")
   * `context.message` - The MCP message data
   * `context.timestamp` - When the request was received
   * `context.fastmcp_context` - FastMCP Context object (if available)

2. **`call_next`** - A function that continues the middleware chain. You **must** call this to proceed, unless you want to stop processing entirely.

### Control Flow

You have complete control over the request flow:

* **Continue processing**: Call `await call_next(context)` to proceed
* **Modify the request**: Change the context before calling `call_next`
* **Modify the response**: Change the result after calling `call_next`
* **Stop the chain**: Don't call `call_next` (rarely needed)
* **Handle errors**: Wrap `call_next` in try/catch blocks

#### State Management

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

In addition to modifying the request and response, you can also store state data that your tools can (optionally) access later. To do so, use the FastMCP Context to either `set_state` or `get_state` as appropriate. For more information, see the [Context State Management](/servers/context#state-management) docs.

## Creating Middleware

FastMCP middleware is implemented by subclassing the `Middleware` base class and overriding the hooks you need. You only need to implement the hooks that are relevant to your use case.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class LoggingMiddleware(Middleware):
    """Middleware that logs all MCP operations."""
    
    async def on_message(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        """Called for all MCP messages."""
        print(f"Processing {context.method} from {context.source}")
        
        result = await call_next(context)
        
        print(f"Completed {context.method}")
        return result

# Add middleware to your server
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
```

This creates a basic logging middleware that will print information about every request that flows through your server.

## Adding Middleware to Your Server

### Single Middleware

Adding middleware to your server is straightforward:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
```

### Multiple Middleware

Middleware executes in the order it's added to the server. The first middleware added runs first on the way in, and last on the way out:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

mcp.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware("secret-token"))
mcp.add_middleware(PerformanceMiddleware())
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
```

This creates the following execution flow:

1. AuthenticationMiddleware (pre-processing)
2. PerformanceMiddleware (pre-processing)
3. LoggingMiddleware (pre-processing)
4. Actual tool/resource handler
5. LoggingMiddleware (post-processing)
6. PerformanceMiddleware (post-processing)
7. AuthenticationMiddleware (post-processing)

## Server Composition and Middleware

When using [Server Composition](/servers/composition) with `mount` or `import_server`, middleware behavior follows these rules:

1. **Parent server middleware** runs for all requests, including those routed to mounted servers
2. **Mounted server middleware** only runs for requests handled by that specific server
3. **Middleware order** is preserved within each server

This allows you to create layered middleware architectures where parent servers handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, while child servers focus on domain-specific middleware.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Parent server with middleware
parent = FastMCP("Parent")
parent.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware("token"))

# Child server with its own middleware  
child = FastMCP("Child")
child.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())

@child.tool
def child_tool() -> str:
    return "from child"

# Mount the child server
parent.mount(child, prefix="child")
```

When a client calls "child\_tool", the request will flow through the parent's authentication middleware first, then route to the child server where it will go through the child's logging middleware.

## Built-in Middleware Examples

FastMCP includes several middleware implementations that demonstrate best practices and provide immediately useful functionality. Let's explore how each type works by building simplified versions, then see how to use the full implementations.

### Timing Middleware

Performance monitoring is essential for understanding your server's behavior and identifying bottlenecks. FastMCP includes timing middleware at `fastmcp.server.middleware.timing`.

Here's an example of how it works:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import time
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class SimpleTimingMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        
        try:
            result = await call_next(context)
            duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1000
            print(f"Request {context.method} completed in {duration_ms:.2f}ms")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start_time) * 1000
            print(f"Request {context.method} failed after {duration_ms:.2f}ms: {e}")
            raise
```

To use the full version with proper logging and configuration:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.timing import (
    TimingMiddleware, 
    DetailedTimingMiddleware
)

# Basic timing for all requests
mcp.add_middleware(TimingMiddleware())

# Detailed per-operation timing (tools, resources, prompts)
mcp.add_middleware(DetailedTimingMiddleware())
```

The built-in versions include custom logger support, proper formatting, and **DetailedTimingMiddleware** provides operation-specific hooks like `on_call_tool` and `on_read_resource` for granular timing.

### Tool Injection Middleware

Tool injection middleware is a middleware that injects tools into the server during the request lifecycle:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.tool_injection import ToolInjectionMiddleware

def my_tool_fn(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

my_tool = Tool.from_function(fn=my_tool_fn, name="my_tool")

mcp.add_middleware(ToolInjectionMiddleware(tools=[my_tool]))
```

### Prompt Tool Middleware

Prompt tool middleware is a compatibility middleware for clients that are unable to list or get prompts. It provides two tools: `list_prompts` and `get_prompt` which allow clients to list and get prompts respectively using only tool calls.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.tool_injection import PromptToolMiddleware

mcp.add_middleware(PromptToolMiddleware())
```

### Resource Tool Middleware

Resource tool middleware is a compatibility middleware for clients that are unable to list or read resources. It provides two tools: `list_resources` and `read_resource` which allow clients to list and read resources respectively using only tool calls.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.tool_injection import ResourceToolMiddleware

mcp.add_middleware(ResourceToolMiddleware())
```

### Caching Middleware

Caching middleware is essential for improving performance and reducing server load. FastMCP provides caching middleware at `fastmcp.server.middleware.caching`.

Here's how to use the full version:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware

mcp.add_middleware(ResponseCachingMiddleware())
```

Out of the box, it caches call/list tool, resources, and prompts to an in-memory cache with TTL-based expiration. Cache entries expire based on their TTL; there is no event-based cache invalidation. List calls are stored under global keys—when sharing a storage backend across multiple servers, consider namespacing collections to prevent conflicts. See [Storage Backends](/servers/storage-backends) for advanced configuration options.

Each method can be configured individually, for example, caching list tools for 30 seconds, limiting caching to specific tools, and disabling caching for resource reads:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware, CallToolSettings, ListToolsSettings, ReadResourceSettings

mcp.add_middleware(ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    list_tools_settings=ListToolsSettings(
        ttl=30,
    ),
    call_tool_settings=CallToolSettings(
        included_tools=["tool1"],
    ),
    read_resource_settings=ReadResourceSettings(
        enabled=False
    )
))
```

#### Storage Backends

By default, caching uses in-memory storage, which is fast but doesn't persist across restarts. For production or persistent caching across server restarts, configure a different storage backend. See [Storage Backends](/servers/storage-backends) for complete options including disk, Redis, DynamoDB, and custom implementations.

Disk-based caching example:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore

mcp.add_middleware(ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    cache_storage=DiskStore(directory="cache"),
))
```

Redis for distributed deployments:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore

mcp.add_middleware(ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    cache_storage=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379),
))
```

#### Cache Statistics

The caching middleware collects operation statistics (hits, misses, etc.) through the underlying storage layer. Access statistics from the middleware instance:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware

middleware = ResponseCachingMiddleware()
mcp.add_middleware(middleware)

# Later, retrieve statistics
stats = middleware.statistics()
print(f"Total cache operations: {stats}")
```

### Logging Middleware

Request and response logging is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and understanding usage patterns in your MCP server. FastMCP provides comprehensive logging middleware at `fastmcp.server.middleware.logging`.

Here's an example of how it works:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class SimpleLoggingMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_message(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        print(f"Processing {context.method} from {context.source}")
        
        try:
            result = await call_next(context)
            print(f"Completed {context.method}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed {context.method}: {e}")
            raise
```

To use the full versions with advanced features:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.logging import (
    LoggingMiddleware, 
    StructuredLoggingMiddleware
)

# Human-readable logging with payload support
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware(
    include_payloads=True,
    max_payload_length=1000
))

# JSON-structured logging for log aggregation tools
mcp.add_middleware(StructuredLoggingMiddleware(include_payloads=True))
```

The built-in versions include payload logging, structured JSON output, custom logger support, payload size limits, and operation-specific hooks for granular control.

### Rate Limiting Middleware

Rate limiting is essential for protecting your server from abuse, ensuring fair resource usage, and maintaining performance under load. FastMCP includes sophisticated rate limiting middleware at `fastmcp.server.middleware.rate_limiting`.

Here's an example of how it works:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import time
from collections import defaultdict
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext
from mcp import McpError
from mcp.types import ErrorData

class SimpleRateLimitMiddleware(Middleware):
    def __init__(self, requests_per_minute: int = 60):
        self.requests_per_minute = requests_per_minute
        self.client_requests = defaultdict(list)
    
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        current_time = time.time()
        client_id = "default"  # In practice, extract from headers or context
        
        # Clean old requests and check limit
        cutoff_time = current_time - 60
        self.client_requests[client_id] = [
            req_time for req_time in self.client_requests[client_id]
            if req_time > cutoff_time
        ]
        
        if len(self.client_requests[client_id]) >= self.requests_per_minute:
            raise McpError(ErrorData(code=-32000, message="Rate limit exceeded"))
        
        self.client_requests[client_id].append(current_time)
        return await call_next(context)
```

To use the full versions with advanced algorithms:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.rate_limiting import (
    RateLimitingMiddleware, 
    SlidingWindowRateLimitingMiddleware
)

# Token bucket rate limiting (allows controlled bursts)
mcp.add_middleware(RateLimitingMiddleware(
    max_requests_per_second=10.0,
    burst_capacity=20
))

# Sliding window rate limiting (precise time-based control)
mcp.add_middleware(SlidingWindowRateLimitingMiddleware(
    max_requests=100,
    window_minutes=1
))
```

The built-in versions include token bucket algorithms, per-client identification, global rate limiting, and async-safe implementations with configurable client identification functions.

### Error Handling Middleware

Consistent error handling and recovery is critical for robust MCP servers. FastMCP provides comprehensive error handling middleware at `fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling`.

Here's an example of how it works:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import logging
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class SimpleErrorHandlingMiddleware(Middleware):
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger("errors")
        self.error_counts = {}
    
    async def on_message(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        try:
            return await call_next(context)
        except Exception as error:
            # Log the error and track statistics
            error_key = f"{type(error).__name__}:{context.method}"
            self.error_counts[error_key] = self.error_counts.get(error_key, 0) + 1
            
            self.logger.error(f"Error in {context.method}: {type(error).__name__}: {error}")
            raise
```

To use the full versions with advanced features:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling import (
    ErrorHandlingMiddleware, 
    RetryMiddleware
)

# Comprehensive error logging and transformation
mcp.add_middleware(ErrorHandlingMiddleware(
    include_traceback=True,
    transform_errors=True,
    error_callback=my_error_callback
))

# Automatic retry with exponential backoff
mcp.add_middleware(RetryMiddleware(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_exceptions=(ConnectionError, TimeoutError)
))
```

The built-in versions include error transformation, custom callbacks, configurable retry logic, and proper MCP error formatting.

### Combining Middleware

These middleware work together seamlessly:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.timing import TimingMiddleware
from fastmcp.server.middleware.logging import LoggingMiddleware
from fastmcp.server.middleware.rate_limiting import RateLimitingMiddleware
from fastmcp.server.middleware.error_handling import ErrorHandlingMiddleware

mcp = FastMCP("Production Server")

# Add middleware in logical order
mcp.add_middleware(ErrorHandlingMiddleware())  # Handle errors first
mcp.add_middleware(RateLimitingMiddleware(max_requests_per_second=50))
mcp.add_middleware(TimingMiddleware())  # Time actual execution
mcp.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())  # Log everything

@mcp.tool
def my_tool(data: str) -> str:
    return f"Processed: {data}"
```

This configuration provides comprehensive monitoring, protection, and observability for your MCP server.

### Custom Middleware Example

You can also create custom middleware by extending the base class:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware import Middleware, MiddlewareContext

class CustomHeaderMiddleware(Middleware):
    async def on_request(self, context: MiddlewareContext, call_next):
        # Add custom logic here
        print(f"Processing {context.method}")
        
        result = await call_next(context)
        
        print(f"Completed {context.method}")
        return result

mcp.add_middleware(CustomHeaderMiddleware())
```


# Progress Reporting
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/progress

Update clients on the progress of long-running operations through the MCP context.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Progress reporting allows MCP tools to notify clients about the progress of long-running operations. This enables clients to display progress indicators and provide better user experience during time-consuming tasks.

## Why Use Progress Reporting?

Progress reporting is valuable for:

* **User experience**: Keep users informed about long-running operations
* **Progress indicators**: Enable clients to show progress bars or percentages
* **Timeout prevention**: Demonstrate that operations are actively progressing
* **Debugging**: Track execution progress for performance analysis

### Basic Usage

Use `ctx.report_progress()` to send progress updates to the client:

```python {14, 21} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
import asyncio

mcp = FastMCP("ProgressDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def process_items(items: list[str], ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Process a list of items with progress updates."""
    total = len(items)
    results = []
    
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        # Report progress as we process each item
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=i, total=total)
        
        # Simulate processing time
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        results.append(item.upper())
    
    # Report 100% completion
    await ctx.report_progress(progress=total, total=total)
    
    return {"processed": len(results), "results": results}
```

## Method Signature

<Card icon="code" title="Context Progress Method">
  <ResponseField name="ctx.report_progress" type="async method">
    Report progress to the client for long-running operations

    <Expandable title="Parameters">
      <ResponseField name="progress" type="float">
        Current progress value (e.g., 24, 0.75, 1500)
      </ResponseField>

      <ResponseField name="total" type="float | None" default="None">
        Optional total value (e.g., 100, 1.0, 2000). When provided, clients may interpret this as enabling percentage calculation.
      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

## Progress Patterns

### Percentage-Based Progress

Report progress as a percentage (0-100):

```python {13-14} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def download_file(url: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Download a file with percentage progress."""
    total_size = 1000  # KB
    downloaded = 0
    
    while downloaded < total_size:
        # Download chunk
        chunk_size = min(50, total_size - downloaded)
        downloaded += chunk_size
        
        # Report percentage progress
        percentage = (downloaded / total_size) * 100
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=percentage, total=100)
        
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate download time
    
    return f"Downloaded file from {url}"
```

### Absolute Progress

Report progress with absolute values:

```python {10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def backup_database(ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Backup database tables with absolute progress."""
    tables = ["users", "orders", "products", "inventory", "logs"]
    
    for i, table in enumerate(tables):
        await ctx.info(f"Backing up table: {table}")
        
        # Report absolute progress
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=i + 1, total=len(tables))
        
        # Simulate backup time
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
    
    return "Database backup completed"
```

### Indeterminate Progress

Report progress without a known total for operations where the endpoint is unknown:

```python {11} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def scan_directory(directory: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Scan directory with indeterminate progress."""
    files_found = 0
    
    # Simulate directory scanning
    for i in range(10):  # Unknown number of files
        files_found += 1
        
        # Report progress without total for indeterminate operations
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=files_found)
        
        await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    
    return {"files_found": files_found, "directory": directory}
```

### Multi-Stage Operations

Break complex operations into stages with progress for each:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def data_migration(source: str, destination: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Migrate data with multi-stage progress reporting."""
    
    # Stage 1: Validation (0-25%)
    await ctx.info("Validating source data")
    for i in range(5):
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=i * 5, total=100)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Stage 2: Export (25-60%)
    await ctx.info("Exporting data from source")
    for i in range(7):
        progress = 25 + (i * 5)
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=progress, total=100)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Stage 3: Transform (60-80%)
    await ctx.info("Transforming data format")
    for i in range(4):
        progress = 60 + (i * 5)
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=progress, total=100)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Stage 4: Import (80-100%)
    await ctx.info("Importing to destination")
    for i in range(4):
        progress = 80 + (i * 5)
        await ctx.report_progress(progress=progress, total=100)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Final completion
    await ctx.report_progress(progress=100, total=100)
    
    return f"Migration from {source} to {destination} completed"
```

## Client Requirements

Progress reporting requires clients to support progress handling:

* Clients must send a `progressToken` in the initial request to receive progress updates
* If no progress token is provided, progress calls will have no effect (they won't error)
* See [Client Progress](/clients/progress) for details on implementing client-side progress handling


# Prompts
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts

Create reusable, parameterized prompt templates for MCP clients.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Prompts are reusable message templates that help LLMs generate structured, purposeful responses. FastMCP simplifies defining these templates, primarily using the `@mcp.prompt` decorator.

## What Are Prompts?

Prompts provide parameterized message templates for LLMs. When a client requests a prompt:

1. FastMCP finds the corresponding prompt definition.
2. If it has parameters, they are validated against your function signature.
3. Your function executes with the validated inputs.
4. The generated message(s) are returned to the LLM to guide its response.

This allows you to define consistent, reusable templates that LLMs can use across different clients and contexts.

## Prompts

### The `@prompt` Decorator

The most common way to define a prompt is by decorating a Python function. The decorator uses the function name as the prompt's identifier.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.prompts.prompt import Message, PromptMessage, TextContent

mcp = FastMCP(name="PromptServer")

# Basic prompt returning a string (converted to user message automatically)
@mcp.prompt
def ask_about_topic(topic: str) -> str:
    """Generates a user message asking for an explanation of a topic."""
    return f"Can you please explain the concept of '{topic}'?"

# Prompt returning a specific message type
@mcp.prompt
def generate_code_request(language: str, task_description: str) -> PromptMessage:
    """Generates a user message requesting code generation."""
    content = f"Write a {language} function that performs the following task: {task_description}"
    return PromptMessage(role="user", content=TextContent(type="text", text=content))
```

**Key Concepts:**

* **Name:** By default, the prompt name is taken from the function name.
* **Parameters:** The function parameters define the inputs needed to generate the prompt.
* **Inferred Metadata:** By default:
  * Prompt Name: Taken from the function name (`ask_about_topic`).
  * Prompt Description: Taken from the function's docstring.

<Tip>
  Functions with `*args` or `**kwargs` are not supported as prompts. This restriction exists because FastMCP needs to generate a complete parameter schema for the MCP protocol, which isn't possible with variable argument lists.
</Tip>

#### Decorator Arguments

While FastMCP infers the name and description from your function, you can override these and add additional metadata using arguments to the `@mcp.prompt` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt(
    name="analyze_data_request",          # Custom prompt name
    description="Creates a request to analyze data with specific parameters",  # Custom description
    tags={"analysis", "data"},            # Optional categorization tags
    meta={"version": "1.1", "author": "data-team"}  # Custom metadata
)
def data_analysis_prompt(
    data_uri: str = Field(description="The URI of the resource containing the data."),
    analysis_type: str = Field(default="summary", description="Type of analysis.")
) -> str:
    """This docstring is ignored when description is provided."""
    return f"Please perform a '{analysis_type}' analysis on the data found at {data_uri}."
```

<Card icon="code" title="@prompt Decorator Arguments">
  <ParamField body="name" type="str | None">
    Sets the explicit prompt name exposed via MCP. If not provided, uses the function name
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="title" type="str | None">
    A human-readable title for the prompt
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="description" type="str | None">
    Provides the description exposed via MCP. If set, the function's docstring is ignored for this purpose
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="tags" type="set[str] | None">
    A set of strings used to categorize the prompt. These can be used by the server and, in some cases, by clients to filter or group available prompts.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="enabled" type="bool" default="True">
    A boolean to enable or disable the prompt. See [Disabling Prompts](#disabling-prompts) for more information
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="icons" type="list[Icon] | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.14.0" />

    Optional list of icon representations for this prompt. See [Icons](/servers/icons) for detailed examples
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="meta" type="dict[str, Any] | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

    Optional meta information about the prompt. This data is passed through to the MCP client as the `_meta` field of the client-side prompt object and can be used for custom metadata, versioning, or other application-specific purposes.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Argument Types

<VersionBadge version="2.9.0" />

The MCP specification requires that all prompt arguments be passed as strings, but FastMCP allows you to use typed annotations for better developer experience. When you use complex types like `list[int]` or `dict[str, str]`, FastMCP:

1. **Automatically converts** string arguments from MCP clients to the expected types
2. **Generates helpful descriptions** showing the exact JSON string format needed
3. **Preserves direct usage** - you can still call prompts with properly typed arguments

Since the MCP specification only allows string arguments, clients need to know what string format to use for complex types. FastMCP solves this by automatically enhancing the argument descriptions with JSON schema information, making it clear to both humans and LLMs how to format their arguments.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python Code theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.prompt
  def analyze_data(
      numbers: list[int],
      metadata: dict[str, str], 
      threshold: float
  ) -> str:
      """Analyze numerical data."""
      avg = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
      return f"Average: {avg}, above threshold: {avg > threshold}"
  ```

  ```json Resulting MCP Prompt theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "name": "analyze_data",
    "description": "Analyze numerical data.",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "name": "numbers",
        "description": "Provide as a JSON string matching the following schema: {\"items\":{\"type\":\"integer\"},\"type\":\"array\"}",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "name": "metadata", 
        "description": "Provide as a JSON string matching the following schema: {\"additionalProperties\":{\"type\":\"string\"},\"type\":\"object\"}",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "name": "threshold",
        "description": "Provide as a JSON string matching the following schema: {\"type\":\"number\"}",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**MCP clients will call this prompt with string arguments:**

```json  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
{
  "numbers": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",
  "metadata": "{\"source\": \"api\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}",
  "threshold": "2.5"
}
```

**But you can still call it directly with proper types:**

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# This also works for direct calls
result = await prompt.render({
    "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "metadata": {"source": "api", "version": "1.0"}, 
    "threshold": 2.5
})
```

<Warning>
  Keep your type annotations simple when using this feature. Complex nested types or custom classes may not convert reliably from JSON strings. The automatically generated schema descriptions are the only guidance users receive about the expected format.

  Good choices: `list[int]`, `dict[str, str]`, `float`, `bool`
  Avoid: Complex Pydantic models, deeply nested structures, custom classes
</Warning>

### Return Values

FastMCP intelligently handles different return types from your prompt function:

* **`str`**: Automatically converted to a single `PromptMessage`.
* **`PromptMessage`**: Used directly as provided. (Note a more user-friendly `Message` constructor is available that can accept raw strings instead of `TextContent` objects.)
* **`list[PromptMessage | str]`**: Used as a sequence of messages (a conversation).
* **`Any`**: If the return type is not one of the above, the return value is attempted to be converted to a string and used as a `PromptMessage`.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.prompts.prompt import Message, PromptResult

@mcp.prompt
def roleplay_scenario(character: str, situation: str) -> PromptResult:
    """Sets up a roleplaying scenario with initial messages."""
    return [
        Message(f"Let's roleplay. You are {character}. The situation is: {situation}"),
        Message("Okay, I understand. I am ready. What happens next?", role="assistant")
    ]
```

### Required vs. Optional Parameters

Parameters in your function signature are considered **required** unless they have a default value.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt
def data_analysis_prompt(
    data_uri: str,                        # Required - no default value
    analysis_type: str = "summary",       # Optional - has default value
    include_charts: bool = False          # Optional - has default value
) -> str:
    """Creates a request to analyze data with specific parameters."""
    prompt = f"Please perform a '{analysis_type}' analysis on the data found at {data_uri}."
    if include_charts:
        prompt += " Include relevant charts and visualizations."
    return prompt
```

In this example, the client *must* provide `data_uri`. If `analysis_type` or `include_charts` are omitted, their default values will be used.

### Disabling Prompts

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

You can control the visibility and availability of prompts by enabling or disabling them. Disabled prompts will not appear in the list of available prompts, and attempting to call a disabled prompt will result in an "Unknown prompt" error.

By default, all prompts are enabled. You can disable a prompt upon creation using the `enabled` parameter in the decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt(enabled=False)
def experimental_prompt():
    """This prompt is not ready for use."""
    return "This is an experimental prompt."
```

You can also toggle a prompt's state programmatically after it has been created:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt
def seasonal_prompt(): return "Happy Holidays!"

# Disable and re-enable the prompt
seasonal_prompt.disable()
seasonal_prompt.enable()
```

### Async Prompts

FastMCP seamlessly supports both standard (`def`) and asynchronous (`async def`) functions as prompts.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Synchronous prompt
@mcp.prompt
def simple_question(question: str) -> str:
    """Generates a simple question to ask the LLM."""
    return f"Question: {question}"

# Asynchronous prompt
@mcp.prompt
async def data_based_prompt(data_id: str) -> str:
    """Generates a prompt based on data that needs to be fetched."""
    # In a real scenario, you might fetch data from a database or API
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(f"https://api.example.com/data/{data_id}") as response:
            data = await response.json()
            return f"Analyze this data: {data['content']}"
```

Use `async def` when your prompt function performs I/O operations like network requests, database queries, file I/O, or external service calls.

### Accessing MCP Context

<VersionBadge version="2.2.5" />

Prompts can access additional MCP information and features through the `Context` object. To access it, add a parameter to your prompt function with a type annotation of `Context`:

```python {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="PromptServer")

@mcp.prompt
async def generate_report_request(report_type: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generates a request for a report."""
    return f"Please create a {report_type} report. Request ID: {ctx.request_id}"
```

For full documentation on the Context object and all its capabilities, see the [Context documentation](/servers/context).

### Notifications

<VersionBadge version="2.9.1" />

FastMCP automatically sends `notifications/prompts/list_changed` notifications to connected clients when prompts are added, enabled, or disabled. This allows clients to stay up-to-date with the current prompt set without manually polling for changes.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt
def example_prompt() -> str:
    return "Hello!"

# These operations trigger notifications:
mcp.add_prompt(example_prompt)  # Sends prompts/list_changed notification
example_prompt.disable()        # Sends prompts/list_changed notification  
example_prompt.enable()         # Sends prompts/list_changed notification
```

Notifications are only sent when these operations occur within an active MCP request context (e.g., when called from within a tool or other MCP operation). Operations performed during server initialization do not trigger notifications.

Clients can handle these notifications using a [message handler](/clients/messages) to automatically refresh their prompt lists or update their interfaces.

## Server Behavior

### Duplicate Prompts

<VersionBadge version="2.1.0" />

You can configure how the FastMCP server handles attempts to register multiple prompts with the same name. Use the `on_duplicate_prompts` setting during `FastMCP` initialization.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    name="PromptServer",
    on_duplicate_prompts="error"  # Raise an error if a prompt name is duplicated
)

@mcp.prompt
def greeting(): return "Hello, how can I help you today?"

# This registration attempt will raise a ValueError because
# "greeting" is already registered and the behavior is "error".
# @mcp.prompt
# def greeting(): return "Hi there! What can I do for you?"
```

The duplicate behavior options are:

* `"warn"` (default): Logs a warning, and the new prompt replaces the old one.
* `"error"`: Raises a `ValueError`, preventing the duplicate registration.
* `"replace"`: Silently replaces the existing prompt with the new one.
* `"ignore"`: Keeps the original prompt and ignores the new registration attempt.


# Proxy Servers
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/proxy

Use FastMCP to act as an intermediary or change transport for other MCP servers.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

FastMCP provides a powerful proxying capability that allows one FastMCP server instance to act as a frontend for another MCP server (which could be remote, running on a different transport, or even another FastMCP instance). This is achieved using the `FastMCP.as_proxy()` class method.

## What is Proxying?

Proxying means setting up a FastMCP server that doesn't implement its own tools or resources directly. Instead, when it receives a request (like `tools/call` or `resources/read`), it forwards that request to a *backend* MCP server, receives the response, and then relays that response back to the original client.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientApp as Your Client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
    participant FastMCPProxy as FastMCP Proxy Server
    participant BackendServer as Backend MCP Server (e.g., remote SSE)

    ClientApp->>FastMCPProxy: MCP Request (e.g. stdio)
    Note over FastMCPProxy, BackendServer: Proxy forwards the request
    FastMCPProxy->>BackendServer: MCP Request (e.g. sse)
    BackendServer-->>FastMCPProxy: MCP Response (e.g. sse)
    Note over ClientApp, FastMCPProxy: Proxy relays the response
    FastMCPProxy-->>ClientApp: MCP Response (e.g. stdio)
```

### Key Benefits

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

* **Session Isolation**: Each request gets its own isolated session, ensuring safe concurrent operations
* **Transport Bridging**: Expose servers running on one transport via a different transport
* **Advanced MCP Features**: Automatic forwarding of sampling, elicitation, logging, and progress
* **Security**: Acts as a controlled gateway to backend servers
* **Simplicity**: Single endpoint even if backend location or transport changes

### Performance Considerations

When using proxy servers, especially those connecting to HTTP-based backend servers, be aware that latency can be significant. Operations like `list_tools()` may take hundreds of milliseconds compared to 1-2ms for local tools. When mounting proxy servers, this latency affects all operations on the parent server, not just interactions with the proxied tools.

If low latency is a requirement for your use-case, consider using [`import_server()`](/servers/composition#importing-static-composition) to copy tools at startup rather than proxying them at runtime.

## Quick Start

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

The recommended way to create a proxy is using `ProxyClient`, which provides full MCP feature support with automatic session isolation:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.proxy import ProxyClient

# Create a proxy with full MCP feature support
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(
    ProxyClient("backend_server.py"),
    name="MyProxy"
)

# Run the proxy (e.g., via stdio for Claude Desktop)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run()
```

This single setup gives you:

* Safe concurrent request handling
* Automatic forwarding of advanced MCP features (sampling, elicitation, etc.)
* Session isolation to prevent context mixing
* Full compatibility with all MCP clients

You can also pass a FastMCP [client transport](/clients/transports) (or parameter that can be inferred to a transport) to `as_proxy()`. This will automatically create a `ProxyClient` instance for you.

Finally, you can pass a regular FastMCP `Client` instance to `as_proxy()`. This will work for many use cases, but may break if advanced MCP features like sampling or elicitation are invoked by the server.

## Session Isolation & Concurrency

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

FastMCP proxies provide session isolation to ensure safe concurrent operations. The session strategy depends on how the proxy is configured:

### Fresh Sessions

When you pass a disconnected client (which is the normal case), each request gets its own isolated backend session:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.proxy import ProxyClient

# Each request creates a fresh backend session (recommended)
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(ProxyClient("backend_server.py"))

# Multiple clients can use this proxy simultaneously without interference:
# - Client A calls a tool -> gets isolated backend session
# - Client B calls a tool -> gets different isolated backend session  
# - No context mixing between requests
```

### Session Reuse with Connected Clients

When you pass an already-connected client, the proxy will reuse that session for all requests:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

# Create and connect a client
async with Client("backend_server.py") as connected_client:
    # This proxy will reuse the connected session for all requests
    proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(connected_client)
    
    # ⚠️ Warning: All requests share the same backend session
    # This may cause context mixing in concurrent scenarios
```

**Important**: Using shared sessions with concurrent requests from multiple clients may lead to context mixing and race conditions. This approach should only be used in single-threaded scenarios or when you have explicit synchronization.

## Transport Bridging

A common use case is bridging transports - exposing a server running on one transport via a different transport. For example, making a remote SSE server available locally via stdio:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.proxy import ProxyClient

# Bridge remote SSE server to local stdio
remote_proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(
    ProxyClient("http://example.com/mcp/sse"),
    name="Remote-to-Local Bridge"
)

# Run locally via stdio for Claude Desktop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    remote_proxy.run()  # Defaults to stdio transport
```

Or expose a local server via HTTP for remote access:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Bridge local server to HTTP
local_proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(
    ProxyClient("local_server.py"),
    name="Local-to-HTTP Bridge"
)

# Run via HTTP for remote clients
if __name__ == "__main__":
    local_proxy.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

## Advanced MCP Features

<VersionBadge version="2.10.3" />

`ProxyClient` automatically forwards advanced MCP protocol features between the backend server and clients connected to the proxy, ensuring full MCP compatibility.

### Supported Features

* **Roots**: Forwards filesystem root access requests to the client
* **Sampling**: Forwards LLM completion requests from backend to client
* **Elicitation**: Forwards user input requests to the client
* **Logging**: Forwards log messages from backend through to client
* **Progress**: Forwards progress notifications during long operations

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.proxy import ProxyClient

# ProxyClient automatically handles all these features
backend = ProxyClient("advanced_backend.py")
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(backend)

# When the backend server:
# - Requests LLM sampling -> forwarded to your client
# - Logs messages -> appear in your client
# - Reports progress -> shown in your client
# - Needs user input -> prompts your client
```

### Customizing Feature Support

You can selectively disable forwarding by passing `None` for specific handlers:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Disable sampling but keep other features
backend = ProxyClient(
    "backend_server.py",
    sampling_handler=None,  # Disable LLM sampling forwarding
    log_handler=None        # Disable log forwarding
)
```

When you use a transport string directly with `FastMCP.as_proxy()`, it automatically creates a `ProxyClient` internally to ensure full feature support.

## Configuration-Based Proxies

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

You can create a proxy directly from a configuration dictionary that follows the MCPConfig schema. This is useful for quickly setting up proxies to remote servers without manually configuring each connection detail.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a proxy directly from a config dictionary
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "default": {  # For single server configs, 'default' is commonly used
            "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        }
    }
}

# Create a proxy to the configured server (auto-creates ProxyClient)
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(config, name="Config-Based Proxy")

# Run the proxy with stdio transport for local access
if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy.run()
```

<Note>
  The MCPConfig format follows an emerging standard for MCP server configuration and may evolve as the specification matures. While FastMCP aims to maintain compatibility with future versions, be aware that field names or structure might change.
</Note>

### Multi-Server Configurations

You can create a proxy to multiple servers by specifying multiple entries in the config. They are automatically mounted with their config names as prefixes:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Multi-server configuration
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {
            "url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        },
        "calendar": {
            "url": "https://calendar-api.example.com/mcp",
            "transport": "http"
        }
    }
}

# Create a unified proxy to multiple servers
composite_proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(config, name="Composite Proxy")

# Tools, resources, prompts, and templates are accessible with prefixes:
# - Tools: weather_get_forecast, calendar_add_event
# - Prompts: weather_daily_summary, calendar_quick_add
# - Resources: weather://weather/icons/sunny, calendar://calendar/events/today
# - Templates: weather://weather/locations/{id}, calendar://calendar/events/{date}
```

## Component Prefixing

When proxying one or more servers, component names are prefixed the same way as with mounting and importing:

* Tools: `{prefix}_{tool_name}`
* Prompts: `{prefix}_{prompt_name}`
* Resources: `protocol://{prefix}/path/to/resource` (default path format)
* Resource templates: `protocol://{prefix}/...` and template names are also prefixed

These rules apply uniformly whether you:

* Mount a proxy on another server
* Create a multi-server proxy from an `MCPConfig`
* Use `FastMCP.as_proxy()` directly

For resource URI prefix formats (path vs legacy protocol style) and configuration options, see Server Composition → Resource Prefix Formats.

## Mirrored Components

<VersionBadge version="2.10.5" />

When you access tools, resources, or prompts from a proxy server, they are "mirrored" from the remote server. Mirrored components cannot be modified directly since they reflect the state of the remote server. For example, you can not simply "disable" a mirrored component.

However, you can create a copy of a mirrored component and store it as a new locally-defined component. Local components always take precedence over mirrored ones because the proxy server will check its own registry before it attempts to engage the remote server.

Therefore, to enable or disable a proxy tool, resource, or prompt, you should first create a local copy and add it to your own server. Here's an example of how to do that for a tool:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Create your own server
my_server = FastMCP("MyServer")

# Get a proxy server
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy("backend_server.py")

# Get mirrored components from proxy
mirrored_tool = await proxy.get_tool("useful_tool")

# Create a local copy that you can modify
local_tool = mirrored_tool.copy()

# Add the local copy to your server
my_server.add_tool(local_tool)

# Now you can disable YOUR copy
local_tool.disable()
```

## `FastMCPProxy` Class

Internally, `FastMCP.as_proxy()` uses the `FastMCPProxy` class. You generally don't need to interact with this class directly, but it's available if needed for advanced scenarios.

### Direct Usage

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.proxy import FastMCPProxy, ProxyClient

# Provide a client factory for explicit session control
def create_client():
    return ProxyClient("backend_server.py")

proxy = FastMCPProxy(client_factory=create_client)
```

### Parameters

* **`client`**: **\[DEPRECATED]** A `Client` instance. Use `client_factory` instead for explicit session management.
* **`client_factory`**: A callable that returns a `Client` instance when called. This gives you full control over session creation and reuse strategies.

### Explicit Session Management

`FastMCPProxy` requires explicit session management - no automatic detection is performed. You must choose your session strategy:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Share session across all requests (be careful with concurrency)
shared_client = ProxyClient("backend_server.py")
def shared_session_factory():
    return shared_client

proxy = FastMCPProxy(client_factory=shared_session_factory)

# Create fresh sessions per request (recommended)
def fresh_session_factory():
    return ProxyClient("backend_server.py")

proxy = FastMCPProxy(client_factory=fresh_session_factory)
```

For automatic session strategy selection, use the convenience method `FastMCP.as_proxy()` instead.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Custom factory with specific configuration
def custom_client_factory():
    client = ProxyClient("backend_server.py")
    # Add any custom configuration here
    return client

proxy = FastMCPProxy(client_factory=custom_client_factory)
```


# Resources & Templates
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources

Expose data sources and dynamic content generators to your MCP client.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Resources represent data or files that an MCP client can read, and resource templates extend this concept by allowing clients to request dynamically generated resources based on parameters passed in the URI.

FastMCP simplifies defining both static and dynamic resources, primarily using the `@mcp.resource` decorator.

## What Are Resources?

Resources provide read-only access to data for the LLM or client application. When a client requests a resource URI:

1. FastMCP finds the corresponding resource definition.
2. If it's dynamic (defined by a function), the function is executed.
3. The content (text, JSON, binary data) is returned to the client.

This allows LLMs to access files, database content, configuration, or dynamically generated information relevant to the conversation.

## Resources

### The `@resource` Decorator

The most common way to define a resource is by decorating a Python function. The decorator requires the resource's unique URI.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import json
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Basic dynamic resource returning a string
@mcp.resource("resource://greeting")
def get_greeting() -> str:
    """Provides a simple greeting message."""
    return "Hello from FastMCP Resources!"

# Resource returning JSON data (dict is auto-serialized)
@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> dict:
    """Provides application configuration as JSON."""
    return {
        "theme": "dark",
        "version": "1.2.0",
        "features": ["tools", "resources"],
    }
```

**Key Concepts:**

* **URI:** The first argument to `@resource` is the unique URI (e.g., `"resource://greeting"`) clients use to request this data.
* **Lazy Loading:** The decorated function (`get_greeting`, `get_config`) is only executed when a client specifically requests that resource URI via `resources/read`.
* **Inferred Metadata:** By default:
  * Resource Name: Taken from the function name (`get_greeting`).
  * Resource Description: Taken from the function's docstring.

#### Decorator Arguments

You can customize the resource's properties using arguments in the `@mcp.resource` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Example specifying metadata
@mcp.resource(
    uri="data://app-status",      # Explicit URI (required)
    name="ApplicationStatus",     # Custom name
    description="Provides the current status of the application.", # Custom description
    mime_type="application/json", # Explicit MIME type
    tags={"monitoring", "status"}, # Categorization tags
    meta={"version": "2.1", "team": "infrastructure"}  # Custom metadata
)
def get_application_status() -> dict:
    """Internal function description (ignored if description is provided above)."""
    return {"status": "ok", "uptime": 12345, "version": mcp.settings.version} # Example usage
```

<Card icon="code" title="@resource Decorator Arguments">
  <ParamField body="uri" type="str" required>
    The unique identifier for the resource
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="name" type="str | None">
    A human-readable name. If not provided, defaults to function name
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="description" type="str | None">
    Explanation of the resource. If not provided, defaults to docstring
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="mime_type" type="str | None">
    Specifies the content type. FastMCP often infers a default like `text/plain` or `application/json`, but explicit is better for non-text types
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="tags" type="set[str] | None">
    A set of strings used to categorize the resource. These can be used by the server and, in some cases, by clients to filter or group available resources.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="enabled" type="bool" default="True">

        If true, the resource is read-only and does not modify its environment.
      </ParamField>

      <ParamField body="idempotentHint" type="bool | None">
        If true, reading the resource repeatedly will have no additional effect on its environment.
      </ParamField>
    </Expandable>
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="meta" type="dict[str, Any] | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

    Optional meta information about the resource. This data is passed through to the MCP client as the `_meta` field of the client-side resource object and can be used for custom metadata, versioning, or other application-specific purposes.
  </ParamField>
</Card>

### Return Values

FastMCP automatically converts your function's return value into the appropriate MCP resource content:

* **`str`**: Sent as `TextResourceContents` (with `mime_type="text/plain"` by default).
* **`dict`, `list`, `pydantic.BaseModel`**: Automatically serialized to a JSON string and sent as `TextResourceContents` (with `mime_type="application/json"` by default).
* **`bytes`**: Base64 encoded and sent as `BlobResourceContents`. You should specify an appropriate `mime_type` (e.g., `"image/png"`, `"application/octet-stream"`).
* **`None`**: Results in an empty resource content list being returned.

### Disabling Resources

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

You can control the visibility and availability of resources and templates by enabling or disabling them. Disabled resources will not appear in the list of available resources or templates, and attempting to read a disabled resource will result in an "Unknown resource" error.

By default, all resources are enabled. You can disable a resource upon creation using the `enabled` parameter in the decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource("data://secret", enabled=False)
def get_secret_data():
    """This resource is currently disabled."""
    return "Secret data"
```

You can also toggle a resource's state programmatically after it has been created:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config(): return {"version": 1}

# Disable and re-enable the resource
get_config.disable()
get_config.enable()
```

### Accessing MCP Context

<VersionBadge version="2.2.5" />

Resources and resource templates can access additional MCP information and features through the `Context` object. To access it, add a parameter to your resource function with a type annotation of `Context`:

```python {6, 14} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

@mcp.resource("resource://system-status")
async def get_system_status(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Provides system status information."""
    return {
        "status": "operational",
        "request_id": ctx.request_id
    }

@mcp.resource("resource://{name}/details")
async def get_details(name: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Get details for a specific name."""
    return {
        "name": name,
        "accessed_at": ctx.request_id
    }
```

For full documentation on the Context object and all its capabilities, see the [Context documentation](/servers/context).

### Async Resources

Use `async def` for resource functions that perform I/O operations (e.g., reading from a database or network) to avoid blocking the server.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import aiofiles
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

@mcp.resource("file:///app/data/important_log.txt", mime_type="text/plain")
async def read_important_log() -> str:
    """Reads content from a specific log file asynchronously."""
    try:
        async with aiofiles.open("/app/data/important_log.txt", mode="r") as f:
            content = await f.read()
        return content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Log file not found."
```

### Resource Classes

While `@mcp.resource` is ideal for dynamic content, you can directly register pre-defined resources (like static files or simple text) using `mcp.add_resource()` and concrete `Resource` subclasses.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.resources import FileResource, TextResource, DirectoryResource

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# 1. Exposing a static file directly
readme_path = Path("./README.md").resolve()
if readme_path.exists():
    # Use a file:// URI scheme
    readme_resource = FileResource(
        uri=f"file://{readme_path.as_posix()}",
        path=readme_path, # Path to the actual file
        name="README File",
        description="The project's README.",
        mime_type="text/markdown",
        tags={"documentation"}
    )
    mcp.add_resource(readme_resource)

# 2. Exposing simple, predefined text
notice_resource = TextResource(
    uri="resource://notice",
    name="Important Notice",
    text="System maintenance scheduled for Sunday.",
    tags={"notification"}
)
mcp.add_resource(notice_resource)

# 3. Using a custom key different from the URI
special_resource = TextResource(
    uri="resource://common-notice",
    name="Special Notice",
    text="This is a special notice with a custom storage key.",
)
mcp.add_resource(special_resource, key="resource://custom-key")

# 4. Exposing a directory listing
data_dir_path = Path("./app_data").resolve()
if data_dir_path.is_dir():
    data_listing_resource = DirectoryResource(
        uri="resource://data-files",
        path=data_dir_path, # Path to the directory
        name="Data Directory Listing",
        description="Lists files available in the data directory.",
        recursive=False # Set to True to list subdirectories
    )
    mcp.add_resource(data_listing_resource) # Returns JSON list of files
```

**Common Resource Classes:**

* `TextResource`: For simple string content.
* `BinaryResource`: For raw `bytes` content.
* `FileResource`: Reads content from a local file path. Handles text/binary modes and lazy reading.
* `HttpResource`: Fetches content from an HTTP(S) URL (requires `httpx`).
* `DirectoryResource`: Lists files in a local directory (returns JSON).
* (`FunctionResource`: Internal class used by `@mcp.resource`).

Use these when the content is static or sourced directly from a file/URL, bypassing the need for a dedicated Python function.

#### Custom Resource Keys

<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

When adding resources directly with `mcp.add_resource()`, you can optionally provide a custom storage key:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Creating a resource with standard URI as the key
resource = TextResource(uri="resource://data")
mcp.add_resource(resource)  # Will be stored and accessed using "resource://data"

# Creating a resource with a custom key
special_resource = TextResource(uri="resource://special-data")
mcp.add_resource(special_resource, key="internal://data-v2")  # Will be stored and accessed using "internal://data-v2"
```

Note that this parameter is only available when using `add_resource()` directly and not through the `@resource` decorator, as URIs are provided explicitly when using the decorator.

### Notifications

<VersionBadge version="2.9.1" />

FastMCP automatically sends `notifications/resources/list_changed` notifications to connected clients when resources or templates are added, enabled, or disabled. This allows clients to stay up-to-date with the current resource set without manually polling for changes.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource("data://example")
def example_resource() -> str:
    return "Hello!"

# These operations trigger notifications:
mcp.add_resource(example_resource)  # Sends resources/list_changed notification
example_resource.disable()          # Sends resources/list_changed notification  
example_resource.enable()           # Sends resources/list_changed notification
```

Notifications are only sent when these operations occur within an active MCP request context (e.g., when called from within a tool or other MCP operation). Operations performed during server initialization do not trigger notifications.

Clients can handle these notifications using a [message handler](/clients/messages) to automatically refresh their resource lists or update their interfaces.

### Annotations

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

FastMCP allows you to add specialized metadata to your resources through annotations. These annotations communicate how resources behave to client applications without consuming token context in LLM prompts.

Annotations serve several purposes in client applications:

* Indicating whether resources are read-only or may have side effects
* Describing the safety profile of resources (idempotent vs. non-idempotent)
* Helping clients optimize caching and access patterns

You can add annotations to a resource using the `annotations` parameter in the `@mcp.resource` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource(
    "data://config",
    annotations={
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "idempotentHint": True
    }
)
def get_config() -> dict:
    """Get application configuration."""
    return {"version": "1.0", "debug": False}
```

FastMCP supports these standard annotations:

| Annotation       | Type    | Default | Purpose                                                           |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readOnlyHint`   | boolean | true    | Indicates if the resource only provides data without side effects |
| `idempotentHint` | boolean | true    | Indicates if repeated reads have the same effect as a single read |

Remember that annotations help make better user experiences but should be treated as advisory hints. They help client applications present appropriate UI elements and optimize access patterns, but won't enforce behavior on their own. Always focus on making your annotations accurately represent what your resource actually does.

## Resource Templates

Resource Templates allow clients to request resources whose content depends on parameters embedded in the URI. Define a template using the **same `@mcp.resource` decorator**, but include `{parameter_name}` placeholders in the URI string and add corresponding arguments to your function signature.

Resource templates share most configuration options with regular resources (name, description, mime\_type, tags, annotations), but add the ability to define URI parameters that map to function parameters.

Resource templates generate a new resource for each unique set of parameters, which means that resources can be dynamically created on-demand. For example, if the resource template `"user://profile/{name}"` is registered, MCP clients could request `"user://profile/ford"` or `"user://profile/marvin"` to retrieve either of those two user profiles as resources, without having to register each resource individually.

<Tip>
  Functions with `*args` are not supported as resource templates. However, unlike tools and prompts, resource templates do support `**kwargs` because the URI template defines specific parameter names that will be collected and passed as keyword arguments.
</Tip>

Here is a complete example that shows how to define two resource templates:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Template URI includes {city} placeholder
@mcp.resource("weather://{city}/current")
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Provides weather information for a specific city."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
    # Here we're using simplified logic for example purposes
    return {
        "city": city.capitalize(),
        "temperature": 22,
        "condition": "Sunny",
        "unit": "celsius"
    }

# Template with multiple parameters and annotations
@mcp.resource(
    "repos://{owner}/{repo}/info",
    annotations={
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "idempotentHint": True
    }
)
def get_repo_info(owner: str, repo: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves information about a GitHub repository."""
    # In a real implementation, this would call the GitHub API
    return {
        "owner": owner,
        "name": repo,
        "full_name": f"{owner}/{repo}",
        "stars": 120,
        "forks": 48
    }
```

With these two templates defined, clients can request a variety of resources:

* `weather://london/current` → Returns weather for London
* `weather://paris/current` → Returns weather for Paris
* `repos://jlowin/fastmcp/info` → Returns info about the jlowin/fastmcp repository
* `repos://prefecthq/prefect/info` → Returns info about the prefecthq/prefect repository

### RFC 6570 URI Templates

FastMCP implements [RFC 6570 URI Templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) for resource templates, providing a standardized way to define parameterized URIs. This includes support for simple expansion, wildcard path parameters, and form-style query parameters.

#### Wildcard Parameters

<VersionBadge version="2.2.4" />

Resource templates support wildcard parameters that can match multiple path segments. While standard parameters (`{param}`) only match a single path segment and don't cross "/" boundaries, wildcard parameters (`{param*}`) can capture multiple segments including slashes. Wildcards capture all subsequent path segments *up until* the defined part of the URI template (whether literal or another parameter). This allows you to have multiple wildcard parameters in a single URI template.

```python {15, 23} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")


# Standard parameter only matches one segment
@mcp.resource("files://{filename}")
def get_file(filename: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves a file by name."""
    # Will only match files://<single-segment>
    return f"File content for: {filename}"


# Wildcard parameter can match multiple segments
@mcp.resource("path://{filepath*}")
def get_path_content(filepath: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves content at a specific path."""
    # Can match path://docs/server/resources.mdx
    return f"Content at path: {filepath}"


# Mixing standard and wildcard parameters
@mcp.resource("repo://{owner}/{path*}/template.py")
def get_template_file(owner: str, path: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves a file from a specific repository and path, but
    only if the resource ends with `template.py`"""
    # Can match repo://jlowin/fastmcp/src/resources/template.py
    return {
        "owner": owner,
        "path": path + "/template.py",
        "content": f"File at {path}/template.py in {owner}'s repository"
    }
```

Wildcard parameters are useful when:

* Working with file paths or hierarchical data
* Creating APIs that need to capture variable-length path segments
* Building URL-like patterns similar to REST APIs

Note that like regular parameters, each wildcard parameter must still be a named parameter in your function signature, and all required function parameters must appear in the URI template.

#### Query Parameters

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

FastMCP supports RFC 6570 form-style query parameters using the `{?param1,param2}` syntax. Query parameters provide a clean way to pass optional configuration to resources without cluttering the path.

Query parameters must be optional function parameters (have default values), while path parameters map to required function parameters. This enforces a clear separation: required data goes in the path, optional configuration in query params.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Basic query parameters
@mcp.resource("data://{id}{?format}")
def get_data(id: str, format: str = "json") -> str:
    """Retrieve data in specified format."""
    if format == "xml":
        return f"<data id='{id}' />"
    return f'{{"id": "{id}"}}'

# Multiple query parameters with type coercion
@mcp.resource("api://{endpoint}{?version,limit,offset}")
def call_api(endpoint: str, version: int = 1, limit: int = 10, offset: int = 0) -> dict:
    """Call API endpoint with pagination."""
    return {
        "endpoint": endpoint,
        "version": version,
        "limit": limit,
        "offset": offset,
        "results": fetch_results(endpoint, version, limit, offset)
    }

# Query parameters with wildcards
@mcp.resource("files://{path*}{?encoding,lines}")
def read_file(path: str, encoding: str = "utf-8", lines: int = 100) -> str:
    """Read file with optional encoding and line limit."""
    return read_file_content(path, encoding, lines)
```

**Example requests:**

* `data://123` → Uses default format `"json"`
* `data://123?format=xml` → Uses format `"xml"`
* `api://users?version=2&limit=50` → `version=2, limit=50, offset=0`
* `files://src/main.py?encoding=ascii&lines=50` → Custom encoding and line limit

FastMCP automatically coerces query parameter string values to the correct types based on your function's type hints (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`).

**Query parameters vs. hidden defaults:**

Query parameters expose optional configuration to clients. To hide optional parameters from clients entirely (always use defaults), simply omit them from the URI template:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Clients CAN override max_results via query string
@mcp.resource("search://{query}{?max_results}")
def search_configurable(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> dict:
    return {"query": query, "limit": max_results}

# Clients CANNOT override max_results (not in URI template)
@mcp.resource("search://{query}")
def search_fixed(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> dict:
    return {"query": query, "limit": max_results}
```

### Template Parameter Rules

<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

FastMCP enforces these validation rules when creating resource templates:

1. **Required function parameters** (no default values) must appear in the URI path template
2. **Query parameters** (specified with `{?param}` syntax) must be optional function parameters with default values
3. **All URI template parameters** (path and query) must exist as function parameters

Optional function parameters (those with default values) can be:

* Included as query parameters (`{?param}`) - clients can override via query string
* Omitted from URI template - always uses default value, not exposed to clients
* Used in alternative path templates - enables multiple ways to access the same resource

**Multiple templates for one function:**

Create multiple resource templates that expose the same function through different URI patterns by manually applying decorators:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

# Define a user lookup function that can be accessed by different identifiers
def lookup_user(name: str | None = None, email: str | None = None) -> dict:
    """Look up a user by either name or email."""
    if email:
        return find_user_by_email(email)  # pseudocode
    elif name:
        return find_user_by_name(name)  # pseudocode
    else:
        return {"error": "No lookup parameters provided"}

# Manually apply multiple decorators to the same function
mcp.resource("users://email/{email}")(lookup_user)
mcp.resource("users://name/{name}")(lookup_user)
```

Now an LLM or client can retrieve user information in two different ways:

* `users://email/alice@example.com` → Looks up user by email (with name=None)
* `users://name/Bob` → Looks up user by name (with email=None)

This approach allows a single function to be registered with multiple URI patterns while keeping the implementation clean and straightforward.

Templates provide a powerful way to expose parameterized data access points following REST-like principles.

## Error Handling

<VersionBadge version="2.4.1" />

If your resource function encounters an error, you can raise a standard Python exception (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, custom exceptions, etc.) or a FastMCP `ResourceError`.

By default, all exceptions (including their details) are logged and converted into an MCP error response to be sent back to the client LLM. This helps the LLM understand failures and react appropriately.

If you want to mask internal error details for security reasons, you can:

1. Use the `mask_error_details=True` parameter when creating your `FastMCP` instance:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP(name="SecureServer", mask_error_details=True)
```

2. Or use `ResourceError` to explicitly control what error information is sent to clients:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.exceptions import ResourceError

mcp = FastMCP(name="DataServer")

@mcp.resource("resource://safe-error")
def fail_with_details() -> str:
    """This resource provides detailed error information."""
    # ResourceError contents are always sent back to clients,
    # regardless of mask_error_details setting
    raise ResourceError("Unable to retrieve data: file not found")

@mcp.resource("resource://masked-error")
def fail_with_masked_details() -> str:
    """This resource masks internal error details when mask_error_details=True."""
    # This message would be masked if mask_error_details=True
    raise ValueError("Sensitive internal file path: /etc/secrets.conf")

@mcp.resource("data://{id}")
def get_data_by_id(id: str) -> dict:
    """Template resources also support the same error handling pattern."""
    if id == "secure":
        raise ValueError("Cannot access secure data")
    elif id == "missing":
        raise ResourceError("Data ID 'missing' not found in database")
    return {"id": id, "value": "data"}
```

When `mask_error_details=True`, only error messages from `ResourceError` will include details, other exceptions will be converted to a generic message.

## Server Behavior

### Duplicate Resources

<VersionBadge version="2.1.0" />

You can configure how the FastMCP server handles attempts to register multiple resources or templates with the same URI. Use the `on_duplicate_resources` setting during `FastMCP` initialization.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    name="ResourceServer",
    on_duplicate_resources="error" # Raise error on duplicates
)

@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config_v1(): return {"version": 1}

# This registration attempt will raise a ValueError because
# "data://config" is already registered and the behavior is "error".
# @mcp.resource("data://config")
# def get_config_v2(): return {"version": 2}
```

The duplicate behavior options are:

* `"warn"` (default): Logs a warning, and the new resource/template replaces the old one.
* `"error"`: Raises a `ValueError`, preventing the duplicate registration.
* `"replace"`: Silently replaces the existing resource/template with the new one.
* `"ignore"`: Keeps the original resource/template and ignores the new registration attempt.


# LLM Sampling
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/sampling

Request LLM text generation from the client or a configured provider through the MCP context.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

LLM sampling allows MCP tools to request LLM text generation based on provided messages. By default, sampling requests are sent to the client's LLM, but you can also configure a fallback handler or always use a specific LLM provider. This is useful when tools need to leverage LLM capabilities to process data, generate responses, or perform text-based analysis.

## Why Use LLM Sampling?

LLM sampling enables tools to:

* **Leverage AI capabilities**: Use the client's LLM for text generation and analysis
* **Offload complex reasoning**: Let the LLM handle tasks requiring natural language understanding
* **Generate dynamic content**: Create responses, summaries, or transformations based on data
* **Maintain context**: Use the same LLM instance that the user is already interacting with

### Basic Usage

Use `ctx.sample()` to request text generation from the client's LLM:

```python {14} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("SamplingDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def analyze_sentiment(text: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Analyze the sentiment of text using the client's LLM."""
    prompt = f"""Analyze the sentiment of the following text as positive, negative, or neutral. 
    Just output a single word - 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral'.
    
    Text to analyze: {text}"""
    
    # Request LLM analysis
    response = await ctx.sample(prompt)
    
    # Process the LLM's response
    sentiment = response.text.strip().lower()
    
    # Map to standard sentiment values
    if "positive" in sentiment:
        sentiment = "positive"
    elif "negative" in sentiment:
        sentiment = "negative"
    else:
        sentiment = "neutral"
    
    return {"text": text, "sentiment": sentiment}
```

## Simple Text Generation

### Basic Prompting

Generate text with simple string prompts:

```python {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def generate_summary(content: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generate a summary of the provided content."""
    prompt = f"Please provide a concise summary of the following content:\n\n{content}"
    
    response = await ctx.sample(prompt)
    return response.text
```

### System Prompt

Use system prompts to guide the LLM's behavior:

````python {4-9} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def generate_code_example(concept: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generate a Python code example for a given concept."""
    response = await ctx.sample(
        messages=f"Write a simple Python code example demonstrating '{concept}'.",
        system_prompt="You are an expert Python programmer. Provide concise, working code examples without explanations.",
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=300
    )
    
    code_example = response.text
    return f"```python\n{code_example}\n```"
````

### Model Preferences

Specify model preferences for different use cases:

```python {4-8, 17-22} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
async def creative_writing(topic: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generate creative content using a specific model."""
    response = await ctx.sample(
        messages=f"Write a creative short story about {topic}",
        model_preferences="claude-3-sonnet",  # Prefer a specific model
        include_context="thisServer",  # Use the server's context
        temperature=0.9,  # High creativity
        max_tokens=1000
    )
    
    return response.text

@mcp.tool
async def technical_analysis(data: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Perform technical analysis with a reasoning-focused model."""
    response = await ctx.sample(
        messages=f"Analyze this technical data and provide insights: {data}",
        model_preferences=["claude-3-opus", "gpt-4"],  # Prefer reasoning models
        temperature=0.2,  # Low randomness for consistency
        max_tokens=800
    )
    
    return response.text
```

### Complex Message Structures

Use structured messages for more complex interactions:

```python {1, 6-10} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.sampling import SamplingMessage

@mcp.tool
async def multi_turn_analysis(user_query: str, context_data: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Perform analysis using multi-turn conversation structure."""
    messages = [
        SamplingMessage(role="user", content=f"I have this data: {context_data}"),
        SamplingMessage(role="assistant", content="I can see your data. What would you like me to analyze?"),
        SamplingMessage(role="user", content=user_query)
    ]
    
    response = await ctx.sample(
        messages=messages,
        system_prompt="You are a data analyst. Provide detailed insights based on the conversation context.",
        temperature=0.3
    )
    
    return response.text
```

## Sampling Fallback Handler

Client support for sampling is optional. If the client does not support sampling, the server will report an error indicating that the client does not support sampling.

However, you can provide a `sampling_handler` to the FastMCP server, which sends sampling requests directly to an LLM provider instead of routing through the client. The `sampling_handler_behavior` parameter controls when this handler is used:

* **`"fallback"`** (default): Uses the handler only when the client doesn't support sampling. Requests go to the client first, falling back to the handler if needed.
* **`"always"`**: Always uses the handler, bypassing the client entirely. Useful when you want full control over the LLM used for sampling.

Sampling handlers can be implemented using any LLM provider, but a sample implementation for OpenAI is provided as a Contrib module. Sampling lacks the full capabilities of typical LLM completions. For this reason, the OpenAI sampling handler, pointed at a third-party provider's OpenAI-compatible API, is often sufficient to implement a sampling handler.

### Fallback Mode (Default)

Uses the handler only when the client doesn't support sampling:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import asyncio
import os

from mcp.types import ContentBlock
from openai import OpenAI

from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.experimental.sampling.handlers.openai import OpenAISamplingHandler
from fastmcp.server.context import Context


async def async_main():
    server = FastMCP(
        name="OpenAI Sampling Fallback Example",
        sampling_handler=OpenAISamplingHandler(
            default_model="gpt-4o-mini",
            client=OpenAI(
                api_key=os.getenv("API_KEY"),
                base_url=os.getenv("BASE_URL"),
            ),
        ),
        sampling_handler_behavior="fallback",  # Default - only use when client doesn't support sampling
    )

    @server.tool
    async def test_sample_fallback(ctx: Context) -> ContentBlock:
        # Will use client's LLM if available, otherwise falls back to the handler
        return await ctx.sample(
            messages=["hello world!"],
        )

    await server.run_http_async()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(async_main())
```

### Always Mode

Always uses the handler, bypassing the client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
server = FastMCP(
    name="Server-Controlled Sampling",
    sampling_handler=OpenAISamplingHandler(
        default_model="gpt-4o-mini",
        client=OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("API_KEY")),
    ),
    sampling_handler_behavior="always",  # Always use the handler, never the client
)

@server.tool
async def analyze_data(data: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    # Will ALWAYS use the server's configured LLM, not the client's
    result = await ctx.sample(
        messages=f"Analyze this data: {data}",
        system_prompt="You are a data analyst.",
    )
    return result.text
```

## Client Requirements

By default, LLM sampling requires client support:

* Clients must implement sampling handlers to process requests (see [Client Sampling](/clients/sampling))
* If the client doesn't support sampling and no fallback handler is configured, `ctx.sample()` will raise an error
* Configure a `sampling_handler` with `sampling_handler_behavior="fallback"` to automatically handle clients that don't support sampling
* Use `sampling_handler_behavior="always"` to completely bypass the client and control which LLM is used


# The FastMCP Server
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/server

The core FastMCP server class for building MCP applications with tools, resources, and prompts.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

The central piece of a FastMCP application is the `FastMCP` server class. This class acts as the main container for your application's tools, resources, and prompts, and manages communication with MCP clients.

## Creating a Server

Instantiating a server is straightforward. You typically provide a name for your server, which helps identify it in client applications or logs.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a basic server instance
mcp = FastMCP(name="MyAssistantServer")

# You can also add instructions for how to interact with the server
mcp_with_instructions = FastMCP(
    name="HelpfulAssistant",
    instructions="""
        This server provides data analysis tools.
        Call get_average() to analyze numerical data.
    """,
)
```

The `FastMCP` constructor accepts several arguments:

<Card icon="code" title="FastMCP Constructor Parameters">
  <ParamField body="name" type="str" default="FastMCP">
    A human-readable name for your server
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="instructions" type="str | None">
    Description of how to interact with this server. These instructions help clients understand the server's purpose and available functionality
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="version" type="str | None">
    Version string for your server. If not provided, defaults to the FastMCP library version
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="website_url" type="str | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.14.0" />

    URL to a website with more information about your server. Displayed in client applications
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="icons" type="list[Icon] | None">
    <VersionBadge version="2.14.0" />

    List of icon representations for your server. Icons help users visually identify your server in client applications. See [Icons](/servers/icons) for detailed examples
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="auth" type="OAuthProvider | TokenVerifier | None">
    Authentication provider for securing HTTP-based transports. See [Authentication](/servers/auth/authentication) for configuration options
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="lifespan" type="AsyncContextManager | None">
    An async context manager function for server startup and shutdown logic
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="tools" type="list[Tool | Callable] | None">
    A list of tools (or functions to convert to tools) to add to the server. In some cases, providing tools programmatically may be more convenient than using the `@mcp.tool` decorator
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="include_tags" type="set[str] | None">
    Only expose components with at least one matching tag
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="exclude_tags" type="set[str] | None">
    Hide components with any matching tag
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="on_duplicate_tools" type="Literal[&#x22;error&#x22;, &#x22;warn&#x22;, &#x22;replace&#x22;]" default="error">
    How to handle duplicate tool registrations
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="on_duplicate_resources" type="Literal[&#x22;error&#x22;, &#x22;warn&#x22;, &#x22;replace&#x22;]" default="warn">
    How to handle duplicate resource registrations
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="on_duplicate_prompts" type="Literal[&#x22;error&#x22;, &#x22;warn&#x22;, &#x22;replace&#x22;]" default="replace">
    How to handle duplicate prompt registrations
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="strict_input_validation" type="bool" default="False">
    <VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

    Controls how tool input parameters are validated. When `False` (default), FastMCP uses Pydantic's flexible validation that coerces compatible inputs (e.g., `"10"` → `10` for int parameters). When `True`, uses the MCP SDK's JSON Schema validation to validate inputs against the exact schema before passing them to your function, rejecting any type mismatches. The default mode improves compatibility with LLM clients while maintaining type safety. See [Input Validation Modes](/servers/tools#input-validation-modes) for details
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField body="include_fastmcp_meta" type="bool" default="True">
    <VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

    Whether to include FastMCP metadata in component responses. When `True`, component tags and other FastMCP-specific metadata are included in the `_fastmcp` namespace within each component's `meta` field. When `False`, this metadata is omitted, resulting in cleaner integration with external systems. Can be overridden globally via `FASTMCP_INCLUDE_FASTMCP_META` environment variable
  </ParamField>
</Card>

## Components

FastMCP servers expose several types of components to the client:

### Tools

Tools are functions that the client can call to perform actions or access external systems.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiplies two numbers together."""
    return a * b
```

See [Tools](/servers/tools) for detailed documentation.

### Resources

Resources expose data sources that the client can read.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> dict:
    """Provides the application configuration."""
    return {"theme": "dark", "version": "1.0"}
```

See [Resources & Templates](/servers/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Resource Templates

Resource templates are parameterized resources that allow the client to request specific data.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
def get_user_profile(user_id: int) -> dict:
    """Retrieves a user's profile by ID."""
    # The {user_id} in the URI is extracted and passed to this function
    return {"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}", "status": "active"}
```

See [Resources & Templates](/servers/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable message templates for guiding the LLM.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.prompt
def analyze_data(data_points: list[float]) -> str:
    """Creates a prompt asking for analysis of numerical data."""
    formatted_data = ", ".join(str(point) for point in data_points)
    return f"Please analyze these data points: {formatted_data}"
```

See [Prompts](/servers/prompts) for detailed documentation.

## Tag-Based Filtering

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

FastMCP supports tag-based filtering to selectively expose components based on configurable include/exclude tag sets. This is useful for creating different views of your server for different environments or users.

Components can be tagged when defined using the `tags` parameter:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(tags={"public", "utility"})
def public_tool() -> str:
    return "This tool is public"

@mcp.tool(tags={"internal", "admin"})
def admin_tool() -> str:
    return "This tool is for admins only"
```

The filtering logic works as follows:

* **Include tags**: If specified, only components with at least one matching tag are exposed
* **Exclude tags**: Components with any matching tag are filtered out
* **Precedence**: Exclude tags always take priority over include tags

<Tip>
  To ensure a component is never exposed, you can set `enabled=False` on the component itself. To learn more, see the component-specific documentation.
</Tip>

You configure tag-based filtering when creating your server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Only expose components tagged with "public"
mcp = FastMCP(include_tags={"public"})

# Hide components tagged as "internal" or "deprecated"  
mcp = FastMCP(exclude_tags={"internal", "deprecated"})

# Combine both: show admin tools but hide deprecated ones
mcp = FastMCP(include_tags={"admin"}, exclude_tags={"deprecated"})
```

This filtering applies to all component types (tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts) and affects both listing and access.

## Running the Server

FastMCP servers need a transport mechanism to communicate with clients. You typically start your server by calling the `mcp.run()` method on your `FastMCP` instance, often within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block in your main server script. This pattern ensures compatibility with various MCP clients.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# my_server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This runs the server, defaulting to STDIO transport
    mcp.run()
    
    # To use a different transport, e.g., HTTP:
    # mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=9000)
```

FastMCP supports several transport options:

* STDIO (default, for local tools)
* HTTP (recommended for web services, uses Streamable HTTP protocol)
* SSE (legacy web transport, deprecated)

The server can also be run using the FastMCP CLI.

For detailed information on each transport, how to configure them (host, port, paths), and when to use which, please refer to the [**Running Your FastMCP Server**](/deployment/running-server) guide.

## Custom Routes

When running your server with HTTP transport, you can add custom web routes alongside your MCP endpoint using the `@custom_route` decorator. This is useful for simple endpoints like health checks that need to be served alongside your MCP server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse

mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")

@mcp.custom_route("/health", methods=["GET"])
async def health_check(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    return PlainTextResponse("OK")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http")  # Health check at http://localhost:8000/health
```

Custom routes are served alongside your MCP endpoint and are useful for:

* Health check endpoints for monitoring
* Simple status or info endpoints
* Basic webhooks or callbacks

For more complex web applications, consider [mounting your MCP server into a FastAPI or Starlette app](/deployment/http#integration-with-web-frameworks).

## Composing Servers

<VersionBadge version="2.2.0" />

FastMCP supports composing multiple servers together using `import_server` (static copy) and `mount` (live link). This allows you to organize large applications into modular components or reuse existing servers.

See the [Server Composition](/servers/composition) guide for full details, best practices, and examples.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Example: Importing a subserver
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import asyncio

main = FastMCP(name="Main")
sub = FastMCP(name="Sub")

@sub.tool
def hello(): 
    return "hi"

# Mount directly
main.mount(sub, prefix="sub")
```

## Proxying Servers

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

FastMCP can act as a proxy for any MCP server (local or remote) using `FastMCP.as_proxy`, letting you bridge transports or add a frontend to existing servers. For example, you can expose a remote SSE server locally via stdio, or vice versa.

Proxies automatically handle concurrent operations safely by creating fresh sessions for each request when using disconnected clients.

See the [Proxying Servers](/servers/proxy) guide for details and advanced usage.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

backend = Client("http://example.com/mcp/sse")
proxy = FastMCP.as_proxy(backend, name="ProxyServer")
# Now use the proxy like any FastMCP server
```

## OpenAPI Integration

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

FastMCP can automatically generate servers from OpenAPI specifications or existing FastAPI applications using `FastMCP.from_openapi()` and `FastMCP.from_fastapi()`. This allows you to instantly convert existing APIs into MCP servers without manual tool creation.

See the [FastAPI Integration](/integrations/fastapi) and [OpenAPI Integration](/integrations/openapi) guides for detailed examples and configuration options.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import httpx
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# From OpenAPI spec
spec = httpx.get("https://api.example.com/openapi.json").json()
mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(openapi_spec=spec, client=httpx.AsyncClient())

# From FastAPI app
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(app=app)
```

## Server Configuration

Servers can be configured using a combination of initialization arguments, global settings, and transport-specific settings.

### Server-Specific Configuration

Server-specific settings are passed when creating the `FastMCP` instance and control server behavior:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Configure server-specific settings
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="ConfiguredServer",
    include_tags={"public", "api"},              # Only expose these tagged components
    exclude_tags={"internal", "deprecated"},     # Hide these tagged components
    on_duplicate_tools="error",                  # Handle duplicate registrations
    on_duplicate_resources="warn",
    on_duplicate_prompts="replace",
    include_fastmcp_meta=False,                  # Disable FastMCP metadata for cleaner integration
)
```

### Global Settings

Global settings affect all FastMCP servers and can be configured via environment variables (prefixed with `FASTMCP_`) or in a `.env` file:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import fastmcp

# Access global settings
print(fastmcp.settings.log_level)        # Default: "INFO"
print(fastmcp.settings.mask_error_details)  # Default: False
print(fastmcp.settings.resource_prefix_format)  # Default: "path"
print(fastmcp.settings.strict_input_validation)  # Default: False
print(fastmcp.settings.include_fastmcp_meta)   # Default: True
```

Common global settings include:

* **`log_level`**: Logging level ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"), set with `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`
* **`mask_error_details`**: Whether to hide detailed error information from clients, set with `FASTMCP_MASK_ERROR_DETAILS`
* **`resource_prefix_format`**: How to format resource prefixes ("path" or "protocol"), set with `FASTMCP_RESOURCE_PREFIX_FORMAT`
* **`strict_input_validation`**: Controls tool input validation mode (default: False for flexible coercion), set with `FASTMCP_STRICT_INPUT_VALIDATION`. See [Input Validation Modes](/servers/tools#input-validation-modes)
* **`include_fastmcp_meta`**: Whether to include FastMCP metadata in component responses (default: True), set with `FASTMCP_INCLUDE_FASTMCP_META`
* **`env_file`**: Path to the environment file to load settings from (default: ".env"), set with `FASTMCP_ENV_FILE`. Useful when your project uses a `.env` file with syntax incompatible with python-dotenv

### Transport-Specific Configuration

Transport settings are provided when running the server and control network behavior:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Configure transport when running
mcp.run(
    transport="http",
    host="0.0.0.0",           # Bind to all interfaces
    port=9000,                # Custom port
    log_level="DEBUG",        # Override global log level
)

# Or for async usage
await mcp.run_async(
    transport="http", 
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8080,
)
```

### Setting Global Configuration

Global FastMCP settings can be configured via environment variables (prefixed with `FASTMCP_`):

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Configure global FastMCP behavior
export FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export FASTMCP_MASK_ERROR_DETAILS=True
export FASTMCP_RESOURCE_PREFIX_FORMAT=protocol
export FASTMCP_STRICT_INPUT_VALIDATION=False
export FASTMCP_INCLUDE_FASTMCP_META=False
```

### Custom Tool Serialization

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

By default, FastMCP serializes tool return values to JSON when they need to be converted to text. You can customize this behavior by providing a `tool_serializer` function when creating your server:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import yaml
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Define a custom serializer that formats dictionaries as YAML
def yaml_serializer(data):
    return yaml.dump(data, sort_keys=False)

# Create a server with the custom serializer
mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", tool_serializer=yaml_serializer)

@mcp.tool
def get_config():
    """Returns configuration in YAML format."""
    return {"api_key": "abc123", "debug": True, "rate_limit": 100}
```

The serializer function takes any data object and returns a string representation. This is applied to **all non-string return values** from your tools. Tools that already return strings bypass the serializer.

This customization is useful when you want to:

* Format data in a specific way (like YAML or custom formats)
* Control specific serialization options (like indentation or sorting)
* Add metadata or transform data before sending it to clients

<Tip>
  If the serializer function raises an exception, the tool will fall back to the default JSON serialization to avoid breaking the server.

# Storage Backends
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/storage-backends

Configure persistent and distributed storage for caching and OAuth state management

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

FastMCP uses pluggable storage backends for caching responses and managing OAuth state. By default, all storage is in-memory, which is perfect for development but doesn't persist across restarts. FastMCP includes support for multiple storage backends, and you can easily extend it with custom implementations.

<Tip>
  The storage layer is powered by **[py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value)**, an async key-value library maintained by a core FastMCP maintainer. This library provides a unified interface for multiple backends, making it easy to swap implementations based on your deployment needs.
</Tip>

## Available Backends

### In-Memory Storage

**Best for:** Development, testing, single-process deployments

In-memory storage is the default for all FastMCP storage needs. It's fast, requires no setup, and is perfect for getting started.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from key_value.aio.stores.memory import MemoryStore

# Used by default - no configuration needed
# But you can also be explicit:
cache_store = MemoryStore()
```

**Characteristics:**

* ✅ No setup required
* ✅ Very fast
* ❌ Data lost on restart
* ❌ Not suitable for multi-process deployments

### Disk Storage

**Best for:** Single-server production deployments, persistent caching

Disk storage persists data to the filesystem, allowing it to survive server restarts.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware

# Persistent response cache
middleware = ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    cache_storage=DiskStore(directory="/var/cache/fastmcp")
)
```

Or with OAuth token storage:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-id",
    client_secret="your-secret",
    base_url="https://your-server.com",
    client_storage=DiskStore(directory="/var/lib/fastmcp/oauth")
)
```

**Characteristics:**

* ✅ Data persists across restarts
* ✅ Good performance for moderate load
* ❌ Not suitable for distributed deployments
* ❌ Filesystem access required

### Redis

**Best for:** Distributed production deployments, shared caching across multiple servers

<Note>
  Redis support requires an optional dependency: `pip install 'py-key-value-aio[redis]'`
</Note>

Redis provides distributed caching and state management, ideal for production deployments with multiple server instances.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware

# Distributed response cache
middleware = ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    cache_storage=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379)
)
```

With authentication:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore

cache_store = RedisStore(
    host="redis.example.com",
    port=6379,
    password="your-redis-password"
)
```

For OAuth token storage:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    base_url="https://your-server.com",
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    client_storage=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379)
)
```

**Characteristics:**

* ✅ Distributed and highly available
* ✅ Fast in-memory performance
* ✅ Works across multiple server instances
* ✅ Built-in TTL support
* ❌ Requires Redis infrastructure
* ❌ Network latency vs local storage

### Other Backends from py-key-value-aio

The py-key-value-aio library includes additional implementations for various storage systems:

* **DynamoDB** - AWS distributed database
* **MongoDB** - NoSQL document store
* **Elasticsearch** - Distributed search and analytics
* **Memcached** - Distributed memory caching
* **RocksDB** - Embedded high-performance key-value store
* **Valkey** - Redis-compatible server

For configuration details on these backends, consult the [py-key-value-aio documentation](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value).

<Warning>
  Before using these backends in production, review the [py-key-value documentation](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value) to understand the maturity level and limitations of your chosen backend. Some backends may be in preview or have specific constraints that make them unsuitable for production use.
</Warning>

## Use Cases in FastMCP

### Server-Side OAuth Token Storage

The [OAuth Proxy](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) and OAuth auth providers use storage for persisting OAuth client registrations and upstream tokens. **By default, storage is automatically encrypted using `FernetEncryptionWrapper`.** When providing custom storage, wrap it in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest.

**Development (default behavior):**

By default, FastMCP automatically manages keys and storage based on your platform:

* **Mac/Windows**: Keys are auto-managed via system keyring, storage defaults to disk. Suitable **only** for development and local testing.
* **Linux**: Keys are ephemeral, storage defaults to memory.

No configuration needed:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-id",
    client_secret="your-secret",
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)
```

**Production:**

For production deployments, configure explicit keys and persistent network-accessible storage with encryption:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import os
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"],
    base_url="https://your-server.com",
    # Explicit JWT signing key (required for production)
    jwt_signing_key=os.environ["JWT_SIGNING_KEY"],
    # Encrypted persistent storage (required for production)
    client_storage=FernetEncryptionWrapper(
        key_value=RedisStore(host="redis.example.com", port=6379),
        fernet=Fernet(os.environ["STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
    )
)
```

Both parameters are required for production. **Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` to encrypt sensitive OAuth tokens at rest** - without it, tokens are stored in plaintext. See [OAuth Token Security](/deployment/http#oauth-token-security) and [Key and Storage Management](/servers/auth/oauth-proxy#key-and-storage-management) for complete setup details.

### Response Caching Middleware

The [Response Caching Middleware](/servers/middleware#caching-middleware) caches tool calls, resource reads, and prompt requests. Storage configuration is passed via the `cache_storage` parameter:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

# Cache to disk instead of memory
mcp.add_middleware(ResponseCachingMiddleware(
    cache_storage=DiskStore(directory="cache")
))
```

For multi-server deployments sharing a Redis instance:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.middleware.caching import ResponseCachingMiddleware
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.prefix_collections import PrefixCollectionsWrapper

base_store = RedisStore(host="redis.example.com")
namespaced_store = PrefixCollectionsWrapper(
    key_value=base_store,
    prefix="my-server"
)

middleware = ResponseCachingMiddleware(cache_storage=namespaced_store)
```

### Client-Side OAuth Token Storage

The [FastMCP Client](/clients/client) uses storage for persisting OAuth tokens locally. By default, tokens are stored in memory:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuthClientProvider
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore

# Store tokens on disk for persistence across restarts
token_storage = DiskStore(directory="~/.local/share/fastmcp/tokens")

oauth_provider = OAuthClientProvider(
    mcp_url="https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp/sse",
    token_storage=token_storage
)
```

This allows clients to reconnect without re-authenticating after restarts.

## Choosing a Backend

| Backend  | Development | Single Server | Multi-Server | Cloud Native |

# Tools
Source: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools

Expose functions as executable capabilities for your MCP client.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

Tools are the core building blocks that allow your LLM to interact with external systems, execute code, and access data that isn't in its training data. In FastMCP, tools are Python functions exposed to LLMs through the MCP protocol.

Tools in FastMCP transform regular Python functions into capabilities that LLMs can invoke during conversations. When an LLM decides to use a tool:

1. It sends a request with parameters based on the tool's schema.
2. FastMCP validates these parameters against your function's signature.
3. Your function executes with the validated inputs.
4. The result is returned to the LLM, which can use it in its response.

This allows LLMs to perform tasks like querying databases, calling APIs, making calculations, or accessing files—extending their capabilities beyond what's in their training data.

## The `@tool` Decorator

Creating a tool is as simple as decorating a Python function with `@mcp.tool`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="CalculatorServer")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two integer numbers together."""
    return a + b
```

When this tool is registered, FastMCP automatically:

* Uses the function name (`add`) as the tool name.
* Uses the function's docstring (`Adds two integer numbers...`) as the tool description.
* Generates an input schema based on the function's parameters and type annotations.
* Handles parameter validation and error reporting.

The way you define your Python function dictates how the tool appears and behaves for the LLM client.

<Tip>
  Functions with `*args` or `**kwargs` are not supported as tools. This restriction exists because FastMCP needs to generate a complete parameter schema for the MCP protocol, which isn't possible with variable argument lists.
</Tip>

### Decorator Arguments

While FastMCP infers the name and description from your function, you can override these and add additional metadata using arguments to the `@mcp.tool` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(
    name="find_products",           # Custom tool name for the LLM
    description="Search the product catalog with optional category filtering.", # Custom description
    tags={"catalog", "search"},      # Optional tags for organization/filtering
    meta={"version": "1.2", "author": "product-team"}  # Custom metadata
)
def search_products_implementation(query: str, category: str | None = None) -> list[dict]:
    """Internal function description (ignored if description is provided above)."""
    # Implementation...
    print(f"Searching for '{query}' in category '{category}'")
    return [{"id": 2, "name": "Another Product"}]
```

### Async Support

FastMCP is an async-first framework that seamlessly supports both asynchronous (`async def`) and synchronous (`def`) functions as tools. Async tools are preferred for I/O-bound operations to keep your server responsive.

While synchronous tools work seamlessly in FastMCP, they can block the event loop during execution. For CPU-intensive or potentially blocking synchronous operations, consider alternative strategies. One approach is to use `anyio` (which FastMCP already uses internally) to wrap them as async functions, for example:

```python {1, 13} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import anyio
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP()

def cpu_intensive_task(data: str) -> str:
    # Some heavy computation that could block the event loop
    return processed_data

@mcp.tool
async def wrapped_cpu_task(data: str) -> str:
    """CPU-intensive task wrapped to prevent blocking."""
    return await anyio.to_thread.run_sync(cpu_intensive_task, data)
```

Alternative approaches include using `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor()` or other threading techniques to manage blocking operations without impacting server responsiveness. For example, here's a recipe for using the `asyncer` library (not included in FastMCP) to create a decorator that wraps synchronous functions, courtesy of [@hsheth2](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/issues/864#issuecomment-3103678258):

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Decorator Recipe theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  import asyncer
  import functools
  from typing import Callable, ParamSpec, TypeVar, Awaitable

  _P = ParamSpec("_P")
  _R = TypeVar("_R")

  def make_async_background(fn: Callable[_P, _R]) -> Callable[_P, Awaitable[_R]]:
      @functools.wraps(fn)
      async def wrapper(*args: _P.args, **kwargs: _P.kwargs) -> _R:
          return await asyncer.asyncify(fn)(*args, **kwargs)

      return wrapper
  ```

  ```python Using the Decorator {6} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  @mcp.tool()
  @make_async_background
  def my_tool() -> None:
      time.sleep(5)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Arguments

By default, FastMCP converts Python functions into MCP tools by inspecting the function's signature and type annotations. This allows you to use standard Python type annotations for your tools. In general, the framework strives to "just work": idiomatic Python behaviors like parameter defaults and type annotations are automatically translated into MCP schemas. However, there are a number of ways to customize the behavior of your tools.

### Type Annotations

MCP tools have typed arguments, and FastMCP uses type annotations to determine those types. Therefore, you should use standard Python type annotations for tool arguments:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def analyze_text(
    text: str,
    max_tokens: int = 100,
    language: str | None = None
) -> dict:
    """Analyze the provided text."""
    # Implementation...
```

FastMCP supports a wide range of type annotations, including all Pydantic types:

| Type Annotation   | Example                                   | Description                                                  |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic types       | `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`             | Simple scalar values                                         |
| Binary data       | `bytes`                                   | Binary content (raw strings, not auto-decoded base64)        |
| Date and Time     | `datetime`, `date`, `timedelta`           | Date and time objects (ISO format strings)                   |
| Collection types  | `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `set[int]` | Collections of items                                         |
| Optional types    | `float \| None`, `Optional[float]`        | Parameters that may be null/omitted                          |
| Union types       | `str \| int`, `Union[str, int]`           | Parameters accepting multiple types                          |
| Constrained types | `Literal["A", "B"]`, `Enum`               | Parameters with specific allowed values                      |
| Paths             | `Path`                                    | File system paths (auto-converted from strings)              |
| UUIDs             | `UUID`                                    | Universally unique identifiers (auto-converted from strings) |
| Pydantic models   | `UserData`                                | Complex structured data with validation                      |

FastMCP supports all types that Pydantic supports as fields, including all Pydantic custom types. A few FastMCP-specific behaviors to note:

**Binary Data**: `bytes` parameters accept raw strings without automatic base64 decoding. For base64 data, use `str` and decode manually with `base64.b64decode()`.

**Enums**: Clients send enum values (`"red"`), not names (`"RED"`). Your function receives the Enum member (`Color.RED`).

**Paths and UUIDs**: String inputs are automatically converted to `Path` and `UUID` objects.

**Pydantic Models**: Must be provided as JSON objects (dicts), not stringified JSON. Even with flexible validation, `{"user": {"name": "Alice"}}` works, but `{"user": '{"name": "Alice"}'}` does not.

### Optional Arguments

FastMCP follows Python's standard function parameter conventions. Parameters without default values are required, while those with default values are optional.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def search_products(
    query: str,                   # Required - no default value
    max_results: int = 10,        # Optional - has default value
    sort_by: str = "relevance",   # Optional - has default value
    category: str | None = None   # Optional - can be None
) -> list[dict]:
    """Search the product catalog."""
    # Implementation...
```

In this example, the LLM must provide a `query` parameter, while `max_results`, `sort_by`, and `category` will use their default values if not explicitly provided.

### Validation Modes

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

By default, FastMCP uses Pydantic's flexible validation that coerces compatible inputs to match your type annotations. This improves compatibility with LLM clients that may send string representations of values (like `"10"` for an integer parameter).

If you need stricter validation that rejects any type mismatches, you can enable strict input validation. Strict mode uses the MCP SDK's built-in JSON Schema validation to validate inputs against the exact schema before passing them to your function:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Enable strict validation for this server
mcp = FastMCP("StrictServer", strict_input_validation=True)

@mcp.tool
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b

# With strict_input_validation=True, sending {"a": "10", "b": "20"} will fail
# With strict_input_validation=False (default), it will be coerced to integers
```

**Validation Behavior Comparison:**

| Input Type                                                | strict\_input\_validation=False (default) | strict\_input\_validation=True |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| String integers (`"10"` for `int`)                        | ✅ Coerced to integer                      | ❌ Validation error             |
| String floats (`"3.14"` for `float`)                      | ✅ Coerced to float                        | ❌ Validation error             |
| String booleans (`"true"` for `bool`)                     | ✅ Coerced to boolean                      | ❌ Validation error             |
| Lists with string elements (`["1", "2"]` for `list[int]`) | ✅ Elements coerced                        | ❌ Validation error             |
| Pydantic model fields with type mismatches                | ✅ Fields coerced                          | ❌ Validation error             |
| Invalid values (`"abc"` for `int`)                        | ❌ Validation error                        | ❌ Validation error             |

<Note>
  **Note on Pydantic Models:** Even with `strict_input_validation=False`, Pydantic model parameters must be provided as JSON objects (dicts), not as stringified JSON. For example, `{"user": {"name": "Alice"}}` works, but `{"user": '{"name": "Alice"}'}` does not.
</Note>

The default flexible validation mode is recommended for most use cases as it handles common LLM client behaviors gracefully while still providing strong type safety through Pydantic's validation.

### Parameter Metadata

You can provide additional metadata about parameters in several ways:

#### Simple String Descriptions

<VersionBadge version="2.11.0" />

For basic parameter descriptions, you can use a convenient shorthand with `Annotated`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from typing import Annotated

@mcp.tool
def process_image(
    image_url: Annotated[str, "URL of the image to process"],
    resize: Annotated[bool, "Whether to resize the image"] = False,
    width: Annotated[int, "Target width in pixels"] = 800,
    format: Annotated[str, "Output image format"] = "jpeg"
) -> dict:
    """Process an image with optional resizing."""
    # Implementation...
```

This shorthand syntax is equivalent to using `Field(description=...)` but more concise for simple descriptions.

<Tip>
  This shorthand syntax is only applied to `Annotated` types with a single string description.
</Tip>

#### Advanced Metadata with Field

For validation constraints and advanced metadata, use Pydantic's `Field` class with `Annotated`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field

@mcp.tool
def process_image(
    image_url: Annotated[str, Field(description="URL of the image to process")],
    resize: Annotated[bool, Field(description="Whether to resize the image")] = False,
    width: Annotated[int, Field(description="Target width in pixels", ge=1, le=2000)] = 800,
    format: Annotated[
        Literal["jpeg", "png", "webp"], 
        Field(description="Output image format")
    ] = "jpeg"
) -> dict:
    """Process an image with optional resizing."""
    # Implementation...
```

You can also use the Field as a default value, though the Annotated approach is preferred:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def search_database(
    query: str = Field(description="Search query string"),
    limit: int = Field(10, description="Maximum number of results", ge=1, le=100)
) -> list:
    """Search the database with the provided query."""
    # Implementation...
```

Field provides several validation and documentation features:

* `description`: Human-readable explanation of the parameter (shown to LLMs)
* `ge`/`gt`/`le`/`lt`: Greater/less than (or equal) constraints
* `min_length`/`max_length`: String or collection length constraints
* `pattern`: Regex pattern for string validation
* `default`: Default value if parameter is omitted

### Excluding Arguments

<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

You can exclude certain arguments from the tool schema shown to the LLM. This is useful for arguments that are injected at runtime (such as `state`, `user_id`, or credentials) and should not be exposed to the LLM or client. Only arguments with default values can be excluded; attempting to exclude a required argument will raise an error.

Example:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(
    name="get_user_details",
    exclude_args=["user_id"]
)
def get_user_details(user_id: str = None) -> str:
    # user_id will be injected by the server, not provided by the LLM
    ...
```

With this configuration, `user_id` will not appear in the tool's parameter schema, but can still be set by the server or framework at runtime.

For more complex tool transformations, see [Transforming Tools](/patterns/tool-transformation).

## Return Values

FastMCP tools can return data in two complementary formats: **traditional content blocks** (like text and images) and **structured outputs** (machine-readable JSON). When you add return type annotations, FastMCP automatically generates **output schemas** to validate the structured data and enables clients to deserialize results back to Python objects.

Understanding how these three concepts work together:

* **Return Values**: What your Python function returns (determines both content blocks and structured data)
* **Structured Outputs**: JSON data sent alongside traditional content for machine processing
* **Output Schemas**: JSON Schema declarations that describe and validate the structured output format

The following sections explain each concept in detail.

### Content Blocks

FastMCP automatically converts tool return values into appropriate MCP content blocks:

* **`str`**: Sent as `TextContent`
* **`bytes`**: Base64 encoded and sent as `BlobResourceContents` (within an `EmbeddedResource`)
* **`fastmcp.utilities.types.Image`**: Sent as `ImageContent`
* **`fastmcp.utilities.types.Audio`**: Sent as `AudioContent`
* **`fastmcp.utilities.types.File`**: Sent as base64-encoded `EmbeddedResource`
* **MCP SDK content blocks**: Sent as-is
* **A list of any of the above**: Converts each item according to the above rules
* **`None`**: Results in an empty response

#### Media Helper Classes

FastMCP provides helper classes for returning images, audio, and files. When you return one of these classes, either directly or as part of a list, FastMCP automatically converts it to the appropriate MCP content block. For example, if you return a `fastmcp.utilities.types.Image` object, FastMCP will convert it to an MCP `ImageContent` block with the correct MIME type and base64 encoding.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.utilities.types import Image, Audio, File

@mcp.tool
def get_chart() -> Image:
    """Generate a chart image."""
    return Image(path="chart.png")

@mcp.tool
def get_multiple_charts() -> list[Image]:
    """Return multiple charts."""
    return [Image(path="chart1.png"), Image(path="chart2.png")]
```

<Tip>
  Helper classes are only automatically converted to MCP content blocks when returned **directly** or as part of a **list**. For more complex containers like dicts, you can manually convert them to MCP types:

  ```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  # ✅ Automatic conversion
  return Image(path="chart.png")
  return [Image(path="chart1.png"), "text content"]

  # ❌ Will not be automatically converted
  return {"image": Image(path="chart.png")}

  # ✅ Manual conversion for nested use
  return {"image": Image(path="chart.png").to_image_content()}
  ```
</Tip>

Each helper class accepts either `path=` or `data=` (mutually exclusive):

* **`path`**: File path (string or Path object) - MIME type detected from extension
* **`data`**: Raw bytes - requires `format=` parameter for MIME type
* **`format`**: Optional format override (e.g., "png", "wav", "pdf")
* **`name`**: Optional name for `File` when using `data=`
* **`annotations`**: Optional MCP annotations for the content

### Structured Output

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

The 6/18/2025 MCP spec update [introduced](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#structured-content) structured content, which is a new way to return data from tools. Structured content is a JSON object that is sent alongside traditional content. FastMCP automatically creates structured outputs alongside traditional content when your tool returns data that has a JSON object representation. This provides machine-readable JSON data that clients can deserialize back to Python objects.

**Automatic Structured Content Rules:**

* **Object-like results** (`dict`, Pydantic models, dataclasses) → Always become structured content (even without output schema)
* **Non-object results** (`int`, `str`, `list`) → Only become structured content if there's an output schema to validate/serialize them
* **All results** → Always become traditional content blocks for backward compatibility

<Note>
  This automatic behavior enables clients to receive machine-readable data alongside human-readable content without requiring explicit output schemas for object-like returns.
</Note>

#### Dictionaries and Objects

When your tool returns a dictionary, dataclass, or Pydantic model, FastMCP automatically creates structured content from it. The structured content contains the actual object data, making it easy for clients to deserialize back to native objects.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Tool Definition theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def get_user_data(user_id: str) -> dict:
      """Get user data."""
      return {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "active": True}
  ```

  ```json MCP Result theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\n  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n  \"age\": 30,\n  \"active\": true\n}"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 30,
      "active": true
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Primitives and Collections

When your tool returns a primitive type (int, str, bool) or a collection (list, set), FastMCP needs a return type annotation to generate structured content. The annotation tells FastMCP how to validate and serialize the result.

Without a type annotation, the tool only produces `content`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Tool Definition theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int):
      """Calculate sum without return annotation."""
      return a + b  # Returns 8
  ```

  ```json MCP Result theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "8"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you add a return annotation, such as `-> int`, FastMCP generates `structuredContent` by wrapping the primitive value in a `{"result": ...}` object, since JSON schemas require object-type roots for structured output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Tool Definition theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      """Calculate sum with return annotation."""
      return a + b  # Returns 8
  ```

  ```json MCP Result theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "8"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "result": 8
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Typed Models

Return type annotations work with any type that can be converted to a JSON schema. Dataclasses and Pydantic models are particularly useful because FastMCP extracts their field definitions to create detailed schemas.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Tool Definition theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from fastmcp import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP()

  @dataclass
  class Person:
      name: str
      age: int
      email: str

  @mcp.tool
  def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> Person:
      """Get a user's profile information."""
      return Person(
          name="Alice",
          age=30,
          email="alice@example.com",
      )
  ```

  ```json Generated Output Schema theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "properties": {
      "name": {"title": "Name", "type": "string"},
      "age": {"title": "Age", "type": "integer"},
      "email": {"title": "Email", "type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["name", "age", "email"],
    "title": "Person",
    "type": "object"
  }
  ```

  ```json MCP Result theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"}"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 30,
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `Person` dataclass becomes an output schema (second tab) that describes the expected format. When executed, clients receive the result (third tab) with both `content` and `structuredContent` fields.

### Output Schemas

<VersionBadge version="2.10.0" />

The 6/18/2025 MCP spec update [introduced](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#output-schema) output schemas, which are a new way to describe the expected output format of a tool. When an output schema is provided, the tool *must* return structured output that matches the schema.

When you add return type annotations to your functions, FastMCP automatically generates JSON schemas that describe the expected output format. These schemas help MCP clients understand and validate the structured data they receive.

#### Primitive Type Wrapping

For primitive return types (like `int`, `str`, `bool`), FastMCP automatically wraps the result under a `"result"` key to create valid structured output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Primitive Return Type theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      """Add two numbers together."""
      return a + b
  ```

  ```json Generated Schema (Wrapped) theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "result": {"type": "integer"}
    },
    "x-fastmcp-wrap-result": true
  }
  ```

  ```json Structured Output theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  {
    "result": 8
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Manual Schema Control

You can override the automatically generated schema by providing a custom `output_schema`:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(output_schema={
    "type": "object", 
    "properties": {
        "data": {"type": "string"},
        "metadata": {"type": "object"}
    }
})
def custom_schema_tool() -> dict:
    """Tool with custom output schema."""
    return {"data": "Hello", "metadata": {"version": "1.0"}}
```

Schema generation works for most common types including basic types, collections, union types, Pydantic models, TypedDict structures, and dataclasses.

<Warning>
  **Important Constraints**:

  * Output schemas must be object types (`"type": "object"`)
  * If you provide an output schema, your tool **must** return structured output that matches it
  * However, you can provide structured output without an output schema (using `ToolResult`)
</Warning>

### ToolResult and Metadata

For complete control over tool responses, return a `ToolResult` object. This gives you explicit control over all aspects of the tool's output: traditional content, structured data, and metadata.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.tools.tool import ToolResult
from mcp.types import TextContent

@mcp.tool
def advanced_tool() -> ToolResult:
    """Tool with full control over output."""
    return ToolResult(
        content=[TextContent(type="text", text="Human-readable summary")],
        structured_content={"data": "value", "count": 42},
        meta={"execution_time_ms": 145}
    )
```

`ToolResult` accepts three fields:

**`content`** - The traditional MCP content blocks that clients display to users. Can be a string (automatically converted to `TextContent`), a list of MCP content blocks, or any serializable value (converted to JSON string). At least one of `content` or `structured_content` must be provided.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Simple string
ToolResult(content="Hello, world!")

# List of content blocks
ToolResult(content=[
    TextContent(type="text", text="Result: 42"),
    ImageContent(type="image", data="base64...", mimeType="image/png")
])
```

**`structured_content`** - A dictionary containing structured data that matches your tool's output schema. This enables clients to programmatically process the results. If you provide `structured_content`, it must be a dictionary or `None`. If only `structured_content` is provided, it will also be used as `content` (converted to JSON string).

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ToolResult(
    content="Found 3 users",
    structured_content={"users": [{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}]}
)
```

**`meta`**

<VersionBadge version="2.13.1" />

Runtime metadata about the tool execution. Use this for performance metrics, debugging information, or any client-specific data that doesn't belong in the content or structured output.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
ToolResult(
    content="Analysis complete",
    structured_content={"result": "positive"},
    meta={
        "execution_time_ms": 145,
        "model_version": "2.1",
        "confidence": 0.95
    }
)
```

<Note>
  The `meta` field in `ToolResult` is for runtime metadata about tool execution (e.g., execution time, performance metrics). This is separate from the `meta` parameter in `@mcp.tool(meta={...})`, which provides static metadata about the tool definition itself.
</Note>

When returning `ToolResult`, you have full control - FastMCP won't automatically wrap or transform your data. `ToolResult` can be returned with or without an output schema.

## Error Handling

<VersionBadge version="2.4.1" />

If your tool encounters an error, you can raise a standard Python exception (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, custom exceptions, etc.) or a FastMCP `ToolError`.

By default, all exceptions (including their details) are logged and converted into an MCP error response to be sent back to the client LLM. This helps the LLM understand failures and react appropriately.

If you want to mask internal error details for security reasons, you can:

1. Use the `mask_error_details=True` parameter when creating your `FastMCP` instance:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
mcp = FastMCP(name="SecureServer", mask_error_details=True)
```

2. Or use `ToolError` to explicitly control what error information is sent to clients:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

@mcp.tool
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide a by b."""

    if b == 0:
        # Error messages from ToolError are always sent to clients,
        # regardless of mask_error_details setting
        raise ToolError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    
    # If mask_error_details=True, this message would be masked
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.")
        
    return a / b
```

When `mask_error_details=True`, only error messages from `ToolError` will include details, other exceptions will be converted to a generic message.

## Disabling Tools

<VersionBadge version="2.8.0" />

You can control the visibility and availability of tools by enabling or disabling them. This is useful for feature flagging, maintenance, or dynamically changing the toolset available to a client. Disabled tools will not appear in the list of available tools returned by `list_tools`, and attempting to call a disabled tool will result in an "Unknown tool" error, just as if the tool did not exist.

By default, all tools are enabled. You can disable a tool upon creation using the `enabled` parameter in the decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(enabled=False)
def maintenance_tool():
    """This tool is currently under maintenance."""
    return "This tool is disabled."
```

You can also toggle a tool's state programmatically after it has been created:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def dynamic_tool():
    return "I am a dynamic tool."

# Disable and re-enable the tool
dynamic_tool.disable()
dynamic_tool.enable()
```

## MCP Annotations

<VersionBadge version="2.2.7" />

FastMCP allows you to add specialized metadata to your tools through annotations. These annotations communicate how tools behave to client applications without consuming token context in LLM prompts.

Annotations serve several purposes in client applications:

* Adding user-friendly titles for display purposes
* Indicating whether tools modify data or systems
* Describing the safety profile of tools (destructive vs. non-destructive)
* Signaling if tools interact with external systems

You can add annotations to a tool using the `annotations` parameter in the `@mcp.tool` decorator:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool(
    annotations={
        "title": "Calculate Sum",
        "readOnlyHint": True,
        "openWorldHint": False
    }
)
def calculate_sum(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b
```

FastMCP supports these standard annotations:

| Annotation        | Type    | Default | Purpose                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :------ | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`           | string  | -       | Display name for user interfaces                                            |
| `readOnlyHint`    | boolean | false   | Indicates if the tool only reads without making changes                     |
| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true    | For non-readonly tools, signals if changes are destructive                  |
| `idempotentHint`  | boolean | false   | Indicates if repeated identical calls have the same effect as a single call |
| `openWorldHint`   | boolean | true    | Specifies if the tool interacts with external systems                       |

Remember that annotations help make better user experiences but should be treated as advisory hints. They help client applications present appropriate UI elements and safety controls, but won't enforce security boundaries on their own. Always focus on making your annotations accurately represent what your tool actually does.

## Notifications

<VersionBadge version="2.9.1" />

FastMCP automatically sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` notifications to connected clients when tools are added, removed, enabled, or disabled. This allows clients to stay up-to-date with the current tool set without manually polling for changes.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def example_tool() -> str:
    return "Hello!"

# These operations trigger notifications:
mcp.add_tool(example_tool)     # Sends tools/list_changed notification
example_tool.disable()         # Sends tools/list_changed notification  
example_tool.enable()          # Sends tools/list_changed notification
mcp.remove_tool("example_tool") # Sends tools/list_changed notification
```

Notifications are only sent when these operations occur within an active MCP request context (e.g., when called from within a tool or other MCP operation). Operations performed during server initialization do not trigger notifications.

Clients can handle these notifications using a [message handler](/clients/messages) to automatically refresh their tool lists or update their interfaces.

## Accessing the MCP Context

Tools can access MCP features like logging, reading resources, or reporting progress through the `Context` object. To use it, add a parameter to your tool function with the type hint `Context`.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP(name="ContextDemo")

@mcp.tool
async def process_data(data_uri: str, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Process data from a resource with progress reporting."""
    await ctx.info(f"Processing data from {data_uri}")
    
    # Read a resource
    resource = await ctx.read_resource(data_uri)
    data = resource[0].content if resource else ""
    
    # Report progress
    await ctx.report_progress(progress=50, total=100)
    
    # Example request to the client's LLM for help
    summary = await ctx.sample(f"Summarize this in 10 words: {data[:200]}")
    
    await ctx.report_progress(progress=100, total=100)
    return {
        "length": len(data),
        "summary": summary.text
    }
```

The Context object provides access to:

* **Logging**: `ctx.debug()`, `ctx.info()`, `ctx.warning()`, `ctx.error()`
* **Progress Reporting**: `ctx.report_progress(progress, total)`
* **Resource Access**: `ctx.read_resource(uri)`
* **LLM Sampling**: `ctx.sample(...)`
* **Request Information**: `ctx.request_id`, `ctx.client_id`

For full documentation on the Context object and all its capabilities, see the [Context documentation](/servers/context).

## Server Behavior

### Duplicate Tools

<VersionBadge version="2.1.0" />

You can control how the FastMCP server behaves if you try to register multiple tools with the same name. This is configured using the `on_duplicate_tools` argument when creating the `FastMCP` instance.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    name="StrictServer",
    # Configure behavior for duplicate tool names
    on_duplicate_tools="error"
)

@mcp.tool
def my_tool(): return "Version 1"

# This will now raise a ValueError because 'my_tool' already exists
# and on_duplicate_tools is set to "error".
# @mcp.tool
# def my_tool(): return "Version 2"
```

The duplicate behavior options are:

* `"warn"` (default): Logs a warning and the new tool replaces the old one.
* `"error"`: Raises a `ValueError`, preventing the duplicate registration.
* `"replace"`: Silently replaces the existing tool with the new one.
* `"ignore"`: Keeps the original tool and ignores the new registration attempt.

### Removing Tools

<VersionBadge version="2.3.4" />

You can dynamically remove tools from a server using the `remove_tool` method:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="DynamicToolServer")

@mcp.tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b

mcp.remove_tool("calculate_sum")
```

<Update label="FastMCP 2.13.0" description="October 25, 2025" tags={["Releases"]}>
  <Card title="FastMCP 2.13.0: Cache Me If You Can" href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.13.0" cta="Read the release notes">
    FastMCP 2.13 "Cache Me If You Can" represents a fundamental maturation of the framework. After months of community feedback on authentication and state management, this release delivers the infrastructure FastMCP needs to handle production workloads: persistent storage, response caching, and pragmatic OAuth improvements that reflect real-world deployment challenges.

    💾 **Pluggable storage backends** bring persistent state to FastMCP servers. Built on [py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value), a new library from FastMCP maintainer Bill Easton ([@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate)), the storage layer provides encrypted disk storage by default, platform-aware token management, and a simple key-value interface for application state. We're excited to bring this elegantly designed library into the FastMCP ecosystem - it's both powerful and remarkably easy to use, including wrappers to add encryption, TTLs, caching, and more to backends ranging from Elasticsearch, Redis, DynamoDB, filesystem, in-memory, and more!

    🔐 **OAuth maturity** brings months of production learnings into the framework. The new consent screen prevents confused deputy and authorization bypass attacks discovered in earlier versions, while the OAuth proxy now issues its own tokens with automatic key derivation. RFC 7662 token introspection support enables enterprise auth flows, and path prefix mounting enables OAuth-protected servers to integrate into existing web applications. FastMCP now supports out-of-the-box authentication with [WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos) and [AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit), [GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github), [Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google), [Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure) (Entra ID), [AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito), [Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0), [Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope), [Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit), [JWTs](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#jwt-token-verification), and [RFC 7662 token introspection](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#token-introspection-protocol).

    ⚡ **Response Caching Middleware** dramatically improves performance for expensive operations, while **Server lifespans** provide proper initialization and cleanup hooks that run once per server instance instead of per client session.

    ✨ **Developer experience improvements** include Pydantic input validation, icon support, RFC 6570 query parameters for resource templates, improved Context API methods, and async file/directory resources.

    FastMCP 2.9 is a major release that, among other things, introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol.

    🤝 *MCP Middleware* brings a flexible middleware system for intercepting and controlling server operations - think authentication, logging, rate limiting, and custom business logic without touching core protocol code.

    ✨ *Server-side type conversion* for prompts solves a major developer pain point: while MCP requires string arguments, your functions can now work with native Python types like lists and dictionaries, with automatic conversion handling the complexity.

    These features transform FastMCP from a simple protocol implementation into a powerful framework for building sophisticated MCP applications. Combined with the new `File` utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance.

    FastMCP 2.8 is here, and it's all about taking control of your tools.

    This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience:

    🛠️ Tool Transformation

    The headline feature lets you wrap any tool—from your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI spec—to create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code.

    This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamseaston_huge-thanks-to-william-easton-for-providing-activity-7338011349525983232-Mw6T?utm_source=share\&utm_medium=member_desktop\&rcm=ACoAAAAd6d0B3uL9zpCsq9eYWKi3HIvb8eN_r_Q), "Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools."

    🏷️ Component Control

    Now that you're transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who's been asking what FastMCP's tags are for—they finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.

    🚀 Pragmatic by Default

    Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we've made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we'll restore the old default -- but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!

    FastMCP 2.7 has been released!

    Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) "naked" decorator usage:

    ```python {3} theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
    mcp = FastMCP()

    @mcp.tool
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b
    ```

    In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.

    The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated.

    Even AI needs a good travel adapter 🔌

    FastMCP now supports proxying arbitrary MCP servers, letting you run a local FastMCP instance that transparently forwards requests to any remote or third-party server—regardless of transport. This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ⇄ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use `FastMCP.from_client()` to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy.
