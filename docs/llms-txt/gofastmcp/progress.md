# Progress Monitoring

> Handle progress notifications from long-running server operations.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <code className="version-badge-container">
            <p className="version-badge">
                <span className="version-badge-label">New in version:</span> 
                <code className="version-badge-version">{version}</code>
            </p>
        </code>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.3.5" />

MCP servers can report progress during long-running operations. The client can receive these updates through a progress handler.

## Progress Handler

Set a progress handler when creating the client:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

async def my_progress_handler(
    progress: float, 
    total: float | None, 
    message: str | None
) -> None:
    if total is not None:
        percentage = (progress / total) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}% - {message or ''}")
    else:
        print(f"Progress: {progress} - {message or ''}")

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    progress_handler=my_progress_handler
)
```

### Handler Parameters

The progress handler receives three parameters:

<Card icon="code" title="Progress Handler Parameters">
  <ResponseField name="progress" type="float">
    Current progress value
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="total" type="float | None">
    Expected total value (may be None)
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="message" type="str | None">
    Optional status message (may be None)
  </ResponseField>
</Card>

## Per-Call Progress Handler

Override the progress handler for specific tool calls:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async with client:
    # Override with specific progress handler for this call
    result = await client.call_tool(
        "long_running_task", 
        {"param": "value"}, 
        progress_handler=my_progress_handler
    )
```
