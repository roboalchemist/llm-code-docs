# MCP Apps Prerequisites

Before building MCP Apps with Apollo MCP Server, make sure you have these prerequisites.

## Required prerequisites

* Apollo MCP Server
* GraphQL API endpoints that you want to expose through MCP Apps
* An MCP Apps-compatible host (for example, ChatGPT with OpenAI Apps SDK access, or another host that supports the MCP specification)

If you're using ChatGPT and want to test end-to-end, you'll need a ChatGPT Plus account with OpenAI Apps SDK access (currently in preview/beta). Apps SDK access might require enrollment or approval from OpenAI. Check the [OpenAI Apps SDK documentation](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/quickstart/#add-your-app-to-chatgpt).

If you're using another host, make sure it complies with the [Model Context Protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

## Template-specific prerequisites

If you're using the [Apollo AI Apps Template](https://github.com/apollographql/ai-apps-template), you'll also need:

* Node.js v18 or later
* npm or yarn

Tunneling tools, like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), can be helpful for local development with remote hosts if you want to test native interfaces.

## Next steps

Once you have all prerequisites in place:

1. Follow the [MCP Apps Quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-quickstart) to create your first app
2. Review the [MCP Apps Overview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps) for architecture and concepts
3. Explore the [MCP Apps Reference](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-mcp-server/mcp-apps-reference) for detailed configuration
