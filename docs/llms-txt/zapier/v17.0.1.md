# What's changed in v17.0.1

> Fixed a regression bug on `zapier build` and the oauth2 template in `zapier init`.

*Released: 2025-05-14*

## cli

* 🐛 `zapier init` Typescript template OAuth2 implementation doesn't work out of the box ([#1022](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/pull/1022))
* 🐛 `version-store.js` is updated to show the Node and NPM versions for v17 ([#1020](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/pull/1020))

## core

* 🐛 `zapier build` (and therefore also `zapier push`) hangs on the `Building app definition.json` step when it's run on an integration with a Core dependency of v17, and run via CLI with a version less than v17 ([#1020](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/pull/1020))

## schema

None!
