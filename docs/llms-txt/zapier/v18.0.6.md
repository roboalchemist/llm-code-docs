# What's changed in v18.0.6

> Package manager detection from `zapier build`

*Released: 2025-12-24*

The `zapier build` command was harcoded to use `npm install`. As alternate package managers gain adoption, the `zapier build` command will respect your app's package manager of choice.
It does this by checking the `packageManager` on the package.json file. If it is not defined, it will look for any relevant lock files. If still, none is defined, then will fallback to `npm`.

If you are familiar with using `zapier build` with the flag `--skip-npm-install`, this flag has been renamed to `--skip-dep-install`, but will continue to still work as an alias. In the future, we will remove the `--skip-npm-install` flag.
