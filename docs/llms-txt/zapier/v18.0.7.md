# What's changed in v18.0.7

> Publishing process improvements, refactoring, and `sample` field added to dynamic `outputFields`.

*Released: 2026-01-07*

In response to the previous [Shai-Hulud incident](/platform/build-cli/inc-547), we're changing our package publishing process to improve security. This release also includes a schema extension that allows `outputFields` to have a `sample` field. Lastly, we've refactored the `invoke` command to make upcoming enhancements easier.

## schema
