## Sponsor Automation for Your Users

With Powered by Zapier, you can offer seamless automation experiences to your users without requiring them to have a paid Zapier subscription or incur additional costs. By sponsoring the automation infrastructure, you simplify the user journey and enhance engagement within your product.

This approach is particularly beneficial when:

* **Launching AI Agents**: Enable your AI solutions to interact with over 8,000 apps, expanding their capabilities without additional development overhead.
* **Building Integration Marketplaces**: Quickly deploy a robust integration ecosystem within your platform, offering users a wide range of automation options.
* **Enhancing User Onboarding**: Provide immediate value to new users by integrating automation features directly into your product experience.

By covering the costs associated with automation tasks, you remove barriers to entry, allowing users to engage with automation features effortlessly. This strategy not only improves user satisfaction but also drives higher adoption rates and long-term retention.
