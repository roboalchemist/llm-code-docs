# Zapier MCP Contact Form

Please fill out the form below if you'd like to talk to the Zapier MCP team. Bug reports, feature requests, and ideas are always welcome!

**Zapier MCP is currently in beta.** While we'll support you as best we can during this phase, please note that full support may not be available just yet.

**Before reaching out**, you may find it useful to get in touch with the app you use Zapier MCP with (i.e. Claude / Cursor / Windsurf), as this is often the quickest path to resolution. You can also try our [MCP Helper Chatbot](https://mcp-helper.zapier.app/) which we're keeping up-to-date.
