# Get Authentications

> Fetch the available Authentications for the provided App. This will only return Authentications that are owned by the user and not those that are shared with them, since it's not possible to create Zaps with Authentications you don't own.

#### When using OAuth

This endpoint requires the `authentication` OAuth scope.

This API is [rate limited](/powered-by-zapier/api-reference/rate-limiting).

  version: 2024.11.0

    ## Introduction


    The Partner API is the best tool for complete style control over a user's
    Zapier experience within your app.

    Essentially, it lets you customize how you present Zapier within your
    product without sacrificing your app's look,

    feel, and flow.


    Think of it as a native Zapier integration, helping you showcase your best
    Zapier-powered workflows where it's most

    helpful to your users (within the flow of your tool). You can customize
    styling, streamline Zap set-up for users,

    expose relevant Zap information, and more!


    With the Partner API, you can:


    - Get a list of all the apps available in Zapier's app directory so you can
    power your app directory and show your

    users all the integration possibilities with your Zapier integration.

    - Have complete style control over how you present Zap templates in your
    product. The Partner API gives you access

    to the raw Zap Template data so you can give your users access to your Zap
    template with your product's style, look

    and feel.

    - Get access to all your Zap templates and give your users the ability to
    search to quickly find the one they need.

    - Streamline Zap setup by pre-filling fields on behalf of your users.

    - Show users the Zaps they have set up from right within your product
    keeping them on your site longer and giving them

    complete confidence in their Zapier integration.

    - Embed our Zapier Editor to allow your users to create new Zaps and modify
    existing ones, without needing to leave

    your product.


    ## Authentication


    There are two ways to authenticate with the Partner API.


    1. Your application's `client_id` which you will receive once you are
    approved for access to the API

    (Client ID Authentication)

    2. A user's access token (Access Token Authentication).


    Which authentication method you should use depends on which endpoint(s) you
    are using.

    Review each endpoint's documentation to understand which parameters are
    required.


    > Note: while we do generate a `client_secret`, the type of grant we use
    (implicit) doesn't

    need it so it's not something we provide.'
