# Powered by Zapier Documentation

> Powered by Zapier is the easiest ways to embed Zapier and surface integrations within your product.

Check out the [Powered by Zapier documentation](/powered-by-zapier/introduction) to learn about [plug-and-play elements](/powered-by-zapier/integration-marketplace/low-code/workflow-element), the [Workflow API](/powered-by-zapier/api-reference/authentication), [quick account creation](/powered-by-zapier/built-in-workflows/code-native/retrieving-a-list-of-zaps), and more.

Powered by Zapier is available for public integrations. To take advantage of our embed solution, first ensure your integration has been published to [Zapier's App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps). If your integration isn't yet published, learn more about [submitting your integration for review](/platform/publish/public-integration#4-submit-your-integration-for-app-review).
