# What's changed in v18.1.0

> New `invoke --remote` flag and a fix on package manager detection.

*Released: 2026-01-19*

The `zapier-platform invoke` command now supports a **remote mode**. By adding a `--remote` (`-r` for short) flag to the `invoke` command, such as:

```
zapier-platform invoke -r
```

... all invocations, including trigger/action invocation itself, input field definitions, and dynamic dropdown choices, will be executed remotely by the Zapier production environment. This means:

* The integration version you want to test has to be deployed first.
* The invocation results and the bundle payload passed to your integration code will match what you see in live production, which is great for testing.
* Remote mode is slower than local mode (without the `-r` flag).

Read more about the three different modes in the [`zapier-platform invoke --help`](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/cli.md#invoke) documentation.

We also fixed an issue where the `build` and `test` commands were not correctly detecting package managers (like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun) when your integration was part of a monorepo. Now, the CLI doesn't just look in the current directory for package manager indicators (like `package-lock.json` for npm), but also checks parent directories up to four levels up.
