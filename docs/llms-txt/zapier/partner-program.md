# Partner Program

> The [Zapier Partner Program](https://zapier.com/developer-platform/partner-program) is a program for Zapier's [8,000+ integration partners](https://zapier.com/apps). It is designed to give all public partners a clear path to success for their integrations and reward them with benefits along the way.

> **The Partner Program is only available to public integrations.**

As your integration gains more active users, and maintains a healthy health score, your integration will tier up in our Partner Program. Zapier's Partner Program consists of 4 tiers:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum

Learn more about the [benefits available in each tier](https://zapier.com/developer-platform/partner-program).

## How tiers are calculated

Your tier in the Zapier Partner Program is determined by your integration's number of active users and health score.

Your tier in the Partner Program is evaluated on a fixed quarterly basis: at the beginning of January, April, July, and October. Your health score is calculated daily in response to your engagement with open bug reports and feature requests.

If at the beginning of a quarter you don't meet all requirements of a tier, you will move down to the next tier that you do qualify for.

Zapier won't externally share your tier in the Partner Program with anyone, including other partners and Zapier users. But if you'd like to, you're welcome to share your tier in the program with your users.

### Active users

The active users metric looks at how many people are actively using your Zapier integration this quarter. Since this number accumulates over the quarter, it is normal to see a drop at the beginning of each quarter compared to the end of last quarter.

The minimum number of active users to achieve each tier above Bronze are:

* Silver - 50
* Gold - 350
* Platinum - 3,000 OR minimum 350 with a 20% growth rate over last quarter

To increase usage of your Zapier integration, try out [these 10 tactics](/platform/publish/partner-faq).

### Integration health score

The integration health score is calculated by looking at:

* how many open feature requests have been reported for your integration
* how many open bug reports have been reported for your integration
* how responsive your team is to the open issues

Some feature requests and bugs impact your score more than others. For example, a feature request with 100 users voting for it will impact your health score more than a feature request with 1 vote.

Our goal for all integrations is for them to maintain a “healthy” health score. No tier of the Partner Program requires an “exceptional” health score.

To improve your health score, respond to and resolve your outstanding [feature requests and bugs](/platform/manage/user-feedback).

## View Partner Program metrics

You can view Partner Program metrics in two ways:

* **Partner newsletter**: Opt in to our [partner newsletter](https://developer.zapier.com/partner-settings/email), and we'll email you monthly updates.
* **Partner Program dashboard**: Log into the [developer platform](https://developer.zapier.com/) with your developer's credentials. In the left side bar, click **Partner Program** to view your metrics.

## How to monitor integration insights

As you launch and maintain your integration, monitor and review the insights in the dashboard on a regular cadence. Insights include data on the integration's growth and usage, such as monthly active users, retention rates, and Zap usage by triggers and actions. You can [see all the metrics tracked](/platform/manage/integration-insights) in this table, or access them for any integration you are an Admin or Collaborator on from the “Dashboard” tab of the developer platform.

You can filter most growth metrics by the last X number of days to identify trends and changes in user activity in correlation to marketing initiatives, integration changes, and product updates like [embedding Zapier](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/full-zapier-experience). Usage details for each trigger and action will show which functionalities are the most popular and being effectively utilized. You can easily and safely share access to the insights by [inviting collaborators](/platform/manage/add-team) to the integration without giving them permission to make changes to it.
