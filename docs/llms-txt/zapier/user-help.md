# Create help documentation for your users

> We encourage you to publish help documentation about using your Zapier integration on your own website. Having guides on your site gives users a seamless experience when they're already exploring your product, and allows you to tailor the documentation to your branding. While Zapier's support team will help users troubleshoot issues, having detailed help docs on your site enables users to self-serve and address common questions on their own.

## Self-hosted help documentation

Step-up your documentation game. Implementing these essential strategies and tips can ensure that your audience gets the assistance they need, seamlessly.

### Speak your user's language

* Identify your integration's target audience and tailor your help docs to their level of technical expertise
* Consider the common questions, pain points, and use cases your users might have

### Organize content effectively

* Structure your help docs in a logical manner, with categories, subcategories, and search functionality for easy navigation
* Use descriptive headings and bullet points to break down complex topics into bite-sized pieces
* Create a table of contents for quick reference

[Check Buffer's simple yet effective way of breaking down topics.](https://support.buffer.com/article/814-buffer-api-support-zapier-pinterest-and-whats-possible-for-users)

### Keep help docs clear and concise

* Use plain language and avoid technical jargon whenever possible
* Break down complex concepts into simple steps and provide examples or screenshots to illustrate key points
* Write in an active voice to keep the content engaging and easy to understand

### Leverage your user Community

* Encourage community engagement from users who have successfully resolved similar issues
* Community-contributed answers help leverage social proof. When users see that their peers have found solutions helpful, this adds authenticity and credibility to your help docs
* Highlighting real user experiences demonstrates that your documentation isn't just theoretical— bolstering users' confidence in its effectiveness.
