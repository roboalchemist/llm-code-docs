# Error: Cannot retrieve App******CLIAPI@*** app

## Error shown

When attempting to use a Zap that has a private integration in a Team and Enterprise Zapier account, the private integration step could show an error that says:

`Cannot retrieve App******CLIAPI@*** app`

This occurs in Team and Enterprise Zapier accounts, and it happens when the private integration has not been explicitly [shared](/platform/manage/sharing) with the Zap owner.

This can happen if the Zap changes ownership, or if the Zap owner was removed from using the private integration, after it has been previously shared with them.

## Solution

To resolve this, an integration admin would need to [share](/platform/manage/sharing) the private integration with the owner of the Zap so that they have access to use the private integration on their Zaps.
