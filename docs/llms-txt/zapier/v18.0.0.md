# What's changed in v18.0.0

> Node.js 22 support, new throttling middleware, and a new CLI executable name `zapier-platform`.

*Released: 2025-10-30*

Version 18.0.0 is a **BREAKING CHANGE** release that contains several important upgrades and changes. Here is a brief breakdown of the main changes (**❗ denotes a breaking change**):

## ❗ Node.js 22 Support

Zapier Platform v18 runs on Node.js 22 runtime. This is a breaking change as it may affect compatibility with older Node.js versions and dependencies.

## ❗ Schema Changes

The `skipCleanArrayInputData` experimental flag has been replaced with `cleanInputData`. This provides more consistent data cleaning behavior across the platform. This change is breaking **only if** you're using `skipCleanArrayInputData`.
See [cleanInputData flag documentation](/platform/build-cli/empty-values-in-input-data) for more details on how to configure this behavior.

## ❗ New Throttling Middleware

A new `throwForThrottling` middleware has been added to prevent `afterResponse` middleware from suppressing 429 (throttling) responses. This ensures proper handling of rate limiting scenarios. This change is breaking **if** you want to handle 429 responses in your `afterResponse`. See [v18.x and above: the built-in `throwForThrottling` middleware](/platform/build-cli/making-http-requests#v18-x-and-above%3A-the-built-in-throwforthrottling-middleware) for how to handle 429s yourself.

## New Executable Name `zapier-platform`

The CLI now includes a new executable name `zapier-platform` while deprecating the old `zapier` command. Both will work for now, but `zapier-platform` is the recommended command going forward.
