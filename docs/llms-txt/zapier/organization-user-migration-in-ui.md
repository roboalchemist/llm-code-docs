# Migration UI now supports individual and organization-level migrations

> Enhanced migration UI with granular control options for individual and organization-level migrations.

*Released: 2025-10-02*

## Migration via the Platform UI

* 🎉 [Email-based migration](https://docs.zapier.com/platform/manage/migrate#migrate-users-to-new-version-with-platform-ui) now supports two scopes:
  * **Individual**: Migrates only private Zaps under the user's individual account (equivalent to the `--user` flag of the `zapier migrate` CLI command)
  * **Organization**: Migrates all Zaps including shared resources across organization accounts (equivalent to the `--account` flag of the `zapier migrate` CLI command)
