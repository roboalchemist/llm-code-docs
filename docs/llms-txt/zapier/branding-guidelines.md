# Integration branding guidelines

> When creating your integration, you'll add your app’s name, logo, description, category, and primary brand color. Consistent branding is essential for helping users recognize and discover your app on Zapier.

The journey starts at the [Zapier app directory](https://zapier.com/apps/), where apps are ranked by popularity and category. Users search for new apps and integrations here.

</Frame>

Each integration gets its own app profile page on Zapier, where your branding
stands out. Users can explore your app’s features and see how it works with
other apps.

App profiles feature [Zap Templates](https://platform.zapier.com/publish/zap-templates)—pre-built workflows that users can set up with just a few clicks. These templates are also shown in the Zapier dashboard for connected apps.

Inside Zapier's account dashboard, the *Start with a template* section shows Zap Templates for apps users have connected to their accounts.

In the Zap editor, your app’s logo and name appear when users select apps to connect.

Follow these guidelines to ensure consistent, effective branding for your Zapier integration:

## App name

When possible, use your app’s current, public-facing name as it appears in your official branding. The app title on Zapier should match your actual app name, including correct capitalization and spacing. Do not include extra words or symbols like ™, ®, or © in the title.

Avoid adding adjectives, descriptors, or phrases unless required to distinguish between similarly named integrations. Only include your company name if it’s inseparably tied to your product branding.

Do not include the word “app” unless it is part of your official name. Abbreviations like FKA (formerly known as), AKA (also known as), and NKA (now known as) are not permitted. If your integration is rebranded, its title must use only the new name without referencing the previous name.

When naming collisions occur, i.e. when another integration already uses the same name, a tiered approach will be applied to distinguish your app while preserving brand clarity:

**Tier 1 (Preferred)**: App Name

Use this when your app name is unique across the Zapier platform and no other integration uses it. Examples:

* Evernote
* Google Sheets
* Trello

**Tier 2 (Next-best)**: App Name by Company

Use this if your app’s name is already taken and your company name is distinct from your product name. This helps differentiate between similar apps by clarifying the brand behind them. Examples:
\_ Ecwid by Lightspeed
\_ Bigin by Zoho CRM \* Grok by xAI

**Tier 3 (Last-resort)**: App Name (Descriptor)

Use this if both your app and company names are the same, and a name conflict exists. Add a short, descriptive tag that clearly differentiates your app. This could include your product’s category, function, or platform. Examples:
\_ Pulse (Business Chat)
\_ Pulse (Health Track)
\_ Nimbus (Notes & Docs)
\_ Nimbus (Weather)

## App logo

The logo you provide will be used across Zapier’s platform, including on your app’s dedicated directory page. Please ensure the logo you provide meets the following requirements:

* PNG, transparent
* Minimum 512x512px (identical height/width measurements)
* Minimum 72 DPI

This will ensure your logo displays properly throughout the site.

Please provide a bigger version if you have one available. If your icon is not square, make a square transparent image and center your icon inside the transparent square. Do not include the app name or other copy in the logo as it will not be legible at small sizes.

**Example**:

<Frame caption="Evernote icon on Zapier">
  <img src="https://cdn.zappy.app/e1ac0809ac62bfd74330479dc22c9038.png" />
</Frame>

Evernote's elephant icon is included in a transparent square rectangle.

<Frame caption="Todoist icon on Zapier">
  <img src="https://cdn.zappy.app/47de5413e9b17530628040488ddd868c.png" />
</Frame>

Todoist's icon includes transparent, rounded corners.

## App description copy

Write a short description (up to 160 characters) of your app’s core features and use cases in the form of "**Integration Name** is a....". The description should be less about selling the platform and more about what the platform actually does. Use proper English and full sentences. The copy should not include links or mentions of Zapier. Do not use flowery or overstated language, or make it appear your integration is associated with or endorsed by Zapier.

**Example**:

* `Trello is a team collaboration tool to organize anything on a kanban board.`, not `Trello is the best project management tool.`
* `Dropbox lets you store files online, sync them to all your devices, and share them easily.`, not `A file storage app.`

## Category

Select the category that best fits your app's core features and use case. If your app includes features from multiple categories, choose the category that best describes your app's primary use case today.

You may update your app's category in the future if needed, so do not select a category that fits your future ambitions for the app instead of its features today. Additionally, do not select a category that applies only to a secondary feature in your app or a narrow category that does not cover your app's broader focus.

### Available Categories

We offer a variety of categories for you to list your integration in. Each top-level category includes all integrations from its child categories. To maximize visibility for your integration, we recommend selecting a specific child category rather than a general parent category. Integrations within each category are ranked by popularity. By choosing a child category, your integration can achieve a higher ranking and greater visibility within that category.

* *Slack* is primarily a team communication tool for chat, so it fits best in the `team chat` category alongside apps like *Discord* and *ChatWork*, not in the `video calls` category even though it does include a video call tool as a secondary feature.
* *Google Contacts* is primarily an address book that fits best with other `contacts` apps, while *HubSpot CRM* can manage contacts but also includes deals and contact tracking which makes it a better fit for the `CRM` category.

## Colors

When you release your Zapier integration to the public, Zapier requires your app's primary color. The primary color is the main color used in your app's logo or branding.

<Frame caption="Gmail primary colors in App Directory">
  <img src="https://cdn.zappy.app/bef595e339362f712a227679316d1357.png" />
</Frame>

Do not use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) as the color, as overlaid text would be unreadable. If your logo is black and white, use the next most common color from your branding.

Zapier uses the primary color as the background color in your app's Zapier App Directory listing, and may additionally use it in the Zapier app dashboard, Zapier blog marketing materials, and other parts of Zapier's app and content that promote your app's integrations.

  <Accordion title="What's an App Family?">
    An app family refers to a collection of related integrations, typically developed by the same organization. Being added to an App Family is at the discretion of Zapier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I become a Premium integration?">
    Being classified as a Premium app isn't something we currently offer to partner-owned integrations. The justification as to why a Zapier-owned integration might be classed as Premium varies, but is often due to an increased cost on our end to be able to offer that integration. Only users on a paid Zapier plan can use Premium integrations, which helps to ensure we can continue to invest in the development of that integration.
