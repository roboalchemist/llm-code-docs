# Application Errors

If you have expected ways your functions might fail, you can either return different values or throw `ConvexError`s.

## Returning different values[​](#returning-different-values "Direct link to Returning different values")

If you're using TypeScript different return types can enforce that you're handling error scenarios.

For example, a `createUser` mutation could return

```
Id<"users"> | { error: "EMAIL_ADDRESS_IN_USE" };
```

to express that either the mutation succeeded or the email address was already taken.

This ensures that you remember to handle these cases in your UI.

## Throwing application errors[​](#throwing-application-errors "Direct link to Throwing application errors")

You might prefer to throw errors for the following reasons:

* You can use the exception bubbling mechanism to throw from a deeply nested function call, instead of manually propagating error results up the call stack. This will work for `runQuery`, `runMutation` and `runAction` calls in [actions](/functions/actions.md) too.
* In [mutations](/functions/mutation-functions.md), throwing an error will prevent the mutation transaction from committing
* On the client, it might be simpler to handle all kinds of errors, both expected and unexpected, uniformly

Convex provides an error subclass, [`ConvexError`](/api/classes/values.ConvexError.md), which can be used to carry information from the backend to the client:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```
import { ConvexError } from "convex/values";
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";

export const assignRole = mutation({
  args: {
    // ...
  },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    const isTaken = isRoleTaken(/* ... */);
    if (isTaken) {
      throw new ConvexError("Role is already taken");
    }
    // ...
  },
});
```

### Application error `data` payload[​](#application-error-data-payload "Direct link to application-error-data-payload")

You can pass the same [data types](/database/types.md) supported by function arguments, return types and the database, to the `ConvexError` constructor. This data will be stored on the `data` property of the error:

```
// error.data === "My fancy error message"
throw new ConvexError("My fancy error message");

// error.data === {message: "My fancy error message", code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  message: "My fancy error message",
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});

// error.data === {code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});
```

Error payloads more complicated than a simple `string` are helpful for more structured error logging, or for handling sets of errors differently on the client.

## Handling application errors on the client[​](#handling-application-errors-on-the-client "Direct link to Handling application errors on the client")

On the client, application errors also use the `ConvexError` class, and the data they carry can be accessed via the `data` property:

src/App.tsx

TS

```
import { ConvexError } from "convex/values";
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function MyApp() {
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.myFunctions.mutateSomething);
  const handleSomething = async () => {
    try {
      await doSomething({ a: 1, b: 2 });
    } catch (error) {
      const errorMessage =
        // Check whether the error is an application error
        error instanceof ConvexError
          ? // Access data and cast it to the type we expect
            (error.data as { message: string }).message
          : // Must be some developer error,
            // and prod deployments will not
            // reveal any more information about it
            // to the client
            "Unexpected error occurred";
      // do something with `errorMessage`
    }
  };
  // ...
}
```
