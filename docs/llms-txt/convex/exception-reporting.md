# Exception Reporting

Configure exception reporting to gain visibility into errors from your Convex function executions. Convex supports integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) and with [Datadog Error Tracking](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/error-tracking/).

Currently, exception reporting is only available to Pro users.

## Configuring Sentry[​](#configuring-sentry "Direct link to Configuring Sentry")

To configure sentry, navigate to the [Deployment Settings](/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings.md) in the Dashboard, and the "Integrations" tab in the sidebar.

![Integrations Page](/assets/images/integrations_page-0f9edc52770c9caa6980330930e7517a.png)

Click on the Sentry card and follow the setup directions. You will need your [Sentry DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/). You may optionally specify additional tags to be added to each exception event.

## Supported Tags[​](#supported-tags "Direct link to Supported Tags")

Convex automatically tags exception events on their way to sentry with the following tags. These tags cannot be overridden.

* `func`: The name of the running function in [string format](/functions/query-functions.md#query-names)
* `func_type`: One of `["query", "mutation", "action", "http_action"]`
* `func_runtime`: One of the [function runtimes](/functions/runtimes.md) - `["default", "node"]`
* `request_id`: The [request id](/functions/debugging.md#finding-relevant-logs-by-request-id) of the function that errored.
* `server_name`: The name of the deployment. e.g. `happy-animal-123`
* `environment`: One of `["prod", "dev", "preview"]`
* `user`: If the function is [authenticated](/auth.md), then the [tokenIdentifier](/api/interfaces/server.UserIdentity.md#tokenidentifier) is used as the user id on Sentry. The `tokenIdentifier` is a stable and globally unique string representing the authenticated user.

## Sentry Notes[​](#sentry-notes "Direct link to Sentry Notes")

* Sentry Exceptions may take a minute or two to propagate to Sentry.
* Convex's built-in sentry support does not yet support the advanced customization provided by the sentry SDK.
* Please reach out with any questions, comments, or suggestions [on Discord](https://convex.dev/community).

## Configuring Datadog Error Tracking[​](#configuring-datadog-error-tracking "Direct link to Configuring Datadog Error Tracking")

Follow the instructions in the [Datadog application](https://app.datadoghq.com/error-tracking/settings/setup/sentry) to configure Datadog error tracking via the Sentry SDK. Then use the Convex-Sentry integration to proceed.
