# Functions

Functions run on the backend and are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript). They are automatically available as APIs accessed through [client libraries](/client/react.md). Everything you do in the Convex backend starts from functions.

There are three types of functions:

* [Queries](/functions/query-functions.md) read data from your Convex database and are automatically cached and subscribable (realtime, reactive).
* [Mutations](/functions/mutation-functions.md) write data to the database and run as a transaction.
* [Actions](/functions/actions.md) can call OpenAI, Stripe, Twilio, or any other service or API you need to make your app work.

You can also build [HTTP actions](/functions/http-actions.md) when you want to call your functions from a webhook or a custom client.

Here's an overview of the three different types of Convex functions and what they can do:

|                            | Queries | Mutations | Actions |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Database access            | Yes     | Yes       | No      |
| Transactional              | Yes     | Yes       | No      |
| Cached                     | Yes     | No        | No      |
| Real-time Updates          | Yes     | No        | No      |
| External API Calls (fetch) | No      | No        | Yes     |
