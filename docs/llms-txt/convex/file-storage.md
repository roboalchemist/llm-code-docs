# File Storage

File Storage makes it easy to implement file upload in your app, store files from and send files to third-party APIs, and to serve dynamic files to your users. All file types are supported.

* [Upload](/file-storage/upload-files.md) files to store them in Convex and reference them in your database documents
* [Store](/file-storage/store-files.md) files generated or fetched from third-party APIs
* [Serve](/file-storage/serve-files.md) files via URL
* [Delete](/file-storage/delete-files.md) files stored in Convex
* Access file [metadata](/file-storage/file-metadata.md)

You can manage your stored files on the [dashboard](/dashboard/deployments/file-storage.md).

**Examples:** [File Storage with HTTP Actions](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/file-storage-with-http), [File Storage with Queries and Mutations](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/file-storage)
