# iOS Swift Quickstart

Learn how to query data from Convex in an application targeting iOS and MacOS devices built with Swift and SwiftUI.

This quickstart assumes that you have a Mac with Xcode, node and npm installed. If you don’t have those tools, take time to install them first.

1. Create a new iOS app in Xcode

   1. Click *Create New Project*
   2. Select iOS App and click *Next*
   3. Name your project something like “ConvexQuickstart”
   4. Ensure Language is set to Swift and User Interface is SwiftUI
   5. Click *Next*

2. Configure dependencies

   1. Click on the top-level ConvexQuickstart app container in the project navigator on the left
   2. Click on ConvexQuickstart under the PROJECT heading
   3. Click the Package Dependencies tab
   4. Click the + button (See Screenshot)
   5. Paste
      <!-- -->
      ```
      https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift
      ```
      <!-- -->
      into the search box and press enter
   6. When the `convex-swift` package loads, click the *Add Package* button
   7. In the *Package Products* dialog, select ConvexQuickstart in the *Add to Target* dropdown
   8. Click the Add Package button

3. <br />

   Install the Convex backend

   Open a terminal and `cd` to the directory for the Xcode project you created. Run the following commands to install the Convex client and server library.

   ```
   npm init -y
   npm install convex
   ```

4. Start Convex

   Start a Convex dev deployment. Follow the command line instructions to create a new project.

   ```
   npx convex dev
   ```

5. Create sample data for your database

   Create a new `sampleData.jsonl` file in your Swift project directory with these contents

   ```
   {"text": "Buy groceries", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Go for a swim", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Integrate Convex", "isCompleted": false}
   ```

6. Add the sample data to a table called \`tasks\` in your database

   Open another terminal tab by pressing ⌘+T which should open in your Swift project directory and run

   ```
   npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
   ```

7. Expose a database query

   Create a `tasks.ts` file in the `convex/` directory within your Swift project with the following contents

   ```
   import { query } from "./_generated/server";

   export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query("tasks").collect();
     },
   });
   ```

8. Create a Swift struct

   Back in Xcode, create a `struct` at the bottom of the `ContentView` file to match the sample data

   ```
   // We're using the name Todo instead of Task to avoid clashing with
   // Swift's builtin Task type.
   struct Todo: Decodable {
     let _id: String
     let text: String
     let isCompleted: Bool
   }
   ```

9. Connect the app to your backend

   1. Get the deployment URL of your dev server with `cat .env.local | grep CONVEX_URL`
   2. Create a `ConvexClient` instance near the top of the file, just above the `ContentView` struct

   ```
   import SwiftUI
   import ConvexMobile

   let convex = ConvexClient(deploymentUrl: "YOUR_CONVEX_URL")

   struct ContentView: View {
   ...
   ```

10. Create your UI

    Replace the default `ContentView` with the following code that will refresh the list of todo items whenever the backend data changes.

    ```
    struct ContentView: View {
      @State private var todos: [Todo] = []

      var body: some View {
        List {
          ForEach(todos, id: \._id) { todo in
            Text(todo.text)
          }
        }.task {
          for await todos: [Todo] in convex.subscribe(to: "tasks:get")
            .replaceError(with: []).values
          {
            self.todos = todos
          }
        }.padding()
      }
    }
    ```

11. Run the app

    1. Press ⌘+R or click *Product → Run*
    2. You can also try adding, updating or deleting documents in your `tasks` table at `dashboard.convex.dev` - the app will update with the changes in real-time.
