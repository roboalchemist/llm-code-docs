# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration allows your team to move fast by combining changes from all team members and automatically testing them on a remote machine.

## Testing in GitHub Actions[​](#testing-in-github-actions "Direct link to Testing in GitHub Actions")

It's easy if you're using [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to set up [CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) workflow for running your test suite:

.github/workflows/test.yml

```
name: Run Tests

on: [pull_request, push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
```

After you commit and push this file to your repository, GitHub will run `npm run test` every time you create a pull request or push a new commit.
