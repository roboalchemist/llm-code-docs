# Deployment Platform API

info

The Convex Deployment API is openly available in Beta. Please contact <platforms@convex.dev> if your use case requires additional capabilities.

Unlike HTTP endpoints which expose application-specific functionality to clients, management API endpoints configure deployments (e.g. modifying environment variables).

## Authorization[​](#authorization "Direct link to Authorization")

The Deployment Management API requires a Authorization header with a key that grants admin access to that deployment.

[Deployment keys](https://docs.convex.dev/cli/deploy-key-types#development-deploy-keys) created in the [dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings#url-and-deploy-key) or by API calls can be used for these APIs.

[Team Access Tokens](/platform-apis.md#managing-your-own-projects) and [OAuth Application Tokens](/platform-apis/oauth-applications.md) can also be used in depending on whether you are using the Management API on behalf of your own team or on behalf of the team of a user of a Convex integration you've built.

Whatever type of key, add the string `"Convex "` to the front.

```
const token = "ey...0=";
const response = await fetch(
  "https://happy-otter-123.convex.cloud/api/v1/list_environment_variables",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Convex ${token}`,
    },
  },
);
console.log(await response.json());
```
