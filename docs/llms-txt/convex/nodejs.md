# Node.js Quickstart

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Node.js project.

For instructions for subscriptions instead of point-in-time queries and more project configurations (TypeScript, bundlers, CJS vs ESM) see [Node.js notes](/client/javascript/node.md).

1. Create a new npm project

   Create a new directory for your Node.js project.

   ```
   mkdir my-project && cd my-project && npm init -y && npm pkg set type="module"
   ```

2. Install the Convex client and server library

   Install the `convex` package which provides a convenient interface for working with Convex from JavaScript.

   Also install the `dotenv` library for loading `.env` files.

   ```
   npm install convex dotenv
   ```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment

   Next, run `npx convex dev`. This will prompt you to log in with GitHub, create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

   It will also create a `convex/` folder for you to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command will then continue running to sync your functions with your dev deployment in the cloud.

   ```
   npx convex dev
   ```

4. Create sample data for your database

   In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl` file with some sample data.

   sampleData.jsonl

   ```
   {"text": "Buy groceries", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Go for a swim", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Integrate Convex", "isCompleted": false}
   ```

5. Add the sample data to your database

   Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table with the sample data into your Convex database with the `import` command.

   ```
   npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
   ```

6. Expose a database query

   Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder with a query function that loads the data.

   Exporting a query function from this file declares an API function named after the file and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.

   convex/tasks.js

   ```
   import { query } from "./_generated/server";

   export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query("tasks").collect();
     },
   });
   ```

7. Connect the script to your backend

   In a new file `script.js`, create a `ConvexHttpClient` using the URL of your development environment.

   script.js

   ```
   import { ConvexHttpClient } from "convex/browser";
   import { api } from "./convex/_generated/api.js";
   import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
   dotenv.config({ path: ".env.local" });

   const client = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env["CONVEX_URL"]);

   client.query(api.tasks.get).then(console.log);
   ```

8. Run the script

   Run the script from the same directory and see the list of tasks logged to the terminal.

   ```
   node script.js
   ```
