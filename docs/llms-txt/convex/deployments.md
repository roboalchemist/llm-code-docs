# Deployments

Each project in Convex has a main production deployment, and each developer on your team can also set up their own personal development deployment. Additionally, there are [preview deployments](/production/hosting/preview-deployments.md) used to test backend changes before they're deployed to production.

While on a [deployment page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment), you may switch between production, your development deployment, and any preview deployments by using the dropdown menu on the top-left of the page.
