# Python Quickstart

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Python app.

1. Create a Python script folder

   Create a folder for your Python script with a virtual environment.

   ```
   python3 -m venv my-app/venv
   ```

2. Install the Convex client and server libraries

   To get started, install the `convex` npm package which enables you to write your backend.

   And also install the `convex` Python client library and `python-dotenv` for working with `.env` files.

   ```
   cd my-app && npm init -y && npm install convex && venv/bin/pip install convex python-dotenv
   ```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment

   Next, run `npx convex dev`. This will prompt you to log in with GitHub, create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

   It will also create a `convex/` folder for you to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command will then continue running to sync your functions with your dev deployment in the cloud.

   ```
   npx convex dev
   ```

4. Create sample data for your database

   In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl` file with some sample data.

   sampleData.jsonl

   ```
   {"text": "Buy groceries", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Go for a swim", "isCompleted": true}
   {"text": "Integrate Convex", "isCompleted": false}
   ```

5. Add the sample data to your database

   Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table with the sample data into your Convex database with the `import` command.

   ```
   npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
   ```

6. Expose a database query

   Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder with a query function that loads the data.

   Exporting a query function from this file declares an API function named after the file and the export name, `"tasks:get"`.

   convex/tasks.js

   ```
   import { query } from "./_generated/server";

   export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async ({ db }) => {
       return await db.query("tasks").collect();
     },
   });
   ```

7. Create a script to load data from Convex

   In a new file `main.py`, create a `ConvexClient` and use it to fetch from your `"tasks:get"` API.

   main.py

   ```
   import os

   from convex import ConvexClient
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   load_dotenv(".env.local")
   CONVEX_URL = os.getenv("CONVEX_URL")
   # or you can hardcode your deployment URL instead
   # CONVEX_URL = "https://happy-otter-123.convex.cloud"

   client = ConvexClient(CONVEX_URL)

   print(client.query("tasks:get"))

   for tasks in client.subscribe("tasks:get"):
       print(tasks)
       # this loop lasts forever, ctrl-c to exit it
   ```

8. Run the script

   Run the script and see the serialized list of tasks.

   ```
   venv/bin/python -m main
   ```
