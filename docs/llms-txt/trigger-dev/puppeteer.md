# Puppeteer

> Use the puppeteer build extension to enable support for Puppeteer in your project

<ScrapingWarning />

To use Puppeteer in your project, add these build settings to your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts trigger.config.ts theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { puppeteer } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/puppeteer";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [puppeteer()],
  },
});
```

And add the following environment variable in your Trigger.dev dashboard on the Environment Variables page:

```bash  theme={"theme":"css-variables"}
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH: "/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable",
```

Follow [this example](/guides/examples/puppeteer) to get setup with Trigger.dev and Puppeteer in your project.
