        Use your project-specific Secret API key. Will start with `tr_dev_`,
        `tr_prod`, `tr_stg`, etc.


        You can find your Secret API key in the API Keys section of your
        Trigger.dev project dashboard.


        Our TypeScript SDK will default to using the value of the
        `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` environment variable if it is set. If you are using
        the SDK in a different environment, you can set the key using the
        `configure` function.


        ```typescript

        import { configure } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";


        configure({ accessToken: "tr_dev_1234" });

        ```
