### About

[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.

## Sponsors

Hey API is sponsor-funded. If you rely on Hey API in production, consider becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hey-api) to accelerate the roadmap.
