# Web Frameworks

There are two approaches to developing APIs: code-first, where you start with the code, or spec-first, where you begin with the specification. If you use the latter, you can ensure your APIs adhere to the specification with our web framework plugins.

## Options

Hey API natively supports the following frameworks.

* [Angular](/openapi-ts/plugins/angular)
* [Fastify](/openapi-ts/plugins/fastify)
* [Adonis](/openapi-ts/plugins/adonis) Soon
* [Elysia](/openapi-ts/plugins/elysia) Soon
* [Express](/openapi-ts/plugins/express) Soon
* [Hono](/openapi-ts/plugins/hono) Soon
* [Koa](/openapi-ts/plugins/koa) Soon
* [Nest](/openapi-ts/plugins/nest) Soon
