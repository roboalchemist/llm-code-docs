# Core

Apart from being responsible for the default output, core plugins are the foundation for other plugins. Instead of creating their own primitives, other plugins can reuse the artifacts from core plugins. This results in a smaller output size and a better user experience.

## Options

Hey API provides the following core plugins.

* [TypeScript](/openapi-ts/plugins/typescript)
* [SDK](/openapi-ts/plugins/sdk)
* [Transformers](/openapi-ts/plugins/transformers)
* [Schemas](/openapi-ts/plugins/schemas)

Need another core plugin? Let us know your interest by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues).

## Examples

You can view live examples on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/orgs/github/hey-api/collections/openapi-ts-examples).

## Sponsors

Hey API is sponsor-funded. If you rely on Hey API in production, consider becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hey-api) to accelerate the roadmap.
