# Overview

The Svelte MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)) server can help your LLM or agent of choice write better Svelte code. It works by providing documentation relevant to the task at hand, and statically analysing generated code so that it can suggest fixes and best practices.

## Setup

The setup varies based on the version of the MCP you prefer — remote or local — and your chosen MCP client (e.g. Claude Code, Codex CLI or GitHub Copilot):

- [local setup](local-setup) using `@sveltejs/mcp`
- [remote setup](remote-setup) using `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp`

## Usage

To get the most out of the MCP server we recommend including the following prompt in your [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md) (or [`CLAUDE.md`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#claude-md-imports), if using Claude Code. Or [`GEMINI.md`](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md/), if using GEMINI). This will tell the LLM which tools are available and when it's appropriate to use them.

> [!NOTE] This is already setup for you when using `npx sv add mcp`

You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available Svelte MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.


If your MCP client supports it, we also recommend using the [svelte-task](prompts#svelte-task) prompt to instruct the LLM on the best way to use the MCP server.

# Local setup

The local (or stdio) version of the MCP server is available via the [`@sveltejs/mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltejs/mcp) npm package. You can either install it globally and then reference it in your configuration or run it with `npx`:

```bash
npx -y @sveltejs/mcp
```

Here's how to set it up in some common MCP clients:

## Claude Code

To include the local MCP version in Claude Code, simply run the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add -t stdio -s [scope] svelte -- npx -y @sveltejs/mcp
```

The `[scope]` must be `user`, `project` or `local`.

## Claude Desktop

In the Settings > Developer section, click on Edit Config. It will open the folder with a `claude_desktop_config.json` file in it. Edit the file to include the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"svelte": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@sveltejs/mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Codex CLI

Add the following to your `config.toml` (which defaults to `~/.codex/config.toml`, but refer to [the configuration documentation](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md) for more advanced setups):

```toml
[mcp_servers.svelte]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@sveltejs/mcp"]
```

## Copilot CLI

Use the Copilot CLI to interactively add the MCP server:

```bash
/mcp add
```

Alternatively, create or edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and add the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"svelte": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@sveltejs/mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Gemini CLI

To include the local MCP version in Gemini CLI, simply run the following command:

```bash
gemini mcp add -t stdio -s [scope] svelte npx -y @sveltejs/mcp
```

The `[scope]` must be `user`, `project` or `local`.

## OpenCode

You can automatically configure the MCP server using the [OpenCode plugin](opencode-plugin) (recommended). If you prefer to configure the MCP server manually, run:

```bash
opencode mcp add
```

and follow the instructions, selecting 'Local' under the 'Select MCP server type' prompt:

```bash
opencode mcp add

┌  Add MCP server
│
◇  Enter MCP server name
│  svelte
│
◇  Select MCP server type
│  Local
│
◆  Enter command to run
│  npx -y @sveltejs/mcp
```

## VS Code

- Open the command palette
- Select "MCP: Add Server..."
- Select "Command (stdio)"
- Insert `npx -y @sveltejs/mcp` in the input and press `Enter`
- When prompted for a name, insert `svelte`
- Select if you want to add it as a `Global` or `Workspace` MCP server

## Cursor

- Open the command palette
- Select "View: Open MCP Settings"
- Click on "Add custom MCP"

It will open a file with your MCP servers where you can add the following configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"svelte": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@sveltejs/mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

## Zed

Install the [Svelte MCP Server extension](https://zed.dev/extensions/svelte-mcp).

<details>

<summary>Configure Manually</summary>

	}
}
```

</details>

## Other clients

If we didn't include the MCP client you are using, refer to their documentation for `stdio` servers and use `npx` as the command and `-y @sveltejs/mcp` as the arguments.

# Remote setup

The remote version of the MCP server is available at `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp`.

Here's how to set it up in some common MCP clients:

## Claude Code

To include the remote MCP version in Claude Code, simply run the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add -t http -s [scope] svelte https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp
```

You can choose your preferred `scope` (it must be `user`, `project` or `local`) and `name`.

If you prefer you can also install the `svelte` plugin in [the Svelte Claude Code Marketplace](plugin) that will give you both the remote server and useful [skills](skills).

## Claude Desktop

- Open Settings > Connectors
- Click on Add Custom Connector
- When prompted for a name, enter `svelte`
- Under the Remote MCP server URL input, use `https://mcp.svelte.dev/mcp`

# Tools

The following tools are provided by the MCP server to the model you are using, which can decide to call one or more of them during a session:

## list-sections

Provides a list of all the available documentation sections.

## get-documentation

Allows the model to get the full (and up-to-date) documentation for the requested sections directly from [svelte.dev/docs](/docs).

## svelte-autofixer

Uses static analysis to provide suggestions for code that your LLM generates. It can be invoked in an agentic loop by your model until all issues and suggestions are resolved.

## playground-link

Generates an ephemeral playground link with the generated code. It's useful when the generated code is not written to a file in your project and you want to quickly test the generated solution. The code is not stored anywhere except the URL itself (which will often, as a consequence, be quite large).

# Resources

This is the list of available resources provided by the MCP server. Resources are included by the user (not by the LLM) and are useful if you want to include specific knowledge in your session. For example, if you know that the component will need to use transitions you can include the transition documentation directly without asking the LLM to do it for you.

## doc-section

This dynamic resource allows you to add every section of the Svelte documentation as a resource. The URI looks like this `svelte://slug-of-the-docs.md` and the returned resource will contain the `llms.txt` version of the specific page you selected.

# Prompts

This is the list of available prompts provided by the MCP server. Prompts are selected by the user and are sent as a user message. They can be useful to write repetitive instructions for the LLM on how to properly use the MCP server.

## svelte-task

This prompt should be used whenever you are asking the model to work on a Svelte-related task. It will instruct the LLM which documentation sections are available, which tools to invoke, when to invoke them, and how to interpret the results.

<details>
	<summary>Copy the prompt</summary>

```md
You are a Svelte expert tasked to build components and utilities for Svelte developers. If you need documentation for anything related to Svelte you can invoke the tool `get-documentation` with one of the following paths. However: before invoking the `get-documentation` tool, try to answer the users query using your own knowledge and the `svelte-autofixer` tool. Be mindful of how many section you request, since it is token-intensive!

</available-docs>

These are the available documentation sections that `list-sections` will return, you do not need to call it again.

Every time you write a Svelte component or a Svelte module you MUST invoke the `svelte-autofixer` tool providing the code. The tool will return a list of issues or suggestions. If there are any issues or suggestions you MUST fix them and call the tool again with the updated code. You MUST keep doing this until the tool returns no issues or suggestions. Only then you can return the code to the user.

This is the task you will work on:

<task>
[YOUR TASK HERE]
</task>

If you are not writing the code into a file, once you have the final version of the code ask the user if it wants to generate a playground link to quickly check the code in it and if it answer yes call the `playground-link` tool and return the url to the user nicely formatted. The playground link MUST be generated only once you have the final version of the code and you are ready to share it, it MUST include an entry point file called `App.svelte` where the main component should live. If you have multiple files to include in the playground link you can include them all at the root.
```

# Overview

The open source [repository](https://github.com/sveltejs/ai-tools) containing the code for the MCP server is also a Claude Code Marketplace plugin.

The marketplace allows you to install the `svelte` plugin which will give you the remote MCP server, [skills](skills) to instruct the LLM on how to properly write Svelte 5 code, and a specialized agent for editing Svelte files.

If possible, we recommend that you instruct the LLM to execute MCP calls with the agent (you can explicitly mention an agent in your message to delegate work to it) when creating or editing `.svelte` files or `.svelte.ts`/`.svelte.js` modules as it helps save context by handling Svelte-specific tasks more efficiently.

## Installation

To add the repository as a marketplace, launch Claude Code and type the following:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sveltejs/ai-tools
```

Then, install the Svelte plugin:

```bash
/plugin install svelte
```

# Subagent

The Svelte plugin includes a specialized subagent called `svelte-file-editor` designed for creating, editing, and reviewing Svelte files.

## Benefits

The subagent has access to its own context window, allowing it to fetch the documentation, iterate with the `svelte-autofixer` tool and write to the file system without wasting context in the main agent.

The delegation should happen automatically when appropriate, but you can also explicitly request the subagent be used for Svelte-related tasks.

# Overview

OpenCode has a [plugin system](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/) that allows developers to add MCP servers, agents and commands programmatically. Svelte has an OpenCode plugin published under `@sveltejs/opencode`.

## Installation

To install the plugin in OpenCode you can edit your [OpenCode config]() (either the global or the local one), adding `@sveltejs/opencode` to the list of plugins.

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
	"plugin": ["@sveltejs/opencode"]
}
```

That's it! You now have the Svelte MCP server, [skills](skills), and the [file editor subagent](opencode-subagent) configured for you.

## Configuration

The default configuration for the Svelte OpenCode plugin looks like this...

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sveltejs/ai-tools/refs/heads/main/packages/opencode/schema.json",
	"mcp": {
		"type": "remote",
		"enabled": true
	},
	"subagent": {
		"enabled": true
	},
	"skills": {
		"enabled": true
	},
	"instructions": {
		"enabled": true
	}
}
```

...but if you prefer, you can enable only the subagent, only the MCP, only the skills, or configure the kind of MCP server you want to use (`local` or `remote`).

You can place this file in `./.opencode/svelte.json` (in your project), in `~/.config/opencode/svelte.json` or, if you have an `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable specified, at `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/svelte.json`.

# Subagent

The Svelte plugin includes a specialized subagent called `svelte-file-editor` designed for creating, editing, and reviewing Svelte files.

## Benefits

The subagent has access to its own context window, allowing it to fetch the documentation, iterate with the `svelte-autofixer` tool and write to the file system without wasting context in the main agent.

The delegation should happen automatically when appropriate, but you can also explicitly request the subagent be used for Svelte-related tasks.

# Overview

This is the list of available skills provided by the Svelte MCP package. Skills are sets of instructions that AI agents can load on-demand to help with specific tasks.

Skills are available in both the Claude Code plugin (installed via the marketplace) and the OpenCode plugin (`@sveltejs/opencode`). They can also be manually installed in your `.claude/skills/` or `.opencode/skills/` folder.

You can download the latest skills from the [releases page](https://github.com/sveltejs/ai-tools/releases) or find them in the [`plugins/svelte/skills`](https://github.com/sveltejs/ai-tools/tree/main/plugins/svelte/skills) folder.

## `svelte-code-writer`

CLI tools for Svelte 5 documentation lookup and code analysis. MUST be used whenever creating, editing or analyzing any Svelte component (.svelte) or Svelte module (.svelte.ts/.svelte.js). If possible, this skill should be executed within the svelte-file-editor agent for optimal results.

# Svelte 5 Code Writer

## CLI Tools

You have access to `@sveltejs/mcp` CLI for Svelte-specific assistance. Use these commands via `npx`:

### List Documentation Sections

```bash
npx @sveltejs/mcp list-sections
```

Lists all available Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation sections with titles and paths.

### Get Documentation

```bash
npx @sveltejs/mcp get-documentation "<section1>,<section2>,..."
```

Retrieves full documentation for specified sections. Use after `list-sections` to fetch relevant docs.

**Example:**

```bash
npx @sveltejs/mcp get-documentation "$state,$derived,$effect"
```

### Svelte Autofixer

```bash
npx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer "<code_or_path>" [options]
```

Analyzes Svelte code and suggests fixes for common issues.

**Options:**

- `--async` - Enable async Svelte mode (default: false)
- `--svelte-version` - Target version: 4 or 5 (default: 5)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Analyze inline code (escape $ as \$)
npx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer '<script>let count = \$state(0);</script>'

# Analyze a file
npx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer ./src/lib/Component.svelte

# Target Svelte 4
npx @sveltejs/mcp svelte-autofixer ./Component.svelte --svelte-version 4
```

**Important:** When passing code with runes (`$state`, `$derived`, etc.) via the terminal, escape the `$` character as `\$` to prevent shell variable substitution.

## Workflow

1. **Uncertain about syntax?** Run `list-sections` then `get-documentation` for relevant topics
2. **Reviewing/debugging?** Run `svelte-autofixer` on the code to detect issues
3. **Always validate** - Run `svelte-autofixer` before finalizing any Svelte component

````markdown
## `$state`

Only use the `$state` rune for variables that should be _reactive_ — in other words, variables that cause an `$effect`, `$derived` or template expression to update. Everything else can be a normal variable.

Objects and arrays (`$state({...})` or `$state([...])`) are made deeply reactive, meaning mutation will trigger updates. This has a trade-off: in exchange for fine-grained reactivity, the objects must be proxied, which has performance overhead. In cases where you're dealing with large objects that are only ever reassigned (rather than mutated), use `$state.raw` instead. This is often the case with API responses, for example.

## `$derived`

To compute something from state, use `$derived` rather than `$effect`:

```js
// do this
let square = $derived(num * num);

// don't do this
let square;

$effect(() => {
	square = num * num;
});
```

> [!NOTE] `$derived` is given an expression, _not_ a function. If you need to use a function (because the expression is complex, for example) use `$derived.by`.

Deriveds are writable — you can assign to them, just like `$state`, except that they will re-evaluate when their expression changes.

If the derived expression is an object or array, it will be returned as-is — it is _not_ made deeply reactive. You can, however, use `$state` inside `$derived.by` in the rare cases that you need this.

## `$effect`

Effects are an escape hatch and should mostly be avoided. In particular, avoid updating state inside effects.

- If you need to sync state to an external library such as D3, it is often neater to use [`{@attach ...}`](references/@attach.md)
- If you need to run some code in response to user interaction, put the code directly in an event handler or use a [function binding](references/bind.md) as appropriate
- If you need to log values for debugging purposes, use [`$inspect`](references/$inspect.md)
- If you need to observe something external to Svelte, use [`createSubscriber`](references/svelte-reactivity.md)

Never wrap the contents of an effect in `if (browser) {...}` or similar — effects do not run on the server.

## `$props`

Treat props as though they will change. For example, values that depend on props should usually use `$derived`:

```js
// @errors: 2451
let { type } = $props();

// do this
let color = $derived(type === 'danger' ? 'red' : 'green');

// don't do this — `color` will not update if `type` changes
let color = type === 'danger' ? 'red' : 'green';
```

## `$inspect.trace`

`$inspect.trace` is a debugging tool for reactivity. If something is not updating properly or running more than it should you can add `$inspect.trace(label)` as the first line of an `$effect` or `$derived.by` (or any function they call) to trace their dependencies and discover which one triggered an update.

## Events

Any element attribute starting with `on` is treated as an event listener:

```svelte
<button onclick={() => {...}}>click me</button>

<!-- attribute shorthand also works -->
<button {onclick}>...</button>

<!-- so do spread attributes -->
<button {...props}>...</button>
```

If you need to attach listeners to `window` or `document` you can use `<svelte:window>` and `<svelte:document>`:

```svelte
<svelte:window onkeydown={...} />
<svelte:document onvisibilitychange={...} />
```

Avoid using `onMount` or `$effect` for this.

## Snippets

[Snippets](references/snippet.md) are a way to define reusable chunks of markup that can be instantiated with the [`{@render ...}`](references/@render.md) tag, or passed to components as props. They must be declared within the template.

```svelte
{#snippet greeting(name)}
	<p>hello {name}!</p>
{/snippet}

{@render greeting('world')}
```

> [!NOTE] Snippets declared at the top level of a component (i.e. not inside elements or blocks) can be referenced inside `<script>`. A snippet that doesn't reference component state is also available in a `<script module>`, in which case it can be exported for use by other components.

## Each blocks

Prefer to use [keyed each blocks](references/each.md) — this improves performance by allowing Svelte to surgically insert or remove items rather than updating the DOM belonging to existing items.

> [!NOTE] The key _must_ uniquely identify the object. Do not use the index as a key.

Avoid destructuring if you need to mutate the item (with something like `bind:value={item.count}`, for example).

## Using JavaScript variables in CSS

If you have a JS variable that you want to use inside CSS you can set a CSS custom property with the `style:` directive.

```svelte
<div style:--columns={columns}>...</div>
```

You can then reference `var(--columns)` inside the component's `<style>`.

## Styling child components

The CSS in a component's `<style>` is scoped to that component. If a parent component needs to control the child's styles, the preferred way is to use CSS custom properties:

```svelte
<!-- Parent.svelte -->
<Child --color="red" />

<!-- Child.svelte -->
<h1>Hello</h1>

<style>
	h1 {
		color: var(--color);
	}
</style>
```

If this impossible (for example, the child component comes from a library) you can use `:global` to override styles:

```svelte
<div>
	<Child />
</div>

<style>
	div :global {
		h1 {
			color: red;
		}
	}
</style>
```

## Context

Consider using context instead of declaring state in a shared module. This will scope the state to the part of the app that needs it, and eliminate the possibility of it leaking between users when server-side rendering.

Use `createContext` rather than `setContext` and `getContext`, as it provides type safety.

## Async Svelte

If using version 5.36 or higher, you can use [await expressions](references/await-expressions.md) and [hydratable](references/hydratable.md) to use promises directly inside components. Note that these require the `experimental.async` option to be enabled in `svelte.config.js` as they are not yet considered fully stable.

## Avoid legacy features

Always use runes mode for new code, and avoid features that have more modern replacements:

- use `$state` instead of implicit reactivity (e.g. `let count = 0; count += 1`)
- use `$derived` and `$effect` instead of `$:` assignments and statements (but only use effects when there is no better solution)
- use `$props` instead of `export let`, `$$props` and `$$restProps`
- use `onclick={...}` instead of `on:click={...}`
- use `{#snippet ...}` and `{@render ...}` instead of `<slot>` and `$$slots` and `<svelte:fragment>`
- use `<DynamicComponent>` instead of `<svelte:component this={DynamicComponent}>`
- use `import Self from './ThisComponent.svelte'` and `<Self>` instead of `<svelte:self>`
- use classes with `$state` fields to share reactivity between components, instead of using stores
- use `{@attach ...}` instead of `use:action`
- use clsx-style arrays and objects in `class` attributes, instead of the `class:` directive
