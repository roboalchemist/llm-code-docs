<SYSTEM>This is the developer documentation for Svelte CLI.</SYSTEM>


# Overview

The command line interface (CLI), `sv`, is a toolkit for creating and maintaining Svelte applications.

## Usage

The easiest way to run `sv` is with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) (or the equivalent command if you're using a different package manager — for example, `pnpm dlx` if you're using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)):

```sh
npx sv <command> <args>
```

If you're inside a project where `sv` is already installed, this will use the local installation, otherwise it will download the latest version and run it without installing it, which is particularly useful for [`sv create`](sv-create).

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to [Christopher Brown](https://github.com/chbrown) who originally owned the `sv` name on npm for graciously allowing it to be used for the Svelte CLI. You can find the original `sv` package at [`@chbrown/sv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chbrown/sv).

# Frequently asked questions

## How do I run the `sv` CLI?

Running `sv` looks slightly different for each package manager. Here is a list of the most common commands:

- **npm** : `npx sv create`
- **pnpm** : `pnpm dlx sv create`
- **Bun** : `bunx sv create`
- **Deno** : `deno run npm:sv create`
- **Yarn** : `yarn dlx sv create`

## `npx sv` is not working

Some package managers prefer to run locally installed tools instead of downloading and executing packages from the registry. This issue mostly occurs with `npm` and `yarn`. This usually results in an error message or looks like the command you were trying to execute did not do anything.

Here is a list of issues with possible solutions that users have encountered in the past:

- [`npx sv` create does nothing](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/472)
- [`sv` command name collides with `runit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/259)
- [`sv` in windows powershell conflicts with `Set-Variable`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/issues/317)

# sv create

`sv create` sets up a new SvelteKit project, with options to [setup additional functionality](sv-add#Official-add-ons).

## Usage

```sh
npx sv create [options] [path]
```

## Options

### `--from-playground <url>`

Create a SvelteKit project from a [playground](/playground) URL. This downloads all playground files, detects external dependencies, and sets up a complete SvelteKit project structure with everything ready to go.

Example:

```sh
npx sv create --from-playground="https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world"
```

### `--template <name>`

Which project template to use:

- `minimal` — barebones scaffolding for your new app
- `demo` — showcase app with a word guessing game that works without JavaScript
- `library` — template for a Svelte library, set up with `svelte-package`
  <!-- TODO: JYC: Uncomment this when the addon template is ready -->
  <!-- - `addon` — template for a community add-on, ready to be tested & published -->

### `--types <option>`

Whether and how to add typechecking to the project:

- `ts` — default to `.ts` files and use `lang="ts"` for `.svelte` components
- `jsdoc` — use [JSDoc syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) for types

### `--no-types`

Prevent typechecking from being added. Not recommended!

### `--add [add-ons...]`

Add add-ons to the project in the `create` command. Following the same format as [sv add](sv-add#Usage).

Example:

```sh
npx sv create --add eslint prettier [path]
```

### `--no-add-ons`

Run the command without the interactive add-ons prompt

### `--install <package-manager>`

Installs dependencies with a specified package manager:

- `npm`
- `pnpm`
- `yarn`
- `bun`
- `deno`

### `--no-install`

Prevents installing dependencies.

### `--no-dir-check`

Skip checking whether the target directory is empty.

# sv add

`sv add` updates an existing project with new functionality.

## Usage

```sh
npx sv add
```

```sh
npx sv add [add-ons]
```

You can select multiple space-separated add-ons from [the list below](#Official-add-ons), or you can use the interactive prompt.

## Options

### `-C`, `--cwd`

Path to the root of your Svelte(Kit) project.

### `--no-git-check`

Even if some files are dirty, no prompt will be shown

### `--no-download-check`

Skip all download confirmation prompts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Svelte maintainers have not reviewed community add-ons for malicious code. Use at your discretion

### `--install <package-manager>`

Installs dependencies with a specified package manager:

- `npm`
- `pnpm`
- `yarn`
- `bun`
- `deno`

### `--no-install`

Prevents installing dependencies

## Community add-ons

> [!NOTE]
> Community add-ons are currently **experimental**. The API may change. Don't use them in production yet!

> [!NOTE]
> Svelte maintainers have not reviewed community add-ons for malicious code!

You can find [community add-ons on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Asv-add) by searching for `keywords:sv-add`.

### How to install a community add-on

```sh
npx sv add [PROTOCOL][COMMUNITY_ADDON]
```

You can:

- mix and match official and community add-ons
- use the interactive prompt or give args to the cli
- use the `--add` option in the `create` command

```sh
npx sv add eslint "@supacool"
```

```sh
npx sv create --add eslint "@supacool"
```

### Package Protocols

```sh
# Scoped package: @org (preferred), we will look for @org/sv
npx sv add "@supacool"

# Regular npm package (with or without scope)
npx sv add my-cool-addon

# Local add-on
npx sv add file:../path/to/my-addon
```

### How to create a community add-on

To start on a good track, create your add-on with the `addon` template.

```sh
npx sv create --template addon [path]
```

In your new add-on directory, check out the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to get started.

Then you can continue with the [API docs](/docs/cli/add-on) to start building your add-on. You can also have a look at the [official addons source code](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli/tree/main/packages/sv/src/addons) to get some inspiration on what can be done.

# sv check

`sv check` finds errors and warnings in your project, such as:

- unused CSS
- accessibility hints
- JavaScript/TypeScript compiler errors

Requires Node 16 or later.

## Installation

You will need to have the `svelte-check` package installed in your project:

```sh
npm i -D svelte-check
```

## Usage

```sh
npx sv check
```

## Options

### `--workspace <path>`

Path to your workspace. All subdirectories except `node_modules` and those listed in `--ignore` are checked.

### `--output <format>`

How to display errors and warnings. See [machine-readable output](#Machine-readable-output).

- `human`
- `human-verbose`
- `machine`
- `machine-verbose`

### `--watch`

Keeps the process alive and watches for changes.

### `--preserveWatchOutput`

Prevents the screen from being cleared in watch mode.

### `--tsconfig <path>`

Pass a path to a `tsconfig` or `jsconfig` file. The path can be relative to the workspace path or absolute. Doing this means that only files matched by the `files`/`include`/`exclude` pattern of the config file are diagnosed. It also means that errors from TypeScript and JavaScript files are reported. If not given, will traverse upwards from the project directory looking for the next `jsconfig`/`tsconfig.json` file.

### `--no-tsconfig`

Use this if you only want to check the Svelte files found in the current directory and below and ignore any `.js`/`.ts` files (they will not be type-checked)

### `--ignore <paths>`

Files/folders to ignore, relative to workspace root. Paths should be comma-separated and quoted. Example:

```sh
npx sv check --ignore "dist,build"
```

<!-- TODO what the hell does this mean? is it possible to use --tsconfig AND --no-tsconfig? if so what would THAT mean? -->

Only has an effect when used in conjunction with `--no-tsconfig`. When used in conjunction with `--tsconfig`, this will only have effect on the files watched, not on the files that are diagnosed, which is then determined by the `tsconfig.json`.

### `--fail-on-warnings`

If provided, warnings will cause `sv check` to exit with an error code.

### `--compiler-warnings <warnings>`

A quoted, comma-separated list of `code:behaviour` pairs where `code` is a [compiler warning code](../svelte/compiler-warnings) and `behaviour` is either `ignore` or `error`:

```sh
npx sv check --compiler-warnings "css_unused_selector:ignore,a11y_missing_attribute:error"
```

### `--diagnostic-sources <sources>`

A quoted, comma-separated list of sources that should run diagnostics on your code. By default, all are active:

<!-- TODO would be nice to have a clearer definition of what these are -->
- `js` (includes TypeScript)
- `svelte`
- `css`

Example:

```sh
npx sv check --diagnostic-sources "js,svelte"
```

### `--threshold <level>`

Filters the diagnostics:

- `warning` (default) — both errors and warnings are shown
- `error` — only errors are shown

## Troubleshooting

[See the language-tools documentation](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/blob/master/docs/README.md) for more information on preprocessor setup and other troubleshooting.

## Machine-readable output

Setting the `--output` to `machine` or `machine-verbose` will format output in a way that is easier to read
by machines, e.g. inside CI pipelines, for code quality checks, etc.

Each row corresponds to a new record. Rows are made up of columns that are separated by a
single space character. The first column of every row contains a timestamp in milliseconds
which can be used for monitoring purposes. The second column gives us the "row type", based
on which the number and types of subsequent columns may differ.

The first row is of type `START` and contains the workspace folder (wrapped in quotes). Example:

```
1590680325583 START "/home/user/language-tools/packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/testfiles"
```

Any number of `ERROR` or `WARNING` records may follow. Their structure is identical and depends on the output argument.

If the argument is `machine` it will tell us the filename, the starting line and column numbers, and the error message. The filename is relative to the workspace directory. The filename and the message are both wrapped in quotes. Example:

```
1590680326283 ERROR "codeactions.svelte" 1:16 "Cannot find module 'blubb' or its corresponding type declarations."
1590680326778 WARNING "imported-file.svelte" 0:37 "Component has unused export property 'prop'. If it is for external reference only, please consider using `export const prop`"
```

If the argument is `machine-verbose` it will tell us the filename, the starting line and column numbers, the ending line and column numbers, the error message, the code of diagnostic, the human-friendly description of the code and the human-friendly source of the diagnostic (eg. svelte/typescript). The filename is relative to the workspace directory. Each diagnostic is represented as an [ndjson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-Delimited_JSON) line prefixed by the timestamp of the log. Example:

```
1590680326283 {"type":"ERROR","fn":"codeaction.svelte","start":{"line":1,"character":16},"end":{"line":1,"character":23},"message":"Cannot find module 'blubb' or its corresponding type declarations.","code":2307,"source":"js"}
1590680326778 {"type":"WARNING","filename":"imported-file.svelte","start":{"line":0,"character":37},"end":{"line":0,"character":51},"message":"Component has unused export property 'prop'. If it is for external reference only, please consider using `export
const prop`","code":"unused-export-let","source":"svelte"}
```

The output concludes with a `COMPLETED` message that summarizes total numbers of files, errors and warnings that were encountered during the check. Example:

```
1590680326807 COMPLETED 20 FILES 21 ERRORS 1 WARNINGS 3 FILES_WITH_PROBLEMS
```

If the application experiences a runtime error, this error will appear as a `FAILURE` record. Example:

```
1590680328921 FAILURE "Connection closed"
```

## Credits

- Vue's [VTI](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/tree/master/vti) which laid the foundation for `svelte-check`

## FAQ

### Why is there no option to only check specific files (for example only staged files)?

`svelte-check` needs to 'see' the whole project for checks to be valid. Suppose you renamed a component prop but didn't update any of the places where the prop is used — the usage sites are all errors now, but you would miss them if checks only ran on changed files.

# sv migrate

`sv migrate` migrates Svelte(Kit) codebases. It delegates to the [`svelte-migrate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-migrate) package.

Some migrations may annotate your codebase with tasks for completion that you can find by searching for `@migration`.

## Usage

```sh
npx sv migrate
```

You can also specify a migration directly via the CLI:
```sh
npx sv migrate [migration]
```

## Migrations

### `app-state`

Migrates `$app/stores` usage to `$app/state` in `.svelte` files. See the [migration guide](/docs/kit/migrating-to-sveltekit-2#SvelteKit-2.12:-$app-stores-deprecated) for more details.

### `svelte-5`

Upgrades a Svelte 4 app to use Svelte 5, and updates individual components to use [runes](../svelte/what-are-runes) and other Svelte 5 syntax ([see migration guide](../svelte/v5-migration-guide)).

### `self-closing-tags`

Replaces all the self-closing non-void elements in your `.svelte` files. See the [pull request](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12128) for more details.

### `svelte-4`

Upgrades a Svelte 3 app to use Svelte 4 ([see migration guide](../svelte/v4-migration-guide)).

### `sveltekit-2`

Upgrades a SvelteKit 1 app to SvelteKit 2 ([see migration guide](../kit/migrating-to-sveltekit-2)).

### `package`

Upgrades a library using `@sveltejs/package` version 1 to version 2. See the [pull request](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8922) for more details.

### `routes`

Upgrades a pre-release SvelteKit app to use the filesystem routing conventions in SvelteKit 1. See the [pull request](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5774) for more details.

# devtools-json

The `devtools-json` add-on installs [`vite-plugin-devtools-json`](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/vite-plugin-devtools-json/), which is a Vite plugin for generating a Chromium DevTools project settings file on-the-fly in the development server. This file is served from `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json` and tells Chromium browsers where your project's source code lives so that you can use [the workspaces feature](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) to edit source files in the browser.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing the plugin enables the feature for all users connecting to the dev server with a Chromium browser, and allows the browser to read and write all files within the directory. If you are using Chrome's AI Assistance feature, this may also result in data being sent to Google.

## Alternatives

If you'd prefer not to install the plugin, but still want to avoid seeing a message about the missing file, you have a couple of options.

Firstly, you can prevent the request from being issued on your machine by disabling the feature in your browser. You can do this in Chrome by visiting `chrome://flags` and disabling the "DevTools Project Settings". You may also be interested in disabling "DevTools Automatic Workspace Folders" since it’s closely related.

You can also prevent the web server from issuing a notice regarding the incoming request for all developers of your application by handling the request yourself. For example, you can create a file named `.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json` with the contents `"Go away, Chrome DevTools!"` or you can add logic to respond to the request in your [`handle`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/hooks#Server-hooks-handle) hook:

```js
/// file: src/hooks.server.js
import { dev } from '$app/environment';

export function handle({ event, resolve }) {
	if (dev && event.url.pathname === '/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json') {
		return new Response(undefined, { status: 404 });
	}

	return resolve(event);
}
```

## Usage

```sh
npx sv add devtools-json
```

## What you get

- `vite-plugin-devtools-json` added to your Vite plugin options

# drizzle

## Usage

```sh
npx sv add drizzle
```

## What you get

# add-on

> [!NOTE]
> Community add-ons are currently **experimental**. The API may change. Don't use them in production yet!

This guide covers how to create, test, and publish community add-ons for `sv`.

## Quick start

The easiest way to create an add-on is using the addon template:

```sh
npx sv create --template addon my-addon
cd my-addon
```

## Add-on structure

Typically, an add-on looks like this:

_hover keywords in the code to have some more context_

```js
import { parse, svelte } from '@sveltejs/sv-utils';
import { defineAddon, defineAddonOptions } from 'sv';

// Define options that will be prompted to the user (or passed as arguments)
const options = defineAddonOptions()
	.add('who', {
		question: 'To whom should the addon say hello?',
		type: 'string' // boolean | number | select | multiselect
	})
	.build();

// your add-on definition, the entry point
export default defineAddon({
	id: 'your-addon-name',

	options,

	// preparing step, check requirements and dependencies
	setup: ({ dependsOn }) => {
		dependsOn('tailwindcss');
	},

	// actual execution of the addon
	run: ({ kit, cancel, sv, options }) => {
		if (!kit) return cancel('SvelteKit is required');

		// Add "Hello [who]!" to the root page
		sv.file(kit.routesDirectory + '/+page.svelte', (content) => {
			const { ast, generateCode } = parse.svelte(content);

			svelte.addFragment(ast, `<p>Hello ${options.who}!</p>`);

			return generateCode();
		});
	}
});
```

## Development with `file:` protocol

While developing your add-on, you can test it locally using the `file:` protocol:

```sh
# In your test project
npx sv add file:../path/to/my-addon
```

This allows you to iterate quickly without publishing to npm.

## Testing with `sv/testing`

The `sv/testing` module provides utilities for testing your add-on:

```js
import { test, expect } from 'vitest';
import { setupTest } from 'sv/testing';
import addon from './index.js';

test('adds hello message', async () => {
	const { content } = await setupTest({
		addon,
		options: { who: 'World' },
		files: {
			'src/routes/+page.svelte': '<h1>Welcome</h1>'

## Publishing to npm

### Package structure

Your add-on must have `sv` as a dependency in `package.json`:

```json
{
	"name": "@your-org/sv",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"type": "module",
	"exports": {
		".": "./dist/index.js"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"sv": "^0.11.0"
	},
	"keywords": ["sv-add"]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Add the `sv-add` keyword so users can discover your add-on on npm.

### Export options

Your package can export the add-on in two ways:

1. **Default export** (recommended for dedicated add-on packages):

   ```json
   {
   	"exports": {
   		".": "./dist/index.js"
   	}
   }
   ```

2. **`/sv` export** (for packages that have other functionality):
   ```json
   {
   	"exports": {
   		".": "./dist/main.js",
   		"./sv": "./dist/addon.js"
   	}
   }
   ```

### Naming conventions

- **Scoped packages**: Use `@your-org/sv` as the package name. Users can then install with just `npx sv add @your-org`.
- **Regular packages**: Any name works. Users install with `npx sv add your-package-name`.

## Version compatibility

Your add-on should specify the minimum `sv` version it requires in `package.json`. If a user's `sv` version has a different major version than what your add-on was built for, they will see a compatibility warning.

# sv-utils

> [!NOTE]
> `@sveltejs/sv-utils` is currently **experimental**. The API may change. Full documentation is not yet available.

`@sveltejs/sv-utils` provides utilities for parsing, transforming, and generating code in add-ons.

```sh
npm install @sveltejs/sv-utils
```
