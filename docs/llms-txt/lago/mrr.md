            Quantifies the revenue generated from `subscription` fees on a
            monthly basis. This figure is calculated post-application of
            applicable taxes and deduction of any applicable discounts. The
            method of calculation varies based on the subscription billing
            cycle:


            - Revenue from `monthly` subscription invoices is included in the
            MRR for the month in which the invoice is issued.

            - Revenue from `quarterly` subscription invoices is distributed
            evenly over three months. This distribution applies to fees paid in
            advance (allocated to the next remaining months depending on
            calendar or anniversary billing) as well as to fees paid in arrears
            (allocated to the preceding months depending on calendar or
            anniversary billing).

            - Revenue from `yearly` subscription invoices is distributed evenly
            over twelve months. This allocation is applicable for fees paid in
            advance (spread over the next remaining months depending on calendar
            or anniversary billing) and for fees paid in arrears (spread over
            the previous months depending on calendar or anniversary billing).

            - Revenue from `semiannual` subscription invoices is distributed
            evenly over six months. This allocation is applicable for fees paid
            in advance (spread over the next remaining months depending on
            calendar or anniversary billing) and for fees paid in arrears
            (spread over the previous months depending on calendar or
            anniversary billing).

            - Revenue from `weekly` subscription invoices, the total revenue
            from all invoices issued within a month is summed up. This total is
            then divided by the number of invoices issued during that month, and
            the result is multiplied by 4.33, representing the average number of
            weeks in a month.
