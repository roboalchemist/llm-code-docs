Decorator for registering an ASGI app with a Modal function.

Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) is a standard for Python
synchronous and asynchronous apps, supported by all popular Python web
libraries. This is an advanced decorator that gives full flexibility in
defining one or more web endpoints on Modal.

**Usage:**

```python
from typing import Callable

@app.function()
@modal.asgi_app()
def create_asgi() -> Callable:
    ...
```

To learn how to use Modal with popular web frameworks, see the
[guide on web endpoints](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks).
