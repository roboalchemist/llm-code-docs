# Kaisar's Competitive Edge

* Kaisar offers a fundamentally different approach to cloud computing. We leverage a distributed and decentralized model that provides increased control and flexibility for users. Kaisar's services don't involve complicated permission models and are cost-efficient. The combination of all these factors sets Kaisar in its own league of decentralized providers.
* Kaisar is a GPU DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network that leverages blockchains, IoT, and the greater Web3 ecosystem to create, operate, and maintain real-world physical infrastructure. These networks use token incentives to coordinate, reward, and safeguard members of the network.

Kaisar leverages [the peaq blockchain](https://www.peaq.network/), a multi-chain layer one blockchain specifically designed and optimized for DePIN. The network can scale beyond 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) (pending upgrade) while maintaining a minimal transaction cost of approximately $0.00025
