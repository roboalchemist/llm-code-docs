# Overview & Mission

Kaisar is a decentralized GPU network designed to provide unlimited computing power to machine learning (ML) and AI applications.&#x20;

Our mission is to make computing scalable, accessible, and efficient by leveraging underutilized GPU resources from independent data centers, crypto miners, and consumer households. We aim to assemble over a million GPUs from these diverse sources to create a robust and decentralized computing infrastructure.
