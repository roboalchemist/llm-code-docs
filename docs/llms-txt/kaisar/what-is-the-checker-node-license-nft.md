# What is the Checker Node License (NFT)

The Checker Node License is an ERC721 NFT that lets you earn rewards by running a Checker Node Client. You can run your Client on your own machine, through a Virtual Private Server (VPS), through a Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) Provider, or delegate it to another user's machine.

You can purchase your NFT from [nodes.kaisar.io](https://nodes.kaisar.io) or through the secondary market in the future. Contracts will be released soon, so stay tuned for updates.

Checker Node NFT Licenses cannot be transferred from the purchase wallet during the first year.
