# Kaisar ZeroNode

## 1. What is Kaisar ZeroNode

Kaisar is a DePIN protocol uniting global GPU and CPU resources into a universal AI compute layer. It enables individuals to connect devices, earn rewards, and access decentralized infrastructure, offering AI developers and businesses a scalable, affordable alternative to traditional cloud services.

ZeroNode, Kaisar’s Chrome extension, empowers users to contribute to this next-gen computing layer by tracking key metrics like location and uptime. Your participation supports the upcoming launch of the worker node (Kaisar OneNode), allowing you to further monetize your hardware and drive the shift toward decentralized infrastructure.

## 2. ZeroNode Rewards

ZeroNode rewards are derived from four key components:

### 2.1. Running a ZeroNode

Rewards for running a ZeroNode are tied to its uptime—the time your node is online and operational. You can earn up to **300 points daily** for maintaining 24 hours of uptime, incentivizing consistent participation and ensuring network reliability.

**Kaisar NFT holders** enjoy a significant advantage: owning a Kaisar NFT doubles your earnings. For example, if your node earns 300 points daily, NFT holders will earn **600 points**, highlighting their integral role in the Kaisar ecosystem.

### 2.2. Referrals

Both the referrer and the referee receive one ticket when you invite a new member to the network. Additionally, the referrer earns an extra 10% reward from the earnings of their referrals. Tickets earned from referrals can be used to participate in lucky draws.

Please note that the referrer will only receive the bonus once the referee’s node has been running for 6 consecutive hours.

### 2.3. Missions

A wide array of missions will be introduced upon launch, and we’ll continue to roll out new challenges weekly, ranging from easy to difficult.&#x20;

To kick things off, we’ll offer tasks such as completing daily check-ins and engaging in various social activities to earn additional points. Your rewards for daily check-ins will grow with each consecutive day of check-in, culminating in a maximum payout on the seventh day. The cycle then repeats.

We’ll unveil more missions in the future, so be sure to follow Kaisar closely for the latest updates.

### 2.4. Lucky Draw

Our innovative Lucky Draw feature sets us apart, offering you a unique opportunity to win exciting rewards. To participate, simply collect tickets. Here are the primary ways to acquire tickets:

* **Referrals:** Invite your friends and earn tickets for each successful referral. The more referrals you make, the more tickets you’ll receive.
* **Points Burning:** Burn 300 points from your active ZeroNode to receive a ticket. You can burn unlimited points to get as many tickets as possible.&#x20;
* **Campaign Participation:** Keep an eye out for our ongoing campaigns and giveaways, where you can earn tickets by completing specific tasks.
* **Future Initiatives:** As we continue to evolve, we may introduce additional ways to earn tickets, such as through limited-time events or community challenges.

The rewards and mechanics of our Lucky Draw are subject to change, ensuring that there are always fresh and exciting opportunities for our community.

## 3. Empowering the Future of advanced and decentralized AI

Kaisar envisions a future where individuals can reclaim control over their computing resources, breaking free from centralized monopolies that have dominated the infrastructure landscape. By participating in the Kaisar ecosystem, you are not only contributing to a more equitable distribution of computing power but also helping to shape the future of decentralized AI.&#x20;
