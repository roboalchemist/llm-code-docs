# FAQs

* **What are Checker Nodes?**

  Checker Nodes validate transactions, monitor uptime, and ensure system reliability within the Kaisar DePIN protocol.
* **How does the two-phase sale work?**

  Participants reserve funds during the Fund Commitment Phase, which determines their priority for the Node Sale Phase. Additional benefits include $KAI rewards, tier-based pricing discounts, and referral bonuses.

  A Checker Node Operator can operate multiple Kaisar NFTs and claim rewards from a single machine through the Checker Node Client.

  A Checker Node Operator owns Kaisar Node NFTs and can run the checker node client on their own machine, through a Virtual Machine, through Node-as-a-Service, or by delegating to another user's machine.
* **What rewards can I expect as a Checker Node operator?**

  Rewards are distributed based on your node’s performance and uptime contributions.
* **Can I purchase multiple Checker Nodes?**

  Referrers earn 10% cashback for purchases made through their referral link, while buyers receive a 10% discount.
* **What happens to unallocated $KAI rewards?**

  Any remaining $KAI rewards will be redistributed among early participants at the end of the Fund Commitment phase.
