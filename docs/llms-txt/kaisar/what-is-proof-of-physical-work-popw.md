# What is Proof of Physical Work (PoPW)?

Proof of Physical Work (PoPW) is a token distribution mechanism used by Kaisar to reward GPU providers for completing verifiable physical work in the real world. It involves validating the performance, uptime, and device info of GPU providers through checkers, with rewards distributed based on these scores.
