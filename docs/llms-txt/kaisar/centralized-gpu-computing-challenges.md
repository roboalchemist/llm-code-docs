# Centralized GPU Computing Challenges

The compute challenges associated with centralized cloud GPU providers are plenty. Below are some statements from prominent publications:

* As demand for GPU compute grows, scaling centralized infrastructure can be challenging. According to Gartner, "GPU-accelerated computing is becoming more prevalent, but scaling GPU resources efficiently remains complex."(Source: Gartner, "Disaggregate Compute and Storage to Enable Scalable, Flexible, and Cost-Effective Data Centers" (2020))
* High-performance GPUs are expensive, and centralizing them can lead to significant upfront costs. A Springer publication notes that "the capital expenditure for large GPU clusters can be prohibitive for many organizations."(Source: Springer, "A Survey on GPU-Based Cloud Computing" (2019))
* GPUs consume substantial power and generate significant heat. Centralizing many GPUs intensifies these challenges. Gartner highlights that "power and cooling requirements for dense GPU deployments are a major consideration in data center design."(Source: Gartner, "Data Center Infrastructure Planning Tool" (2020))
* Network latency: For some applications, network latency between centralized GPUs and distributed data sources can be problematic. Gartner points out that "data locality and network performance are critical factors in GPU-accelerated computing architectures."(Source: Gartner, "Best Practices for Building a Scalable Data Science Platform" (2020))
* Centralized GPU computing requires specialized software stacks and tools. Gartner notes that "the rapidly evolving GPU software ecosystem can create integration and compatibility challenges."(Source: Gartner, "Magic Quadrant for High-Performance Computing" (2020))
