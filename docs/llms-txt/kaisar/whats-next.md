# What’s Next?

After purchasing an Kaisar node, investors will receive an ERC-721 NFT to the wallet addresses used during the Kaisar node sale. The NFT symbolizes ownership of the purchased Kaisar node. Keep in mind that there's no cap on the number of nodes you can buy.

You can purchase as many nodes as you want, if available. The Checker Node license gives buyers lifetime access. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale.

The NFTs will be airdropped to buyer wallets directly at a later date. There's no claiming process. There will be sufficient time between the NFT airdrop and time for us
