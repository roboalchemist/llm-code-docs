# Best Practices: Optimizing Your Email Outreach

## Sequence Copy

1. **Keep an individual sequence to 4 email touches max -** Within a four-touch sequence, we recommend alternating the structure between 2 new threads and 2 follow-up replies. The copy of these follow-up replies can be short and limited to 1-2 sentences. Example: "Any thoughts on my previous note?"

2. **Alternate case studies and value props between new threads -** You should vary the copy and angle you're approaching to pitch your product in email steps 1 and 3. For example, you can highlight different customer case studies or statistics across both emails.

3. **Shorten subject line and use personalization -** Keep subject titles concise and add custom variables to increase variability. This approach will also help improve deliverability. Example: "Unify x (Your Company Name)"

4. **Include statistics and case studies for social proof -** Incorporating very numbers-driven, concise impact statements can catch your prospect's attention. We recommend adding concise blurbs from customer case studies into your sequence copy.

5. **Add personalization with snippets -** You can use Unify's smart snippets to personalize copy based on relevant value prop, job title, work description, industry, and more. This will make your sequence copy more compelling with targeted pain points, use cases, or case studies. More variance in email copy will also help with deliverability.

6. **Keep it concise, focus on a single product or pain point -** Don't try to fit too many points into your email - you want to be decisive and mention the most relevant product or pain point to that individual to capture their attention! Keep the language simple and avoid business jargon. We generally recommend keeping each email between 50-200 words.

7. **End with a compelling call to action (CTA) -** Conclude each email with a clear, specific, and actionable request. This could include scheduling a call, booking a demo, or asking the prospect to reply with a specific piece of information relevant to their needs.

## Deliverability

1. **Limit the links -** Try not to overload your emails with multiple or duplicate links. Too many links can set off spam alarms - we generally recommend limiting the email touch to include 1-2 links maximum.

2. **Check link safety -** Ensure the links you include are secure and no warnings are displayed by the browser when visiting them.

3. **Mix up subject lines -** Don't stick with the same old subject lines, use template variables to keep them dynamic and interesting.

4. **No all caps -** Using all caps anywhere in your email can make it look spammy, so stick to normal capitalization.

5. **Easy on the exclamation -** Too many exclamation points can trigger spam filters, especially in the subject line. Use them sparingly!

6. **Send from multiple email addresses -** Sending emails from multiple mailboxes improves deliverability by distributing volume across different IP addresses and domains. This approach reduces the risk of being flagged as spam and increases overall sending capacity.

7. **Proofread for Typos**: Typos can make your email look unprofessional, especially when you're emailing multiple contacts at a company. Make sure to proofread and catch any errors.
