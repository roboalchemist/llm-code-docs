# HubSpot Setup for Nooks Integration

This guide walks you through how to set up the Nooks integration with HubSpot to synchronize call tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* Admin access to your HubSpot account
* An active Nooks subscription

## Setup Steps

1. **Admin**: Map users to their Hubspot profiles. Make sure your team has the proper permissions in your Hubspot to be able to create sequences, tasks or lists for themselves (If managers/admins are creating sequences and lists, this can be disregarded)
2. Create or Edit your Call Outcomes
3. Set up automation rules and/or filters to ensure proper hygiene and activities against your contacts.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [setup guide](https://support.devrev.ai/nooks/article/ART-120-getting-started-with-hubspot).

## Next Steps

With your HubSpot integration configured and Nooks connected, you're ready to [launch your first call campaign](/reference/integrations/nooks/call-campaigns)!
