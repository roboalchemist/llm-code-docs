# Website Visitor Intent

> Start revealing the companies and people visiting your website.

## Overview

By integrating with your website, Unify can reveal the companies and people
visiting your website in real-time. Beyond idenifying these visitors, Unify
enables you to take action based on which pages they're clicking on, where
they're visiting from, and how many sessions they've had.

## How to get started

### Step 1: Integrate Unify with your website

The first step is to integrate Unify with your website using either the official
Unify plugin for your website or a third-party analytics provider like Segment.

If you're not already using Segment, we recommend starting with the official
Unify plugin. You can find the installation instructions [here](/developers/intent-client/overview).
For customers already using Segment, you can find the instructions for setting
up the official Segment integration [here](/reference/integrations/segment).

### Step 2: Turn on website intent data

Once that's done, the only thing left to do is to enable the feature in Unify
and start revealing the companies and people visiting your website. Navigate to
[Settings -> Unify Intent](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent)
to turn on this feature.

If you already have a subscription to 6sense or Clearbit Reveal, you can also
bring your own API key. See the [6sense](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/6sense)
and [Clearbit](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/clearbit)
integration settings pages to get started.
