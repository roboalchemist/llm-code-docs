# Best Practices: Plays to Book You Meetings

## Section 1: Best Practices

Unify is a sales engagement platform designed to help you generate pipeline. To ensure that you see the best results, we recommend a few general principles:

* **Act Quickly:** Act on intent signals within 24-48 hours to catch prospects before they make their decision. Intent gets stale quickly.
* **Engage with Every Lead:** Once you define your ICP in Unify, avoid selective outreach. Avoid introducing bias into how you prospect.
* **Multiple Touchpoints:** If you’ve found that a channel works best for your team, use Unify to lean into that. Unify excels at email - if that’s your preferred channel, great. If not, use email in addition to social or phone outreach. See section 4 below to see our recommendations for email and social outreach.

## Section 2: Actioning on Intent

There are two primary ways to act on intent data in Unify:

### Automatic Plays

* **When to use:** Both for low and high volume signals. Plays automate prospecting, qualifying, sequencing, and syncing leads to your CRM.
* **Benefits:** Reduce friction and improve intent to meeting booked conversion by immediately actioning on leads.
* Learn more about how to build Plays in [How to Create a Play](/tutorials/how-to-create-a-play).

### Manual Alerts

* **When to use:** Ideal for low volume, high value signals. It's important to ensure the sales team is accountable for acting on alerts to ensure hot leads don’t slip through the cracks.
* **Benefits:** Immediate and contextual information delivered to where your team is working.
* Most reps use Slack alerts to trigger manual workflows. Learn how to set these up in our [Slack Integration Guide](/reference/integrations/slack#slack-integration-guide)

## Section 3: Intent-Based Plays

Intent signals are indicators that there’s an opportunity to sell your product or book an intro meeting. Our customers have seen success with these intent-based Plays:

1. **Pricing Page Visits:** Checking out pricing pages indicates that prospects are seriously considering a purchase decision.
2. **[Repeat Buyers](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/champion-tracking---outbound-to-past-customers-who-have-moved-jobs):** When someone you’ve sold to before is back on the website demonstrating high intent. This works well for businesses that have more transactional sales.
3. **[Inbound Form Submissions](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-website-form-submitters):** A form submission is one of the strongest signs of intent. Convert those leads immediately by automating outreach as soon as they submit.
4. **[New Hires](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-people-who-have-started-jobs-at-a-new-company):** People are more likely to purchase new tools in their first few months on a job. Targeting your ICPs that have just changed jobs can convert better.
5. **[Support Docs](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-contacts-viewing-your-technical-docs):** Interest in support docs (e.g., integration details), suggests prospects are trying to understand how your product works and if it would work for them.
6. **[Product Tour Visits](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-people-who-view-your-product-demo):** Interest in demo videos or product tours indicates a desire to understand specific product offerings in more granularity.
7. **[Retarget Paid Traffic](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/retarget-paid-traffic):** Get more out of your spend on paid traffic by retargeting people based on UTM filters.
8. **[Closed-Lost Opportunities](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/retarget-closed-lost-opportunities-when-they-revisit-website):** A revisit to your site by a closed-lost opportunities signals the prospect might be interested in re-engaging.

## Section 4: Section 4: Nailing Email or Social Outreach

Nailing email and social messages is key to booking the most possible meetings from Unify. A few guiding principles:

1. **Use Soft Messaging:** Use your judgement, but we typically recommend against direct mentions of website activity. Instead, tailor messages to address the pain points related to the product or service they showed interest in.
2. **Keep It Short:** Many senior leaders at your target accounts read emails on their phones, concise messages under 100 words are more likely to be read and understood. Remember that people are skimming emails.
3. **Persona-Specific Messaging:** Address specific pain points and perspectives of the different personas you sell to (e.g., sales and marketing for us). Avoid generic messages that try to cater to multiple personas, as they may resonate with none.
4. **Focus on One Product:** If you sell multiple products, pitch one per email. This approach minimizes the chances that your prospect gets confused about what you solve.
5. **Highlight Relevant Pain Points:** Rather than pitching your product, focus on speaking to a specific challenge or pain point that your prospect has. Educate the prospect on your product once you’re on the phone with them.
