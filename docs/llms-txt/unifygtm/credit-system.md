## Best practices

* **Use Prospecting Limits**: Set limits on the number of people you want to prospect for at each company, especially when targeting only a couple personas.

* **Create Specific Personas**: Be as specific as possible when listing titles to include or exclude in your buyer persona to make sure you aren't prospecting for unqualified contacts.

* **Set Global Exclusions**: Exclusions are a helpful way to make sure that you are not prospecting, enriching, or tracking people who don't fit your ICP.
