# Running Call Campaigns with Nooks

> Launch and manage effective call campaigns using Nooks with your CRM integration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting your call campaign, ensure you have:

* Completed your CRM setup ([HubSpot](/reference/integrations/nooks/hubspot-setup) or [Salesforce](/reference/integrations/nooks/salesforce-setup))

## Setting Up Your Call Campaign

### 1. Create Your Sequence

Create a Unify Sequence that includes manual phone call steps. This will generate the call tasks that sync to your CRM and feed into Nooks. Learn more in our [Sequences guide](/reference/sequences/manual-steps#phone-call-steps).

### 2. Monitor the Sync

Sequence enrollments will appear in your CRM within 30 minutes of being created in Unify. These tasks will automatically be available in Nooks when you reset your call list.

### 3. Set Up Your Call Session

In Nooks, follow these steps to prepare your calling session:

1. Login to Nooks

2. Select your call sequence

### 4. Start Calling

Begin your call campaign! As you complete calls, results will automatically sync back to both your CRM and Unify, keeping all your systems up to date.
