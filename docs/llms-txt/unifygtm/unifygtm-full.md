# Best Practices: Optimizing Your Email Outreach
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/best-practices/deliverability



## Sequence Copy

1. **Keep an individual sequence to 4 email touches max -** Within a four-touch sequence, we recommend alternating the structure between 2 new threads and 2 follow-up replies. The copy of these follow-up replies can be short and limited to 1-2 sentences. Example: "Any thoughts on my previous note?"

2. **Alternate case studies and value props between new threads -** You should vary the copy and angle you're approaching to pitch your product in email steps 1 and 3. For example, you can highlight different customer case studies or statistics across both emails.

3. **Shorten subject line and use personalization -** Keep subject titles concise and add custom variables to increase variability. This approach will also help improve deliverability. Example: "Unify x (Your Company Name)"

4. **Include statistics and case studies for social proof -** Incorporating very numbers-driven, concise impact statements can catch your prospect's attention. We recommend adding concise blurbs from customer case studies into your sequence copy.

5. **Add personalization with snippets -** You can use Unify's smart snippets to personalize copy based on relevant value prop, job title, work description, industry, and more. This will make your sequence copy more compelling with targeted pain points, use cases, or case studies. More variance in email copy will also help with deliverability.

6. **Keep it concise, focus on a single product or pain point -** Don't try to fit too many points into your email - you want to be decisive and mention the most relevant product or pain point to that individual to capture their attention! Keep the language simple and avoid business jargon. We generally recommend keeping each email between 50-200 words.

7. **End with a compelling call to action (CTA) -** Conclude each email with a clear, specific, and actionable request. This could include scheduling a call, booking a demo, or asking the prospect to reply with a specific piece of information relevant to their needs.

## Deliverability

1. **Limit the links -** Try not to overload your emails with multiple or duplicate links. Too many links can set off spam alarms - we generally recommend limiting the email touch to include 1-2 links maximum.

2. **Check link safety -** Ensure the links you include are secure and no warnings are displayed by the browser when visiting them.

3. **Mix up subject lines -** Don't stick with the same old subject lines, use template variables to keep them dynamic and interesting.

4. **No all caps -** Using all caps anywhere in your email can make it look spammy, so stick to normal capitalization.

5. **Easy on the exclamation -** Too many exclamation points can trigger spam filters, especially in the subject line. Use them sparingly!

6. **Send from multiple email addresses -** Sending emails from multiple mailboxes improves deliverability by distributing volume across different IP addresses and domains. This approach reduces the risk of being flagged as spam and increases overall sending capacity.

7. **Proofread for Typos**: Typos can make your email look unprofessional, especially when you're emailing multiple contacts at a company. Make sure to proofread and catch any errors.

# Best Practices: Plays to Book You Meetings
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/best-practices/plays



## Section 1: Best Practices

Unify is a sales engagement platform designed to help you generate pipeline. To ensure that you see the best results, we recommend a few general principles:

* **Act Quickly:** Act on intent signals within 24-48 hours to catch prospects before they make their decision. Intent gets stale quickly.
* **Engage with Every Lead:** Once you define your ICP in Unify, avoid selective outreach. Avoid introducing bias into how you prospect.
* **Multiple Touchpoints:** If you’ve found that a channel works best for your team, use Unify to lean into that. Unify excels at email - if that’s your preferred channel, great. If not, use email in addition to social or phone outreach. See section 4 below to see our recommendations for email and social outreach.

## Section 2: Actioning on Intent

There are two primary ways to act on intent data in Unify:

### Automatic Plays

* **When to use:** Both for low and high volume signals. Plays automate prospecting, qualifying, sequencing, and syncing leads to your CRM.
* **Benefits:** Reduce friction and improve intent to meeting booked conversion by immediately actioning on leads.
* Learn more about how to build Plays in [How to Create a Play](/tutorials/how-to-create-a-play).

### Manual Alerts

* **When to use:** Ideal for low volume, high value signals. It's important to ensure the sales team is accountable for acting on alerts to ensure hot leads don’t slip through the cracks.
* **Benefits:** Immediate and contextual information delivered to where your team is working.
* Most reps use Slack alerts to trigger manual workflows. Learn how to set these up in our [Slack Integration Guide](/reference/integrations/slack#slack-integration-guide)

## Section 3: Intent-Based Plays

Intent signals are indicators that there’s an opportunity to sell your product or book an intro meeting. Our customers have seen success with these intent-based Plays:

1. **Pricing Page Visits:** Checking out pricing pages indicates that prospects are seriously considering a purchase decision.
2. **[Repeat Buyers](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/champion-tracking---outbound-to-past-customers-who-have-moved-jobs):** When someone you’ve sold to before is back on the website demonstrating high intent. This works well for businesses that have more transactional sales.
3. **[Inbound Form Submissions](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-website-form-submitters):** A form submission is one of the strongest signs of intent. Convert those leads immediately by automating outreach as soon as they submit.
4. **[New Hires](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-people-who-have-started-jobs-at-a-new-company):** People are more likely to purchase new tools in their first few months on a job. Targeting your ICPs that have just changed jobs can convert better.
5. **[Support Docs](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-contacts-viewing-your-technical-docs):** Interest in support docs (e.g., integration details), suggests prospects are trying to understand how your product works and if it would work for them.
6. **[Product Tour Visits](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/outbound-to-people-who-view-your-product-demo):** Interest in demo videos or product tours indicates a desire to understand specific product offerings in more granularity.
7. **[Retarget Paid Traffic](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/retarget-paid-traffic):** Get more out of your spend on paid traffic by retargeting people based on UTM filters.
8. **[Closed-Lost Opportunities](https://www.unifygtm.com/plays/retarget-closed-lost-opportunities-when-they-revisit-website):** A revisit to your site by a closed-lost opportunities signals the prospect might be interested in re-engaging.

## Section 4: Section 4: Nailing Email or Social Outreach

Nailing email and social messages is key to booking the most possible meetings from Unify. A few guiding principles:

1. **Use Soft Messaging:** Use your judgement, but we typically recommend against direct mentions of website activity. Instead, tailor messages to address the pain points related to the product or service they showed interest in.
2. **Keep It Short:** Many senior leaders at your target accounts read emails on their phones, concise messages under 100 words are more likely to be read and understood. Remember that people are skimming emails.
3. **Persona-Specific Messaging:** Address specific pain points and perspectives of the different personas you sell to (e.g., sales and marketing for us). Avoid generic messages that try to cater to multiple personas, as they may resonate with none.
4. **Focus on One Product:** If you sell multiple products, pitch one per email. This approach minimizes the chances that your prospect gets confused about what you solve.
5. **Highlight Relevant Pain Points:** Rather than pitching your product, focus on speaking to a specific challenge or pain point that your prospect has. Educate the prospect on your product once you’re on the phone with them.


# Best Practices: Writing AI Prompts
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/best-practices/prompting



## Section 1: General Tips

Unify has multiple AI features that can be used to improve qualification and outreach outcomes. To set yourself up for success, we recommend a few general principles for prompting when using these features:

* **Clear Instructions:** Be explicit about what you want the AI to do. Providing a clear set of instructions will help the AI understand what you want to accomplish and what steps to follow to complete the task(s).
* **Length =/= Quality:** Writing an overly detailed or essay length prompt does not mean that the AI will provide a better response. Excessive information can be detrimental unless it is properly structured and explained, as it can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the prompt.
* **Provide Context:** Assume AI does not know your industry, company, or product as well as you do. Provide relevant context as you reference information about your company or your goals. For example, if you are referencing a niche keyword, provide a brief explanation of what it means, how it relates to your business, and the task you are giving the AI.

## Section 2: AI Agents

There are two primary ways that you can provide information and instruction to Unify's AI Agents.

### Questions

* **Questions:** Questions are the minimum required input to run an AI Agent. You can ask any question about a Company or Person and select the type of response you want the Agent to provide (e.g., True/False, Text, Multi-Select, Number).
* **What information to provide:** In the question, only include the research question you want the Agent to answer. Avoid adding clarifying information or instructions to keep it focused.

### Guidance

* **When to use:** Guidance is an optional field for AI Agents that enables you to provide additional context or instructions to the AI Agent. When asking more complex questions, when you have a set of instructions or requirements that you want the AI Agent to follow, or when you want to provide clarification on the research question, guidance is the best way to provide that information.
* **How To Structure Guidance:** Similar to Prompts, Guidance should be clear, concise, and specific. Use the guidance to provide specific directions about each question that you are asking, and additional context if there is a specific way that you want the AI Agent to conduct its research. For example, if you want the AI Agent to only use information from a specific source, you can include that information in the guidance. Or, if you want to provide more direction on when the AI Agent should select a specific answer for a multi select response type, that information should also be included in the guidance.

## Section 3: Smart Snippets

Smart Snippets are a powerful way to personalize messaging to your prospects.

* **Provide Context (Again!):** The model can only act on what you provide. This means you should specify the information you want to create copy from, select template variables to reference, or add Agent template variables to the Smart Snippet. Additionally, provide context around the template variable to create a coherent prompt. Think of template variables as placeholders for information and write sentences or blurbs surrounding those variables.
* **Adding References:** A common mistake is referencing information that you haven't provided to the model, which can lead to incorrect responses. To prevent this, ensure that if you're referencing data provided through a template variable or Agent output, you include that template variable in the Snippet.

### Agent Outputs in Smart Snippets

Using Agents to conduct research and then incorporating that research into a Smart Snippet is a great way to hyper-personalize your messaging. To use this feature effectively:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Use the Agent to conduct research only, and use the Snippet to generate the copy. Each feature is optimized for its respective task.
* **Structure the Snippet prompt around the Agent variables:** When writing a Smart Snippet prompt with Agent output template variables, provide context and labels about what each Agent output contains so the Snippet can handle it accordingly. For example, if you have an Agent Question that asks for a True/False or Number answer, write your prompt using the Agent template variable as a placeholder in your sentences to provide context to the Snippet.
  * For example, if your Agent question was "What is the most recent product launch from this company?", your Snippet prompt should be something like: "Research indicates that this company just launched `{{Agent Question}}`. Write a sentence to congratulate them on the launch."

## Section 4: AI Research

AI Research is a powerful way to automate and customize research that you want to conduct about any company that you are engaging. AI Research is powered by Unify's Observation Model, which is the system that Unify uses to run completely customized research for your company on your prospects.

### Prompting AI Research

Writing prompts for AI Research is slightly different from writing prompts for AI Agents, as AI Research is designed to read as much relevant information as possible before generating a report for you. We recommend following the style of the Observation prompts we generated for you as a starting point. To prompt for AI Research, follow these guidelines:

* **Pick a General Signal:** The goal with an Observation prompt is to describe a specific piece of information to the system that you'd like to monitor for any given company. For example, if you know that a company using a specific technology has a high likelihood of becoming your customer, an Observation for that could be: "Company uses an outbound sequencer (Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo, etc.) and a data/intent source (ZoomInfo, 6sense, Bombora, Clearbit, Demandbase, G2 Intent)."

* **Test and Iterate:** Once you've written your prompt, take advantage of the settings page to generate examples and see what the resulting reports look like.


# Intent Client Usage
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/developers/intent-client/client-spec

Learn how to send events using the Unify Intent Client.

<Tip>
  The Unify Intent Client can be used to log user activity across multiple subdomains of the
  same top-level domain. For example, if a user visits your marketing website at `www.yoursite.com`
  and then logs into your production web application at `app.yoursite.com`, the activity in both
  places will be attributed to the same person.
</Tip>

## Page View Events

Website page views are an indicator of buyer intent. You can log this information to the Unify platform
for usage with the `page` method.

There are two ways to collect page data with the Unify intent client:

1. Automatic monitoring of the current page
2. Manually via the client `page` method

Utilizing both of these methods when appropriate is recommended to take full advantage of intent data
within Unify.

### Automatic Page Monitoring

The Unify intent client is capable of automatically monitoring the user's current page to trigger
page events. This will happen by default when the client is installed via the [Unify Website tag](./website-tag).
If the client is installed via a package manager, you must pass the `autoPage` configuration option
when instantiating the client. See [Configuration](#configuration) below for more details.

<Check>Automatic page monitoring works in Single Page Apps, too!</Check>

In either case, this behavior can be enabled or disabled programmatically via the `startAutoPage`
and `stopAutoPage` methods on the client:

```ts theme={null}
// Initialize the client and tell it to automatically monitor pages
const unify = new UnifyIntentClient(
  'YOUR_PUBLIC_WRITE_KEY',
  { autoPage: true },
);
unify.mount();

// Tell the client to stop monitoring pages
unify.stopAutoPage();

// Tell the client to start monitoring pages again
unify.startAutoPage();
```

### Manual Page Logging

You can also manually trigger a page event with the `page` method on the client. This is useful
when you do not want to trigger page events for every page.

```ts theme={null}
const unify = new UnifyIntentClient('YOUR_PUBLIC_WRITE_KEY');
unify.mount();

// Trigger a page event for whatever page the user is currently on
unify.page();

// Trigger a page event for a custom page other than the current page
unify.page({ pathname: '/some-custom-page' });
```

## Identify Events

All intent data collected for users by Unify is anonymous by default. When intent events are
logged, Unify will attempt to automatically de-anonymize the IP address of a user to associate
them with a specific company, but their personal identity will remain anonymous until an
identify event is triggered for them.

There are two ways to collect identity data with the Unify intent client:

1. Automatic monitoring of email input elements
2. Manually via the client `identify` method

Utilizing both of these methods when appropriate is recommended to take full advantage of intent
data within Unify.

### Automatic Input Monitoring

The Unify intent client is capable of automatically monitoring text and email input elements on
the page to collect user identity. This will happen by default when the client is installed via
the Unify JavaScript tag. If the client is installed via a package manager, you must pass the
`autoIdentify` configuration option when instantiating the client. See [Configuration](#configuration)
below for more details.

In either case, this behavior can be enabled or disabled programmatically via the `startAutoIdentify`
and `stopAutoIdentify` methods on the client:

```ts theme={null}
// Initialize the client and tell it to automatically monitor inputs
const unify = new UnifyIntentClient(
  'YOUR_PUBLIC_WRITE_KEY',
  { autoIdentify: true },
);
unify.mount();

// Tell the client to stop monitoring inputs for now
unify.stopAutoIdentify();

// Tell the client to start monitoring inputs again
unify.startAutoIdentify();
```

### Manual Identification

You can also manually trigger an identify event with the identify method on the client. This is
useful when users log-in with OAuth or SSO, for example, because they do not enter their email
into an input on the page. The `identify` call accepts an optional second argument where you can
pass any standard Person or Company fields (the same ones used in imports and CRM integrations).
Those fields are forwarded to Unify and merged into the user/company profile. See the
[standard Person fields](/reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings#people) and
[standard Company fields](/reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings#companies) reference
for the full list.

```ts theme={null}
const unify = new UnifyIntentClient('YOUR_PUBLIC_WRITE_KEY');
unify.mount();

// However you determine the currently logged-in user
const currentUser = getCurrentUser();

// Identify the current user
unify.identify(currentUser.emailAddress, {
  firstName: currentUser.firstName,
  lastName: currentUser.lastName,
  title: currentUser.title,
  phone: currentUser.phone,
  company: {
    name: currentUser.companyName,
    domain: currentUser.companyDomain,
    industry: currentUser.industry,
    employeeCount: currentUser.employeeCount,
  },
});
```

## Configuration

The following configuration options can be passed when initializing the client:

<ParamField type="boolean">
  <Note>If installed via the [Unify Website tag](./website-tag) then the `autoPage` config will default to `true`.</Note>

  Tells the client to automatically log page events whenever the current page changes.
  Works for static websites and Single Page Apps. Also logs a page event for the initial page.
</ParamField>

<ParamField type="boolean">
  <Note>If installed via the [Unify Website tag](./website-tag) then the `autoIdentify` config will default to `true`.</Note>

  Tells the client to automatically monitor text and email input elements on the
  page for changes. When the current user enters a valid email address into an input, the client
  will log an identify event for that email address.
</ParamField>


# JavaScript Client

  autoIdentify: false,
};

const unify = new UnifyIntentClient(writeKey, config);

// Do not call mount during server side rendering. Only call it in a browser context.
unify.mount();
```

You can then use the resulting client instance to log intent data. See the
[Client Spec](./client-spec) for more details on how to use the client.

## Cleanup

When you are done using the client, if you wish to clean up the side effects
generated by it, you can do so with the `unmount` method:

```ts cleanup.ts theme={null}
import { UnifyIntentClient, UnifyIntentClientConfig } from '@unifygtm/intent-client';

const writeKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY';

const unify = new UnifyIntentClient(writeKey);
unify.mount();

// Use the client for some time, then later...

unify.unmount();
```


# Intent Client Overview
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/developers/intent-client/overview

Learn how to start collecting website intent data in Unify.

Buyer intent data is at the core of what makes Unify tick. The easiest way to
start collecting this data is by installing the Unify Intent client on your
marketing website or web app.

# How it works

The Unify Intent client is a JavaScript library that allows you to collect
events from your website and send them to Unify. It currently supports Page and
Identify events. Track events are coming soon.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Page Events" icon="memo-pad">
    e.g. a user visits the pricing page of your marketing website
  </Card>

  <Card title="Identify Events" icon="user-check">
    e.g. a user logs into your web application with their email address
  </Card>

  <Card title="Track Events (coming soon)" icon="bullseye-pointer">
    e.g. a user clicks a button to open a pricing calculator modal
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When you install the Unify Intent client on your website, it can automatically
start collecting these events and sending them to Unify. You can also customize
this behavior by sending events manually using the client's API.

The Unify Intent client is fully open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/unifygtm/intent-js-client).

# Installation

There are several different ways to install the Unify Intent client on your
website. Choose the one that best suits your use case:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Website Tag" icon="code" href="/developers/intent-client/website-tag">
    Quickly set up the Unify Intent client on a static marketing website.
  </Card>

  <Card title="React Library" icon="react" href="/developers/intent-client/react">
    Install the Unify Intent client in a React app.
  </Card>

  <Card title="JavaScript Client" icon="square-js" href="/developers/intent-client/js-client">
    Install the Unify Intent client in a different frontend web application
    framework.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you aren't sure, we recommend starting with the **Website Tag** installation
method. This is the simplest way to get started and all you need for most
marketing websites.

# Usage

If you install the client using the **React Library** or **JavaScript Client**
methods, see our [Usage Guide](/developers/intent-client/client-spec) to learn
how to use the client and start adding events.


# React
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/developers/intent-client/react

Install the Unify Intent client in a React app.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Github" icon="github" href="https://github.com/unifygtm/intent-react" />

  <Card title="npm" icon="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unifygtm/intent-react" />
</CardGroup>

## Installation

You can install the Unify Intent React library with your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell npm theme={null}
  npm install @unifygtm/intent-react
  ```

  ```shell yarn theme={null}
  yarn add @unifygtm/intent-react
  ```

  ```shell pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm add @unifygtm/intent-react
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

First, wrap your React app in a `UnifyIntentProvider`:

```tsx index.tsx theme={null}
import {
  UnifyIntentClient,
  UnifyIntentClientConfig,
  UnifyIntentProvider,
} from '@unifygtm/intent-react';

const writeKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY';

const config: UnifyIntentClientConfig = {
  autoPage: true,
  autoIdentify: false,
};

const intentClient = new UnifyIntentClient(writeKey, config);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement,
);

root.render(
  <UnifyIntentProvider intentClient={intentClient}>
    <App />
  </UnifyIntentProvider>
);
```

The `UnifyIntentProvider` automatically takes care of mounting and unmounting the client
for you whenever the component mounts and unmounts. So any components rendered in your app
can freely access and use the intent client using the `useUnifyIntent` hook:

```tsx Example.tsx theme={null}
import { useUnifyIntent } from '@unifygtm/intent-react';

const Example = () => {
  // Get the Unify Intent Client
  const unify = useUnifyIntent();

  // However you access the current user...
  const currentUser = useCurrentUser();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (currentUser?.emailAddress) {
      // Log an identify event for the current user
      // You can pass any standard Person/Company fields in the optional payload
      // (see /reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings for field lists)
      unify.identify(currentUser.emailAddress, {
        firstName: currentUser.firstName,
        lastName: currentUser.lastName,
        company: { name: currentUser.companyName, domain: currentUser.companyDomain },
      });
    }
  }, [currentUser, unify]);

  ...
};

export default Example;
```

You can then use the resulting client instance to log intent data. See the
[Usage](./client-spec) page for more details on how to use the client.


# Website Tag
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/developers/intent-client/website-tag

Quickly set up the Unify Intent client on a static marketing website.

# Installation

You can automatically load and install the client by placing a `<script>` tag in the `<head>`
or `<body>` of your website's HTML. The minified script can be found [here](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent-client)
in Unify.

```html index.html theme={null}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!-- Your Unify JavaScript tag here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Or here... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Once added, there's nothing else you need to do to start collecting intent data.
The website tag will automatically start collecting both page views and user
identifications.

<Warning>
  Be sure to only initialize the client one time on your website.
</Warning>

If you'd like to manually trigger events in specific places on your website, you
can do so by calling the client directly. When you include the tag in your HTML,
you will immediately be able to access the client at `window.unify` (or simply
`unify` since `window` is global).

```js Console theme={null}
// Trigger a `page` event
window.unify.page();
unify.page();

// Trigger an `identify` event
window.unify.identify("user@email.com");
unify.identify("user@email.com");

// You can also pass standard Person/Company fields as a second argument
// (see /reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings for field lists)
unify.identify("jane@unifygtm.com", {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  company: { name: "Unify", domain: "unifygtm.com" },
});
```

## Additional instructions

If you're using one of the tools below, you can follow the provider-specific
instructions for that tool to install the website tag.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Google Tag Manager">
    The Unify Intent website tag can be added using Google Tag Manager. This can
    be useful in certain situations, such as if you have lots of scripts on your
    website and prefer to manage them all in one place.

    Start by opening the Google Tag Manager console. Add a new tag by selecting
    **Tags -> New**. Click on the **Tag Configuration** section and choose the
    **Custom HTML** tag type.

    Copy the website tag script from the Unify settings page [here](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent-client)
    and paste it into the HTML field. Once it's added, click **Save**.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    Lastly, be sure to enable support for `document.write` in the tag settings.
    This is required for the website tag to work correctly.

    For more information, see the official Google Tag Manager support docs
    [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107167).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webflow">
    Webflow has a dedicated section for adding custom code to your website. From
    the Webflow dashboard, navigate to the settings for your website and then
    select the **Custom code** tab in the sidebar.

    Under **Head code**, paste the website tag script from the Unify settings
    page [here](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent-client)
    in the text area. Be sure to create a new line between any existing code and
    the Unify script.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    When you're done, click **Save** and then publish your changes by selecting
    **Publish -> Publish to selected domains** in the top right corner.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Usage

Once the website tag is installed, the Unify Intent client will automatically
start collecting events on your website. Most of the time, there is nothing else
you need to do.

For details on how this works and the available options, see [Configuration](/developers/intent-client/client-spec#configuration).

# Building an Agent
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/agents/building-an-agent

Learn the fundamentals of building Agents in Unify.

## Agent configuration

Every Agent has three components:

1. **Record Type**: Specify whether this agent will run on Company records or Person records.
2. **Questions**: Define research questions for the agent to answer.
3. (Optional) **Guidance**: Provide additional context or advice to the agent to improve the results.

Once you've configured your Agent, test it by running it on example Companies or People.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Record type

Agents can run on Companies or People. Data from Unify for the underlying records will be made
available to the Agent as it performs research to answer your questions.

For example, an agent intended to perform account qualification will run on company records.
On the other hand, an agent that researches individual people for lead qualification will run on person records.

<Warning>Once you save an Agent, you cannot change its record type.</Warning>

### Questions

Define a set of questions that the Agent will answer for you.
Every question has an expected response type. The available response types are:

* **True / False**
* **Number**
* **Select**

View the [response types documentation](/reference/agents/response-types) for more details and examples.
Try to keep your questions straightforward and concise.
Use a [guidance prompt](#guidance-prompt) to guide define any special
terms or concepts that the Agent should know.

### Guidance prompt

Optionally, you may provide a prompt to help guide your Agent's thought process.
If there is any context the Agent needs to answer your question, this is the place to include it.

In most cases, providing guidance for the Agent is unnecessary.
The Agent already knows that it will be answering questions about a company or person,
so you do not need to include that information in the prompt.

Examples of things to include in a guidance prompt:

* What your company does
* Where to find specific information about the Person or Company to research
* Definitions for specialized terms and concepts

<Tip>
  Unify provides deep customization of and visibility into Agents' thought processes.
  You can take advantage of this to tweak questions or guidance and dial in the accuracy.
</Tip>

## Testing your Agent

Unify gives you best-in-class visibility into an AI's chain-of-thought.
Leverage this to test your Agent, diagnose any issues, and iterate on your
questions and guidance prompts.

Upon providing a valid Agent configuration, an extension will appear and prompt
you to test your Agent. Use the search bar to find a specific Company or Person to test your Agent on,
or use the shuffle button to randomly select a Company or Person. The Agent will run,
explain its reasoning, and provide responses to your questions.

<Tip>
  Generate multiple examples simultaneously to speed up your workflow.
  Navigate through these examples using the arrows at the top of the screen.

Learn what Unify Agents are and how to use them.

## What are Agents?

Agents are tools that research and answer questions about Companies and People in Unify.
You provide questions, and Unify will provide answers.

Agents use state-of-the-art LLMs to automate research on your prospects.
If the answer to your question exists on the internet, Unify
Agents will find it for you.

<Frame>
  <img />

## Use cases

Agents are new to the Unify platform, and their range of use cases is quickly expanding.

* **Account qualification**: Agents can be used to qualify Companies that run
  through your [Plays](/reference/plays/overview).
* **Lead qualification**: Agents can be used to qualify People that run through
  your [Plays](/reference/plays/overview).

<Tip>Check out the [Agent qualification action](/reference/plays/actions#agent-qualification) to use Agents in your Plays.</Tip>


# Agent Response Types
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/agents/response-types

Control how Unify Agents respond to your questions.

## Overview

A single Agent can answer multiple questions, each with different response types.
Unify ensures that Agents adhere to the response types you specify to give
you fine-grained control over AI.

<Tip>Unify Agents know what they don't know. If the Agent cannot find an
answer to your question, it will respond accordingly.</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Response types

### True / False

Agents will respond with either `True` or `False` to a question of this type. This is best for simple questions:

* *Does this company have an office in San Francisco?*
* *Is there a pricing page on this company's website?*

### Number

Agents will respond with a number to a question of this type. This is best for questions that require a numerical answer:

* *What was the revenue for this company last year?*
* *How many years of full-time experience does this person have?*

### Select

Agents will respond with a *single* option from a list that you specify.
This is best for multiple-choice questions:

* *Is this company B2B, B2C, or B2G?*
  * Options: `B2B`, `B2C`, `B2G`
  * Answer: `B2B`

In some cases, you may want the Agent to respond with *multiple* options from the list you provided.
Click the `Allow multiple options` checkbox to enable this.
When enabled, the Agent will respond with zero, one, or multiple options.

* *Which of the following funding rounds has this company completed?*
  * Options: `Seed`, `Series A`, `Series B`, `Series C`, `Series D`, `Series E`
  * Answer: `Seed`, `Series A`


# Overview
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/ai-research/overview

Learn about how AI Research works

## How does AI Research work?

When you onboard to Unify, our multi-agent system conducts research on your Company to understand your products, customers, and value proposition. The system uses this information about your Company to analyze and assess what insights you may consider important when evaluating prospect Companies, and creates Observations for those insights. These Observations are the default set of insights that Unify will use to generate AI Research reports for you.

<Tip>
  An Observation is a key piece of information that the system will try to find for a given Company.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

When Unify generates an AI Research report for you, the multi-agent system takes the current Observations you have set (or that we have preset for you), and conducts research on each Observation to surface the most relevant insights for your team to read and reference.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

### Accessing AI Research

To access AI Research, you can click on the AI Research tab on any Task, Company, or Person page. AI Research will be automatically generated for Tasks,
but for Company and People pages, they can be generated on demand.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

## Modifying your Observations

Admins have the ability to add Observations (up to a maximum of 8), edit Observations, and delete Observations. Additionally Admins can re-order the Observations in the AI Research settings page which will adjust the order of Observations that shows up in the AI Research panel.

Adding, Updating, or Deleting Observations will modify the AI Research that is generated for future AI Research generated in Task, People, and Company pages.

Once you have added a new Observation or made updates to an existing Observation,
you will also be able to regenerate existing AI Research on demand. AI Research that was based on old Observations will show a banner with a button to "regenerate" the AI Research.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

## Testing your Observations

After providing a valid Observation configuration (Observation name and prompt), you can test your Observation to see if the configuration retrieves what you are looking for. You can either generate Observations for specific companies, or select a random sample of companies to test on. Use this page to experiment and iterate on the Observation prompts until you are satisfied with the resulting AI Research.

<Tip>
  To get effective Observations, ensure that your prompt explains all of the context that is needed to retrieve the information that you are looking for.

# How Bidirectional Syncs Work
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/hubspot/bidirectional-syncs

An in-depth explanation of how syncs work between HubSpot and Unify.

# Overview

Unify can create and update HubSpot records in response to Play runs and
sequence enrollments. This page summarizes the rules used to determine when and
how to create or update records in HubSpot.

# Overwriting data

Unify takes a very conservative approach to overwriting existing HubSpot data in
order to make data loss impossible. This approach is based around only a few
simple rules:

* **Creating new records:** When Unify is creating a new HubSpot record, it will
  fill in all properties that are enabled for writing in the field mapping or
  default values.

* **Updating existing records:** Unify will inspect whether the field is empty
  or not. If the field already has a value, it will only be updated if it is a
  Unify-specific field. These fields are prefixed with "Unify" and can be found [here](/reference/integrations/hubspot/field-mappings#available-fields).

These rules apply regardless of how the record was originally created (e.g., by
Unify or externally). If you're looking for more fine-grained control, you can
also limit the permissions granted to the Unify integration user in HubSpot.

# Duplicate prevention

Duplicates are strictly prevented within Unify. When creating new HubSpot
records, Unify will only ever create one record. If there is already an existing
HubSpot record of the same type, Unify will always update it rather than
creating a new one.

However, duplicates are a common problem in HubSpot and may already exist in
your HubSpot instance. In addition, users or other integrations may accidentally
create new duplicates over time.

In order to accommodate this reality, Unify follows specific rules to ensure
predictable behavior when updating duplicated HubSpot records. While Unify
cannot de-duplicate your HubSpot, it will *never* make the problem worse, and
in some situations may be able to help clarify the “source of truth” record.

### Contacts

If there is an existing contact that matches the Unify person being written, it
will be updated. Matches are determined based on email address. If there are no
matches, a new contact will be created.

If there are multiple contacts that match the Unify person, only one will be
updated. Specifically, the contact that was most recently modified within
HubSpot is the one that will be updated.

### Companies

HubSpot companies are written by Unify whenever a contact is created or updated.
They are also written if a HubSpot sync action runs within a Play that is
running on companies.

If there is an existing company that matches the Unify company being written, it
will be updated. Matches are determined based on the domain of the company
website. Domains are normalized, so URLs that redirect to different domains will
not result in duplicates. If there are no matches, a new company will be
created.

If there are multiple companies that match the Unify company, only one will be
updated. Specifically, the company that was most recently modified within
HubSpot will be updated.

### Email Messages

Unify does not update existing email messages in HubSpot; only emails sent
through Unify or received in response to those emails will be written to
HubSpot.

Email messages are written to HubSpot for all emails sent as a part of Unify
sequences if the corresponding person already exists in HubSpot. This means
that in order to write email messages for sequence enrollments, you should
ensure that the person already exists in HubSpot or that you include a Play
action to sync them to HubSpot.


# Configure Default Values
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/hubspot/default-values

Learn how to set default values writing to HubSpot.

# Overview

When Unify creates or updates records in HubSpot, it will populate each HubSpot
property using the value in the corresponding Unify field. However, you can also
specify *default values* to be used as a fallback. This can useful in a few
different scenarios:

1. You may have custom fields in HubSpot that require a value
2. You may want to write a custom value to a field that is not available in the
   field mappings
3. You may want to dynamically set a value in different Plays or Play actions

You can set global default values from [Settings -> Integrations -> HubSpot](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/hubspot).
These will be used for all writes to HubSpot unless overridden in a Play or by a
field mapping.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

To learn how to set default values at the Play level instead, see the [Sync to HubSpot](/reference/plays/actions#sync-to-hubspot)
action reference.


# Field Mappings
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/hubspot/field-mappings

Understand how to configure and use HubSpot field mappings in Unify.

# Overview

Unify can sync data between HubSpot objects and Unify objects. However, the
exact fields in HubSpot differ from Unify, so Unify needs to understand how to
sync data between the two systems. This is done using *field mappings*.

# Setup

### Change field mappings

When you first connect your HubSpot instance, Unify will automatically prepare
the field mappings for you. If you use any custom properties in place of
default HubSpot properties, you may want to update the mappings before Unify
starts syncing data.

In the [HubSpot integration settings](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/hubspot),
look for the **Company** and **Person** field mappings at
the bottom of the page. Select one to view and edit the field configuration.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can return to update these mappings any time in the future, so you don't
need to worry about getting them perfect right off the bat!

### (Optional) Create custom properties

You can write values to default properties and custom properties. In order to
write to custom properties, they must already exist in HubSpot.

While some of the fields Unify can write exist as standard properties in
HubSpot, many of them do not. In particular, Unify-specific fields (like the
name of the Sequence a person was enrolled in) do not exist in HubSpot by
default. In order to write these values to HubSpot, you will need to create
custom properties before mapping them.

<Note>
  Here's what the process looks like for adding **Contact** properties. First, in
  HubSpot, navigate to **CRM -> Contacts**.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Home" />
  </Frame>

  Select **Actions -> Edit properties**.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Contacts" />
  </Frame>

  Navigate to **Groups -> Create group**.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Contact Property Groups" />
  </Frame>

  Type in the name of the group (recommended title "Unify information") and click
  **Create**.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Contact Create Property Group" />
  </Frame>

  Navigate to **Properties -> Create property**.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Contact Properties" />
  </Frame>

  When editing the property details, make sure the **Object type** is set properly
  (in this case, to **Contact**) and the **Group** is set to the group you
  created earlier. You can fill in the **Label** and **Description** as desired.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="HubSpot Contact Create Property" />
  </Frame>

  Lastly, select the **Field type** and click **Create**.

  <Frame>

# HubSpot Integration Guide
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/hubspot/overview

This guide outlines how to connect your HubSpot CRM to Unify.

## Overview

In just a few steps, you can connect your HubSpot CRM to Unify and start syncing
data bidirectionally. This unlocks a few key benefits when using Unify:

1. HubSpot records can be used to [construct exclusions](/tutorials/how-to-create-an-exclusion)
   that prevent Unify from engaging with specific people or companies. For
   example, you can create an exclusion for all current customers or deals in
   progress.
2. You can create Plays that are triggered by HubSpot records. This allows you
   to run a Play based on a specific event or criteria captured within HubSpot.
3. Unify can write data back to HubSpot so that you can maintain a source of
   truth in your CRM and respect rules of engagement in other tools or business
   processes.

Unify's integration with HubSpot is designed from the ground up to prevent many
common pitfalls, including overwriting existing data or creating duplicate
records. For an in-depth description of how Unify does this, see [How Bidirectional Syncs Work](/reference/integrations/hubspot/bidirectional-syncs).

# Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect HubSpot instance">
    Navigate to [Settings -> HubSpot](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/hubspot)
    and select **Connect**. You will be redirected to the HubSpot authentication
    page where you can sign in and authorize Unify to access HubSpot data.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create field mappings">
    Unify provides granular control over which HubSpot properties map to which
    Unify fields. For each object, select **Create Mapping** and update any
    fields you wish to customize.

    In most cases, the default options will be a good starting point. You can
    always return to change these mappings in the future.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    See [Field Mappings](/reference/integrations/hubspot/field-mappings) for details on
    how field mappings work and the available options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable syncs">
    Once you're satisfied with your integration settings and field mappings, you
    can begin syncing data into Unify by selecting **Resume**. If at any point
    you want to pause syncs again, you can return to this page and select
    **Pause**.

    To enable Unify to write data back to HubSpot, activate the toggle next to
    **Enable writing to HubSpot**. This will allow Unify to sync records back to
    HubSpot.

# Property Options
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/hubspot/property-options

Find the options for a property in HubSpot.

# Explanation

Properties in HubSpot have a different name displayed in the UI than the value
used at the API level. For most properties, the dropdown options you see in the
UI will be the same as the values you see in Unify.

However, certain properties in HubSpot have options which Unify cannot access.
At the moment, this is a known HubSpot limitation. The steps outlined here can
help to work around the issue.

## Workaround

In order to support using these options for filtering in audiences and
exclusions, you can perform the following steps. This article uses the
**Lifecycle Stage** property on **Company** as an example, but the same steps
should work for other properties and objects.

In HubSpot, navigate to **CRM -> Companies** and select **Actions -> Edit properties**.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Properties" />
</Frame>

Search for the property by its name (in this case, **Lifecycle Stage**) and
select the property.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Properties" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Lifecycle Stage" />
</Frame>

Navigate to **Field type**. You will see a list of options, with **LABEL** and
**INTERNAL NAME** values alongside the number of records that have that value.
You may want to copy these values to a secure separate location for easy future
reference. If you wish to filter records in Unify to a specific **LABEL** value,
you can do so by using the corresponding **INTERNAL NAME** value.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Property Options" />
</Frame>

Here's what that looks like in Unify for the **LABEL** value "Lead" and
therefore **INTERNAL NAME** value "lead":

## Nooks Integration Setup

<Info>
  **Sep 2025 Update: Installing Nooks as a Trusted App in Salesforce**

  In September 2025, Salesforce made security changes regarding which apps can be connected to Salesforce (via OAuth) by individual reps. This can impact Nooks users who are connecting to Salesforce for the first time, or reconnecting Salesforce. They might see an "OAuth Error" like this:

  <Frame>
    <img alt="salesforce-oauth-error.png" />
  </Frame>

  Your Salesforce administrator will need to install Nooks as a trusted app in your Salesforce org. For more information, see: [Installing Nooks as a Trusted App in SFDC](https://support.devrev.ai/nooks/article/ART-115-getting-started-with-salesforce-sfdc#Sep%202025%20Update%3A%20Installing%20Nooks%20as%20a%20Trusted%20App%20in%20SFDC).
</Info>

Once your Salesforce report is ready, connect Nooks to Salesforce:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in Nooks
2. Select **Integrations**
3. Select **Connect Salesforce** and authorize the connection
4. Install Nooks as an OAuth app. Nooks should appear as an app in the Salesforce Setup settings in the "Connected Apps OAuth Usage" section. Click "Install".
5. \[Recommended] Configure field mappings to optimize your call tasks:
   * Navigate to **Settings** > **Salesforce** > **Field Mappings**
   * Add your specific SFDC fields such as:
     * Current Unify Sequence
     * Current Unify Play
     * Relevant prospect information for call tasks

<Note>
  You will need admin access to Salesforce to authorize this connection. For more information, see: [Nooks admin setup](https://support.devrev.ai/nooks/article/ART-115-getting-started-with-salesforce-sfdc) or reach our to your CSM.

# How Bidirectional Syncs Work
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/bidirectional-syncs

An in-depth explanation of how syncs work between Salesforce and Unify.

# Overview

Unify can create and update Salesforce records in response to Play runs and
sequence enrollments. This page summarizes the rules used to determine when and
how to create or update records in Salesforce.

# Overwriting data

Unify takes a very conservative approach to overwriting existing Salesforce
data in order to make data loss impossible. This approach is based around only
a few simple rules:

* **Creating new records:** When Unify is creating a new Salesforce record, it
  will fill in all fields that are enabled for writing in the field mapping or
  default values.

* **Updating existing records:** Unify will inspect whether the field is empty
  or not. If the field is empty, it will be updated with the new value. If the
  field already has a value, it will only be updated if it is a Unify-specific
  field. These fields are prefixed with "Unify" and can be found [here](/reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings#available-fields).

These rules apply regardless of how the record was originally created (e.g., by
Unify or externally). If you're looking for more fine-grained control, you can
also limit the permissions granted to the Unify integration user in Salesforce.

# Duplicate prevention

Duplicates are strictly prevented within Unify. When creating new Salesforce
records, Unify will only ever create one record. If there is already an existing
Salesforce record of the same type, Unify will always update it rather than
creating a new one.

However, duplicates are a common problem in Salesforce and may already exist in
your Salesforce instance. In addition, users or other integrations may
accidentally create new duplicates over time.

In order to accommodate this reality, Unify follows specific rules to ensure
predictable behavior when updating duplicated Salesforce records. While Unify
cannot de-duplicate your Salesforce, it will *never* make the problem worse, and
in some situations may be able to help clarify the “source of truth” record.

### Contacts

Salesforce contacts are written by Unify if **Create new records as Contacts & Accounts**
is selected. In addition, contacts are sometimes created in place of leads if
the person being written to Salesforce *already exists* as a contact. Unify
cannot create a lead in this situation due to Salesforce’s
[contact duplicate rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US\&id=sf.duplicate_rules_standard_contact_rule.htm\&type=5).

In both situations, if there is an existing contact that matches the Unify
person being written, it will be updated. Matches are determined based on email
address. If there are no matches, a new contact will be created.

If there are multiple contacts that match the Unify person, only one will be
updated. Specifically, the contact that was most recently modified within
Salesforce is the one that will be updated.

### Accounts

Salesforce accounts are written by Unify whenever a contact is created or
updated. They are also written if a Salesforce sync action runs within a Play
that is running on companies.

If there is an existing account that matches the Unify company being written, it
will be updated. Matches are determined based on the domain of the company
website. Domains are normalized, so URLs that redirect to different domains will
not result in duplicates. If there are no matches, a new account will be
created.

If there are multiple accounts that match the Unify company, only one will be
updated. Specifically, the account that was most recently modified within
Salesforce will be updated.

### Leads

Salesforce leads are written by Unify when **Create new records as Leads** is
selected.

If there is an existing lead that matches the Unify company being written, it
will be updated. Matches are determined based on email address. If there are no
matches, a new lead will be created.

If there are multiple leads that match the Unify person, only one will be
updated. Specifically, the lead that was most recently modified within
Salesforce is the one that will be updated.

### Email Messages

Unify writes to the email message object in Salesforce, which is the recommended
approach for syncing email data to Salesforce. In order to write records of this
object type, the *Enhanced Email* feature must be enabled in Salesforce. This is
typically enabled by default.

Unify does not update existing email messages in Salesforce; only emails sent
through Unify or received in response to those emails will be written to
Salesforce. Unify uses the standard **Universal Message ID** to deduplicate
email messages if they are simultaneously being written by another integration.

Email messages are written to Salesforce for all emails sent as a part of Unify
sequences if the corresponding person already exists in Salesforce. This means
that in order to write email messages for sequence enrollments, you should
ensure that the person already exists in Salesforce or that you include a Play
action to sync them to Salesforce.


# Bulk Update Records
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/bulk-update-records

Use Salesforce reports to quickly update a large number of records in Salesforce.

## Explanation

If you need to update a large number of records in Salesforce, you can use Salesforce reports to simplify the process. A common use case is updating the value of a field across all records created by a Play. However, these steps are generally applicable to any set of Salesforce records.

## Steps

### Export the Records

1. Navigate to the **Reports** page.

<Tip>
  In the top-right corner of the screen, if you click the menu icon and search for “reports”, you should see a link to get there.

  <Frame>
    <img alt="export-the-records-step-1" />
  </Frame>
</Tip>

2. In the top-right corner of the screen, select **New Report**
3. Choose a report type based on which type of records you need to update, and then click **Start Report** on the right

<Frame>
  <img alt="export-the-records-step-3" />
</Frame>

4. Be sure to add the `Id` column to your report in the sidebar, which is typically named after the record type you are selecting (e.g., `Account ID`, `Contact ID`, etc.)

<Frame>
  <img alt="export-the-records-step-4" />
</Frame>

5. Also add any additional columns that you wish to edit on the records
6. Add any filters or sorting options needed to narrow down the records you want to update

<Frame>
  <img alt="export-the-records-step-6" />

7. When ready, click **Save** in the top-right corner, enter a name, and then click **Save** again

<Frame>
  <img alt="export-the-records-step-7" />
</Frame>

8. Click **Run** in the top-right corner and verify these are the records you want to update
9. Click the dropdown arrow next to **Edit** in the top-right corner and select **Export**
10. Choose **Details Only** and **Comma Delimited .csv** as the format and then click **Export**

<Frame>
  <img alt="export-the-records-step-10" />

### Make Changes

1. Open the downloaded file and make any desired updates to the values
2. Save the changes as a new file so that the original is available as a backup

### Upload the Changed Records

1. Navigate to the **Setup** page in Salesforce

2. In the sidebar on the left, search for "data import wizard" and select the **Data Import Wizard** integration

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to update existing records and be sure to choose the option to match records by `Salesforce.com ID`

<Frame>
  <img alt="upload-the-changed-records-step-3" />
</Frame>

4. Ensure the mapping looks correct and that the ID column is mapped to `Salesforce.com ID`

<Frame>
  <img alt="upload-the-changed-records-step-4" />
</Frame>

5. Verify the details on the last page and then click **Start Import**

<Frame>
  <img alt="upload-the-changed-records-step-5" />

6. Once this bulk import is complete you’re all finished!


# Configure Default Values
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/default-values

Learn how to set default values writing to Salesforce.

# Overview

When Unify creates or updates records in Salesforce, it will populate each
Salesforce field using the value in the corresponding Unify field. However, you
can also specify *default values* to be used as a fallback. This can useful in a
few different scenarios:

1. You may have custom fields in Salesforce that require a value
2. You may want to write a custom value to a field that is not available in the
   field mappings
3. You may want to dynamically set a value in different Plays or Play actions

You can set global default values from [Settings -> Integrations -> Salesforce](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/salesforce).
These will be used for all writes to Salesforce unless overridden in a Play or
by a field mapping.

To learn how to set default values at the Play level instead, see the [Sync to Salesforce](/reference/plays/actions#sync-to-salesforce)
action reference.


# Field Mappings
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings

Understand how to configure and use Salesforce field mappings in Unify.

# Overview

Unify can sync data between Salesforce objects and Unify objects. However, the
exact objects and fields in Salesforce differ from Unify, so Unify needs to
understand how to sync data between the two systems. This is done using *field
mappings*.

# Setup

### Change field mappings

When you first connect your Salesforce instance, Unify will automatically
prepare the field mappings for you. If you use any custom fields in place of
standard Salesforce fields, you may want to update the mappings before Unify
starts syncing data.

In the [Salesforce integration settings](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/salesforce),
look for the **Company**, **Person**, and **Email Message** field mappings at
the bottom of the page. Select one to view and edit the field configuration.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can return to update these mappings any time in the future, so you don't
need to worry about getting them perfect right off the bat!

### (Optional) Create custom fields

You can write values to standard fields and custom fields. In order to write to
custom fields, they must already exist in Salesforce. See [this guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.adding_fields.htm\&type=5)
for instructions on creating custom fields in Salesforce.

While some of the fields Unify can write exist as standard fields in Salesforce,
many of them do not. In particular, Unify-specific fields (like the name of the
Sequence a person was enrolled in) do not exist in Salesforce by default. In
order to write these values to Salesforce, you will need to create custom fields
before mapping them.

# Available fields

Below is a full list of the values that can be configured in the field mappings
for each object type. Some of these are standard fields, while others provide
Unify-specific information, such as the name of the Sequence that a person was
enrolled in.

# Toggle Lead Assignment Rules in Salesforce
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/lead-assignment-rules

Troubleshoot a common bug in Salesforce related to lead assignment rules.

## Explanation

Salesforce allows you to create "lead assignment rules" that automatically assign different owners to leads depending on custom criteria. However, sometimes these rules don’t work right off the bat due to a specific bug in Salesforce. The steps outlined here should resolve the issue.

## Steps

### Ensure you have an active lead assignment rule

Navigate to the **Setup** page in Salesforce by clicking the settings icon in the top-right corner of any Salesforce page.

<Frame>
  <img alt="active-lead-assignment-rule-step-1" />
</Frame>

Search for **Lead Assignment Rules** in the sidebar.

<Frame>
  <img alt="active-lead-assignment-rule-step-2" />
</Frame>

You should see at least one rule with a checkmark under the **Active** column.

<Frame>
  <img alt="active-lead-assignment-rule-step-3" />
</Frame>

### Toggle the rule off and on

In the **Lead Assignment Rules** page from the previous step, click on the name of your rule and then select **Edit**. Uncheck the checkbox next to **Active** to temporarily deactivate the rule.

<Frame>
  <img alt="toggle-rule-off-on-step-2" />
</Frame>

Click **Save**. Then click **Edit** again, re-check the checkbox next to **Active**, and then choose **Save**.

### Test that leads are assigned correctly in the UI

Navigate to the **Leads** page in Salesforce. You can get there via the app launcher.

<Frame>
  <img alt="test-leads-correctly-assigned-step-1" />
</Frame>

In the top-right corner of the screen, select **New** to create a new lead.

<Frame>
  <img alt="test-leads-correctly-assigned-step-2" />
</Frame>

Check the **Assign using active assignment rule** checkbox in the lower-left corner.

<Frame>
  <img alt="test-leads-correctly-assigned-step-3" />
</Frame>

Fill out the required lead fields with values that should trigger the lead assignment rule you created and then click **Save** in the bottom-right corner.

Lastly, verify that the lead was assigned to the correct owner.


# Salesforce Integration Guide
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/overview

This guide outlines how to connect your Salesforce instance to Unify.

# Overview

In just a few steps, you can connect your Salesforce instance to Unify and start
syncing data bidirectionally. This unlocks a few key benefits when using Unify:

1. Salesforce records can be used to [construct exclusions](/tutorials/how-to-create-an-exclusion)
   that prevent Unify from engaging with specific people or companies. For
   example, you can create an exclusion for all current customers or deals in
   progress.
2. You can create Plays that are triggered by Salesforce records. This allows
   you to run a Play based on a specific event or criteria captured within
   Salesforce.
3. Unify can write data back to Salesforce so that you can maintain a source of
   truth in your CRM and respect rules of engagement in other tools or business
   processes.

Unify's integration with Salesforce is designed from the ground up to prevent
many common pitfalls, including overwriting existing data or creating duplicate
records. For an in-depth description of how Unify does this, see [How Bidirectional Syncs Work](/reference/integrations/salesforce/bidirectional-syncs).

* **Salesforce Subscription:** Unify requires API access to your Salesforce
  instance. This is typically included with most Salesforce plans, but some
  plans may require an upgrade.

  * If you're unsure, follow [these instructions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000386929\&type=1)
    to determine your plan and then check [here](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000385436\&language=en_US\&type=1)
    to see if API access is included.

* **Administrative Access:** In order to assign the correct permissions to the
  integration user, a Salesforce admin may be needed to complete these steps.

# Setup

<Note>
  If you are using a Salesforce sandbox instance, let our support team know in
  advance and we will create a dedicated testing login for you.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an integration user strategy">
    Decide which integration user Unify should use to connect to Salesforce.
    Unify supports multiple approaches:

    | Setup                                                      | Pros                                                                                                                                                                         | Cons                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Dedicated integration user**                             | This is best practice and our recommended option. The user is granted specific limited permissions and all updates made within Salesforce are clearly attributable to Unify. | This requires the purchase or use of a dedicated Salesforce user license, which may require time to set up at your company.                                          |
    | **Shared integration user with other connected apps**      | This might be a better choice, because you may already use an integration user with other connected apps. You don't need to provision a new user.                            | Unify must share the permissions and limits of the shared integration user. If this user's access is shut down, all connected apps will be impacted.                 |
    | **Existing individual user with system admin permissions** | This is typically the fastest and most affordable option because you use an individual user that already exists in your Salesforce. There's no need to create anything new.  | Unify is given full system access and edits made within Salesforce are attributed to the individual user. If the user leaves the company, the connection will break. |

    If you choose to create a dedicated integration user, you can follow [this guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.sf_contracts_create_users_and_assign_permission_sets.htm\&type=5)
    for step-by-step instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Salesforce instance">
    Navigate to [Settings -> Salesforce](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/salesforce)
    and select **Connect**. You will be redirected to the Salesforce authentication
    page where you can sign in using the desired Salesforce integration user that
    Unify will use.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign required permissions">
    Unify requires specific permissions in order to access the Salesforce API and
    read and write data. If any permissions are missing, they will be shown on
    the settings page.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    See [Required Permissions and Settings](/reference/integrations/salesforce/required-permissions)
    for details on fixing any issues.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose which objects to create">
    Salesforce has two different ways of representing companies and people:

    1. **Contacts and Accounts**: Every person has a Contact record, and Contacts are associated with Accounts.
    2. **Leads**: Every person has a Lead record which contains information about both the person and their company.

    Unify supports both options, and you can choose which approach you want to
    use on the integration settings page. This can be changed at any time.

    <Tip>
      Pick the option that best aligns with how your team uses Salesforce today.
      If you're unsure, Unify recommends **Contacts and Accounts** as a best
      practice.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create field mappings">
    Unify provides granular control over which Salesforce fields map to which
    Unify fields. For each object, select **Create Mapping** and update any
    fields you wish to customize.

    In most cases, the default options will be a good starting point. You can
    always return to change these mappings in the future.

    <Frame>
      <img />
    </Frame>

    See [Field Mappings](/reference/integrations/salesforce/field-mappings) for details on
    how field mappings work and the available options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable syncs">
    Once you're satisfied with your integration settings and field mappings, you
    can begin syncing data into Unify by selecting **Resume**. If at any point
    you want to pause syncs again, you can return to this page and select
    **Pause**.

    To enable Unify to write data back to Salesforce, activate the toggle next to
    **Enable writing to Salesforce**. This will allow Unify to sync records back
    to Salesforce.

# Required Permissions and Settings
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/integrations/salesforce/required-permissions

Ensure your Salesforce user has the required permissions for Unify.

# Overview

The permissions that Unify requires fall into two categories:

1. **System Permissions**: These are permissions that apply to the entire
   Salesforce instance and are required for Unify to function properly.
2. **Object Permissions**: These are permissions that apply to specific objects
   (e.g., Account, Contact, etc.) and are required for Unify to read and write
   data.

The exact permissions that Unify needs are detailed below along with
instructions on assigning these permissions to your integration user.

# Required Permissions

<Info>
  Access can be restricted as desired for sensitive records or fields that you
  do not want Unify to access. However, Unify needs access to any records or
  fields that you want to use for exclusions.

  For example, to prevent Unify from engaging with current customers, Unify will
  require access to the records that indicate current customers to evaluate the
  exclusion rule.

needs. Credits are consumed by various activities such as prospecting,
enrichment, AI Agent runs, and certain intent signals.

## How credits work

Here are the key points to know about the credit system:

* **Credit Value**: Each Unify Credit represents a unit of platform usage.

* **Consumption**: Credits are deducted in real-time as features are used.

* **Replenishment**: Credits reset monthly or annually based on your plan. Add
  credits at anytime on the [Usage](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/organization/usage)
  page or upgrade your plan on the [Plans & Billing](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/billing)
  page.

You can monitor your credit consumption on the [Usage](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/organization/usage)
page.

## Credit consumption

Different features consume credits at different rates. Here's a breakdown of the
credit consumption of each feature:

| Feature                        | Unify Credits | Unit                              | Description                                                                                                                  |

| Website Reveals                | 0.1           | Per website visitor revealed      | Website reveals are triggered by adding our website tag and turning on Unify Intent.                                         |
| Person Enriched (B2B Email)    | 2             | Per person enriched               | People that are uploaded via CSV without emails or prospected via the prospecting step are enriched when run through a Play. |
| Person Enriched (Phone Number) | 4             | Per person enriched               | Phone number enrichment can be turned on in the prospecting node in Unify.                                                   |
| New Hire Tracking              | 5             | Per new hire found                | A new hire is returned when someone within the customer defined specifications that has moved jobs in the last 90 days.      |
| Champion Tracking              | 1             | Per champion track attempt        | Champions are set up by users and are tracked on a monthly basis.                                                            |
| AI Agent                       | 0.1           | Per question answered per company | Agents can be configured to answer various per each company or person they are run on.                                       |

## Best practices

* **Use Prospecting Limits**: Set limits on the number of people you want to prospect for at each company, especially when targeting only a couple personas.

* **Create Specific Personas**: Be as specific as possible when listing titles to include or exclude in your buyer persona to make sure you aren't prospecting for unqualified contacts.

* **Set Global Exclusions**: Exclusions are a helpful way to make sure that you are not prospecting, enriching, or tracking people who don't fit your ICP.

</Tip>


# Notification Preferences
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/notifications/preferences

Set how you want to be notified for updates and activities on Unify.

Notification preferences allow you to control how and when you receive alerts for replies, tasks, and updates.
Preferences are divided into two categories: **Workspace notifications** (team-level notifications available for admins) and
**my notifications** (personal notifications available for all users).

## Workspace Notifications

<Note>
  Workspace notifications are only available to users with the **Admin** role.
</Note>

Workspace notifications allow admins to have visibility into any notification for any team member, ensuring admins stay informed about important updates
across the team.

### Workspace Replies

Receive notifications when prospects reply to any Sequence. Admins can customize which reply classifications trigger notifications and choose where to receive them.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

#### Reply Classifications

By default, the following reply classifications can be configured.

* <PositiveToneIcon />**Positive** — The email response shows enthusiasm, agreement, or active engagement with the sender's offer, indicating a genuine interest in moving forward
* <WillingToMeetIcon />**Willing to meet** — The recipient's email indicates their openness to schedule a meeting, specifically about the offer mentioned in the initial outreach
* <NeedsMoreInfoIcon />**Needs more info** — The recipient requests additional details or expresses uncertainty about the offer
* <NeutralToneIcon />**Neutral** — The email is objective, factual, respectful, unemotional, and polite yet concise

You can add additional classifications if you want to receive notifications for other types of replies. For example, if you want to be notified
about <OutOfOfficeIcon />**Out of Office** replies, you can add that classification in your settings.

<Tip>
  See [Reply Classifications](/reference/sequences/replies#reply-classifications) for detailed definitions of all classification types.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

#### Excluding Classifications

Some replies can have multiple classifications. You can exclude specific classifications from triggering notifications. **If a reply has any excluded classification, no notification will be sent**, even if it also has other classifications that would normally trigger an alert.

Common exclusions include:

* <OutOfOfficeIcon />**OOO** (Out of Office) — Automated away messages
* <AutomatedIcon />**Automated** — Auto-responders and system-generated replies

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Workspace Tasks and Updates

Receive notifications for all tasks and updates created for anyone on your team. This allows admins to stay informed about task assignments and progress across the organization.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## My Notifications

Personal notifications are available to all users (both Admins and Reps) and allow you to manage alerts specific to you.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Connecting Your Slack Account

To receive Slack notifications, you need to connect your personal Slack profile to Unify.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your Slack Organization">
    Admins must configure their tenant's connection to Slack before users can select their profiles.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your Slack profile">
    Click on the Slack profile selector to connect your account. Slack notifications will be sent directly to your Unify Slack app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If you don't see your Slack profile in the dropdown, or if the options are disabled,
  make sure the Unify Slack app is installed in your workspace and you've been added to it.
</Tip>

### My Tasks and Updates

Receive notifications for tasks assigned to you and updates on those tasks.

**Notification channels:**

* **Slack** — Direct messages in Slack (requires Slack profile connection)
* **In app** — Notifications in the Unify notification feed

## Notification Channels

Unify supports two notification channels:

| Channel    | Description                                       | Requirements                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slack**  | Receive notifications as direct messages in Slack | Must connect your Slack Organization / Slack profile |
| **In app** | View notifications in the Unify notification feed | No setup required                                    |

You can enable either or both channels for each notification type.

## Default Settings

All new users are configured with default notification preferences upon onboarding.
You can customize these settings at any time from the notification preferences page.

# Play Actions
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/plays/actions

Actions are the building blocks of Unify Plays.

## Overview

Plays chain together actions to perform anything from simple automations to
complex and dynamic outbound campaigns. Below are the actions you can choose
from when creating a Play.

## Core actions

### AI qualification

AI agents are powerful tools for researching companies or people and answering
questions about them. In Plays, the answers provided by an agent can be used to
determine whether a company or person is qualified or not.

When you select the agent qualification action, you will be able to choose an
existing agent or create a new one. Every agent has a set of questions that it
will answer about the given record. In the action configuration panel, you can
select which answers are required for the record to be considered qualified.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Assign owner

The owner assignment action allows you to assign a record to a specific owner in
Unify. Every company and person record in Unify has an owner, and this action
allows you to set or change the owner of a record.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

When you connect a CRM to Unify, the owner of the corresponding records in the
CRM will be synced into Unify. For records that don't yet have an owner or don't
yet exist in the CRM, you can use this action to assign an owner. You can also
choose to update the owner if desired.

### Prospect

One of the most common use cases for Plays is to find new people to reach out
to. The prospecting action takes a company record as input and finds new people
at the company matching specific personas and criteria.

When you select the prospecting action, you can specify one or more personas to
search for. The personas are considered in order, so the first persona will be
preferred over the second, and so on.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can also specify a limit on the number of people to find per company. If the
**Include existing people** option is enabled, existing people at the company
already in Unify will count towards this limit. This can be useful if you want
to save prospecting credits on companies you already have relevant contacts for.

### Sequence

The sequence enrollment action makes building automated outbound campaigns
easier than ever. You can choose which sequences to send people to based on
which personas they match.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The routing configuration provides a way to specify which mailboxes and
sequences should be used for people this action runs on. You can specify a
set of mailboxes to use or choose to use a mailbox associated with the [company
or person record owner](/reference/plays/actions#assign-owner-action).

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You also have the option to set a limit on how many people to enroll per
company, which is generally recommended to avoid overtargeting a single company.
This limit applies globally across play runs, so if multiple Plays run on the
same company, this limit will be shared across all of them.

### Slack alert

The Slack alert action allows you to send a customized Slack message at any
point in a Play. You can send messages to any public channels or DM any users in
your workspace.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The contents of the messages can be customized with template variables, so you
can include information about the record that triggered the action.

<Note>
  If the value for a template variable is missing, the message will still be sent,
  but the variable will be replaced with `Unknown`.
</Note>

You may optionally tag the owner of the account (e.g. `@John Doe`), so they can
be easily notified of the alert. You can also include intent signal information
containing recent website visitors, G2 page views, and more.

This action is available when Slack connected to Unify. See the [Slack Integration Guide](/reference/integrations/slack)
for information on integrating Slack with Unify.

### Sync to HubSpot

The HubSpot sync action allows you to create or update a record in HubSpot based
on a company or person record in Unify. This action will use the settings you've
configured for HubSpot in the Unify settings.

You also have the option to specify additional default field values. These will
be written to HubSpot unless a different Unify field is already mapped to the
HubSpot field.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Sync to Salesforce

The Salesforce sync action allows you to create or update a record in Salesforce
based on a company or person record in Unify. This action will use the settings
you've configured for Salesforce in the Unify settings.

You also have the option to specify additional default field values. These will
be written to Salesforce unless a different Unify field is already mapped to the
Salesforce field.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Utility actions

### Loop

<Note>
  In order to fully understand the purpose of loops and how to use them
  effectively, it's recommended that you read about action [inputs and outputs](/reference/plays/building-a-play#inputs-and-outputs) first.
</Note>

Most actions run on one record at a time. Loops are a simple way to run one or
more actions on every record in a list.

For example, a **Prospect for new People** action will return a list of people.
You can connect a loop action to the prospecting action and then add actions
within the loop. The first action in the loop will receive one person at a time.

### If / Else

The if-else action creates a branch in a Play, evaluates some conditions for
records, and sends them down a specific path based on the result. This allows
you to perform different actions on different records based on criteria that you
specify.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

This action enables you to solve a wide variety of more complex use cases using
Plays. For example, you can enroll people into different sequences based on
their company firmographics, exact job title, or custom CRM field values.

### A/B Test

The A/B test action allows you to route records down a specific path based on a set probability.
This is useful for testing different sequences or actions.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Delay

The Delay action waits for a specified amount of time before continuing to the
next action in a Play. This can be useful for spacing out actions in a Play and
ensuring that actions are performed at the right time.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

This action is particularly useful when combined with if-else actions. For
example, when a person visitors your website, it can be useful to wait a few
minutes before taking action to see which pages they end up visitor or whether
they fill out a form.

### Get Company

If you have a person record, you can use this action to fetch the company that
the person works at. If the person does not have a company associated with them,
this action will not return any result.

### Get People

If you have a company record, you can use this action to fetch people that work
at the company. Unlike the **Prospect for new People** action, this action only
looks for people that already exist in Unify rather than prspect for new people.

## Coming soon

There are lots of additional actions in the works including more powerful AI
features and deep integrations with third-party tools. If you're interested in
an action that isn't available yet, [let us know](mailto:support@unifygtm.com)!
We'll get you in the beta as soon as it's ready.


# Building a Play
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/plays/building-a-play

Learn the fundamentals of creating Plays in Unify.

## Actions and triggers

The building blocks of Plays are called *actions*. Each action is a different
step of a Play, each representing a different task that can be automated in
Unify.

Every Play stars with a special type of action called a *trigger*. A trigger is
the starting point of your Play which defines when the Play should be executed
and what data should be provided to it.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Here are a few of the triggers you can choose from:

* **Record enters an Audience**: Run a Play once on every company or person that
  "enters" an Audience. Audiences can be reused across multiple Plays.
* **Record matches criteria**: Run a Play once on every company or person that
  matches a set of filters. This trigger is similar to the audience trigger, but
  it doesn't require you to create a separate audience. Useful when you don't
  need to create a reusable audience.
* **Manual**: Only run a Play when it is manually triggered. For example, you
  can send individual companies or people to a Play, or you can send an entire
  audience.

Once the trigger is selected, you can start adding additional actions to the
Play. Each action performs a different task. Actions can be chained together or
perform branching logic based on the results of the previous action.

Here are some of the most commonly used actions:

* **AI Agent Qualification**: Perform AI-powered research to answer qualifying
  questions about a company or person.
* **Prospect for new People**: Find new people at a company matching specific
  personas. You can specify a limit on the number of people to find.
* **Sequence Enrollment**: Enroll a person in a sequence. You can route people
  to different mailboxes and sequences based on their persona.
* **Write to Salesforce or HubSpot**: Sync a company or person to Salesforce or
  HubSpot. This will create or update a record in your CRM.

You can find details about the full set of available triggers and actions in the
reference sections below:

<Card title="Triggers" icon="link" href="/reference/plays/triggers">
  See the full list of triggers available in Unify and how to use them.
</Card>

<Card title="Actions" icon="link" href="/reference/plays/actions">
  See the full list of actions available in Unify and how to use them.
</Card>

## Inputs and outputs

Each action receives an input and produces an output. Actions in the Play
Builder have small colored symbols that represent what type of input and output
they expect.

Here's what each symbol represents:

| Symbol |                                       | Value |
| :----: | ------------------------------------- | :---- |
|        | A single person record.               |       |
|        | A list of one or more person records. |       |
|        | A single company record.              |       |

Plays work by connecting each action's output to a matching input on another
action. This is how data flows through the Play and how each action knows what
to do.

## Connecting actions

To connect two actions, click on the output symbol of the first action and drag
the connection to the input symbol of the second action.

<Frame>
  <video />

  <video />
</Frame>

When adding a new action to the Play Builder, you can drag and drop it on top of
another action to automatically connect them.

<Frame>
  <video />

  <video />
</Frame>

Another shortcut for connecting actions is to move any action near to another
action. Once the input and output symbols are close enough, they will
automatically be connected.

<Frame>
  <video />

  <video />
</Frame>

To delete a connection, click on the connection line and press the **Backspace**
or **Delete** key.

<Frame>
  <video />

  <video />
</Frame>

## Save and publish

When you first create a Play, it is automatically saved as a draft. You can
leave and return later to finish building the Play without losing your progress.

Once you're ready to start running the Play, you can publish it. Published Plays
will run automatically based on the trigger you've selected. To publish a Play,
click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the Play Builder.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

After publishing a Play, you can still make changes to it. Any changes you make
will be saved as a new draft. You can publish the new draft at any time by
clicking the **Publish** button again. You can also discard the draft and revert
to the last published version.

If you want to temporarily stop a Play from running, you can pause it by
toggling the pause button to the left of the **Publish** button. Pausing a Play
will prevent it from running until you resume it.

## View logs

Once a Play starts running, you can view the logs to see which companies and
people the Play has run on. In the top left corner of the Play Builder, click
on **Logs** to see the full history of Play executions.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Within the logs view, you can see the status of each Play execution, including
in-progress, completed, and failed executions. You can click on any row of the
logs table to see more details about that specific execution.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The exact path this record took through the Play is highlighted on the right
side of the details view. You can see exactly which actions ran and what the
results were at each step.

## View metrics

In addition to logs, you can view metrics for each Play to see how it's
performing over time. In the top left corner of the Play Builder, click on
**Metrics** to see overview metrics and charts for the Play and each of its
actions.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can click on any action to see detailed information about how it's
performing. For example, clicking  on an agent qualification action will let
you measure how many records are being qualified over time and why.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The action-specific metrics pages will also show you the records that have
passed through that action and their results.


# Unify Plays
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/plays/overview

Learn what Unify Plays are and how to use them.

## What are Plays?

Plays are automated workflows that let you build and execute repeatable
strategies. Unify manages the logistics of coordinating and scaling all of the
details.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Building scalable and effective sales, marketing, and GTM strategies requires
successfully coordinating two key components:

* **Data**: Countless data sources go into building scalable automations. This
  data is traditionally scattered across tools and databases, but Unify
  centralizes it in one place.
* **Actions**: Researching companies, identifying decision-makers, executing
  multi-channel outreach, and more. Taking the right action at the right time
  is crucial to success.

Unify is a purpose-built system of action that solves this problem. Plays let
you define a series of actions that will be taken on companies or people at
exactly the right moment.

## Use cases

Plays are a versatile tool that can be used to build out anything from standard,
reliable outbound strategies to complex and innovative growth campaigns. Here
are some of the most popular use cases for Plays:

* **Warm Outbound**: Find prospects at companies matching intent signals and
  reach out to them with personalized messaging at just the right time.
* **Champion tracking**: Keep tabs on champions of your business and reach out
  to them when they take a role at a new company.
* **List building**: Take a list of companies and turn it into high-quality
  leads by enriching the data and finding new contacts in relevant roles.

These are just a few of the most common ways Plays are used. Plays provide the
flexibility to build arbitrarily complex automations tailored to your goals.

<Tip>Check out the tutorial [How to Create a Play](/tutorials/how-to-create-a-play) for a hands-on introduction to Plays!</Tip>


# Play Triggers
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/plays/triggers

Triggers represent the events and data sources that a Play runs on.

## Overview

Plays run on invidiual records, such as companies or people. Triggers define
when a Play should run and what data should be provided to it. Below are the
triggers you can choose from when creating a Play.

## Available triggers

### Champions

This trigger is a shortcut for running a Play on champions that Unify has
tracked for your business. Once selected, you can customize the matching
criteria similar to the record match trigger. This trigger always returns
People.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

In order to use this trigger, you must have enabled and configured champion
tracking in your settings. For more information, see [Champion Tracking](/reference/signals/champions).

### Find lookalike companies

This trigger runs a Play on companies that are similar to a set of companies
you specify. This is useful for finding new companies that are similar to your
existing customers or ideal customer profile.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Once you've defined the criteria that specifies which companies to find
lookalikes for, you can define some additional options for the trigger, such as
additional filters to apply or exclusions to enable and disable.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

This trigger is powered by [Ocean.io](https://www.ocean.io/). The integration is
fully managed by Unify and included in your plan, so no additional subscription
or setup is required.

### Record enters an Audience

This trigger runs a Play once on every company or person that "enters" an
audience. A record enters an audience when it meets the criteria of the audience
for the first time.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

When you select an audience trigger, you will be prompted to select an audience
from the list of audiences you have created. Audiences are reusable in Unify,
which means you can use the same audience in multiple Plays.

You also have the choice to run the Play on either companies that enter the
audience or people that enter the audience. If you select companies, the output
of this trigger will be a company record. Otherwise, the output will be a person
record.

### Record matches criteria

This trigger runs a Play once on every company or person that matches a set of
filters. This trigger behaves the same as the audience trigger, but it doesn't
require that you already have an audience created. Instead, you can define the
filters directly in the Play.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

When you select a criteria trigger, you will be prompted to add filters to
select the companies or people that the Play should run on. Just like building
audiences, you can add as many filters as you like and preview the records that
match the filters before saving the trigger.

As with audience triggers, you can choose to run the Play on either companies or
people. This will determine what type of record the trigger outputs.

### Website visitors

This trigger is a shortcut for running a Play on companies that visit your
website. Once selected, you can customize the matching criteria similar to the
record match trigger. This trigger always returns Companies.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Coming soon

There are lots of additional triggers in the works including webhooks, third-party
events, schedules, and more. If you're interested in one that isn't available
yet, [let us know](mailto:support@unifygtm.com)! We'll get you in the beta as
soon as it's ready.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I use an Audience trigger or a record match trigger?">
    Audience triggers and record match triggers can both be used to accomplish
    the same goal. The main difference is that audience triggers require you to
    create an audience ahead of time, while record match triggers allow you to
    define the filters directly in the Play.

    Audiences can be reused in multiple Plays, which is useful if you have a set
    of filters that you use frequently. Audiences can also be viewed, edited,
    and exported from the **Audiences** tab.

    Record match triggers are a great option for quickly iterating on a Play or
    if you don't want to create an audience for a one-off Play. You can always
    come back later, convert the filters into an audience, and then swap the
    trigger out for an audience trigger.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is an Audience trigger the same as sending an Audience to a manual trigger?">
    Audiences are dynamic lists of companies and people that can change over
    time according to the filters you specify. For example, an audience might
    capture all companies that have visited your website in the last 30 days.

    When you send an audience to a manual trigger, you are sending the current
    list of companies or people that are in the audience at that moment. This
    is useful if you want to run a Play on a snapshot of the audience but not on
    a recurring basis.

    By contrast, an audience trigger will run a Play on every company or person
    that enters the audience in the future. This is useful if you want to run a
    Play on every company or person that meets the audience criteria now and in
    the future.

Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/manual-steps

Bring human-in-the-loop actions to your Unify Sequences.

Manual steps allow you to layer manual emails, phone calls, action items, and social touches into your Unify Sequences.

## Adding Manual steps to Sequences

In the Sequence Builder, click the `+` button to add a step and choose from the following options:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Manual email" icon={<ManualEmailIcon />} href="#manual-email-steps">
    Create an email that must be manually queued to send from Unify
  </Card>

  <Card title="Phone call" icon={<PhoneCallIcon />} href="#phone-call-steps">
    Create a task to call the prospect.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Action item" icon={<ActionItemIcon />} href="#action-item-steps">
    This will create a task to perform some generic action.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each time a prospect runs through the Sequence, a corresponding task will be created in your Task Dashboard for each manual step.

# Unify Sequences
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/overview

Learn what Unify sequences are and how to use them.

## What are Sequences?

A sequence is a series of automated outreach steps that let you scale your
outbound and measure its effectiveness. Sequences are purpose-built for modern
outbound sales with native AI capabilities and deep integration with the Unify
platform.

Once you've created a sequence, you can enroll people in it to automate your
outreach. Sequence enrollments can be performed automatically from Plays, but
you can also enroll people manually. Enrollments can then be monitored from the
sequence details page to track their progress.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Unify sequences come equipped with comprehensive analytics that let you measure
their effectiveness and compare performance across different sequences with
ease. Unify also provides an unparalleled suite of features for maintaining high
deliverability and ensuring your domain reputation is being handled with care.


# Sequence Replies
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/replies

View and manage replies from prospects in your Sequences.

## Overview

When prospects reply to your Sequence emails, Unify automatically captures and classifies those replies. All replies are accessible directly within the Unify app.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Out-of-Thread Replies

In addition to direct replies to Sequence emails, Unify also captures **out-of-thread replies** from your prospects.

An out-of-thread reply is an email from a sequence enrollee that doesn't directly reply to a sequence email. This includes new email threads initiated by the prospect or separate conversations sent to your mailbox while they're engaged with your sequence.

## Reply Classifications

Unify automatically classifies replies using AI to help you prioritize your responses. Each reply receives one or more classification tags that indicate the prospect's intent or sentiment.

* <PositiveToneIcon />**Positive** — The email response shows enthusiasm, agreement, or active engagement with the sender's offer, indicating a genuine interest in moving forward. This is not an automated reply.
* <WillingToMeetIcon />**Willing to meet** — The recipient's email indicates their openness to schedule a meeting, specifically about the offer mentioned in the initial outreach.
* <NeedsMoreInfoIcon />**Needs more info** — The recipient requests additional details or expresses uncertainty about the offer. Providing clarification may result in a positive outcome.
* <BadTimingIcon />**Bad Timing** — The email conveys interest but explains that current budget constraints or timing prevent immediate action. Future actions may be possible if a timeframe is mentioned.
* <HasSolutionIcon />**Has solution** — The recipient mentions that they are already using a different product or service to meet their needs.
* <NeutralToneIcon />**Neutral** — The email is objective, factual, respectful, unemotional, and polite yet concise.
* <LeftJobIcon />**Left Job** — The email indicates the sender is no longer employed at their previous role or company.
* <UpdatedContactInfoIcon />**Updated contact info** — The email notifies the sender of a new or updated email address for further communication.
* <ReferralIcon />**Referral** — The email includes a suggestion to contact another person, and provides the referral's contact information.
* <NegativeToneIcon />**Negative** — The email contains hostile, emotional, or adversarial language, such as anger or frustration.
* <NsfwIcon />**NSFW** — The email includes content that is offensive or inappropriate.
* <OptOutIcon />**Opt out** — The recipient explicitly requests to unsubscribe, threatens to block communication, or mentions reporting the sender.
* <OutOfOfficeIcon />**OOO** — The recipient's email indicates they are out of office or currently unable to provide a complete response.
* <SoftBounceIcon />**Soft Bounce** — The email indicates a temporary delivery failure, meaning the message might eventually be delivered.
* <HardBounceIcon />**Hard Bounce** — The email indicates a permanent delivery failure, suggesting the recipient's email address is invalid or no longer in use.
* <AutomatedIcon />**Automated** — The email appears to have been generated by an automated system, rather than sent by a person.

<Note>
  Reply classifications can be configured to trigger [notifications](/reference/notifications/preferences) so you're alerted when important replies come in.

# Creating a Custom Send Schedule
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/send-schedules/creating-send-schedules

Learn how to configure Custom Send Schedules for Sequences.

## Navigation

You can access the Custom Send Schedules page by navigating to:
**Settings → Organization → Sequences → Send Schedules**.

Once you are on this page, click the **+ New Schedule** button to create a new Custom Send Schedule.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

## Configuring a new Custom Send Schedule

After clicking the **+ New Schedule** button, a configuration drawer will open, allowing you to define the parameters of your new Custom Send Schedule.

### General

Under the **General** section, you can configure the basic information for your Custom Send Schedule.

* **Name** — Provide a clear, descriptive name for your Custom Send Schedule (e.g., *North America Weekdays* or *APAC Morning Outreach*).
* **Time Zone** — Select the time zone in which the schedule will operate. This ensures that all send windows and skip dates align to the correct local time. (e.g., America/Los Angeles, Europe/London, Asia/Singapore)

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

> 💡 **Tip:** If your team operates globally, create separate Custom Send Schedules for each region to ensure messages are sent during local business hours.

***

### Windows

The **Windows** section defines when Unify is allowed to send automated messages through Sequences during the week.

For each day of the week, you can:

* Enable or disable sending (for example, enable Monday–Friday and disable Saturday–Sunday).
* Specify one or more **time windows** when messages can be sent (e.g., 9 AM–12 PM, 1 PM–5 PM).

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

**Example:**
If you want outreach to happen only during typical working hours, you might configure:

* Monday–Friday: 9:00 AM–4:30 PM
* Saturday & Sunday: Disabled

> **Note:** Messages queued outside of active windows will automatically be held until the next available send window.

***

### Skip Dates

Skip Dates allow you to automatically **pause sending on holidays or custom dates**.
This helps maintain deliverability and professionalism by avoiding sends on non-working days.

There are two ways to configure Skip Dates:

1. **U.S. Holidays** — Toggle this option to automatically skip sending on major U.S. federal holidays (e.g., New Year’s Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving).
2. **Custom Dates** — Add specific dates or recurring dates (such as company offsites, local holidays, or yearly breaks).

You can specify whether custom dates repeat **annually** or occur **once**.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

> 💡 **Tip:** Use Skip Dates to prevent outreach from occurring during out-of-office periods or industry-wide holidays that may impact engagement.

***

### Saving the Custom Send Schedule

Once you’ve configured the General settings, Windows, and Skip Dates, click **Create** to save your Custom Send Schedule.
It will now appear in the **Custom Send Schedules** list view, where you can edit, duplicate, or delete it at any time.

Your new Custom Send Schedule is now ready to use!


# Custom Send Schedules Overview
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/send-schedules/overview

Learn what Custom Send Schedules are and how they control automated email sending within Sequences in Unify.

Custom Send Schedules help teams coordinate outreach across time zones, avoid weekends or holidays, and ensure emails are delivered during ideal business hours for recipients.

## What are Custom Send Schedules?

Custom Send Schedules define the specific days and time windows when Unify is allowed to send automated email messages through Sequences.

Each schedule can be customized with:

* **Time zones** — Align delivery windows with your target audience or team region (e.g., America/Los Angeles, Europe/London, Asia/Singapore).

* **Active days** — Choose which weekdays are enabled for sending (e.g., Monday–Friday).

* **Time windows** — Define the daily sending hours to control when messages are delivered within each active day (e.g., 9 AM–2 PM, 3 PM–6 PM).

* **Skip dates** — Exclude U.S. holidays or add custom recurring dates to pause sending automatically.

# Smart Snippets
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/smart-snippets

Personalize your outreach with AI-powered email copy generation.

## Overview

Smart snippets allow you to personalize messages with AI-generated copy that's
unique to each recipient. You can use smart snippets to enhance your messaging,
improve deliverability, and increase engagement.

Smart snippets are concise, self-contained pieces of text that serve a clear
communicative purpose. Each snippet should be laser-focused on the parts of your
outbound message that change the most to fit each recipient differently.

## Creating a smart snippet

Navigate to the [Snippets](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/snippets) tab in
the sidebar, select **New Snippet** in the top right corner, and choose
**Smart Snippet**. You will see the smart snippet creation screen.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

To define a smart snippet, you provide a prompt that describes the content you
want to generate. The prompt should include template variables for any data you
want the model to use when writing the snippet. You can click on the quick
prompts to see example prompts for inspiration.

After you've entered your prompt, click **Generate examples** to see what the
smart snippet will generate for a sample of real people from your data. You can
edit the prompt and regenerate examples to iteratively refine your snippet.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Just like regular snippets, you should also define a fallback value for the case
where some of the template variables in the prompt are missing data. This will
prevent enrollments from being blocked by the missing data.

When you're satisfied with your prompt, click **Create** to save it. You will
now be able to use the snippet in your sequences.

## Recommendations

Here are a few practices we recommend to get the most out of smart snippets:

1. Always include at least one template variable for the model to use to
   personalize the snippet. For example, include some details about the sender,
   the recipient, or their company. This helps the model write more precise and
   personalized copy.
2. Include 2-3 example outputs to guide the model. Examples help the model
   understand the tone and structure you're trying to achieve. The model will
   often pick up on vocabulary and stylistic choices from your examples.
3. Start small. Pick a specific part of the email—such as the salutation or
   hook—and focus on personalizing that part. Smart snippets are most effective
   when they're used to personalize small sections of your email. Remember that
   you can use as many snippets in an email as you want!


# Template Variables
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/sequences/template-variables

Use template variables to personalize your emails.

## Overview

Template variables are key to personalizing messages sent through Unify. You can
use template variables to insert dynamic values into your emails, such as a
person's name, company, or job title.

## Inserting variables

You can insert template variables into emails you write when creating sequences in Unify. To open the template variable dropdown, click on the template variable button in the sequence builder.

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-1" />
</Frame>

You can also press **`{`** on your keyboard to open the template variable dropdown. Once open, you can select a variable and insert it into your email.

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-2" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-3" />
</Frame>

When a person is enrolled in this sequence, this value will be filled in dynamically.

## Handling missing data

### Enrollment blocking

Sometimes, Unify won’t have data to populate variables used in a sequence email. In these cases, Unify will never send an email with a placeholder or missing value. Instead, Unify will *block* the sequence enrollment.

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-4" />
</Frame>

Blocked enrollments can be seen on the sequence details page. You can click on a blocked enrollment to edit the message and manually fill in any missing values.

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-5" />
</Frame>

The template variables with missing values will appear highlighted in orange. Once you’ve replaced the missing values, click **Save** and the blocked status will disappear.

<Frame>
  <img alt="template-var-6" />
</Frame>

The step will then be rescheduled and sent automatically as part of the sequence.

### Snippets

To avoid having to manually unblock enrollments that are missing a value, it's
highly recommended that you take advantage of *snippets*.

Snippets are reusable blocks of copy that can be inserted into messages the same
as template variables. However, snippets also allow you to define fallback text
which is used if any template variables are missing values.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can access snippets by navigating to the [Snippets](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/snippets)
tab in the sidebar. When defining a snippet, you can use template variables or
even other snippets in the copy. Underneath the snippet text area, there is a
second text area where you can define a fallback.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The fallback will be used in the event that any of the variables used in the
copy are missing. If you use snippets within snippets (which is called
*snippet-ception*), the fallback for the nested snippet will be used in the
top-level snippet.


# Champion Tracking
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/signals/champions

Automatically track your champions and take action on them.

## What is a Champion?

Your companies' champions are customers who have used and advocated for the adoption of your product or services.

## What is Champion Tracking?

With Champion Tracking, you can define filters to select your company's champions and automatically follow when they change jobs.
A champion who has changed jobs is indicative of an opportunity with an outsized probability of success.

When enabled, the job statuses of each of your champions will be checked once per month
and their new contact information will be found when they change jobs. This information is extremely
valuable for breaking into new accounts and performing retargeting campaigns.

Unify will automatically create an exclusion for the old contact records of your champions who have changed jobs.
This means that the old records won't appear in audiences nor be sequenced.

You will be charged one credit per champion tracked per month regardless of whether a job change was detected.
You can view the `Tracking` tab in the Champion Tracking Settings page to see who is being tracked.

### Set Up Champion Tracking

Define who your champions are.

#### Enabling

1. In the Unify app, go to [Settings -> Track -> Champions](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/champion-tracking).

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

2. Click the toggle at the top of the page to open the Champion Tracking Settings modal.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

3. Define filters to identify your champions to track. For example, users commonly filter down to companies with Closed Won opportunities.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

4. Click `Enable Champion Tracking`.  Unify will track your champions once per month starting from the moment you enable Champion Tracking.

#### Disabling

1. In the Unify app, go to [Settings -> Track -> Champions](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/champion-tracking).

2. Click the toggle and click `Disable` to disable Champion Tracking. You will still be able to view job changes Unify has already detected throughout the app, but people will stop being tracked monthly.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

### Take Action on Champion Job Changes

Take action when Unify detects a champion job change.

#### Champion Tracking Audience Filters

In the audience builder, you can add filters for champion job changes.
Connect these audiences to Plays, sequences, and Slack alerts to automate workflows triggered by these changes.

Here is an example of audience filters that includes all champions for whom Unify has ever detected a job change:

<Frame>

# New Hire Tracking
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/signals/new-hires

Automatically track new hires at companies and take action.

## What is New Hire Tracking?

A new hire is someone who has recently started a job at a new company within the past 90 days.

New Hire Tracking helps you identify and monitor individuals who have recently joined companies that align with your target profile. These new hires often play pivotal roles in shaping change within their organizations, making them valuable opportunities for outreach.

These are not people in your current Unify instance, they are net new prospects, meaning that they have not already been sourced through CRM integration, website intent, or uploaded manually.

By using New Hire Tracking, you can apply specific filters to define your target companies and personas, automatically keeping track of new hires at these organizations.

### Why is this a valuable signal?

New hires signify organizational shifts and often catalyze new purchasing decisions, presenting valuable opportunities for strategic outreach.

### How does New Hire Tracking work?

Once activated, Unify scans for new hires that match your selected personas at your target companies, delivering their contact details to you daily. Your target personas and companies can be customized to include or exclude specific job titles, industries, company size, and location. This enables you to build a dynamic, up-to-date list of key contacts for your team to engage through Audiences.

New hires will not track existing contacts synced over from your CRM today. If enabled, Champion Tracking will be tracking when contacts from existing customers change jobs. For more information, see the [Champion Tracking section](/reference/signals/champions).

Each tracked new hire costs two credits, regardless of whether the lead has been routed or engaged.

To view tracked new hires, navigate to the “New Hires” tab in the New Hire Tracking Settings.

### Setting Up New Hire Tracking

Define the personas and companies you want to track, then follow the steps below to get started.

#### How to Enable

1. In the Unify app, go to [Settings -> Track -> New Hires](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/new-hire-tracking).

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

2. Click the toggle at the top of the page to open the New Hire Tracking Settings.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

3. Apply filters to fine-tune your new hire tracking. For best results, use all available filters to narrow down the most relevant target companies and personas.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

4. Click `Enable New Hire Tracking`. Unify will begin tracking new hires daily from this point forward.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

#### How to Disable

1. In the Unify app, go to [Settings -> Track -> New Hires](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/new-hire-tracking).

2. Click the toggle and select `Disable` to stop tracking new hires. Previously detected job changes will remain visible, but new hires will no longer be tracked.

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

### Acting on New Hires

When Unify identifies a new hire, you can immediately add these contacts to audiences and run Plays on them. Similar to setting up Plays to capture website intent or retarget CRM opportunities as they’re added, you can create Plays that consistently capture and engage with new hires added by Unify!

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

#### New Hire Tracking in Audience Filters

In the Audience Builder, you can add filters to focus on new hires.

These audiences can be linked to Plays, sequences, or Slack alerts, allowing you to automate workflows based on new hire data.

Here’s an example of filters used to track all new hires:

<Frame>
  <img alt="" />
</Frame>

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I get Slack notifications for new hires?

Create an audience for new hires, then enable Slack alerts for that audience to receive real-time notifications.

#### How do I stop tracking new hires?

Click the toggle to disable new hire tracking. Previously detected job changes will remain visible, but new hires will no longer be tracked.

#### Can I track new hires in a specific industry?

Yes, you can filter new hires by industry.

#### Can I track new hires by country?

At the moment, you can track new hires based on the location of their company. We’re actively working on expanding this feature to allow tracking new hires based on their individual country of residence.

#### How are you selecting the new contacts added to Unify?

We identify ideal new hire prospects who have changed roles within the last 90 days, using a combination of job title, company size, and industry. These prospects are then selected through a randomized process.

# Website Visitor Intent
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/reference/signals/website-visitors

Start revealing the companies and people visiting your website.

## Overview

By integrating with your website, Unify can reveal the companies and people
visiting your website in real-time. Beyond idenifying these visitors, Unify
enables you to take action based on which pages they're clicking on, where
they're visiting from, and how many sessions they've had.

## How to get started

### Step 1: Integrate Unify with your website

The first step is to integrate Unify with your website using either the official
Unify plugin for your website or a third-party analytics provider like Segment.

If you're not already using Segment, we recommend starting with the official
Unify plugin. You can find the installation instructions [here](/developers/intent-client/overview).
For customers already using Segment, you can find the instructions for setting
up the official Segment integration [here](/reference/integrations/segment).

### Step 2: Turn on website intent data

Once that's done, the only thing left to do is to enable the feature in Unify
and start revealing the companies and people visiting your website. Navigate to
[Settings -> Unify Intent](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent)
to turn on this feature.

If you already have a subscription to 6sense or Clearbit Reveal, you can also
bring your own API key. See the [6sense](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/6sense)
and [Clearbit](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/clearbit)
integration settings pages to get started.


# How to Create a Play
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-play

Learn the fundamentals and build a Unify Play from start to finish.

## Overview

Plays are automated workflows that let you build and execute repeatable
strategies. In this guide, you'll learn the basics of how Plays work and create
one from scratch.

### What are Plays?

Building scalable and effective sales, marketing, and GTM strategies requires
successfully coordinating two key components:

* **Data**: Countless data sources go into building scalable automations. This
  data is traditionally scattered across tools and databases, but Unify
  centralizes it in one place.
* **Actions**: Researching companies, identifying decision-makers, executing
  multi-channel outreach, and more. Taking the right action at the right time
  is crucial to success.

Unify is a purpose-built system of action that solves this problem. Plays let
you define a series of actions that will be taken on companies or people at
exactly the right moment.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Tutorial preview

One of the most popular use cases for Plays is to find prospects at companies
that are visiting your website and enroll them in outbound sequences. This is a
great example of a *warm outbound* campaign that targets key decision-makers
at companies showing buying intent.

In this guide, you'll create a Unify Play that runs on companies visiting your
website and performs the following actions:

1. **Prospect**: Find new people at the company that match your buyer personas.
2. **Sequence**: Enroll the new prospects in a sequence to send them emails.
3. **Sync to CRM**: Sync newly found people to Salesforce or HubSpot.

This standard Play is a great starting point to understand how Plays work and
kickstart your outbound strategy.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create a new Play

Look for the [Plays](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/plays) tab in the
sidebar and click on it. This is where you will create and manage all your
team's Plays. To create a new Play, click the **New Play** button.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Choose a trigger

Once you've created a new Play, you will see the Play Builder. The first step
when building any Play is to choose a *trigger*. The trigger lets you specify
exactly when the Play should run and which companies or people it should run on.

In the center of the builder, you will see an action that says **Select a trigger**.
Click on it to show the trigger configuration panel. For this Play, choose the
**Website visitors** template.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Here you have the option to further filter and refine the companies that this
Play will run on. For example, if you only want to run this Play on companies
with more than 100 employees, you can add a filter on **Employee Count**.

You can learn more about the available filters and how to use them in the tutorial
[How to Create an Audience](/tutorials/how-to-create-an-audience). You can always
return later to add or modify filters. Click **Done** to finish configuring the
trigger.

### Step 3: Add actions

Now that the trigger has been selected, it's time to start adding actions. There
are many actions to choose from, and you can configure them in countless ways.
For this Play, we're going to start simple and add three actions.

#### Prospect for people

Start by adding a prospecting action. This action will take the company coming
from the trigger and search for relevant prospects. Drag the **Prospect for People**
action from the action list and drop it into the builder.

<Tip>
  If you drag and drop a new action on top of an existing action, it will
  automatically be connected to it.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Once added, you will see the prospecting options shown in the configuration
panel on the left. Here are the most important selections to make:

* **Max. prospects per company**: This is how many prospects you want to find at
  each company. We recommend starting with 2-4 prospects per company.
* **Personas**: These are the personas to search for. You can select from
  existing personas or create new ones. Unify will find people matching these
  personas in order, so list them in order of preference.

If you haven't defined any personas yet, you can learn how to do so in the
tutorial [How to Create Personas](/tutorials/how-to-use-personas).

#### Loop

Next, add a **Loop** action. The prospecting action will return a list of people
found at the company, and the loop will run subsequent actions once for each
person in the list.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Each action receives an input and produces an output. Actions in the Play
Builder have small colored symbols that represent what type of input and output
they expect.

Here's what each symbol represents:

| Symbol |                                       | Value |
| :----: | ------------------------------------- | :---- |
|        | A single person record.               |       |
|        | A list of one or more person records. |       |
|        | A single company record.              |       |

Plays work by connecting each action's output to a matching input on another
action. This is how data flows through the Play and how each action knows what
to do.

Most actions run on one record at a time. The **Loop** action is how you take a
list of records and run actions on them one by one.

#### Sequence enrollment

Now place a **Sequence** action inside the loop. This will enroll each person
into a Unify Sequence.

<Tip>
  Once you've dropped the action into the loop, you can drag it near the loop
  action to automatically connect them. You can also manually draw connections
  between the colored icons that represent action inputs and outputs.
</Tip>

Once added, you can configure the sequence enrollment action by routing personas
to the desired sequences and mailboxes. To speed up the process, click the
**Add prospect personas** button to automatically reuse all of the personas you
selected in the prospecting action.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

#### Sync to CRM

Finally, add an action to sync each new person to your CRM. Depending on which
CRM you've connected in Unify, you will see either a **Sync to Salesforce** or
**Sync to HubSpot** action.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

### Step 4: Publish and view logs

Once your Play is ready, click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of
the Play Builder. This will activate the Play and start running it on companies
that match the trigger criteria you defined earlier.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

As the Play starts to run on companies, you will see them appear in the logs.
Click on the **Logs** tab at the top of the Play Builder to view the logs.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Click on any company to view the details of its run, including the exact actions
that were taken and the results of each action. Click on any action to view the
precise inputs, outputs, and result of that action.

# How to Create an Audience
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/tutorials/how-to-create-an-audience

Create dynamic lists of companies and people to view and act on.

## What are Audiences?

In Unify, audiences are dynamic lists of companies and people that are generated
based on powerful filter criteria that you specify. Once defined, you can view and take
action on these companies and people in Unify.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Here are just a few examples of the
types of audiences you can define:

* Companies that have clicked on your pricing page in the past week
* People who have opened an email you sent them in the past month at least twice
  without replying yet
* Champions for your business that have joined a new company matching your ICP

Typically, either sales leaders, revenue operations, or sales operations will
create the audiences to be used by sellers for building plays and taking action.

## Build a new audience

Access audiences by clicking on [Audiences](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/audiences)
in the sidebar. You can view and edit existing audiences or create a new one by
selecting **New audience**.

Audience support a wide variety of filters. One of the most commonly used
options is to filter by fields in your CRM. To get started, click **Add condition**
and search for the field you want to filter by.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Another popular filter is website activity. You can filter by page views,
sessions, and visitors to your website. This is a great way to identify which
companies are showing interest in your business.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can combine multiple filter criteria with **And** and **Or** groups to
build more complex audiences. For example, you might want to capture companies
that have visited your pricing page or that have filled out an inbound form.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

The best way to to learn about the available filter options is to explore! As
you add and remove filters, the audience preview will update in real-time to
show the companies and people that match your criteria.

## Exclusions

Exclusions are a mechanism to prevent Unify from taking action on specific
companies or people. Common use cases for exclusions include preventing current
customers or competitors from appearing in your audiences or Plays.

Once you've defined exclusions, they will be automatically applied to all
audiences by default. Sometimes, you may want to disable an exclusion for a
specific audience. This can be done from the audience configuration page under
the **Advanced** section.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

For more information on creating exclusions, see [How to Create an Exclusion](/tutorials/how-to-create-an-exclusion).

## What's next?

Audiences can be used for a variety of purposes, including building plays and
subscribing to Slack alerts. For more information, check out these tutorials:

# How to Create an Exclusion
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/tutorials/how-to-create-an-exclusion

Prevent Unify from actioning on specific companies or people.

1. Excluding current customers
2. Exclude people who have unsubscribed from outbound campaigns

## How to create an exclusion

Let’s walk through how to exclude all Active Salesforce accounts.

### 1. Go to Exclusions in Settings

Navigate to [Settings > Exclusions](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/organization/exclusions) and click `New exclusion`

<Frame>
  <img alt="Exclusions 1.png" />
</Frame>

## 2. Select Companies or People

Select `Companies` in this case

<Frame>
  <img alt="Untitled" />
</Frame>

## 3. Define criterion to filter

In this example, we’re creating an exclusion called `Current Customers` that excludes companies with Salesforce `Account Status` equal to `Active`

<Frame>
  <img alt="Exclusions 2.png" />
</Frame>

## 4. Hit Save

Here you’ll see an overview of your new exclusion. These lists will automatically be excluded from targeting.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Exclusions 2.png" />
</Frame>

## Upload exclusions from a CSV

Let's walk through how to set up an exclusion using a CSV of companies or people.

### 1. Create a column in your CSV called "Status"

Populate the "Status" column with the same value across all the rows in your CSV. This value usually indicates the type of contact you are excluding. Examples can include "Active Customer", "Competitor", etc.

### 2. Upload these contacts in the companies or people tab

If you're uploading companies, you'll need to include both the company name and domain. If you're uploading people, you'll need to include one of the following set of fields:

* Email
* First Name, Last Name, and Company Domain
* LinkedIn URL

### 3. Map the CSV fields to the Unify fields

You'll select the fields you want to map into Unify. Make sure to select "Status" field from Unify when mapping that same column from your CSV. The Unify "Status" field should then populate with the values you populated in the CSV under the column. Once these are mapped, you can finish the upload.

### 4. Create a new exclusion and add the "Status" field in the conditions

You'll then switch over into the "Exclusions" tab in your settings and create a new exclusion. Under either the people or companies filters, you will select the Unify status column and add the value from your CSV (i.e. "Active Customer"). Once you save this exclusion, this list should be excluded from future audiences and Plays moving forward!

***

Note that if you would like to add more companies or contacts to this exclusion list in the feature, you'll need to follow the same process as above and make sure the "Status" field is correctly mapped. This should automatically pull in the new exclusion after uploaded if the "Status" value is the same value in the filter.

# How to Define Personas
Source: https://docs.unifygtm.com/tutorials/how-to-use-personas

Create personas to prospect and reach out to your ideal buyers.

## Overview

Personas are collections of job titles that you want to target. Each persona
consists of a list of titles that you want to include and exclude. Personas can
be used throughout Unify, such as when prospecting or routing people to
different sequences.

## Create a persona

Navigate to the [Personas](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/personas) tab in
the sidebar and select **New persona**. Here you can add job titles that you
wish to include or exclude when matching people against this persona.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

You can also take advantage of AI-powered persona generation to automatically
find and add similar job titles to your persona. This lets you quickly define
comprehensive personas that match different variations of a job title.

<Frame>
  <img />
</Frame>

Once you've added all the titles you want to include or exclude, click **Create
persona** to save your changes. This persona will now be available for use
throughout Unify.

## Title matching behavior

When evaluating whether a person's job title matches a persona, Unify adheres to
the following rules and heuristics:

* **Ignore capitalization**: For example, "RevOps Lead" and "Revops lead" are
  considered equivalent.
* **Ignore punctuation**: For example, "Enterprise Sales, Lead" and "Enterprise
  Sales Lead" are considered equivalent.
* **Ignore word order**: For example, "Lead Sales Engineer" and "Sales Engineer,
  Lead" are considered equivalent.
* **Ignore extraneous words**: For example, "CEO" and "CEO and Founder" are
  considered equivalent.

That means that you don't need to exhaustively list every possible variation of
a job title in your persona. Instead, you can focus on the most common keywords
and let Unify handle the details.
