# Clearbit Integration Guide

> Use your existing subscription to identify website visitors.

# Overview

Unify integrates with Clearbit in two ways:

* If you already have a Clearbit subscription, you can connect it to Unify by
  providing your API key to identify website visitors.
* [Unify Intent](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent)
  identifies website visitors out of the box and is powered by Clearbit as well
  as other providers.

Unify uses Clearbit along with various other providers to identify website
visitors. If you already have a Clearbit subscription, you can connect it to
Unify by providing your API key.

# Setup

To connect your existing Clearbit subscription to Unify, simply navigate to
[Settings -> Integrations -> Clearbit](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/clearbit)
and enter your API key. Unify will start using your Clearbit account to identify
website visitors.
