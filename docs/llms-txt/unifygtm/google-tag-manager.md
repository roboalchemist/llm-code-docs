# Google Tag Manager Integration Guide

> This guide outlines how to install the Unify website tag using Google Tag Manager.

# Overview

Unify provides several different ways to start collecting intent data from your
website. The quickest way to get started is by installing the Unify website tag
directly on your website.

If you're using Google Tag Manager, you can add the website tag as a custom HTML
tag. This allows you to manage all of your scripts in one place and easily
control when and where they are loaded.

# Installation

For instructions, see the [Website Tag](/developers/intent-client/website-tag)
installation guide.
