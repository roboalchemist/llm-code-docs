# G2 Integration Guide

> Revealing anonymous visitors on your G2 profile.

# Overview

You can connect your G2 account to Unify to reveal anonymous visitors on your G2
profile, comparison pages, and more. These visitors can then be used to create
Audiences and Plays.

# Setup

To connect your existing G2 subscription to Unify, simply navigate to
[Settings -> Integrations -> G2](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/g2)
and enter your API token. Your API token can be found [here](https://my.g2.com/)
in the G2 dashboard. Once this is done, Unify will start using your G2 account
to identify visitors.
