Performance Monitoringcollects*traces*to help you monitor the performance of your app. A trace is a report of performance data captured between two points in time in your app.

You can create your own traces to monitor performance data associated with specific code in your app. With a***custom code trace***, you can measure how long it takes your app to complete a specific task or a set of tasks, for example loading a set of images or querying your database.

The default metric for a custom code trace is its "duration" (the time between the starting and stopping points of the trace), but you can add***custom metrics***, as well.

In your code, you define the beginning and the end of a custom code trace using the APIs provided by thePerformance MonitoringSDK. Custom code traces can be started anytime after they've been created, and they are thread safe.

Since the default metric collected for these traces is "duration", they are sometimes called "Duration traces".

You can view data from these traces in the*Custom traces* subtab of the traces table, which is at the bottom of the*Performance* dashboard (learn more about[using the console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/custom-code-traces#monitor-in-console)later on this page).
| **Note:** Starting and stopping traces too rapidly can be resource intensive, so you should avoid creating custom code traces at high frequencies (for example, once per frame in games).

## Default attributes, custom attributes, and custom metrics

For custom code traces,Performance Monitoringautomatically logs[***default attributes***](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/attributes)(common metadata like app version, country, device, etc.) so that you can filter the data for the trace in theFirebaseconsole. You can also add and monitor[***custom attributes***](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/custom-code-traces#create-custom-attributes)(such as, game level or user properties).

<br />

You can further configure a custom code trace to record[***custom metrics***](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/custom-code-traces#add-custom-metrics)for performance-related events that occur within the trace's scope. For example, you can create a custom metric for the number of cache hits and misses or the number of times that the UI becomes unresponsive for a noticeable period of time.

Custom attributes and custom metrics display in theFirebaseconsole alongside the default attributes and default metric for the trace.
| An*attribute* is a string value that helps you filter and segment data in the console. A*metric*is a numeric value that can be charted and measured over time.

## Add custom code traces

Use thePerformance MonitoringTrace API ([Swift](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/Trace)\|[Obj-C](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/FIRTrace)) to add custom code traces to monitor specific application code.

Note the following:

- An app can have multiple custom code traces.
- More than one custom code trace can run at the same time.
- Names for custom code traces must meet the following requirements: no leading or trailing whitespace, no leading underscore (`_`) character, and max length is 100 characters.
- Custom code traces support adding[custom metrics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/custom-code-traces#add-custom-metrics)and[custom attributes](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/custom-code-traces#create-custom-attributes).

To start and stop a custom code trace, wrap the code that you want to trace with lines of code similar to the following:  

### Swift

<br />

**Note:**This Firebase product is not available on macOS, Mac Catalyst, watchOS targets.  

```swift
// Add the Performance Monitoring module to your header
import FirebasePerformance

let trace = Performance.startTrace(name: "<var class="readonly" translate="no">CUSTOM_TRACE_NAME</var>")

// code that you want to trace

trace.stop()
```

### Objective-C

<br />

**Note:**This Firebase product is not available on macOS, Mac Catalyst, watchOS targets.  

```objective-c
// Add the Performance Monitoring module to your header
@import FirebasePerformance;

FIRTrace *trace = [FIRPerformance startTraceWithName:@"<var class="readonly" translate="no">CUSTOM_TRACE_NAME</var>"];

// code that you want to trace

[trace stop];
```

## Add custom metrics to custom code traces

Use thePerformance MonitoringTrace API ([Swift](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/Trace)\|[Obj-C](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/FIRTrace)) to add custom metrics to custom code traces.

Note the following:

- Names for custom metrics must meet the following requirements: no leading or trailing whitespace, no leading underscore (`_`) character, and max length is 100 characters.
- Each custom code trace can record up to 32 metrics (including the default*Duration*metric).

To add a custom metric, add a line of code similar to the following each time that the event occurs. For example, this custom metric counts performance- related events that occur in your app, such as cache hits or retries.  

### Swift

<br />

**Note:**This Firebase product is not available on macOS, Mac Catalyst, watchOS targets.  

```swift
let trace = Performance.startTrace(name: "<var class="readonly" translate="no">CUSTOM_TRACE_NAME</var>")

trace.incrementMetric("<var class="readonly" translate="no">EVENT_NAME</var>", by: 1)
// code that you want to trace (and log custom metrics)

trace.stop()
```

### Objective-C

<br />

**Note:**This Firebase product is not available on macOS, Mac Catalyst, watchOS targets.  

```objective-c
FIRTrace *trace = [FIRPerformance startTraceWithName:@"<var class="readonly" translate="no">CUSTOM_TRACE_NAME</var>"];

[trace incrementMetric:@"<var class="readonly" translate="no">EVENT_NAME</var>" byInt:1];
// code that you want to trace (and log custom metrics)

[trace stop];
```

## Create custom attributes for custom code traces

Use thePerformance MonitoringTrace API ([Swift](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/Trace)\|[Obj-C](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseperformance/api/reference/Classes/FIRTrace)) to add custom attributes to custom code traces.

To use custom attributes, add code to your app that defines the attribute and associates it with a specific custom code trace. You can set the custom attribute anytime between when the trace starts and when the trace stops.

Note the following:

- Names for custom attributes must meet the following requirements:

  - No leading or trailing whitespace, no leading underscore (`_`) character
  - No spaces
  - Max length is 32 characters
  - Allowed characters for the name are`A-Z`,`a-z`, and`_`.
- Each custom code trace can record up to 5 custom attributes.

- Please ensure that custom attributes do not contain any information that personally identifies an individual to Google.

  | **Collecting user data:** Performance Monitoringdoes not itself collect any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers. Developers can collect additional data usingPerformance Monitoringby creating custom attributes on custom code traces. Such data collected throughPerformance Monitoringshould not contain information that personally identifies an individual to Google.
  |
  | Here's an example of a log message that*does not*contain personally identifiable information:  
  |
  | ```java
  | trace.putAttribute("experiment", "A");
  | ```
  |
  | Here's an example that*does* contain personally identifiable information (***do not use***this type of custom attribute in your app):  
  |
  | ```java
  | trace.putAttribute("email", user.getEmailAddress());
  | ```
  |
  | Data that exposes any personally identifiable information is subject to deletion without notice.

```

## Track, view, and filter performance data

### Track specific metrics in your dashboard

To learn how your key metrics are trending, add them to your metrics board at the top of the*Performance*dashboard. You can quickly identify regressions by seeing week-over-week changes or verify that recent changes in your code are improving performance.
![an image of the metrics board in the <span class=](https://firebase.google.com/static/docs/perf-mon/images/perf-mon-metrics-board.png)Firebase Performance Monitoringdashboard" /\>

To add a metric to your metrics board, follow these steps:

1. Go to the[*Performance*dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/performance)in theFirebaseconsole.
2. Click an empty metric card, then select an existing metric to add to your board.
3. Clickmore_verton a populated metric card for more options, for example to replace or remove a metric.

<br />

The metrics board shows collected metric data over time, both in graphical form and as a numerical percentage change.

Learn more about[using the dashboard](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/console).

### View traces and their data

To view your traces, go to the[*Performance*dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/performance)in theFirebaseconsole, scroll down to the traces table, then click the appropriate subtab. The table displays some top metrics for each trace, and you can even sort the list by the percentage change for a specific metric.

Performance Monitoringprovides a troubleshooting page in theFirebaseconsole that highlights metric changes, making it easy to quickly address and minimize the impact of performance issues on your apps and users. You can use the troubleshooting page when you learn about potential performance issues, for example, in the following scenarios:

- You select relevant metrics on the dashboard and you notice a big delta.
- In the traces table you sort to display the largest deltas at the top, and you see a significant percentage change.
- You receive an email alert notifying you of a performance issue.

You can access the troubleshooting page in the following ways:

- On the metric dashboard, click the**View metric details**button.
- On any metric card, select**more_vert=\> View details**. The troubleshooting page displays information about the metric you selected.
- In the traces table, click a trace name or any metric value in the row associated with that trace.
- In an email alert, click**Investigate now**.

When you click a trace name in the traces table, you can then drill down into metrics of interest. Click the**Filteradd**button to filter the data by attribute, for example:
![an image of <span class=](https://firebase.google.com/static/docs/perf-mon/images/perf-mon-filter-by-attribute_native-1.png)Firebase Performance Monitoringdata being filtered by attribute" /\>

- Filter by*App version*to view data about a past release or your latest release
- Filter by*Device*to learn how older devices handle your app
- Filter by*Country*to make sure your database location isn't affecting a specific region
