## Description

Remove fields from the documents produced by the previous stage.

The generated documents will contain all fields from the previous stage except for the fields specified to be removed.

## Syntax

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/cities")
      .removeFields('population', 'location.state')
      .execute();

## Client examples

##### Node.js

```javascript
const results = await db.pipeline()
  .collection("cities")
  .removeFields("population", "location.state")
  .execute();
```

### Web

```javascript
const results = await execute(db.pipeline()
  .collection("cities")
  .removeFields("population", "location.state"));
```

##### Swift

```swift
let results = try await db.pipeline()
  .collection("cities")
  .removeFields(["population", "location.state"])
  .execute()
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val results = db.pipeline()
    .collection("cities")
    .removeFields("population", "location.state")
    .execute()
```

### Java

```java
Task<Pipeline.Snapshot> results = db.pipeline()
        .collection("cities")
        .removeFields("population", "location.state")
        .execute();
```

##### Python

```python
results = (
    client.pipeline()
    .collection("cities")
    .remove_fields("population", "location.state")
    .execute()
)
```

##### Java

```java
Pipeline.Snapshot results =
    firestore
        .pipeline()
        .collection("cities")
        .removeFields("population", "location.state")
        .execute()
        .get();
```

## Behavior

### Remove Nested Fields

The `remove_fields` stage respects nested field syntax, and will remove keys from a map.

For example, to remove the nested state field from the dataset:

### Node.js

    await db.collection('cities').doc('SF').set({name: 'San Francisco', location: {country: 'USA', state: 'California'}});
    await db.collection('cities').doc('TO').set({name: 'Toronto', location: {country: 'Canada', province: 'Ontario'}});

The following pipeline can be used:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/cities")
      .removeFields('location.state')
      .execute();

Which produces the following documents:

    {name: 'San Francisco', location: {country: 'USA'}}
    {name: 'Toronto', location: {country: 'Canada', province: 'Ontario'}}

Removal of elements within an array is unsupported.

### Remove on Non-Existent Fields

If a nested or top-level field given to `remove_fields` does not exist in a document, the stage won't edit the document for that field. Other existing fields will still be removed.
