| `createTime` | ``string (`https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#timestamp` format)`` Output only. The timestamp at which this database was created. Databases created before 2016 do not populate createTime. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"`, `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"` or `"2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30"`. |
| `updateTime` | ``string (`https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#timestamp` format)`` Output only. The timestamp at which this database was most recently updated. Note this only includes updates to the database resource and not data contained by the database. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"`, `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"` or `"2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30"`. |
| `deleteTime` | ``string (`https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#timestamp` format)`` Output only. The timestamp at which this database was deleted. Only set if the database has been deleted. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: `"2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"`, `"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"` or `"2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30"`. |

| `concurrencyMode` | ``enum (`https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases#ConcurrencyMode`)`` The concurrency control mode to use for this database. If unspecified in a databases.create request, this will default based on the database edition: Optimistic for Enterprise and Pessimistic for all other databases. |
| `versionRetentionPeriod` | ``string (`https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#duration` format)`` Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in the database.

If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise, the retention period is 1 hour. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with '`s`'. Example: `"3.5s"`. |
| `earliestVersionTime` | ``string (`https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf#timestamp` format)`` Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can be read from the database. See \[versionRetentionPeriod\] above; this field is populated with `now - versionRetentionPeriod`. This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when you initiate the recovery. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted.

This keyPrefix is used, in combination with the project ID ("\~") to construct the application ID that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google App Engine first generation runtimes. This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys is the projectId (eg: foo instead of v\~foo). |

The value is always DATA_ACCESS_MODE_DISABLED for Standard Edition. |
| `freeTier` | `boolean` Output only. Background: Free tier is the ability of a Firestore database to use a small amount of resources every day without being charged. Once usage exceeds the free tier limit further usage is charged. Whether this database can make use of the free tier. Only one database per project can be eligible for the free tier. The first (or next) database that is created in a project without a free tier database will be marked as eligible for the free tier. Databases that are created while there is a free tier database will not be eligible for the free tier. |
