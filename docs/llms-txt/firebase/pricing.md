## Important notes on Flutter and React Native + Expo workspaces

If you're not subscribed to a[Google Developer Programpremium plan](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/_/plans-and-pricing), you're limited to two total workspaces across both Flutter and React Native + Expo. This means you can have a maximum of:

- Two Flutter workspaces OR
- Two React Native + Expo workspaces OR
- One Flutter and one React Native + Expo workspace

Once you have reached the maximum of two workspaces, you must delete an existing workspace before you can create a new one.

### What if I already have more than two workspaces?

If you have more than two Flutter or React Native + Expo workspaces, you will retain access to them. However, you won't be able to create any new workspaces in these categories until you delete enough to fall under the two workspace limit.

To increase the number of Flutter and React Native + Expo workspaces you can create, join the[Google Developer Programpremium plan](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/_/plans-and-pricing).

## Cloud Billingand paid services

- The Firebase project is automatically upgraded to the[pay-as-you-go Blaze pricing plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).
- You will be charged for any usage of paid services beyond the no-cost quota.
- YourGemini Developer APIusage is upgraded to the paid tier.
