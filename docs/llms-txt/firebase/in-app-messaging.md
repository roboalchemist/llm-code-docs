Engage active app users with contextual messages.  
Firebase In-App Messaginghelps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted, contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. For example, you could send an in-app message to get users to subscribe, watch a video, complete a level, or buy an item. You can customize messages as cards, banners, modals, or images, and set up triggers so that they appear exactly when they'd benefit your users most.
