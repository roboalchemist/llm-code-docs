Firebase Hostingintegrates with popular modern web frameworks including Angular and Next.js. UsingFirebase HostingandCloud Functions for Firebasewith these frameworks, you can develop apps and microservices in your preferred framework environment, and then deploy them in a managed, secure server environment.

Support during this early preview includes the following functionality:

- Deploy Web apps comprised of static web content
- Deploy Web apps that use pre-rendering / Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Deploy Web apps that use server-side Rendering (SSR)---full server rendering on demand

Firebase provides this functionality through theFirebaseCLI. When initializingHostingon the command line, you provide information about your new or existing Web project, and the CLI sets up the right resources for your chosen Web framework.
| **Note:** Framework-awareHostingis an early public preview. This means that the functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways. A preview release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy and may receive limited or no support.

## Before you begin

Before you get started deploying your app to Firebase, review the following requirements and options:

- FirebaseCLI version 12.1.0 or later. Make sure to[install the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli)using your preferred method.
- Optional: Billing enabled on your Firebase project (required if you plan to use SSR)

## Serve locally

You can test your integration locally by following these steps:

1. Run`firebase emulators:start`from the terminal. This builds your app and serves it using theFirebaseCLI.
2. Open your web app at the local URL returned by the CLI (usually http://localhost:5000).

## Deploy your app toFirebase Hosting

When you're ready to share your changes with the world, deploy your app to your live site:

1. Run`firebase deploy`from the terminal.
2. Check your website on:`SITE_ID.web.app`or`PROJECT_ID.web.app`(or your custom domain, if you set one up).

## Configure different environments

You can deploy multiple sets of environment variables for different project environments, such as staging and production.

Like Cloud Functions for Firebase, this tooling supports the[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)file format for loading environment variables specified in a .env file.

- If you have a`staging`project alias, you can deploy environment variables from a`.env.staging`file.
- If you have a`production`project alias, you can deploy environment variables from a`.env.production`file.
- If you have a project with id`PROJECT_ID`, you can deploy environment variables from a`.env.PROJECT_ID`file.

See the[Cloud Functions documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env?gen=2nd#deploying_multiple_sets_of_environment_variables)for a detailed guide.
