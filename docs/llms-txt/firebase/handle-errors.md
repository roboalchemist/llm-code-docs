| **If you have an`*.appspot.com`default bucket,** your Firebase project must be upgraded to the[pay-as-you-go Blaze pricing plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)by**as early as February 02, 2026** to maintain access to your default bucket.[Learn more.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/faqs-storage-changes-announced-sept-2024)

Sometimes when you're building an app, things don't go as planned and an error occurs!

When in doubt, catch the exception thrown by the function and see what the error message has to say.  

    final storageRef = FirebaseStorage.instance.ref().child("files/uid");
    try {
      final listResult = await storageRef.listAll();
    } on FirebaseException catch (e) {
      // Caught an exception from Firebase.
      print("Failed with error '${e.code}': ${e.message}");
    }

| **Note:** By default, aCloud Storage for Firebasebucket requiresFirebase Authenticationto perform any action on the bucket's data or files. You can change yourFirebase Security RulesforCloud Storageto[allow unauthenticated access for specific situations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/rules-conditions#public). However, for most situations, we strongly recommend[restricting access and setting up robust security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security/get-started)(especially for production apps). Note that if you useGoogleApp Engineand have a defaultCloud Storagebucket with a name format of`*.appspot.com`, you may need to consider[how your security rules impact access toApp Enginefiles](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/gcp-integration#security-rules-and-app-engine-files).

## Handle Error Messages

There are a number of reasons why errors may occur, including the file not existing, the user not having permission to access the desired file, or the user cancelling the file upload.

To properly diagnose the issue and handle the error, here is a full list of all the errors our client will raise, and how they occurred.
