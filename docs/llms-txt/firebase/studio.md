Generate entire apps with multimodal prompts, including natural language, images, drawings. Enhance your app using a gallery of stock images from[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). If your app needs a database or authentication, theApp Prototyping agentsets upCloud FirestoreandFirebase Authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Always-available AI assistance from Gemini inFirebase**                                           | Use AI coding assistance from[Gemini inFirebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/ai-assistance)across all development surfaces: interactive chat, code generation, tool running, and inline code suggestions.

| **Familiar and highly customizable development environment**                                        | Firebase Studiois built on the popularCode OSSproject and runs a full[virtual machine (VM)](https://cloud.google.com/workstations)powered byGoogle Cloud. You can customize almost every aspect of your online development environment with[Nix](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/customize-workspace), including system packages, language tooling, IDE configurations, app previews, and IDE configuration---and share the project and its entire development environment configuration with a[custom template](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/custom-templates).                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Built-in tools, emulators, and deployment methods with deep Firebase andGoogle Cloudintegration** | [Preview your web and Android apps right in the browser](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/preview-apps)and take advantage of[built-in runtime services and tools](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/debug)for emulation, testing, and debugging. Firebase Studioseamlessly integrates with[Firebase andGoogle Cloudservices](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/google-integrations). For example, you could use the[Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite)directly fromFirebase Studioto thoroughly test Firebase andGoogle Cloudservices likeFirebase Authentication,Cloud Functions,Cloud Firestore,Cloud Storage,Firebase App Hosting, andFirebase Hostingbefore you[publish your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/deploy-app). |

## How does it work?

Firebase Studiosupports multiple modes to cater to different development styles:

- **Coding with full control** : Work directly in a Code OSS-based IDE where you can import existing repositories or start new projects, and use extensions from the[Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/). Gemini inFirebaseprovides workspace-aware AI assistance with code completion, code generation, testing, tool-running, and documentation. You can completely customize your workspaces, deployment approach, and target runtime environment with support for extensible configuration using[Nix](https://nixos.org/).

- **Prompting without coding: TheApp Prototyping agent, also known asPrototyper** lets you create new workspaces to prototype and refine app ideas with Gemini inFirebase---without writing any code. Work with the agent using multimodal prompts to iteratively develop a full-stack app (currently works for web apps), test and debug, and share your work with others, right from your browser. You can immediately roll changes back if needed, add new features, test, publish toFirebase App Hostingand monitor your app's performance with built-in observability.

You can seamlessly transition between coding and prompting to harness the strengths of each. For example, you can start with a prototype in theApp Prototyping agentthat covers the basics, like app structure and user flow, then switch toCodeto implement more custom logic and integration.

This flexibility lets you iterate quickly and build apps that meet your specific needs---all fromFirebase Studio.
| **Note:** TheApp Prototyping agentcan help you**build web apps with Next.js**. Support for other platforms and frameworks is coming soon!

## Pricing, quotas, and limits

Access toFirebase Studiois available at no cost, but you can increase the number of workspaces you can create by joining the[Google Developer Program](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/_/dashboard). Certain integrations (likeFirebase App Hosting) may require aCloud Billingaccount.
