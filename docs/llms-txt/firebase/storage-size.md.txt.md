This page describes the storage size of documents, document names, fields, and
index entries in Cloud Firestore.
You can learn about the costs of this storage at [Cloud Firestore
Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/pricing).

## String size

String sizes are calculated as the number of [UTF-8 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) bytes + 1.

The following are stored as strings:

- Collection IDs
- String document IDs
- Document names
- Field names
- String field values

For example:

- The collection ID `tasks` uses 5 bytes + 1 byte, for a total of 6 bytes.
- The field name `description` uses 11 bytes + 1 byte, for a total of 12 bytes.

## Document ID size

The size of a document ID is either the [string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#string-size) for a string
ID or 8 bytes for an integer ID.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The Cloud Firestore client libraries always use string document IDs.

## Document name size

The size of a document name is the sum of:

- The size of each collection ID and document ID in the path to the document
- 16 additional bytes

For a document in the subcollection `users/jeff/tasks` with a string document ID
of `my_task_id`, the document name size is 6 + 5 + 6 + 11 + 16 = 44 bytes:

- 6 bytes for the `users` collection ID
- 5 bytes for the `jeff` document ID
- 6 bytes for the `tasks` collection ID
- 11 bytes for the `my_task_id` document ID
- 16 additional bytes

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Any documents in subcollections under the document, for example `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id/comments/D8PvloqiczrzXik3SWjZ`, aren't counted towards the document name size or the 1 MiB limit for the `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id` document.

## Field value size

The following table shows the size of field values by type.

| Type | Size |
|---|---|
| Array | The sum of the sizes of its values |
| Boolean | 1 byte |
| Bytes | Byte length |
| Date and time | 8 bytes |
| Floating-point number | 8 bytes |
| Geographical point | 16 bytes |
| Integer | 8 bytes |
| Map | The size of the map, calculated the same way as [document size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-size) |
| Null | 1 byte |
| Reference | The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) |
| Text string | Number of UTF-8 encoded bytes + 1 |
| Vector | 8 bytes per dimension |

For example, a boolean field named `done` would use 6 bytes:

- 5 bytes for the `done` field name
- 1 byte for the boolean value

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Field values in an index are truncated after 1500 bytes, see [indexing limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas#indexes).

## Document size

The size of a document is the sum of:

- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size)
- The sum of the [string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#string-size) of each field name
- The sum of the size of each [field value](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#field-size)
- 32 additional bytes

This example is for a document in subcollection `users/jeff/tasks`
with a string document ID of `my_task_id`:

```
 - "type": "Personal"
 - "done": false
 - "priority": 1
 - "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
```

The total size of the fields is 71 bytes:

| Field name and value | Field size in bytes |
|---|---|
| `"type": "Personal"` | 14 5 for the field name + 9 for the field's string value |
| `"done": false` | 6 5 for the field name + 1 for the field's boolean value |
| `"priority": 1` | 17 9 for the field name + 8 for the field's integer value |
| `"description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"` | 34 12 for the field name + 22 for the field's string value |

So the document size is 44 + 71 + 32 = 147 bytes:

- 44 bytes for the document name
- 71 bytes for the fields
- 32 additional bytes

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Any documents in subcollections under the document, for example `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id/comments/D8PvloqiczrzXik3SWjZ`, aren't counted towards the document name size or the 1 MiB limit for the `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id` document.

## Index entry size

Index entry sizes are calculated as follows for single-field and composite
indexes.

### Single-field index entry size

The size of a single-field index entry depends on whether an index is scoped to
a collection or a collection group.

#### Collection scope

The size of an entry in a single-field index with collection scope is the sum
of:

- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document
- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document's parent document
- The [string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#string-size) of the indexed field name
- The size of the indexed [field value](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#field-size)
- 32 additional bytes

Consider a document in the sub-collection `users/jeff/tasks` with
a string document ID of `my_task_id`:

```
 - "type": "Personal"
 - "done": false
 - "priority": 1
 - "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
```

For a single-field index with collection scope that indexes the `done`
field, the total size of the entry in this index is 109 bytes:

- 44 bytes for the document name `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id`
- 27 bytes for the parent document's document name `users/jeff`
- 5 bytes for the `done` field name
- 1 byte for the boolean field value
- 32 additional bytes

#### Collection group scope

The size of an entry in a single-field index with collection group scope is the
sum of:

- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document
- The [string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#string-size) of the indexed field name
- The size of the indexed [field value](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#field-size)
- 48 additional bytes

Consider a document in the sub-collection `users/jeff/tasks` with
a string document ID of `my_task_id`:

```
 - "type": "Personal"
 - "done": false
 - "priority": 1
 - "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
```

For a single-field index with collection group scope that indexes the `done`
field, the total size of the entry in this index is 98 bytes:

- 44 bytes for the document name `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id`
- 5 bytes for the `done` field name
- 1 byte for the boolean field value
- 48 additional bytes

### Composite index entry size

The size of an entry in a composite index depends on whether the index is scoped
to a collection or a collection group.

#### Collection scope

The size of an index entry in a composite index with collection scope is the
sum of:

- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document
- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document's parent document
- The sum of the indexed [field values](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#field-size)
- 32 additional bytes

Consider a document in the sub-collection `users/jeff/tasks` with
a string document ID of `my_task_id`:

```
 - "type": "Personal"
 - "done": false
 - "priority": 1
 - "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
```

For a composite index with collection scope that indexes the `done` and
`priority` fields (both ascending), the total size of the entry in this index is
112 bytes:

- 44 bytes for the document name `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id`
- 27 bytes for the parent document's document name `users/jeff`
- 1 byte for the boolean field value
- 8 bytes for the integer field value
- 32 additional bytes

#### Collection group scope

The size of an index entry in a composite index with collection group scope is
the sum of:

- The [document name size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#document-name-size) of the indexed document
- The sum of the indexed [field values](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/storage-size#field-size)
- 32 additional bytes

Consider a document in the sub-collection `users/jeff/tasks` with
a string document ID of `my_task_id`:

```
 - "type": "Personal"
 - "done": false
 - "priority": 1
 - "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
```

For a composite index with collection group scope that indexes the `done` and
`priority` fields (both ascending), the total size of the index entry in this
index is 85 bytes:

- 44 bytes for the document name `users/jeff/tasks/my_task_id`
- 1 byte for the boolean field value
- 8 bytes for the integer field value
- 32 additional bytes
