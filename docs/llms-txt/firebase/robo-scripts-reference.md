This document provides reference information about Robo scripts including structure, capabilities, usage, recording, and actions.*Robo scripts*are tests that automate manual quality assurance (QA) tasks for mobile apps, and enable continuous integration (CI) and pre-launch testing strategies. A Robo script is a JSON file that describes a sequence of user interface (UI) and other actions.

You can create a Robo script in the following ways:

- Use the Robo script recording feature. (Android only)

- Create the Robo script manually. (Android and iOS+)

- Record the Robo script and then edit it manually. (Android only)

To learn more about using Robo scripts, see[Run a Robo script](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/run-robo-scripts).

## Introduction

Robo script is provided to Robo test alongside other inputs like the app-under-test Android Application Package (APK).

The following is an example of a Robo script that signs a user into an app, which is triggered when the app-under-test is launched:  

    [
      {
        "crawlStage": "crawl",
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED",
            "replacementText": "user123",
            "elementDescriptors": [
              {
                "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/username"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "eventType": "VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED",
            "replacementText": "12345",
            "elementDescriptors": [
              {
                "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/password"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
            "elementDescriptors": [
              {
                "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/login"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

If there is a single Robo script in a file and it has the default`app_under_test_shown`triggering condition, as in the example above, then you can specify the Robo script in a file using a simpler format - just as a sequence of its actions:  

    [
      {
        "eventType": "VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED",
        "replacementText": "user123",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/username"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "eventType": "VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED",
        "replacementText": "12345",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/password"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/login"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### iOS+ support for Robo scripts

Robo for iOS+ (Beta) has**limited support**for Robo scripts. The Robo script syntax for iOS+ is identical to Android syntax, and supported iOS+ features behave similarly to their Android counterparts.
| **Note:** Robo for iOS+ is a beta release. This means that the functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways. A beta release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy and may receive limited or no support.

The following actions are supported in iOS+:

- Assertion
- Click
- Long click
- Swipe
- Ignore all element(s)
- Wait
- Take screenshot
- Terminate crawl

The following identifying attributes in element descriptors are supported in iOS+:

- Class name
- Ancestor class name
- Content description (and regex)
- Text (and regex)

The following**triggering conditions in context descriptors**are supported in iOS+:

- App under test shown
- Element present
- Non-Robo script action performed

## Structure

A Robo script has several attributes that describe how Robo executes it. Most of these attributes are optional with predefined default values:

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `id`                | An integer number that helps track this Robo script in crawl outputs. Robo has built-in Robo scripts with their own`id`s. Although the same`id`in different Robo scripts does not affect their behavior, distinguishing actions from these Robo scripts in crawl outputs can be challenging. We recommend assigning a unique`id`of`1000`or higher for your Robo scripts to avoid any conflicts. |
| `description`       | Similar to`id`but more descriptive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `crawlStage`        | The stage of a crawl Robo applies this Robo script at. By default, it is the main crawl stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `priority`          | The priority of this Robo script in comparison to other Robo scripts. By default, all Robo scripts have a priority of`1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `maxNumberOfRuns`   | Specifies how many times during a crawl Robo can execute this Robo script. By default, Robo can execute a Robo script one time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `contextDescriptor` | Describes the context or condition that triggers this Robo script. If omitted, this Robo script's triggering condition is considered to be always met; in other words, the Robo script is unconditional.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `actions`           | All actions of this Robo script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A single file contains a collection of one or more Robo scripts.

The following is an example of a file with two unconditional Robo scripts, each with a single action that is executed once at the beginning of a crawl:  

    [
      {
        "id": 1000,
        "description": "My first Robo script",
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "DISABLE_KEYBOARD"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1001,
        "description": "My second Robo script",
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "PRESSED_BACK"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### Context descriptor

A context descriptor defines the context or condition that triggers a Robo script using one or a combination of several attributes:

|                  **Attribute**                   |                                                                                                                                                                           **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"condition": "always"`                          | Always triggers a Robo script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `"condition": "element_present"`                 | Checks that a UI widget that matches`elementDescriptors`or text specified by`visionText`is present on the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `"condition": "element_disabled"`                | Checks that a UI widget that matches`elementDescriptors`is present on the screen and cannot be interacted with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `"condition": "element_checked"`                 | Checks that a UI widget that matches`elementDescriptors`is present on the screen and is checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `"condition": "app_under_test_shown"`            | Checks that the app-under-test is running in the foreground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `"condition": "default_launcher_shown"`          | Checks that a device's home screen is shown, which means that no apps are running in the foreground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `"condition": "non_roboscript_action_performed"` | Checks that the last`nonRoboscriptActionCount`consecutive actions performed by Robo test are not Robo script actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `negateCondition`                                | If set to`true`, negates the`condition`. For example, you can use this attribute to check if a UI widget is NOT present on the screen, or that the app-under-test is NOT running in the foreground.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `elementDescriptors`                             | One or more element descriptors that identify a UI widget on the screen. It is used in combination with the`element_present`,`element_disabled`, and`element_checked`conditions. Mutually exclusive with`visionText`. For more information, see[Element descriptors](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-scripts-reference#element-descriptors). |
| `visionText`                                     | Text on the screen is detected using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API.`visionText`is used in combination with the`element_present`condition. Mutually exclusive with`elementDescriptors`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `nonRoboscriptActionCount`                       | The number of consecutive non-Robo script actions performed prior. It is used in combination with the`non_roboscript_action_performed`condition to trigger a Robo script after every`nonRoboscriptActionCount`Robo actions. By default, it is`1`.                                                                                                                   |

The following is an example of a Robo script that is triggered by a UI widget with a resource ID`"my.app.package:id/page_header"`being present on the screen:  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "element_present",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/page_header"
          }
        ]
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
          "elementDescriptors": [
            {
              "text": "Settings"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

The following is an example of a Robo script that is triggered by`"Privacy Policy"`detected by Optical Character Recognition (OCR):  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "description": "Vision text Robo script",
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "element_present",
        "visionText": "Privacy Policy"
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
          "visionText": "Privacy Policy"
        }
      ]
    }

The following is an example of a Robo script that waits for 5 seconds after every non-script Robo action:  

    {
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "non_roboscript_action_performed"
      },
      "maxNumberOfRuns" : 1000,
      "actions" : [
        {
          "eventType" : "WAIT",
          "delayTime" : 5000
        }]
    }

### Actions

Each action in a Robo script is represented as a bundle of one or more attribute-value pairs, which are described in the following table:

|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `eventType`                                   | Specifies the type of the action, for example, click, text edit, etc. Required for every action.                                                                                                                                            |
| `elementDescriptors`                          | Descriptors that identify a UI widget. Required for all actions that have a target UI widget, like clicking a particular button.                                                                                                            |
| `optional`                                    | If set to`true`, this action is skipped when it cannot be performed. For example, this action is skipped when it can't find its target UI widget on a screen-- without failing the containing Robo script. By default, the value is`false`. |
| `replacementText`                             | The text to input into the target UI widget. Required for text editing actions.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `swipeDirection`                              | Specifies the direction of the swipe. Required for swipe actions.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `delayTime`                                   | Specifies how long to wait, in milliseconds. Required for wait actions.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `pointTapXCoordinate`and`pointTapYCoordinate` | The pixel X and Y coordinates of the tapped point. Mutually exclusive with`pointTapXPercent`and`pointTapYPercent`. Required for point tap actions.                                                                                          |
| `pointTapXPercent`and`pointTapYPercent`       | The percentage X and Y coordinates of the tapped point. Mutually exclusive with`pointTapXCoordinate`and`pointTapYCoordinate`. Required for point tap actions.                                                                               |

The following is an example of a Robo script with two actions without target UI widgets, which means that these actions don't operate on a specific UI widget:  

    [
      {
        "eventType": "WAIT",
        "delayTime": 3000
      },
      {
        "eventType": "PRESSED_BACK"
      }
    ]

### Element descriptors

An element descriptor identifies a UI widget using one or more of the following identifying attributes:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**                                                                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                        |
| `className`                                                                        | --                                                                                                                                                     |
| `ancestorClassName`                                                                | Class name of the element's UI hierarchy ancestor. An ancestor is any of the parent nodes in the element's UI hierarchy, including the element itself. |
| `resourceId`                                                                       | --                                                                                                                                                     |
| `resourceIdRegex`                                                                  | Java regular expression to match`resourceId`.                                                                                                          |
| `contentDescription`                                                               | --                                                                                                                                                     |
| `contentDescriptionRegex`                                                          | Java regular expression to match`contentDescription`.                                                                                                  |
| `text`(that appears on the screen)                                                 | --                                                                                                                                                     |
| `textRegex`                                                                        | Java regular expression to match`text`.                                                                                                                |
| `groupViewChildPosition`,`recyclerViewChildPosition`, or`adapterViewChildPosition` | Represents a UI widget's child position depending on the kind of its parent widget.                                                                    |

Frequently, these attributes are undefined, for example, a button might not have text and content description. Even if some attribute values are present, they might not be unique on a given app screen (including`resourceId`).

For example, differentiating between items of a list is commonly possible only by using their different child positions within their parent widget. This means that using just one element descriptor to identify a UI widget is usually insufficient. Therefore, an action's`elementDescriptors`attribute contains a sequence of element descriptors that are ordered such that the first one corresponds to the target UI widget, the second one corresponds to the target UI widget's parent widget, and so on. An action's target UI widget is matched when all of its element descriptors match the corresponding UI widget sub-hierarchy.

The following is an example of a Robo script with a text change and click actions, both of which require you to identify the target UI widget using the provided element descriptors:  

    [
      {
        "eventType": "VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED",
        "replacementText": "John",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "className": "android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatEditText",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 0,
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/first_name"
          },
          {
            "className": "android.widget.FrameLayout",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 0
          },
          {
            "className": "android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 1
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "className": "android.support.design.widget.FloatingActionButton",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/done"
          },
          {
            "className": "android.widget.FrameLayout",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/content"
          },
          {
            "className": "android.widget.FrameLayout",
            "groupViewChildPosition": 0,
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/sign_in_content"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### Execution options

You can optionally prefix the list of actions in a Robo script with a JSON object that specifies the execution options for that Robo script. This configuration header starts with the`roboscript`keyword followed by a JSON representation of the desired execution options.

Robo scripts support the following execution options:

- `executionMode`- execution options applied when a Robo script is running:
  - `strict`- if set to`true`, Robo script does not employ[partial matching, skipping current action, and suspension](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-scripts-reference#capabilities). That is, the Robo script is executed as a regular instrumentation test and fails as soon as any of its actions cannot be performed. By default, it is`false`.
  - `dismiss_popups`- if set to`true`, Robo test dismisses any unexpected dialogs while performing the Robo script even in`strict`mode. This option has no effect when not in`strict`mode. By default, it is`false`.
  - `notify`- if set to`false`, Robo script does not show on-screen notifications at the beginning and end of its execution. By default, it is`true`.
- `postscript`- execution options applied after a Robo script is completed:
  - `terminate`- if set to`true`, Robo test stops crawling after the Robo script is completed. By default, it is`false`.

The following is an example of a Robo script executed in`strict`mode without on-screen notifications that waits for three seconds, after which the crawl stops:  

    "roboscript": {
      "executionMode": {
        "strict": true,
        "notify": false
      },
      "postscript": {
        "terminate": true
      }
    }
    [
      {
        "eventType": "WAIT",
        "delayTime": 3000
      }
    ]

### Template parameters

A*template parameter*is a placeholder in a Robo script that is replaced with the actual value when Robo test loads that Robo script for execution. Template parameters are prefixed with a double underscore followed by a percent sign, and are postfixed with a percent sign followed by a double underscore.

Robo scripts support the following template parameter:

- `__%APP_PACKAGE_NAME%__`- the package name of the app-under-test.

The following is an example of a Robo script that stops the app-under-test process:  

    [
      {
        "eventType": "ADB_SHELL_COMMAND",
        "command": "am force-stop __%APP_PACKAGE_NAME%__"
      }
    ]

### Comments

A Robo script can contain comment lines, which are lines that start with`#`or`//`.

The following is an example of a Robo script with a couple of comments:  

    # Confirm a user account.
    [
      {
        // Click the DONE button.
        "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/done"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

## Capabilities

By default, until all actions of a Robo script are completed (or at least attempted), the Robo script remains active. Robo test keeps trying to match a Robo script action whenever it is picking an action to perform. Robo script employs the following techniques to increase robustness:

|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technique**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Partial matching    | If the current Robo script action cannot be fully matched, the matching criteria are relaxed and the matching is retried. The partial matching doesn't consider the outermost element descriptor while matching the target UI widget of a Robo script action. If the partial matching succeeds, the corresponding Robo script action is performed as usual. This technique supports scenarios in which the app structure changes, for example, between app versions, when screen elements are rearranged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Skip current action | If the current Robo script action cannot be fully or partially matched, Robo tries to match the subsequent Robo script action. If the subsequent action fully or partially matches, Robo test skips (and never returns to) the current Robo script action and performs the subsequent one. This technique supports scenarios when app behavior changes between versions or is flaky, for example, when an intermittent dialog might appear at different screens during recording versus replaying of a Robo script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Suspend             | If neither current nor subsequent Robo script actions can be fully or partially matched, Robo script is temporarily suspended and Robo test picks an action to perform using its other strategies. After this action is completed, Robo test resumes executing the Robo script. As long as current or subsequent Robo script actions cannot be matched, Robo script remains suspended for any number of actions. Thus, Robo scripts don't necessarily need to be a prologue for a Robo test, and you can intersperse Robo script actions with standard Robo test actions. This technique supports scenarios when app behavior is flaky, or when changes between app versions are large enough that Robo test needs to "fill in the gaps" with its standard actions. |

### Priorities

If a Robo script reaches its`maxNumberOfRuns`, it can no longer be triggered in a given crawl. If more than one Robo script can be triggered by the current context, priority is given by choosing, in the following order, the Robo script that:

1. Has a`contextDescriptor`attribute.
2. Has the highest`priority`(by default, all Robo scripts have the same execution`priority`of`1`).
3. Appears earliest in the list of the Robo scripts, if Robo scripts' priorities are the same.

The following is an example of a file with three Robo scripts that perform the same action and are triggered by the same condition - the app-under-test being in the foreground:  

    [
      {
        "id": 1000,
        "description": "Robo script 1",
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "WAIT",
            "delayTime": 3000
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1001,
        "description": "Robo script 2",
        "priority": "2",
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "WAIT",
            "delayTime": 3000
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1002,
        "description": "Robo script 3",
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "WAIT",
            "delayTime": 3000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

When the app-under-test is in the foreground, Robo triggers the following, in order:

1. `"Robo script 2"`because it has the highest priority.
2. `"Robo script 1"`because it appears earlier among the remaining applicable Robo scripts with the same priority.
3. `"Robo script 3"`as the last applicable Robo script.

### Repeated runs

By default, Robo triggers a Robo script at most once during a crawl. This can be adjusted via the`maxNumberOfRuns`attribute.

The following is an example of a Robo script that brings the app-under-test into the background for up to 10 times:  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "maxNumberOfRuns": 10,
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "eventType": "GO_HOME"
        }
      ]
    }

### Crawl stage

Robo scripts are applicable at different stages of a given Robo crawl:

|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Crawl stage** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `pre_crawl`     | Before Robo launches and starts crawling the app-under-test.                                                                                                                                  |
| `post_crawl`    | After Robo finishes crawling the app-under-test. A`post_crawl`Robo script must not exceed 15 seconds in duration or else the crawl may terminate in a timeout.                                |
| `crawl`         | The main crawl stage, when Robo crawls the app-under-test.                                                                                                                                    |
| `close_screen`  | When Robo tries to return back (backtrack) from a given screen, when all possible actions on this screen are explored. By default, Robo presses back, which is undesirable in some scenarios. |

If the`crawlStage`attribute of a Robo script is unspecified, it is implied to be`crawl`.

The following is an example of a Robo script that clears the app-under-test user data before Robo starts crawling it:  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "crawlStage": "pre_crawl",
      "actions": [
        {
          "eventType": "ADB_SHELL_COMMAND",
          "command": "pm clear __%APP_PACKAGE_NAME%__"
        }
      ]
    }

The following is an example of a Robo script that instructs Robo to click`"Cancel"`whenever it tries to return back (backtrack) from a confirmation dialog:  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "crawlStage": "close_screen",
      "maxNumberOfRuns": 999,
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "element_present",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/confirmation_dialog"
          }
        ]
      },
      "actions": [
        {
          "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
          "elementDescriptors": [
            {
              "text": "Cancel"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

### Conditional actions

A Robo script can contain conditional actions. Conditional actions have three additional attributes that describe how Robo performs them:

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `priority`          | The priority of this conditional action in comparison to other conditional actions within its containing Robo script. By default, all conditional actions have a priority of`1`.                                                                            |
| `maxNumberOfRuns`   | How many times this conditional action can be performed during one execution of its containing Robo script. By default, all conditional actions can be performed at most once in a single execution of their containing Robo script.                        |
| `contextDescriptor` | The context/condition that triggers this conditional action. It has the same structure and offers similar capabilities as[the Robo script's contextDescriptor](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-scripts-reference#context-descriptor) |

When triggered, a Robo script performs its non-conditional actions one by one in order of appearance. If a Robo script contains conditional actions, then they are considered every time before picking a non-conditional action to perform. If any conditional action is triggered and picked based on its priority and the remaining number of runs, then the Robo script performs this conditional action. Otherwise, the Robo script performs the following non-conditional action. To be valid, a Robo script must contain at least one non-conditional action.

The following is an example of an unconditional Robo script with a conditional action that dismisses popup dialogs if they show up at any point during the Robo script execution:  

    {
      "id": 1000,
      "actions": [
        {
          "description": "Dismiss popup",
          "maxNumberOfRuns": 100,
          "contextDescriptor": {
            "condition": "default_launcher_shown",
            "negateCondition": true
          },
          "eventType": "GO_HOME"
        },
        {
          "description": "Screen off",
          "eventType": "ADB_SHELL_COMMAND",
          "command": "input keyevent 26"
        },
        {
          "description": "Wait for 10 seconds",
          "eventType": "WAIT",
          "delayTime": 10000
        },
        {
          "description": "Screen on",
          "eventType": "ADB_SHELL_COMMAND",
          "command": "input keyevent 82"
        },
        {
          "description": "Wait for 10 seconds",
          "eventType": "WAIT",
          "delayTime": 10000
        }
    }

### Ignoring actions

A Robo script can contain instructions for Robo to ignore specific UI widgets or all UI widgets on a particular screen. These instructions are represented as ignoring "actions" with`eventType``ELEMENT_IGNORED`and`ALL_ELEMENTS_IGNORED`correspondingly.

Whenever the`contextDescriptor`attribute of a Robo script containing ignoring actions matches a given screen, Robo does not interact with any UI widgets targeted by its ignoring actions (unless some other Robo script action makes Robo perform an action on one of the ignored UI widgets).

A Robo script can contain a mix of ignoring, conditional, and non-conditional actions. Unlike other Robo script actions, ignoring actions are applied as long as their containing Robo script's`contextDescriptor`matches a screen during a Robo crawl, regardless of the values of the`priority`and`maxNumberOfRuns`attributes.

The following is an example of a file with two Robo scripts. The first Robo script makes Robo ignore all UI widgets on a screen containing a UI widget with a resource ID`"my.app.package:id/ignored_screen"`. The second Robo script makes Robo ignore UI widgets whose resource IDs match Java regex`".*:id/done"`on a screen containing a UI widget with a resource ID`"my.app.package:id/main_screen"`:  

    [
      {
        "id": 1000,
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "element_present",
          "elementDescriptors": [
            {
              "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/ignored_screen"
            }
          ]
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "ALL_ELEMENTS_IGNORED"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1001,
        "contextDescriptor": {
          "condition": "element_present",
          "elementDescriptors": [
            {
              "resourceId": "my.app.package:id/main_screen"
            }
          ]
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "eventType": "ELEMENT_IGNORED",
            "elementDescriptors": [
              {
                "resourceIdRegex": ".*:id/done"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### RecyclerView and AdapterView support

Children of RecyclerView and AdapterView widgets are loaded dynamically and might be displayed many swipes away from the current screen. Since the size of a screen, and the number of swipes required to get to this child, is different for different device form factors, it is much more robust to rely on the child's data position, which is absolute. It is a less robust approach to rely on the number of swipes that are required to bring this child to the screen and then use its screen position.

Therefore, Robo script captures the absolute data positions of RecyclerView children that are targets of Robo script actions as`recyclerViewChildPosition`. Robo script also captures the absolute data positions of AdapterView children that are targets of Robo script actions as`adapterViewChildPosition`.

Actions on RecyclerView and AdapterView children are performed in the following steps:

1. Robo test ensures that the corresponding child is displayed on the screen through a positioning action on its containing RecyclerView or AdapterView.

2. Robo test performs the recorded action directly on the child element, since it is already displayed on the screen.

The following is an example of a click action on an AdapterView (`android.widget.GridView`) child:  

    {
      "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
      "elementDescriptors": [
        {
          "className": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka.widget.AvatarView",
          "adapterViewChildPosition": 5,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/avatar",
          "contentDescription": "Avatar 6"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.GridView",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/avatars"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.LinearLayout",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 1
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.LinearLayout",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 0
        }
      ]
    }

The following is an example of a click action on a RecyclerView (`android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView`) child:  

    {
      "eventType": "VIEW_CLICKED",
      "elementDescriptors": [
        {
          "className": "android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatTextView",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/category_title"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.FrameLayout",
          "recyclerViewChildPosition": 8,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/category_item"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/categories"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.FrameLayout",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 1,
          "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/category_container"
        },
        {
          "className": "android.widget.LinearLayout",
          "groupViewChildPosition": 0
        }
      ]
    }

## Record a Robo script in Android Studio and run it inTest Lab

You can create a Robo script in Android Studio, which saves the script as a JSON file. You can then upload the JSON file toFirebase Test Labwith the application and run the test accordingly.

When you run a Robo test with a script attached, Robo test first steps through your pre-scripted actions and then explores the app as usual.

To create a Robo script JSON file in Android Studio, follow the steps in[Record a Robo script usingTest Labin Android Studio](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/run-robo-scripts#record-android-studio).

## Robo script actions

The following common optional attribute applies to all actions:

- `description`- helps track execution of this Robo script action in Robo test outputs.

### Assertion

If the asserted condition is true, the Robo script continues to the next action, which could be another assertion. Otherwise, the Robo script execution is halted due to a failed assertion.

The following table lists required attributes:

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attribute**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `"eventType": "ASSERTION"` | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `contextDescriptor`        | Describes the asserted context or condition. It has the same structure and offers similar capabilities as[the Robo script's contextDescriptor](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-scripts-reference#context-descriptor). |

<br />

The following is an example of a Robo script assertion that checks that the app-under-test is in the foreground:  

    {
      "eventType": "ASSERTION",
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "app_under_test_shown"
      }
    }

The following is an example of a Robo script assertion that checks that a UI widget with the resource ID`"com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/done"`is present on a screen:  

    {
      "eventType": "ASSERTION",
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "element_present",
        "elementDescriptors": [
          {
            "resourceId": "com.google.samples.apps.topeka:id/done"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

The following is an example of a Robo script assertion that checks that`"Settings"`is NOT detected on a screen using OCR:  

    {
      "eventType": "ASSERTION",
      "contextDescriptor": {
        "condition": "element_present",
        "negateCondition": true,
        "visionText": "Settings"
      }
    }
