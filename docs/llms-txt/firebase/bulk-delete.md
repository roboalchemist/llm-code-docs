Use the managed bulk delete service to delete data from your database. This feature supports deletion against one or more collection groups.

This page describes how to delete documents in bulk using the managed bulk delete service. The Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility managed bulk delete service is available through the[`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)command-line tool and theCloud Firestore[REST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases/bulkDeleteDocuments).
| **Caution:** Bulk deleting data from Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility incurs one delete operation per document deleted and some read operations based on a fraction of total documents read. However, these operations don't appear in the usage section of the console. Make sure that you understand this before issuing bulk deletes to avoid billed charges.

## Before you begin

Before you can use the managed bulk delete service, you must complete the following tasks:

1. [Enable billing for yourGoogle Cloudproject.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project)OnlyGoogle Cloudprojects with billing enabled can use the bulk delete functionality.
2. Make sure your account has the necessary permissions for Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.**If you are the project owner, your account has the required permissions.**Otherwise, the following roles grant the necessary permissions for bulk delete operations:

   - [Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility roles:](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/security/iam#predefined_roles)`Owner`,`Cloud Datastore Owner`, or`Cloud Datastore Bulk Admin`**Note:** TheseDatastoreroles also grant permissions inCloud Firestore.

### Set up`gcloud`for your project

You can initiate bulk delete operations through the Google Cloud console or the`gcloud`command-line tool. To use`gcloud`, set up the command-line tool and connect to your project in one of the following ways:

- Access`gcloud`from the Google Cloud console using[Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/).

  [StartCloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

  Make sure`gcloud`is configured for the correct project:  

      gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]

- [Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

## Bulk delete data

A bulk delete operation first finds all applicable documents in your database and deletes them in batches. You may still query or read these documents while the results may vary based on the progress made. Bulk delete doesn't delete any documents added or modified after the operation starts.
| **Note:** If you plan to delete all documents in the database, see the[database deletion feature](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/create-databases#delete-database)instead.

### Bulk delete specific collection groups

### gcloud

To bulk delete specific collection groups, use the[`--collection-ids`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/firestore/bulk-delete#FLAGS)flag. The operation deletes only the collection groups with the given IDs.

<br />

```
gcloud firestore bulk-delete \
--collection-ids=[COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_1_OR_KIND_1],[COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_2_OR_KIND_2],[SUBCOLLECTION_GROUP_ID_1_OR_KIND_3] \
--database=[DATABASE]
```

## Manage bulk delete operations

After you start a bulk delete operation, Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility assigns the operation a unique name. You can use the operation name to delete, cancel, or check the status of the operation.

Operation names are prefixed with`projects/[PROJECT_ID]/databases/[DATABASE_ID]/operations/`, for example:  

```
projects/my-project/databases/(default)/operations/ASA1MTAwNDQxNAgadGx1YWZlZAcSeWx0aGdpbi1zYm9qLW5pbWRhEgopEg
```

However, you can leave out the prefix when specifying an operation name for the`describe`,`cancel`, and`delete`commands.

### List all bulk delete operations

### gcloud

Use the[`operations list`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firestore/operations/list)command to see all running and recently completed operations, including bulk delete operations:  

```
gcloud firestore operations list
```

### Check operation status

### gcloud

Use the[`operations describe`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firestore/operations/describe)command to show the status of a bulk delete operation.  

```
gcloud firestore operations describe [OPERATION_NAME]
```

#### Estimate the completion time

A request for the status of a long-running operation returns the metrics`workEstimated`and`workCompleted`. Each of these metrics is returned in both number of bytes and number of documents:

- `workEstimated`shows the estimated total number of bytes and documents an operation will process. Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility might omit this metric if it can't make an estimate.

- `workCompleted`shows the number of bytes and documents deleted so far. After the operation completes, the value shows the total number of bytes and documents that were actually processed, which might be larger than the value of`workEstimated`.

Divide`workCompleted`by`workEstimated`for a rough progress estimate. This estimate might be inaccurate, because it depends on delayed statistics collection.

### Cancel an operation

### gcloud

Use the[`operations cancel`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firestore/operations/cancel)command to stop an operation in progress:  

```
gcloud firestore operations cancel [OPERATION_NAME]
```

Cancelling a running operation doesn't undo the operation. A cancelled bulk delete operation doesn't recover the deleted documents.

### Delete an operation

Use the[`gcloud firestore operations delete`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firestore/operations/delete)command to remove a completed operation from the list of recent operations. To cancel a running operation, use the earlier cancellation operation.  

```
gcloud firestore operations delete [OPERATION_NAME]
```

## Billing and pricing for bulk delete operations

You are required to enable billing for yourGoogle Cloudproject before you use the managed bulk delete service.

Note that Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility charges on the actual work done. If the operation is cancelled or failed due to user error, you will be charged with progress made. Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility won't charge reads or deletes for the documents that are not eventually deleted, such as documents that are modified after the delete operation started. The cost will be attributed on the day of operation completion.

Bulk delete operations doesn't trigger your[Google Cloudbudget](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)alerts until after completion. Similarly, reads and deletes performed during a bulk delete operation are applied to your free tier usage after the operation is complete. Bulk delete operations don't affect the usage shown in the usage section of the console.

### View bulk delete costs

Bulk delete operations apply the`goog-firestoremanaged:bulkdelete`label to billed operations. In the[Cloud Billing reports page](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/reports#getting_started), you can use this label to view costs related to bulk delete operations.
