# Source: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/move-data.md.txt

This page describes how to use the managed import and export features
to move Cloud Firestore data from one
project to another. This can be useful for setting up a development environment
or as part of permanently migrating an app to another project.
The example on this page demonstrates how to export data from a
source project and then import that data into a destination project. Moving data
between projects involves the following steps:

1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket to hold the data from your source project.
2. Export the data from your source project to the bucket.
3. Give your destination project permission to read from the bucket.
4. Import the data from the bucket into your destination project.

## Before you begin

Before you can use the managed export and import service, you must complete the
following tasks:

1. [Enable
   billing for both your source project and
   destination project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project) Only Google Cloud projects with billing enabled can use the export and import functionality.

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Note:** Firebase projects must be on the [Blaze plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/?authuser=0) to use the managed export and import service. Enabling billing for the Google Cloud automatically upgrades your Firebase project to the Blaze plan.

2. Make sure your account has the necessary Cloud IAM
   permissions in your source project and
   destination project.
   **If you are a project owner for both projects, your account has the required
   permissions.** Otherwise, the following Cloud IAM roles
   grant the necessary permissions for Cloud Firestore
   export and import operations:


   `Owner`, `Cloud Datastore Owner`, or `Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin`

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Note:** These roles grant permissions for both Datastore and Cloud Firestore.

   A project owner can grant one of these roles by following the
   steps in
   [Grant access](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant_access).
3. Set up the `gcloud` command-line tool and connect to your project
   in one of the following ways:

   - Access `gcloud` from the Google Cloud console using
     [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/).


     [Start Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

     Make sure `gcloud` is configured for the correct project:

     ```
     gcloud config set project [SOURCE_PROJECT_ID]
     ```
   - [Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)

4.
   Set up indexes in your new project. The composite indexes should match
   between the source and destination projects. Indexes should be set up
   first to avoid having to process each document multiple times.

## Export data from the source project

Export your data by creating a Cloud Storage bucket for your
Cloud Firestore export files and starting an export operation.

### Create a Cloud Storage bucket

[Create a
Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the same location as your Cloud Firestore
database. To view your database location, see your
[project location setting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#project_location_setting).
You cannot use a Requester Pays bucket for export and import operations.

**If your Cloud Storage bucket is not in your
source project** , you must give the source project's
default service account access to the bucket. Each Google Cloud project
has an automatically created default service account with the name `PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. Cloud Firestore
export operations use this default service account to authorize Cloud Storage
bucket operations. To give the
default service account access to your source bucket, grant it the
[`Storage Admin`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles)
role.

You can grant this role with the
[`gsutil` tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
available in Cloud Shell:


[Start Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

```
gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:[service-PROJECT_NUMBER]@gcp-sa-firestore.iam.gserviceaccount.com :roles/storage.admin\
gs://[BUCKET_NAME]@
```

You can also [grant this role in the Google Cloud console](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).

### Disable write operations (optional)

If your app continues to write to your database while you perform an export
operation, you might not capture all of those writes in your export files. To
export data from a consistent state, disable writes to your database by updating
your security rules and halting any Admin SDK operations.

1. Update security rules

   In the Cloud Firestore
   [**Rules** tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/rules)
   of the console, update your source project security rules to deny all
   writes. For example:

         // Deny write access to all users under any conditions
         service cloud.firestore {
           match /databases/{database}/documents {
             match /{document=**} {
               allow write: if false;
             }
             // Reads do not affect export operations
             // Add your read rules here
           }
         }

2. Halt writes from Admin SDKs

   Security rules do not stop writes coming from privileged server
   environments created using a [Firebase Admin
   SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) or a [Google Cloud
   Server Client
   Library](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers).
   Make sure to halt write operations from your admin servers by
   shutting down or updating your servers.

### Begin an export operation

Use the `gcloud firestore export` command to export
data from your source project. You can export all your data or only
specific collection groups. Replace `[SOURCE_BUCKET]` with the name of your
Cloud Storage bucket:

Export all data
:

    ```
    gcloud firestore export gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET] --async
    ```

Export specific collection groups
:

    ```
    gcloud firestore export gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET] --collection-ids=[COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_1],[COLLECTION_GROUP_ID_2] --async
    ```

Take note of your export operation's `outputURIPrefix` as you will use
this later on. By default, Cloud Firestore adds a pre-fix to your export
files based on a timestamp:

    outputUriPrefix: gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/2019-03-05T20:58:23_56418

As the export operation runs, you can use the `firestore operations list`
command to view your operation's progress:

```
gcloud firestore operations list
```

## Import data into the destination project

Next, give the destination project access to your
Cloud Firestore data files and start an import operation.

### Give the destination project access to your data files

Before you can begin an import operation, you must
make sure your destination project can access your Cloud Firestore
data files.

#### Move data files to a local bucket

If your source bucket location is different from the
Cloud Firestore location of your destination project, you must move
your data files to a Cloud Storage bucket in the same
location as your destination project.

Move your data files to another Cloud Storage bucket by following the steps
in [Moving and Renaming Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/moving-buckets).
For all the following steps, use this new bucket as the `[SOURCE_BUCKET]`.

#### Give the project service account access to your source bucket

If your source bucket is not in your destination project, then you must give the
destination project's default service account access to your source bucket. The
default service account is named
`[DESTINATION_PROJECT_ID]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. To
give the default service account access to your source bucket, grant it the
proper permissions to access the bucket.

You can grant the necessary roles with the
[`gsutil` tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil)
available in Cloud Shell:


[Start Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/?cloudshell=true)

```
gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:[DESTINATION_PROJECT_ID]@appspot.gserviceaccount.com:legacyBucketReader,legacyObjectReader \
gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]
```

You can also [grant this role in the Google Cloud console](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).

### Begin an import operation

Before starting the import operation, make sure `gcloud` is configured
for the correct project:

```
gcloud config set project [DESTINATION_PROJECT_ID]
```

Use the `gcloud firestore import` command to import the data in
your source bucket into your destination project:

```
gcloud firestore import gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/[EXPORT_PREFIX] --async
```

Where `[EXPORT_PREFIX]` matches the prefix in your export operation's
`outputUriPrefix`. For example:

```
gcloud firestore import gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/2019-03-05T20:58:23_56418 --async
```

As the export operation runs, you can use the `firestore operations list`
command to view your operation's progress:

```
gcloud firestore operations list
```
