## Description

Add new fields to the documents produced by the previous stage.

The generated documents will contain all the fields from the previous stage
along with all newly added fields, overwriting any field that shares the same
name from the previous document.

## Syntax

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/users")
      .addFields(field('first_name').concat(' ', field('last_name')).as('full_name'))
      .execute();

## Client examples

### Web

```javascript
const result = await execute(db.pipeline()
  .collection("books")
  .select(field("soldBooks").add(field("unsoldBooks")).as("totalBooks"))
);
```

##### Swift

```swift
let result = try await db.pipeline()
  .collection("books")
  .select([Field("soldBooks").add(Field("unsoldBooks")).as("totalBooks")])
  .execute()
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val result = db.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .select(Expression.add(field("soldBooks"), field("unsoldBooks")).alias("totalBooks"))
    .execute()
```

### Java

```java
Task<Pipeline.Snapshot> result = db.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .select(Expression.add(field("soldBooks"), field("unsoldBooks")).alias("totalBooks"))
    .execute();
```

##### Python

```python
from google.cloud.firestore_v1.pipeline_expressions import Field

result = (
    client.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .select(Field.of("soldBooks").add(Field.of("unsoldBooks")).as_("totalBooks"))
    .execute()
)
```

##### Java

```java
Pipeline.Snapshot result =
    firestore
        .pipeline()
        .collection("books")
        .select(add(field("soldBooks"), field("unsoldBooks")).as("totalBooks"))
        .execute()
        .get();
```

## Behavior

### Overlapping Fields

Assigning an expression an alias that is already in the documents from the
previous stage will cause the `add_fields(...)` stage to overwrite the previous
field.

This can be used to chain up multiple expressions over the same field name, like:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/users")
      .addFields(field('age').abs().as('age'))
      .addFields(field('age').add(10).as('age'))
      .execute();

### Nesting Fields

While the alias assigned to the newly added fields can contain special
characters like `.`, these are treated as top-level fields. For example:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/users")
      .addFields(field('address.city').toLower().as('address.city'))
      .execute();

adds a new top-level field `address.city` rather than merging the result of
the expression back into the nested map under `address`.
