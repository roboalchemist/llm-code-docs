# Firebase App Indexing

FirebaseApp Indexingis no longer the recommended way of indexing content for display as suggested results in Google Search App. This page points to other useful Google developer products.

## Android

| **Caution:** The Google Search App for Android no longer uses local content indexed via Firebase App Indexing to provide results to users.

[Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)are the recommended way of linking users directly from search results, websites and other apps to specific content within your app.
