While you can use[theApp Prototyping agent](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/get-started-ai)to automatically create a new app prototype with theGemini API, you can also launch a blank canvas with the[GeminiDeveloper API](https://ai.google.dev/)through one click of a button. Start using the latest generative AI models from Google in your app with a template that includes all theGemini APIinfrastructure you need. All you need to do is add your[Gemini APIkey](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup)and get coding!
