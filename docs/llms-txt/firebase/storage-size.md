This page describes the storage size of documents, fields, and index entries in Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility.

You can learn about the costs of this storage at the[Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)page.

## String size

String sizes are calculated as the number of[UTF-8 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)bytes + 1.

The following are stored as strings:

- Collection name
- Field names
- String field values (including`_id`)

For example:

- The collection name`tasks`uses 5 bytes + 1 byte, for a total of 6 bytes.
- The field name`description`uses 11 bytes + 1 byte, for a total of 12 bytes.

## Field value size

The following table shows the size of field values by type.

|         Type          |                                                  Size                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array                 | The sum of the sizes of its values                                                                      |
| Boolean               | 1 byte                                                                                                  |
| Binary data           | Byte length + 1 for a non-generic (non-0) subtype                                                       |
| Date                  | 8 bytes                                                                                                 |
| Double                | 8 bytes                                                                                                 |
| Double128             | 16 bytes                                                                                                |
| 32-bit integer        | 4 bytes                                                                                                 |
| 64-bit integer (long) | 8 bytes                                                                                                 |
| Object                | The sum of the string sizes of each field name and the sizes of each field falue in the embedded object |
| Min Key               | 1 byte                                                                                                  |
| Max Key               | 1 byte                                                                                                  |
| Null                  | 1 byte                                                                                                  |
| Regular expression    | (Pattern length + 1) + (Options length + 1)                                                             |
| Timestamp             | 8 bytes                                                                                                 |
| String                | Number of UTF-8 encoded bytes + 1                                                                       |

For example, a boolean field named`done`would use 6 bytes:

- 5 bytes for the`done`field name
- 1 byte for the boolean value

## Document size

The size of a document is the sum of:

- The[string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/storage-size#string-size)of the collection name
- The sum of the[string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/storage-size#string-size)of each field name (except`_id`)
- The sum of the size of each[field value](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/storage-size#field-size)(including`_id`)
- 48 additional bytes

This example is for a document in collection`tasks`:  

    {
      "_id": "my_task_id",
      "type": "Personal",
      "done": false,
      "priority": 1,
      "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
    }

The total size of the fields is 78 bytes:

|           Field name and value           |                       Field size in bytes                        |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"_id": "my_task_id"`                    | 11 for the field's string value                                  |
| `"type": "Personal"`                     | 14 5 for the field name + 9 for the field's string value         |
| `"done": false`                          | 6 5 for the field name + 1 for the field's boolean value         |
| `"priority": 1`                          | 17 9 for the field name + 4 for the field's 32-bit integer value |
| `"description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"` | 34 12 for the field name + 22 for the field's string value       |

So the document size is 6 + 78 + 48 = 132 bytes:

- 6 for the collection name
- 78 bytes for the fields
- 48 additional bytes

## Index entry size

The size of an index entry in an index is the sum of:

- The[string size](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/storage-size#string-size)of the collection name
- The size of the`_id`field value
- The sum of the indexed[field values](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/storage-size#field-size)
- 48 additional bytes

Consider a document in the`tasks`collection:  

    {
      "_id": "my_task_id",
      "type": "Personal",
      "done": false,
      "priority": 1,
      "description": "Learn Cloud Firestore"
    }

For an index on the`done`and`priority`fields (both ascending), the total size of the index entry in this index is 70 bytes:

- 6 bytes for the collection name`tasks`
- 11 bytes for the`_id`field value
- 1 byte for the boolean field value
- 4 bytes for the 32-bit integer field value
- 48 additional bytes

For sparse indexes, if a document doesn't include any of the fields, then no index entry is created. If a document contains at least one of the indexed fields, an index entry is created with absent indexed fields set to`NULL`.
