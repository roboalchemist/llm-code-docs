TheFirebaseCLI ([GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)) provides a variety of tools for managing, viewing, and deploying to Firebase projects.

**Before using theFirebaseCLI,[set up a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides).**

## Set up or update the CLI

### Install theFirebaseCLI

You can install theFirebaseCLI using a method that matches your operating system, experience level, and/or use case. Regardless of how you install the CLI, you have access to the same functionality and the`firebase`command.

[Windows](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-windows)[macOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux)[Linux](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install-cli-mac-linux)

#### **Windows**

You can install theFirebaseCLI for Windows using one of the following options:

|      **Option**       |                                                             **Description**                                                             |                                  **Recommended for...**                                  |

| **npm**               | Use npm (the Node Package Manager) to install the CLI and enable the globally available`firebase`command.                               | Developers using[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)                                       |

### standalone binary

To download and run the binary for theFirebaseCLI, follow these steps:

1. Download the[FirebaseCLI binary for Windows](https://firebase.tools/bin/win/instant/latest).

2. Access the binary to open a shell where you can run the`firebase`command.

3. Continue to[log in and test the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

### npm

To use`npm`(the Node Package Manager) to install theFirebaseCLI, follow these steps:

1. Install[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)using[nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)(the Node Version Manager). Installing Node.js automatically installs the`npm`command tools.

   | **Note:** TheFirebaseCLI requires**Node.js v18.0.0 or later**. Some Firebase features might require specific versions of Node.js, so check each Firebase product's getting started page for any specific Node.js requirements.
2. Install theFirebaseCLI via`npm`by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

   This command enables the globally available`firebase`command.
   | **Note:** If the`npm install -g firebase-tools`command fails, you might need to[change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
3. Continue to[log in and test the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

#### **macOS or Linux**

You can install theFirebaseCLI for macOS or Linux using one of the following options:

|          **Option**          |                                                                        **Description**                                                                         |                                                                         **Recommended for...**                                                                         |

### auto install script

To install theFirebaseCLI using the automatic install script, follow these steps:

1. Run the following cURL command:

   ```
   curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
   ```

   This script automatically detects your operating system, downloads the latestFirebaseCLI release, then enables the globally available`firebase`command.
   | **Note:** If you experience permission issues when installing on MacOS or Linux, you might need to use`sudo`to grant the script the required permissions:`sudo curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash`
2. Continue to[log in and test the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

For more examples and details about the automatic install script, refer to the script's source code at[firebase.tools](https://firebase.tools/).

### standalone binary

To download and run the binary for theFirebaseCLI that's specific for your OS, follow these steps:

1. Download theFirebaseCLI binary for your OS:[macOS](https://firebase.tools/bin/macos/latest)\|[Linux](https://firebase.tools/bin/linux/latest)

2. *(Optional)* Set up the globally available`firebase`command.

   1. Make the binary executable by running`chmod +x ./firebase_tools`.
   2. [Add the binary's path to your PATH.](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/26059)

   | **Note:** If you choose not to set up the`firebase`command, you'll need to access the binary each time you want to run aFirebaseCLI command.
3. Continue to[log in and test the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

### npm

To use`npm`(the Node Package Manager) to install theFirebaseCLI, follow these steps:

1. Install[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)using[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md)(the Node Version Manager).  
   Installing Node.js automatically installs the`npm`command tools.

   | **Note:** TheFirebaseCLI requires**Node.js v18.0.0 or later**. Some Firebase features might require specific versions of Node.js, so check each Firebase product's getting started page for any specific Node.js requirements.
2. Install theFirebaseCLI via`npm`by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

   This command enables the globally available`firebase`command.
   | **Note:** If the`npm install -g firebase-tools`command fails, you might need to[change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
3. Continue to[log in and test the CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#sign-in-test-cli).

### Log in and test theFirebaseCLI

After installing the CLI, you must authenticate. Then you can confirm authentication by listing your Firebase projects.

1. Log into Firebase using your Google account by running the following command:

   ```
   firebase login
   ```

   This command connects your local machine to Firebase and grants you access to your Firebase projects.
   | **Note:** The`firebase login`command opens a web page that connects to`localhost`on your machine. If you're using a remote machine and don't have access to`localhost`, run the command with the flag`--no-localhost`.
   | **Note:** You can also[use theFirebaseCLI with CI systems](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#cli-ci-systems).
2. Test that the CLI is properly installed and accessing your account by listing your Firebase projects. Run the following command:

   ```
   firebase projects:list
   ```

   The displayed list should be the same as the Firebase projects listed in the[Firebaseconsole](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Update to the latest CLI version

Generally, you want to use the most up-to-dateFirebaseCLI version.
| In many cases, new features and bug fixes are available only with the latest version of theFirebaseCLI. It's a good practice to frequently update the CLI to its latest version.

How you update the CLI version depends on your operating system and how you installed the CLI.  

### Windows

- **standalone binary** :[Download the new version](https://firebase.tools/bin/win/instant/latest), then replace it on your system
- **npm** : Run`npm install -g firebase-tools`

### macOS

- **automatic install script** : Run`curl -sL https://firebase.tools | upgrade=true bash`

  | **Note:** If you experience permission issues when installing on MacOS or Linux, you might need to use`sudo`to grant the script the required permissions:`sudo curl -sL https://firebase.tools | upgrade=true bash`
- **standalone binary** :[Download the new version](https://firebase.tools/bin/macos/latest), then replace it on your system

- **npm** : Run`npm install -g firebase-tools`

### Linux

- **automatic install script** : Run`curl -sL https://firebase.tools | upgrade=true bash`

  | **Note:** If you experience permission issues when installing on MacOS or Linux, you might need to use`sudo`to grant the script the required permissions:`sudo curl -sL https://firebase.tools | upgrade=true bash`
- **standalone binary** :[Download the new version](https://firebase.tools/bin/linux/latest), then replace it on your system

- **npm** : Run`npm install -g firebase-tools`

### Uninstall theFirebaseCLI

How you uninstall the CLI depends on your operating system and how you installed the CLI.  

### Windows

- **standalone binary** : Delete the`firebase.exe`binary that you downloaded.
- **npm** : Run`npm uninstall -g firebase-tools`

### macOS

- **automatic install script** : Run`curl -sL https://firebase.tools | uninstall=true bash`

  | **Note:** If you experience permission issues when uninstalling on MacOS or Linux, you might need to use`sudo`to grant the script the required permissions:`sudo curl -sL https://firebase.tools | uninstall=true bash`
- **standalone binary** : Delete the`firebase`binary that you downloaded. If you added its location to your`PATH`environment variable, be sure to remove it.

- **npm** : Run`npm uninstall -g firebase-tools`

### Linux

- **automatic install script** : Run`curl -sL https://firebase.tools | uninstall=true bash`

  | **Note:** If you experience permission issues when uninstalling on MacOS or Linux, you might need to use`sudo`to grant the script the required permissions:`sudo curl -sL https://firebase.tools | uninstall=true bash`
- **standalone binary** : Delete the`firebase`binary that you downloaded. If you added its location to your`PATH`environment variable, be sure to remove it.

- **npm** : Run`npm uninstall -g firebase-tools`

### Use the CLI with CI systems

We recommend that you authenticate using Application Default Credentials when using the CLI with CI systems.

#### *(Recommended)*Use Application Default Credentials

TheFirebaseCLI will detect and use Application Default Credentials if they're set. The simplest way to authenticate the CLI in CI and other headless environments is to[set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

#### *(Legacy)* Use`FIREBASE_TOKEN`

Alternatively, you can authenticate using`FIREBASE_TOKEN`. This is less secure than Application Default Credentials and is no longer recommended.

1. On a machine with a browser,[install theFirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli).

2. Start the signin process by running the following command:

   ```
   firebase login:ci
   ```
3. Visit the URL provided, then log in using a Google account.

4. Print a new[refresh token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2). The current CLI session will not be affected.

5. Store the output token in a secure but accessible way in your CI system.

6. Use this token when running`firebase`commands. You can use either of the following two options:

   - **Option 1:** Store the token as the environment variable`FIREBASE_TOKEN`. Your system will automatically use the token.

   - **Option 2:** Run all`firebase`commands with the`--token `<var translate="no">TOKEN</var>flag in your CI system.  
     This is the order of precedence for token loading: flag, environment variable, desired Firebase project.

| **Note:** On any machine with theFirebaseCLI installed, you can immediately revoke access for the specified token by running the following command:`firebase logout --token `<var translate="no">TOKEN</var>

## Initialize a Firebase project

Many common tasks performed using the CLI, such as deploying to a Firebase project, require a**project directory** . You establish a project directory using the`firebase init`command. A project directory is usually the same directory as your source control root, and after running`firebase init`, the directory contains a[`firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#the_firebasejson_file)configuration file.

To initialize a new Firebase project, run the following command from within your app's directory:  

```
firebase init
```
| **Note:** The`firebase init`command does not create a new directory. If you're starting a new app, you must first make a directory, then run`firebase init`from within that directory.

The`firebase init`command steps you through setting up your project directory and some Firebase products. During project initialization, theFirebaseCLI asks you to complete the following tasks:

- Select a default Firebase project.

  This step associates the current project directory with a Firebase project so that project-specific commands (like`firebase deploy`) run against the appropriate Firebase project.

  It's also possible to[associate multiple Firebase projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#project_aliases)(such as a staging project and a production project) with the same project directory.
- Select desired Firebase products to set up in your Firebase project.

  This step prompts you to set configurations for specific files for the selected products. For more details on these configurations, refer to the specific product's documentation (for example,[Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#initialize)). Note that you can always run`firebase init`later to set up more Firebase products.

At the end of initialization, Firebase automatically creates the following two files at the root of your local app directory:

- A[`firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#the_firebasejson_file)configuration file that lists your project configuration.

- A`.firebaserc`file that stores your project[aliases](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#project_aliases).

### The`firebase.json`file

The[`firebase init`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#initialize_a_firebase_project)command creates a`firebase.json`configuration file in the root of your project directory.

The`firebase.json`file is required to[deploy assets with theFirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deployment)because it specifies which files and settings from your project directory are deployed to your Firebase project. Since some settings can be defined in either your project directory or theFirebaseconsole, make sure that you resolve any potential[deployment conflicts](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deployment_conflicts).

You can[configure mostFirebase Hostingoptions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config)directly in the`firebase.json`file. However, for other[Firebase services that can be deployed with theFirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deployment), the`firebase init`command creates specific files where you can define settings for those services, such as an`index.js`file forCloud Functions. You can also set up[predeploy or postdeploy hooks](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#hooks)in the`firebase.json`file.
| **Note:** If you run`firebase init`again for any Firebase service, the command will overwrite the corresponding section of the`firebase.json`file back to the default configuration for that service.

The following is an example`firebase.json`file with default settings if you selectFirebase Hosting,Cloud Firestore, andCloud Functions for Firebase(with TypeScript source and lint options selected) during initialization.  

    {
      "hosting": {
        "public": "public",
        "ignore": [
          "firebase.json",
          "**/.*",
          "**/node_modules/**"
        ]
      },
      "firestore": {
          "rules": "firestore.rules",
          "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
      },
      "functions": {
        "predeploy": [
          "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run lint",
          "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run build"
        ]
      }
    }

While`firebase.json`is used by default, you can pass the`--config `<var translate="no">PATH</var>flag to specify an alternate configuration file.

#### Configuration for multipleCloud Firestoredatabases

When you run`firebase init`, your`firebase.json`file will contain a single`firestore`key corresponding to your project's default database, as shown above.

If your project contains multipleCloud Firestoredatabases, edit your`firebase.json`file to associate differentCloud FirestoreSecurity Rulesand database index source files with each database. Modify the file with a JSON array, with one entry for each database.  

          "firestore": [
            {
              "database": "(default)",
              "rules": "firestore.default.rules",
              "indexes": "firestore.default.indexes.json"
            },
            {
              "database": "ecommerce",
              "rules": "firestore.ecommerce.rules",
              "indexes": "firestore.ecommerce.indexes.json"
            }
          ],

#### Cloud Functionsfiles to ignore on deploy

At function deployment time, the CLI automatically specifies a list of files in the`functions`directory to ignore. This prevents deploying to the backend extraneous files that could increase the data size of your deployment.

The list of files ignored by default, shown in JSON format, is:  

    "ignore": [
      ".git",
      ".runtimeconfig.json",
      "firebase-debug.log",
      "firebase-debug.*.log",
      "node_modules"
    ]

If you add your own custom values for`ignore`in`firebase.json`, make sure that you keep (or add, if it is missing) the list of files shown above.

## Manage project aliases

You can associate multiple Firebase projects with the same project directory. For example, you might want to use one Firebase project for staging and another for production. By using different project environments, you can verify changes before deploying to production. The`firebase use`command allows you to switch between aliases as well as create new aliases.

### Add a project alias

When you select a Firebase project during[project initialization](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#initialize_a_firebase_project), the project is automatically assigned the alias of`default`. However, to allow project-specific commands to run against a different Firebase project but still use the*same*project directory, run the following command from within your project directory:  

```
firebase use --add
```

This command prompts you to select another Firebase project and assign the project as alias. Alias assignments are written to a`.firebaserc`file inside your project directory.

### Use project aliases

To use assigned Firebase project aliases, run any of the following commands from within your project directory.

|                               Command                                |                                                                      Description                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `firebase use`                                                       | View a list of currently defined aliases for your project directory                                                                                   |
| `firebase use \` <var translate="no">PROJECT_ID|ALIAS</var>          | Directs all commands to run against the specified Firebase project. The CLI uses this project as the currently "active project".                      |
| `firebase use --clear`                                               | Clears the active project. Run`firebase use `<var translate="no">PROJECT_ID|ALIAS</var>to set a new active project before running other CLI commands. |
| `firebase use \` `--unalias `<var translate="no">PROJECT_ALIAS</var> | Removes an alias from your project directory.                                                                                                         |

You can override what's being used as the currently active project by passing the`--project`flag with any CLI command. As an example: You can set your CLI to run against a Firebase project that you've assigned the`staging`alias. If you want to run a single command against the Firebase project that you've assigned the`prod`alias, then you can run, for example,firebase deploy --project=prod.

### Source control and project aliases

In general, you should check your`.firebaserc`file into source control to allow your team to share project aliases. However, for open source projects or starter templates, you should generally not check in your`.firebaserc`file.

If you have a development project that's for your use only, you can either pass the`--project`flag with each command or run`firebase use `<var translate="no">PROJECT_ID</var>without assigning an alias to the Firebase project.

## Serve and test your Firebase project locally

You can view and test your Firebase project on locally hosted URLs before deploying to production. If you only want to test select features, you can use a comma-separated list in a flag on the`firebase serve`command.

Run the following command from the root of your local project directory if you want to do either of the following tasks:

- View the static content for your Firebase-hosted app.
- UseCloud Functionsto[generate dynamic content forFirebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/functions)and you want to use your*production (deployed)* HTTP functions to emulateHostingon a local URL.

```
firebase serve --only hosting
```

#### Emulate your project using*local*HTTP functions

Run any of the following commands from your project directory to emulate your project using*local*HTTP functions.

- To emulate HTTP functions and hosting for testing on local URLs, use either of the following commands:

  ```
  firebase serve
  ```  

  ```text
  firebase serve --only functions,hosting // uses a flag
  ```
- To emulate HTTP functions only, use the following command:

  ```
  firebase serve --only functions
  ```

#### Test from other local devices

By default,`firebase serve`only responds to requests from`localhost`. This means that you'll be able to access your hosted content from your computer's web browser but not from other devices on your network. If you'd like to test from other local devices, use the`--host`flag, like so:  

```text
firebase serve --host 0.0.0.0  // accepts requests to any host
```

## Deploy to a Firebase project

TheFirebaseCLI manages deployment of code and assets to your Firebase project, including:

- New releases of yourFirebase Hostingsites
- New, updated, or existingCloud Functions for Firebase
- New or updated schemas and connectors forFirebase Data Connect
- Rules forFirebase Realtime Database
- Rules forCloud Storage for Firebase
- Rules forCloud Firestore
- Indexes forCloud Firestore

To deploy to a Firebase project, run the following command from your project directory:  

```
firebase deploy
```

You can optionally add a comment to each of your deployments. This comment will display with the other deployment information on your project's[Firebase Hostingpage](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/hosting/main). For example:  

```text
firebase deploy -m "Deploying the best new feature ever."
```

When you use the`firebase deploy`command, be aware of the following:

- To deploy resources from a project directory, the project directory**must** have a[`firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#the_firebasejson_file)file. This file is automatically created for you by the[`firebase init`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#initialize_a_firebase_project)command.

- By default,`firebase deploy`creates a release for*all* deployable resources in your project directory. To deploy specific Firebase services or features,[use partial deployment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys).

### Deployment conflicts for security rules

ForFirebase Realtime Database,Cloud Storage for Firebase, andCloud Firestore, you can define security rules either in your local project directory or in the[Firebaseconsole](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
| **Note:** **When you[deploy security rules using theFirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/#deployment), the rules defined in your project directory overwrite any existing rules in theFirebaseconsole.** So, if you choose to define or edit your security rules using theFirebaseconsole, make sure that you also update the rules defined in your project directory.

Another option to avoid deployment conflicts is to[use partial deployment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys)and only define rules in theFirebaseconsole.

### Deployment quotas

It's possible (though unlikely) that you might exceed a quota that limits the rate or volume of your Firebase deployment operations. For example, when deploying very large numbers of functions, you might receive an`HTTP 429 Quota`error message. To solve such issues, try[using partial deployment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys).

### Roll back a deployment

You can roll back aFirebase Hostingdeployment from your project's[Firebase Hostingpage](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/hosting/main)by selecting the**Rollback**action for the desired release.

It's not currently possible to roll back releases of security rules forFirebase Realtime Database,Cloud Storage for Firebase, orCloud Firestore.

### Deploy specific Firebase services

If you only want to deploy specific Firebase services or features, you can use a comma-separated list in a flag on the`firebase deploy`command. For example, the following command deploysFirebase Hostingcontent andCloud Storagesecurity rules.  

```

| `--only functions`   | Cloud Functions for Firebase([more specific versions of this flag](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deploy_specific_functions)are possible) |

| **Note:** The`--only rules`syntax used by older versions of the CLI is deprecated.

### Deploy specific functions

When deploying functions, you can target specific functions. For example:  

```
firebase deploy --only functions:function1
```  

```
firebase deploy --only functions:function1,functions:function2
```

Another option is to group functions into export groups in your`/functions/index.js`file. Grouping functions allows you to deploy multiple functions using a single command.

For example, you can write the following functions to define a`groupA`and a`groupB`:  

    var functions = require('firebase-functions/v1');

    exports.groupA = {
      function1: functions.https.onRequest(...),
      function2: functions.database.ref('\path').onWrite(...)
    }
    exports.groupB = require('./groupB');

In this example, a separate**`functions/groupB.js`** file contains additional functions that specifically define the functions in`groupB`. For example:  

    var functions = require('firebase-functions/v1');

    exports.function3 = functions.storage.object().onChange(...);
    exports.function4 = functions.analytics.event('in_app_purchase').onLog(...);

In this example, you can deploy all the`groupA`functions by running the following command from your project directory:  

```
firebase deploy --only functions:groupA
```

Or you can target a specific function within a group by running the following command:  

```
firebase deploy --only functions:groupA.function1,groupB.function4
```
| **Important:** To avoid running to quota errors and other server errors, limit function group size to 10 or fewer for each deployment operation.

### Delete functions

TheFirebaseCLI supports the following commands and options for deleting previously deployed functions:

- Deletes all functions that match the specified name in all regions:

  ```
  firebase functions:delete FUNCTION-1_NAME
  ```

  <br />

- Deletes a specified function running in a non-default region:

  ```
  firebase functions:delete FUNCTION-1_NAME --region REGION_NAME
  ```

  <br />

- Deletes more than one function:

  ```
  firebase functions:delete FUNCTION-1_NAME FUNCTION-2_NAME
  ```

  <br />

- Deletes a specified functions group:

  ```
  firebase functions:delete GROUP_NAME
  ```

  <br />

- Bypasses the confirmation prompt:

  ```
  firebase functions:delete FUNCTION-1_NAME --force
  ```

  <br />

### Set up predeploy and postdeploy scripted tasks

You can connect shell scripts to the`firebase deploy`command to perform predeploy or postdeploy tasks. For example, a predeploy script could transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript, and a postdeploy hook could notify administrators of new site content deploys toFirebase Hosting.

To set up predeploy or postdeploy hooks, add bash scripts to your[`firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#the_firebasejson_file)configuration file. You can define brief scripts directly in the`firebase.json`file, or you can reference other files that are in your project directory.

For example, the following script is the`firebase.json`expression for a postdeploy task that sends a Slack message upon successful deployment toFirebase Hosting.  

    "hosting": {
      // ...

      "postdeploy": "./messageSlack.sh 'Just deployed to Firebase Hosting'",
      "public": "public"
    }

The`messageSlack.sh`script file resides in the project directory and looks like this:  

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"$1"}'
     \https://SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
```

You can set up`predeploy`and`postdeploy`hooks for any of the[assets that you can deploy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#deployment). Note that running`firebase deploy`triggers*all* the predeploy and postdeploy tasks defined in your`firebase.json`file. To run only those tasks associated with a specific Firebase service,[use partial deployment commands](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#partial_deploys).

Both`predeploy`and`postdeploy`hooks print the standard output and error streams of the scripts to the terminal. For failure cases, note the following:

- If a predeploy hook fails to complete as expected, deployment is canceled.
- If deployment fails for any reason, postdeploy hooks are not triggered.

### Environment variables

Within scripts running in the predeploy and postdeploy hooks, the following environment variables are available:

- `$GCLOUD_PROJECT`: The active project's project ID
- `$PROJECT_DIR`: The root directory containing the`firebase.json`file
- `$RESOURCE_DIR`:*(For`hosting`and`functions`scripts only)* The location of the directory that contains theHostingorCloud Functionsresources to be deployed

## Manage multipleRealtime Databaseinstances

A Firebase project can have[multipleFirebase Realtime Databaseinstances](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding). By default, CLI commands interact with your*default*database instance.

However, you can interact with a non-default database instance by using the`--instance `<var translate="no">DATABASE_NAME</var>flag. The following commands support the`--instance`flag:

- `firebase database:get`
- `firebase database:profile`
- `firebase database:push`
- `firebase database:remove`
- `firebase database:set`
- `firebase database:update`

### Realtime Databasecommands

Note that you can create your initial, defaultRealtime Databaseinstance in theFirebaseconsole or by using the[general`firebase init`workflow](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#initialize_a_firebase_project)or the specific`firebase init database`flow.

Once instances are created, you can manage them as discussed in[Manage multipleRealtime Databaseinstances](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#manage_rtdb_shards).
