You can install (and[manage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions)) any of the officialFirebaseextensions using either theFirebaseconsole, the[FirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)(command-line interface), or using an autogenerated SDK.

Make sure to review the[differences](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#console-vs-cli)in the supported actions for each installation method.

<br />

| To try out aFirebase Extensionfor the first time, we recommend that you install the extension in a test or development project.

<br />

To install or manage extensions, you must be assigned one of these roles:[Owner or Editor](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/roles-basic)or[Firebase Admin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/roles-predefined-all-products).

To install an extension, your project must be on the**Blaze** (pay as you go) plan. Although there is no charge for installing an extension, you might be charged for your use of Firebase services or Cloud services such as[Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing), if your usage exceeds the services' free tier.

## Before you begin

If you haven't already,[add Firebase to your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides)and upgrade your Firebase project to the**Blaze**(pay as you go) plan.

## **Step 1**: View detailed information about an extension

This step is optional, but strongly recommended.

Before installing aFirebase Extension, we recommend that you review detailed information about the extension, including:

- How the extension works, any pre-installation tasks, and details about the extension
- General identifying information and description
- Whether the extension's tasks require a billing account
- Google services (APIs) and[access roles](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)required for operation
- [Resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#resources)created for the extension (like functions)
- Descriptions of user-configurable parameters

**To view an extension's detailed information:**

1. Browse officialFirebaseextensions in the[ExtensionsHub](https://extensions.dev/extensions).

2. Click an extension's card to:

   - Display the detailed information for the extension.

   - Find the link to the extension's source code in the[Firebase Extensionssource repository](https://github.com/firebase/extensions).

     In the extension's[*extension directory*](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#view-source-code), you can view this detailed information in the`README`.

## **Step 2**: Install an extension

During the installation process, you'll be prompted to review the basic specifications for the extension (such as APIs enabled,[resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#resources)created,[access](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)granted, etc.). You'll be notified of any billing requirements, and you'll also be prompted to specify values for the extension's configurable parameters.

1. Browse officialFirebaseextensions in the[ExtensionsHub](https://extensions.dev/extensions).

2. Click an extension's card, then review the detailed information for the extension, which can offer specific usage instructions and any pre-installation tasks.

3. Click**Install**, then follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension.

   | **Note:** Deploying and provisioning an extension may take the system 3-5 minutes.

## **Step 3**: Complete post-install setup

Some extensions have required or optional steps for you to complete before using them. Find these instructions in your extension's post-install details page in theExtensionsdashboard of theFirebaseconsole (the specific link to the dashboard is displayed in the terminal after installation).

You can also find these instructions in the`POSTINSTALL.md`file included in the[extension's source directory](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#view-source-code).

### Create Firebase resources

If you configured the extension to use Firebase resources (Cloud Firestorecollections,Realtime Databasepaths,Cloud Storagebuckets) that don't already exist, create them before using the extension.

### Create Eventarc event handlers

Some extensions publish to[Eventarc](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc)when important events happen during execution. If an extension publishes events, and you enabled events during installation, you can write functions that react to these events with your own custom logic. This can be useful, for example, to notify users when long-running tasks complete, or to post-process the output of an extension function.

See the extension's documentation for a list of events (if any) it publishes. For example, see the[event types for the Run Payments with Stripe extension](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/98c97775d54fb0be4601864b74d2fe5ce24dab83/firestore-stripe-payments/extension.yaml).

Then, see[Custom event triggers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/custom-events#handle-events)for information on writing Eventarc event handlers.
| **Important:** Enabling events can result in charges if you exceed the free quota. See[Eventarc pricing](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).

## Install multiple extension instances

You can install the same extension more than once in the same project. Each installed instance can have its own customized configuration and its own extension resources. You identify and refer to each installed instance using its*instance ID*, which is unique within your project.

You'll be prompted to confirm or edit the instance ID of each additional instance of the extension you install.

## Next Steps

- [View the details and the configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions?platform=console#view-details-installed-extension)of your installed extension in theFirebaseconsole.

- [Monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor)of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.

- Using theFirebaseconsole,[manage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions?platform=console)your installed extension. For officialFirebaseextensions, you can reconfigure or uninstall your extension, as well as update your extension to the latest version.

- As a best practice for all projects, make sure to set up[budget alerts](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/avoid-surprise-bills#set-up-budget-alert-emails)for your project and monitor your[*Usage and billing*dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/usage)in theFirebaseconsole.
