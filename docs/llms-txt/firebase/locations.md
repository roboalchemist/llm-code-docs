TheGemini Developer APIprovides global access to models, which means your request will be handled by an available model anywhere in the global pool.
| **Note:** This page is*not* about whether you as a developer or one of your end users in a region can access theGemini Developer API. Learn more about the[supported regions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/available-regions)and any relevant[use restrictions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#use-restrictions)for theGemini Developer API.  
|
| This page is about you*explicitly specifying the**location for the model**that you're accessing in your requests* (for example, to meet data residency requirements). If this feature is important to you, then consider using theVertex AIGemini APIto access generative models instead.
