While the easiest way to useCloud Firestoreis to use one of the native client libraries, there are some situations when it is useful to call the REST API directly.

The REST API can be helpful for the following use cases:

- AccessingCloud Firestorefrom a resource-constrained environment, such as an internet of things (IoT) device, where running a complete client library is not possible.
- Automating database administration or retrieving detailed database metadata.

If you are using a[gRPC-supported language](https://grpc.io/about/#osp), consider using the[RPC API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rpc/)rather than the REST API.

## Authentication and authorization

For authentication, theCloud FirestoreREST API accepts either a[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)ID token or a[Google Identity OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)token. The token you provide affects your request's authorization:

- Use Firebase ID tokens to authenticate requests from your application's users. For these requests,Cloud Firestoreuses[Cloud FirestoreSecurity Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started)to determine if a request is authorized.

- Use a Google Identity OAuth 2.0 token and a[service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)to authenticate requests from your application, such as requests for database administration. For these requests,Cloud Firestoreuses[Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview)to determine if a request is authorized.

### Working with Firebase ID tokens

You can attain a Firebase ID token in two ways:

- [Generate a Firebase ID token using theFirebase AuthenticationREST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth/).
- [Retrieve a user's Firebase ID token from aFirebase AuthenticationSDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients).

By retrieving a user's Firebase ID token, you can make requests on behalf of the user.

For requests authenticated with a Firebase ID token and for unauthenticated requests,Cloud Firestoreuses your[Cloud FirestoreSecurity Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started)to determine if a request is authorized.

### Working with Google Identity OAuth 2.0 tokens

You can generate an access token by using a[service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)with a[Google API Client Library](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/)or by following the steps in[Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount). You can also generate a token with the[`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)command-line tool and the command[`gcloud auth application-default print-access-token`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/print-access-token).

This token must have the following scope to send requests to theCloud FirestoreREST API:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore`

If you authenticate your requests with a service account and a Google Identity OAuth 2.0 token,Cloud Firestoreassumes that your requests act on behalf of your application instead of an individual user.Cloud Firestoreallows these requests to ignore your security rules. Instead,Cloud Firestoreuses[IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview)to determine if a request is authorized.

You can control the access permissions of service accounts by assigning[Cloud FirestoreIAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/security/iam#roles).

### Authenticating with an access token

After you obtain either a Firebase ID token or a Google Identity OAuth 2.0 token, pass it to theCloud Firestoreendpoints as an`Authorization`header set to`Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}`.

## Making REST calls

All REST API endpoints exist under the base URL`https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/`.

To create a path to a document with the ID`LA`in the collection`cities`under the project`YOUR_PROJECT_ID`you would use the following structure.  

    /projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)/documents/cities/LA

To interact with this path, combine it with the base API URL.  

    https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/databases/(default)/documents/cities/LA

The best way to begin experimenting with the REST API is to use the[API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/firestore/firestore/v1/), which automatically generates Google Identity OAuth 2.0 tokens and allows you to examine the API.

## Methods

Below are brief descriptions of the two most important method groups. For a complete list, see the[REST API reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/)or use the[API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/firestore/firestore/v1/).

#### `v1.projects.databases.documents`

Perform CRUD operations on documents, similar to those outlined in the[add data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data)or[get data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data)guides.

#### `v1.projects.databases.collectionGroups.indexes`

Perform actions on indexes such as creating new indexes, disabling an existing index, or listing all current indexes. Useful for automating data structure migrations or synchronizing indexes between projects.

Also enables retrieval of document metadata, such as the list of all fields and subcollections for a given document.

## Error Codes

When aCloud Firestorerequest succeeds, theCloud FirestoreAPI returns an HTTP`200 OK`status code and the requested data. When a request fails, theCloud FirestoreAPI returns an HTTP`4xx`or`5xx`status code and a response with information about the error.

The following table lists recommended actions for each error code. These codes apply to theCloud FirestoreREST and RPC APIs. The[Cloud FirestoreSDKs and client libraries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/client/libraries)may not return these same error codes.
