> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The Cloud Firestore emulator will be updated to require Java 21 in an upcoming release. Upgrade to Java 21 or later to continue using the latest version of the emulator.

Before connecting your app to the Cloud Firestore emulator, make sure that
you [understand the overall Firebase Local Emulator Suite workflow](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype?database=Firestore),
and that you [install and configure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure)
the Local Emulator Suite and review its [CLI commands](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#startup).

## Choose a Firebase project

The Firebase Local Emulator Suite emulates products for a single Firebase project.

To select the project to use, before you start the emulators, in the CLI run
`firebase use` in your working directory. Or, you can pass
the `--project` flag to each emulator
command.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** It's generally a good practice to use one project ID for all emulator invocations, so the Emulator Suite UI, different product emulators, and all running instances of a particular emulator can communicate correctly in all cases. In fact, by default, the Local Emulator Suite will warn on detecting multiple project IDs in use, though you can override this behavior. For guidance on setting and managing project IDs, see the [Installation and configuration guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#project_id_configuration).

Local Emulator Suite supports emulation of *real* Firebase projects and
*demo* projects.

| Project type | Features | Use with emulators |
|---|---|---|
| Real | A real Firebase project is one you created and configured (most likely via the Firebase console). Real projects have live resources, like database instances, storage buckets, functions, or any other resource you set up for that Firebase project. | When working with real Firebase projects, you can run emulators for any or all of the supported products. For any products you are not emulating, your apps and code will interact with the *live* resource (database instance, storage bucket, function, etc.). |
| Demo | A demo Firebase project has no *real* Firebase configuration and no live resources. These projects are usually accessed via codelabs or other tutorials. Project IDs for demo projects have the `demo-` prefix. | When working with demo Firebase projects, your apps and code interact with emulators *only*. If your app attempts to interact with a resource for which an emulator isn't running, that code will fail. |

We recommend you use demo projects wherever possible. Benefits include:

- Easier setup, since you can run the emulators without ever creating a Firebase project
- Stronger safety, since if your code accidentally invokes non-emulated (production) resources, there is no chance of data change, usage and billing
- Better offline support, since there is no need to access the internet to download your SDK configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** If you want to emulate cross-service interactions such as database-triggered Cloud Functions or Security Rules that rely on Authentication you must make sure that the project ID in your code (in `initializeApp()`, etc.) matches the project ID used by the Firebase CLI.

## Instrument your app to talk to the emulators

On startup, the Cloud Firestore emulator creates a default database and a named
database for each `firestore` configuration in your
[`firebase.json` file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#firestore-multiple-dbs).

Named databases are also created implicitly in response to any SDK or
REST API calls to the emulator that reference a specific database. Such
implicitly-created databases operate with [open rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/basics#cloud-firestore_1).

To work with your default and named databases interactively in the
Emulator Suite UI, in your browser's address bar, update the URL to select
either the default or a named database.

- For example, to browse the data in your default instance, update the URL to `localhost:4000/firestore/default/data`
- To browse in an instance named `ecommerce`, update to `localhost:4000/firestore/ecommerce/data`.

### Android, Apple platforms, and Web SDKs

Set up your in-app configuration or test classes to interact with
Cloud Firestore as follows. Note that in the following samples, app code
is connecting to the default project database. For examples involving additional
Cloud Firestore databases beyond the default database, refer to the
[guide for multiple databases](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-databases#access_a_named_database_with_a_client_library).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** The Cloud Firestore emulator clears database contents when shut down. Since the offline cache of the Firestore SDK is not automatically cleared, you may want to disable local persistence in your emulator configuration to avoid discrepancies between the emulated database and local caches; in the Web SDK, persistence is disabled by default.

##### Kotlin

```kotlin
// 10.0.2.2 is the special IP address to connect to the 'localhost' of
// the host computer from an Android emulator.
val firestore = Firebase.firestore
firestore.useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 8080)

firestore.firestoreSettings = firestoreSettings {
    isPersistenceEnabled = false
}
```

##### Java

```java
// 10.0.2.2 is the special IP address to connect to the 'localhost' of
// the host computer from an Android emulator.
FirebaseFirestore firestore = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
firestore.useEmulator("10.0.2.2", 8080);

FirebaseFirestoreSettings settings = new FirebaseFirestoreSettings.Builder()
        .setPersistenceEnabled(false)
        .build();
firestore.setFirestoreSettings(settings);
```

##### Swift

```swift
let settings = Firestore.firestore().settings
settings.host = "127.0.0.1:8080"
settings.cacheSettings = MemoryCacheSettings()
settings.isSSLEnabled = false
Firestore.firestore().settings = settingshttps://github.com/firebase/snippets-ios/blob/affc6b838d3dc3382ca741983dad489631d52b43/firestore/swift/firestore-smoketest/ViewController.swift#L1265-L1269
```

### Web

```javascript
import { getFirestore, connectFirestoreEmulator } from "firebase/firestore";

// firebaseApps previously initialized using initializeApp()
const db = getFirestore();
connectFirestoreEmulator(db, '127.0.0.1', 8080);
```

### Web

> [!NOTE]
> [Learn
> more](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#modular-version) about the tree-shakeable modular Web API and its advantages over the namespaced API.

```javascript
// Firebase previously initialized using firebase.initializeApp().
var db = firebase.firestore();
if (location.hostname === "localhost") {
  db.useEmulator("127.0.0.1", 8080);
}
```

No additional setup is needed to test Cloud Functions
[triggered by Firestore events](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events)
using the emulator. When the Firestore and Cloud Functions emulators are both
running, they automatically work together.

### Admin SDKs

The Firebase Admin SDKs automatically connect to the Cloud Firestore
emulator when the `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable is set:

    export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST="127.0.0.1:8080"

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** For emulators to work correctly the `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable must omit protocols such as `http://`.

If your code is running inside the Cloud Functions emulator your project ID
and other configuration are automatically set when calling `initializeApp`.

If you want your Admin SDK code to connect to a shared emulator running in
another environment, you need to specify the [the same project ID you set using the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_firestore#choose_a_firebase_project).
You can pass a project ID to `initializeApp` directly or set the
`GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable.

##### Node.js Admin SDK

```javascript
admin.initializeApp({ projectId: "your-project-id" });
```

##### Environment Variable

```
export GCLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
```

### Cloud Firestore REST API

The Cloud Firestore emulator provides a REST endpoint for interacting with your
database. All REST API calls should be made to the `http://localhost:8080/v1`
endpoint.

The full path for a REST call follows the pattern:

    http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}

For example, to list all documents in the `users` collection for the project
`my-project-id`, you can use `curl`:

    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/v1/projects/my-project-id/databases/(default)/documents/users"

## Clear your database between tests

Production Firestore provides no platform SDK method for flushing the database, but the Firestore emulator gives you a REST endpoint specifically for this purpose, which can be called from a test framework setup/tearDown step, from a test class, or from the shell (e.g., with `curl`) before a test is kicked off. You can use this approach as an alternative to simply shutting down the emulator process.

In an appropriate method, perform an HTTP DELETE operation, supplying your
Firebase projectID, for example `firestore-emulator-example`, to the following
endpoint:

    "http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/firestore-emulator-example/databases/(default)/documents"

Naturally, your code should await REST confirmation that the flush finished or failed.

You can perform this operation from the shell:

    // Shell alternative...
    $ curl -v -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/firestore-emulator-example/databases/(default)/documents"

Having implemented a step like this, you can sequence your tests and trigger
your functions with confidence that old data will be purged between runs and
you're using a fresh baseline test configuration.

## Import and export data

The database and Cloud Storage for Firebase emulators allow you to export data
from a running emulator instance. Define a baseline set of data to use in your
unit tests or continuous integration workflows, then export it to be shared
among the team.

    firebase emulators:export ./dir

In tests, on emulator startup, import the baseline data.

    firebase emulators:start --import=./dir

You can instruct the emulator to export data on shutdown, either specifying an
export path or simply using the path passed to the `--import`
flag.

    firebase emulators:start --import=./dir --export-on-exit

These data import and export options work with the
`firebase emulators:exec` command as well. For more, refer to the
[emulator command reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#startup).

## Visualize Security Rules activity

As you work through prototype and test loops, you can use visualization tools
and reports provided by the Local Emulator Suite.

### Use the Requests Monitor

The Cloud Firestore emulator lets you visualize client requests in
the Emulator Suite UI, including evaluation tracing for Firebase Security Rules.

Open the *Firestore \> Requests* tab to view the detailed evaluation
sequence for each request.

![Firestore Emulator Requests Monitor showing Security Rules evaluations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/images/firestore-emulator-request-monitor-rules.png)

### Visualize Rules evaluations reports

As you add Security Rules to your prototype you can debug them with
Local Emulator Suite debug tools.

After running a suite of tests, you can access test
coverage reports that show how each of your security rules was evaluated.

To get the reports, query an exposed endpoint on the emulator while
it's running. For a browser-friendly version, use the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/<database_name>:ruleCoverage.html
```

This breaks your rules into expressions and subexpressions that you can
mouseover for more information, including number of evaluations and values
returned. For the raw JSON version of this data, include the following URL
in your query:

```
http://localhost:8080/emulator/v1/projects/<database_name>:ruleCoverage
```

Here, the HTML version of the report highlights evaluations that throw undefined and null-value errors:

## How the Cloud Firestore emulator differs from production

The Cloud Firestore Emulator attempts to faithfully replicate the behavior
of the production service with some notable limitations.

### Multiple database support for Cloud Firestore

Currently, the Emulator Suite UI supports interactive creation, editing,
deletion, request monitoring, and security visualization for a default database,
but not additional named databases.

However, the emulator itself does create a named database based on the
configuration in your `firebase.json` file and implicitly in response to SDK or
REST API calls.

### Transactions

The emulator does not currently implement all transaction behavior
seen in production. When you're testing features that involve multiple
concurrent writes to one document, the emulator may be slow to complete write
requests. In some cases, locks may take up to 30 seconds to be released.
Consider adjusting test timeouts accordingly, if needed.

### Indexes

The emulator does not track compound indexes and instead will execute any
valid query. Make sure to test your app against a real Cloud Firestore
instance to determine which indexes you will need.

### Limits

The emulator does not enforce all limits enforced in production. For example,
the emulator may allow transactions that would be rejected as too large by the
production service. Make sure you are familiar with the
[documented limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas) and that you design your app to
proactively avoid them.
