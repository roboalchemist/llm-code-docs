Spark plan custom domains only have access to the `GROUPED` cert type, while Blaze plan domains can select any option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `cert`               | `object (`[Certificate](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/projects.sites.customDomains#Certificate)`)` Output only. The SSL certificate Hosting has for this custom domain's domain name. For new custom domains, this often represents Hosting's intent to create a certificate, rather than an actual cert. Check the `state` field for more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `redirectTarget`     | `string` A domain name that this `CustomDomain` should direct traffic towards.

## HostState

The host state of your domain name. Host state is determined by checking each IP address associated with your domain name to see if it's serving Hosting content.

| `HOST_STATE_UNSPECIFIED` | Your custom domain's host state is unspecified. The message is invalid if this is unspecified.                                                                                                                 |
| `HOST_UNHOSTED`          | Your custom domain's domain name isn't associated with any IP addresses.                                                                                                                                       |
| `HOST_UNREACHABLE`       | Your custom domain's domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS queries to find your domain name's IP addresses resulted in errors. See your `CustomDomain` object's `issues` field for more details. |
| `HOST_MISMATCH`          | Your custom domain's domain name has IP addresses that don't ultimately resolve to Hosting.                                                                                                                    |
| `HOST_CONFLICT`          | Your custom domain's domain name has IP addresses that resolve to both Hosting and other services. To ensure consistent results, remove `A` and `AAAA` records related to non-Hosting services.                |
| `HOST_ACTIVE`            | All requests against your custom domain's domain name are served by Hosting. If the custom domain's `OwnershipState` is also `ACTIVE`, Hosting serves your Hosting site's content on the domain name.          |

## OwnershipState

The ownership state of your domain. A domain can be owned by at most one Firebase Hosting Site. Ownership can be determined in two ways:  

    * TXT records: A TXT record on the domain in the form
    `hosting-site=[siteId]`.
    * CNAME records: A CNAME record that points to a Hosting site's default
    domain.

If your `CustomDomain` is in an `OwnershipState` other than `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE` for more than 30 days and it hasn't been updated in at least 30 days, Hosting's ownership systems delete the `CustomDomain`. To restore a deleted `CustomDomain`, make an `customDomains.undelete` request.

| `OWNERSHIP_UNREACHABLE`       | Your custom domain's domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS queries to find your domain name's ownership records resulted in errors. See your `CustomDomain` object's `issues` field for more details.                    |
| `OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH`          | Your custom domain's domain name is owned by another Firebase project. Remove the conflicting `TXT` records and replace them with project-specific records for your current Firebase project.                                          |
| `OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT`          | Your custom domain's domain name has conflicting `TXT` records that indicate ownership by both your current Firebase project and another project. Remove the other project's ownership records to grant the current project ownership. |
| `OWNERSHIP_PENDING`           | Your custom domain's DNS records are configured correctly. Hosting will transfer ownership of your domain to this `CustomDomain` within 24 hours.                                                                                      |
| `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE`            | Your custom domain's domain name has `TXT` records that grant its project permission to act on its behalf.                                                                                                                             |

## DnsUpdates

A set of DNS record updates that you should make to allow Hosting to serve secure content in response to requests against your domain name. These updates present the current state of your domain name's DNS records when Hosting last queried them, and the desired set of records that Hosting needs to see before your custom domain can be fully active.

## DnsRecord

DNS records are resource records that define how systems and services should behave when handling requests for a domain name. For example, when you add `A` records to your domain name's DNS records, you're informing other systems (such as your users' web browsers) to contact those IPv4 addresses to retrieve resources relevant to your domain name (such as your Hosting site files).

| `CNAME`            | A `CNAME` record, as defined in [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035). `CNAME` or Canonical Name records map a domain name to a different, canonical domain name. If a `CNAME` record is present, it should be the only record on the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `TXT`              | A `TXT` record, as defined in [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035). `TXT` records hold arbitrary text data on a domain name. Hosting uses `TXT` records to establish which Firebase Project has permission to act on a domain name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `AAAA`             | An AAAA record, as defined in [RFC 3596](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596) AAAA records determine which IPv6 addresses a domain name directs traffic towards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `CAA`              | A CAA record, as defined in [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844). CAA, or Certificate Authority Authorization, records determine which Certificate Authorities (SSL certificate minting organizations) are authorized to mint a certificate for the domain name. Firebase Hosting uses `pki.goog` as its primary CA. CAA records cascade. A CAA record on `foo.com` also applies to `bar.foo.com` unless `bar.foo.com` has its own set of CAA records. CAA records are optional. If a domain name and its parents have no CAA records, all CAs are authorized to mint certificates on its behalf. In general, Hosting only asks you to modify CAA records when doing so is required to unblock SSL cert creation. |

## Action

Action is a type of action you should take on this DNS record to configure your domain for use with Firebase Hosting.

|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `NONE`   | No action necessary.                      |
| `ADD`    | Add this record to your DNS records.      |
| `REMOVE` | Remove this record from your DNS records. |

## Type

The certificate's type. Determines how Hosting systems handle create and maintain the certificate.

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TYPE_UNSPECIFIED` | The certificate's type is unspecified. The message is invalid if this is unspecified.                                     |
| `TEMPORARY`        | A short-lived certificate type that covers a domain name temporarily, while Hosting creates a more permanent certificate. |
| `GROUPED`          | The standard certificate for Spark plan custom domains.                                                                   |
| `PROJECT_GROUPED`  | Blaze plan only. A certificate that covers from 1 to 100 domain names with custom domains on the same Firebase project.   |
| `DEDICATED`        | Blaze plan only. A certificate that covers a single domain name.                                                          |

## Certificate

An SSL certificate used to provide end-to-end encryption for requests against your domain name. A `Certificate` can be an actual SSL certificate or, for newly-created custom domains, Hosting's intent to create one.
