This page lists error codes that you might encounter and provides suggestions for how to fix each of them.

### DeadlineExceeded (262)

The following can increase`DeadlineExceeded (262)`errors:

- An increase in latency caused an operation to take longer than the deadline (60 seconds by default) to complete.

    DeadlineExceeded (262): Deadline exceeded.

To resolve this issue, see the[guide to troubleshooting latency](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/resolve-latency).

### Aborted (112)

The following situations can increase`Aborted (112)`errors:

- A document receiving too many updates per second.
- Contention from overlapping transactions.
- Traffic that increases rapidly or encounters hot-spots.

    Aborted (112): Too much contention on these documents. Please try again

Or  

    Aborted (112): Aborted due to cross-transaction contention. This occurs when
    multiple transactions attempt to access the same data, requiring at least one
    to be aborted in order to enforce serializability.

To resolve this issue:

- For rapid traffic increases, Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility attempts to automatically scale to meet the increased demand. When Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility scales, latency begins to decrease.
- Hot-spots limit the ability of Cloud Firestore with MongoDB compatibility to scale up. Review[designing for scale](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/understand-reads-writes-scale#avoid_hotspots)to identify hot-spots.
- Review[data contention in transactions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/understand-reads-writes-scale#high-level_steps_in_a_write_transaction)and your usage of transactions.
- Reduce the write rate to individual documents.

### InvalidArgument (2)

The following situations can cause`InvalidArgument (2)`errors:

- Attempting to commit a document with that exceeds the 7.5 KiB limit for an index entry.

7.5 KiB is a[limit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/quotas)for index entries. You cannot exceed this limit and it's not a quota that can be adjusted.  

    InvalidArgument (2): Index entry on <var class="readonly" translate="no">field_name</var> is larger than 7680 bytes.

To resolve this issue:

For indexed field values, split the field into multiple fields. If possible, create an un-indexed field and move data that doesn't need to be indexed into the un-indexed field.
