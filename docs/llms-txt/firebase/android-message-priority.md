# Set and manage Android message priority

<br />

You have two options for assigning delivery priority to downstream messages
on Android:
normal and high priority. Delivery of normal and high priority messages works
like this:

- **Normal priority.** This is the default priority for data and notification messages.
  Normal priority messages are delivered immediately when the device is not sleeping. When the device is in [Doze mode](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#understand_doze), delivery may be
  delayed to conserve battery until the device exits doze. For less time-sensitive messages, such as
  notifications of new email, keeping your UI in sync, or syncing app data in
  the background, choose normal delivery priority.

- **High priority.** FCM attempts to deliver high priority
  messages immediately, allowing FCM to wake a sleeping device when
  necessary and to run some limited processing (including very limited network
  access). High priority messages generally should result in user interaction
  with your app or its notifications.

<br />

## Deciding between high and normal priority messages

While normal priority messages are suitable for general updates, choose high
priority when you need to ensure immediate delivery for urgent matters or
actions. Since the delivery time for normal priority messages can be impacted by
Doze mode, setting most of your user visible notifications to high priority will
ensure they are delivered promptly. For example, notifications such as, chat
messages, problems with an account, or food delivery updates, should be set to
high priority.

### Message processing for high and normal priority messages

For both high priority and normal priority messages received on an Android
device, several seconds are given to process the message payload in the
`onMessageReceived` handler, with slightly more time allocated for high priority
messages than normal priority ones. This time is only expected to be long enough
to immediately render a notification. If you have to do any additional work such
as loading an image from device storage or calling your servers to collect
additional content you will need to take additional steps.

The `onMessageReceived` method is called on a separate worker thread. As best
practice, you should process the message payload and display a notification
immediately within the `onMessageReceived` method. You shouldn't be making
additional asynchronous network calls or doing payload processing on a separate
thread within the `onMessageReceived` method, doing so can cause your
application to be outside of a
[valid process lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle)
before the payload is fully processed. If this happens, you may see that certain
FCM messages that are sent result in delayed or missing notifications.

If you do need additional time to process for your message, for example to fetch
an `imageUrl` contained in your message payload, you will need to use a
construct such as `WorkManager` or foreground service to extend the application
lifecycle. You should use the following guidance when you
[override the `onMessageReceived` method](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#override-onmessagereceived)
to verify your notifications are fully processed.

- **For high priority notifications:** Start an [expedited job](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/getting-started/define-work) using the Android `WorkManager` to verify that your high priority notification gets prioritized processing time to verify your notification rendering runs to completion. The good news is that if you're worried about exhausting [expedited job quotas](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/getting-started/define-work#quotas) as a result of high priority FCM processing, you don't need to be. There is a brief exemption for expedited jobs scheduled immediately after a high priority FCM `onMessageReceived` is dispatched.
- **For normal priority notifications:** Start a [regular `WorkRequest`](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/getting-started/define-work#Overview) using the Android `WorkManager` instead. This will verify that the additional work required to process your notification gets processed eventually, without utilizing prioritized processing and causing unneeded battery usage issues.

## Setting priority for messages

You can send notifications to your users using the Admin SDK, the
FCM REST API, and the Firebase console. To change your priority
setting from the
Admin SDK and FCM REST API, you have to update the message JSON payload. You
can use the following code sample to see how to set the priority to high. For
notifications sent from the console, setting Android-specific notification
fields isn't supported.  

     {
      "message": {
          "notification": {
              "body": "Purchase exceeding $500 detected",
              "title": "Credit card purchase"
          },
          "data": {
              "purchaser": "Your child",
              "items": "Gravity Defier Sneakers"
          },
          "android": {
              "priority": "high"
          },
          "apns": {
              "headers": {
                  "apns-priority": "5"
              }
          }
      }
    }

### Test your high priority notifications in Doze mode

To make sure your high priority notifications are being received and processed
correctly when received by a user, follow these instructions to test your
notifications:

1. Set your device to Doze mode using the instructions in [Test your app with Doze](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#testing_doze).
2. Access your FCM registration token from your app on the test device. For more information on how to access the token, see [Send a test message to a background app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message#access_the_registration_token).
3. Once you have the FCM token, send your high priority notification to the test device using your FCM notification sending code or a [cURL command](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/quickstart-js/messaging/readme) that has configuration parameters matching your high priority notification.

## Deprioritization of high priority FCM on Android

High priority messages on Android are meant for time sensitive, user visible
content, and should result in user-facing notifications. If FCM
detects a pattern in which messages don't result in user-facing notifications,
your messages may be deprioritized to normal priority or [delegated](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/doc-revamp/optimize-delivery/android-message-priority#proxy)
for handling by Google Play services.

FCM uses 7 days
of message behavior when determining whether to deprioritize or proxy
messages; it makes this determination independently for every instance of your
application. If, in response to high priority messages, notifications are
displayed in a way that is visible to the user, then your future high-priority
messages won't be affected.

### Notification delegation with Google Play services

High priority notification messages that meet certain
criteria are proxied by Google Play services instead of being deprioritized.
This means that the notifications are displayed by Google Play services on
behalf of the app, without any need to start the app. This is done to provide a
better overall user experience on Android devices.

Note that proxied notification messages introduce changes in how analytics
related to messages being received are reported:

- In order for analytics for proxied notifications to be reported, your app must use FCM SDK version 24.0.0 or higher.
- You may notice delays or drops in the number of messages received versus the number prior to the introduction of proxied notifications. This is because analytics for proxied notifications are only reported once your app starts, and might not be reported at all if the notification doesn't result in the app opening.

Proxying notification messages in this way is the default behavior for apps
using Android Q+ and Google Play services version 19054000 or later. Messages
sent through HTTP v1 API are proxied, but messages sent through the Firebase
console or legacy APIs *will not be proxied*. Note that this feature is
currently in Beta, and is subject to change.

Though we strongly recommend leaving delegation enabled for its benefits to
device battery and memory, you can opt out of this behavior in any of these
ways:

- On an app-level basis: in your app manifest, add the directive `<meta-data android:name= "delivery_metrics_exported_to_big_query_enabled" android:value="false"/>`.
- On an app instance basis: For the app instance, set `fun setNotificationDelegationEnabled(disable: Boolean): Task<Void!>` in the UI flow for your app, depending on the specific use case.
- On a per-message basis: Set the `proxy` key to `DENY` in the `AndroidNotification` object for the send request.

### Measuring message deprioritization on Android

<br />

- **Individual Messages.** On delivery, you can
  determine whether an individual message was deprioritized or not by comparing
  its delivered priority, from [getPriority()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage#getPriority()), with its original
  priority, from [getOriginalPriority()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/messaging/RemoteMessage#getOriginalPriority()).

- **All Messages.** The [FCM Aggregate Delivery Data API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery#aggregated_delivery_data_via_the_data_api)
  can report what percentage of all your messages to Android are being
  deprioritized. Some messages may be omitted from the aggregate data reports,
  but overall they should give a global view of message deprioritization rates. See our article on
  [aggregated delivery data](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/what-is-fcm-aggregated-delivery-data-d6d68396b83b) for more information and sample code for querying the API; it can also be explored from the
  [API explorer](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcmdata/rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps.deliveryData/list).

- **Proxied Notifications.** Proxied notifications won't be counted in current FCM or GA delivery metrics, so
  you may experience a drop of up to 15% in notification delivery metrics. For
  reporting on proxied messages, use the
  [FCM Aggregate Delivery Data API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/understand-delivery#aggregated_delivery_data_via_the_data_api).
  `ProxyNotificationInsightPercents` reports the percentage of successfully
  proxied notifications as well as details for messages that can't be
  successfully proxied.

<br />

### Troubleshooting Notification Delays

<br />

- **Ensure that your app instance has notifications enabled.** If the user has disabled the notification permission for your app, none of your notifications will be posted, as a result, your messages will be deprioritized. You should [verify that notifications are enabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationManagerCompat#areNotificationsEnabled()) before sending high priority messages to an application instance.

- **Avoid making additional network calls when processing your notification.** Because a small portion of the Android mobile population are
  on high latency networks, avoid opening a connection to your servers before
  displaying a notification. Calling back to the server before the end of the
  allowed processing time may be risky for users on high latency networks.

  Instead, include the
  notification content in the FCM message and display it immediately. If you need
  to sync for additional in-app content on Android, you can schedule a task with
  [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to handle that in the background.
