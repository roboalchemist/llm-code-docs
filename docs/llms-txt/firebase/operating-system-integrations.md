Follow the[migration guide](https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq#how_should_i_migrate_from_the_service)and see the[Dynamic Links Deprecation FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq)for more information.

TheDynamic Linksfeature is built on top of the existing deep linking capabilities of the underlying operating systems.

Below are some flowcharts detailing the specific integrations with iOS and Android. These flowcharts are for the case where the link behavior has been configured to (a) open the deep link in the app, if installed; and (b) open the App Store/Play Store page if the app is not installed.
