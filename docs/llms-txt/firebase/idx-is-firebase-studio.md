As part of our mission to provide developers with a comprehensive suite of tools for building and publishing high-quality, full-stack apps, we're excited to announce thatProject IDXis now part ofFirebase Studio.

[Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio)is an agentic, cloud-based development environment that gives you powerful tools and AI agents directly in your browser. WithFirebase Studio, you can prototype, build, test, publish, and iterate on full-stack AI apps from a single place.

## Will my existingProject IDXworkspaces and projects be affected?

No, your existingProject IDXworkspaces and projects will open inFirebase Studioafter accepting the[Firebase Terms of Service](https://firebase.google.com/terms)and the[Android SDK Terms and Conditions](https://developer.android.com/studio/terms). After you accept these terms, you can access your existing projects and data in[Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/).

You can continue to useFirebase Studioas you usedProject IDX, integrated with the providers of your choice.

## What does this mean for existingProject IDXusers?
