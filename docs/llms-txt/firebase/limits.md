The following are restrictions on data storage and operations inFirebase Realtime Database. To scale beyond any of these limits,[use multiple databases](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding).

### Global

| Simultaneous connections                              | 200,000\*                                      | A simultaneous connection is equivalent to one mobile device, browser tab, or server app connected to the database. This isn't the same as the total number of users of your app, because your users don't all connect at once. For example, apps with 10 million monthly active users usually have fewer than 200,000 simultaneous connections. Your max simultaneous connections depends on your total user count and the average time users spend in your app. However, if you need to scale beyond this limit, try[using multiple databases](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding). *\*The Spark plan limit on simultaneous connections is 100.* |
| Simultaneous responses sent from a single database.   | \~100,000/second                               | Responses include simultaneous broadcast and read operations sent by the server from a single database at a given time. The limit refers to the data packets that represent each individual read or broadcast operation, including push notifications, sent from the database. This guidance is for sustained load, but the database can handle occasional higher bursts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Number of Cloud Functions triggered by a single write | 1000; or, forCloud Functionsv2, 500 per region | While there isn't a limit to how many read or write operations you can trigger from a single function, a single database write operation can only trigger 1000 functions, or 500 functions per region forCloud Functionsv2. Cloud Functionscan only be triggered by write operations, and each function can also trigger more write operations that trigger more functions (each with their own 1000-function or 500-per-region limit).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Size of a single event triggered by a write           | 1 MB                                           | The size of an event consists of the following values: 1. The existing data at the write location. 2. The update value, or the delta in data necessary to write the new data to the location. Write operations larger than 1MB succeed on the database, but they don't trigger a function invocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Disable strict enforcement for trigger limits**
|
| Strict validation is enabled by default for write operations that trigger events. Any write operations that trigger more than 1000 Cloud Functions or a single event greater than 1 MB in size will fail and return an error reporting the limit that was hit. This might mean that some Cloud Functions aren't triggered at all if they fail the pre-validation.
|
| If you're performing a larger write operation (for example, deleting your entire database), you might want to disable this validation, as the errors themselves might block the operation.
|
| To turn off`strictTriggerValidation`, follow these steps:
|
| 1. Get your Database secret from the[**Service accounts**tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/databasesecrets)of your**Project settings** in theFirebaseconsole.
| 2. Run the following CURL request from your command line:
| `
| curl -X PUT -d "false" https://`*<namespace>* `.firebaseio.com/.settings/strictTriggerValidation/.json?auth\=`*<SECRET>*`
| `

To perform a read operation at a larger location, try one of the following options: - [Use a backup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/ios/backups). - [Paginate data with a query](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/retrieve-data#range-queries). - [Use shallow queries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/retrieve-data#shallow). |
| Total nodes in a path with listeners or queries on it | 75 million\* | You can't listen to or query paths with more than 75 million nodes, cumulative. However, you can still listen to or query child nodes. Try drilling down deeper into the path or creating separate listeners or queries for more specific portions of the path. *\*You can't view paths with more than 30,000 total nodes from the data viewer in theFirebaseconsole.*                                                                                                                         |

| Size of a single write request to the database | 256 MB from the REST API; 16 MB from the SDKs. | The total data in each write operation should be less than 256 MB. Multi-path updates are subject to the same size limitation.                                                    |
