If the completion callback on Authentication methods receives an `NSError` argument that
is not nil, an error has occurred. To dispatch to appropriate error-handling
logic in your production code, check the error code against common errors and
method specific errors listed below.

Some errors can be resolved by particular user actions, for example,
`FIRAuthErrorCodeUserTokenExpired` can be resolved by signing the user in
again, and `FIRAuthErrorCodeWrongPassword` by asking the user to provide the
right password.

Except in the case of `FIRAuthErrorCodeNetworkError` or
`FIRAuthErrorCodeTooManyRequests`, retrying a failing operation with the same
arguments will never succeed. Make no assumption on whether or not the operation
has taken effect on the server side.

When investigating or logging errors, review the `userInfo` dictionary.
`FIRAuthErrorNameKey` contains a cross-platform error name string that can be
used for identifying the error.
`NSLocalizedDescriptionKey` contains a description of the error. This
description is meant for the developer, not the user.
`NSUnderlyingErrorKey` contains the underlying error that caused the error in
question, if an underlying error is present.

In addition to the main fields listed above, there can be other fields in the
`userInfo` dictionary that you may find useful when diagnosing errors.

## Error codes common to all API methods

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeNetworkError` | Indicates a network error occurred during the operation. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeUserNotFound` | Indicates the user account was not found. This could happen if the user account has been deleted. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeUserTokenExpired` | Indicates the current user's token has expired, for example, the user may have changed account password on another device. You must prompt the user to sign in again on this device. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeTooManyRequests` | Indicates that the request has been blocked after an abnormal number of requests have been made from the caller device to the Firebase Authentication servers. Retry again after some time. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeInvalidAPIKey` | Indicates the application has been configured with an invalid API key. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeAppNotAuthorized` | Indicates the App is not authorized to use Firebase Authentication with the provided API Key. go to the Google API Console and check under the credentials tab that the API key you are using has your application's bundle ID whitelisted. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeKeychainError` | Indicates an error occurred when accessing the keychain. The `NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey` and `NSUnderlyingErrorKey` fields in the `NSError.userInfo` dictionary will contain more information about the error encountered. |
| `FIRAuthErrorCodeInternalError` | Indicates an internal error occurred. Please [report the error](https://firebase.google.com/support) with the entire `NSError` object. |
