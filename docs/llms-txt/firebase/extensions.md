# Firebase Extensions

Firebase Extensionshelp you deploy functionality to your app quickly with pre-packaged solutions.

Once installed, aFirebase Extensionperforms a specific task or set of tasks in response to HTTPS requests,Cloud Schedulerevents, or to triggering events from other Firebase products, likeCloud FirestoreorFirebase Cloud Messaging.

| Firebase Extensionsis a**beta release**. This means that the functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways or have limited support. A beta release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.

| **Reduce time spent on development, maintenance, and growth** | Since an extension is a packaged solution, all you do is install and configure the extension. With extensions, you don't spend time researching, writing, and debugging the code that implements functionality or automates a task for your app or project. Explore[ExtensionsHub](https://extensions.dev/extensions)to find solutions for your app or project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Built to be configurable and reusable**                     | Each installed instance of an extension is unique. You specify configuration values for the extension that are unique for your app, project, or use case. Depending on what the extension does, these values could be almost anything: aCloud Firestorepath, image dimensions, or a GitHub URL. You can reuse the same extension in different projects. You can even install multiple instances of the same extension in a single project. Each installed instance can have its own customized configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Integrates the Firebase platform**                          | Extensions can fill that missing piece of your existing architecture. Extensions can respond to events generated by the Firebase products that you already use in your app. A change in one Firebase product can trigger an extension to perform its task, even a task using another product. For example, a specificRealtime Databasewrite can trigger sending a newFirebase Cloud Messagingnotification. An extension can also integrate your Firebase project with other Google Cloud Platform products (like BigQuery and Google Translate) or even third-party services (like Mailchimp and Bit.ly). And triggering events aren't limited to Firebase events; you can even trigger an extension directly with an HTTPS request, or at a scheduled interval. |
| **Security and limited access**                               | The application logic for extensions runs on the backend, using Google Cloud Functions, so the code is fully isolated from the client. Also, extensions themselves are isolated from the rest of your project because an installed extension is granted[limited access](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)to only the resources and data that are clearly listed before installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Zero maintenance**                                          | Install and configure an extension for your Firebase project. After that, the backend automatically scales computing resources up and down to match the needs of your extension. You never worry about credentials, server configuration, provisioning new servers, or decommissioning old ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## How does it work?

At its core, aFirebase Extensionis code that performs a task whenever a***specifically defined event occurs in your app or project***.

An extension's logic is written using[Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions). The functions in an extension define the event providers and the conditions that trigger execution (for example, aCloud Firestorewrite, an HTTPS request, or aCloud Schedulerevent).

Even though extensions use functions, a key differentiating feature between extensions and functions is that an extension relies upon an`extension.yaml`specification file, which explicitly defines:

- The Google services (APIs) that the extension will use
- The[access roles](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)that the extension requires to operate
- The extension-specific[resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#resources)that the extension requires to operate
- The configurable parameters for the extension

You can install an extension in a project multiple times, with each installed instance having a different configuration.

**When you install an instance of an extension, Firebase does the following:**

1. Prompts you to specify the required configuration values (parameters) to be used for this instance of the extension.
2. Enables the listed APIs from the`extension.yaml`file for the project.
3. Creates a new[service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)to be used by this instance of the extension, and assigns it the listed access roles. The extension instance executes its code using the access granted to this service account.
4. Provisions the listed[resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#resources)for the extension instance (for example, a function).

Note that each installed instance of an extensions has its own service account and individually-provisioned resources.

In addition to the`extension.yaml`file, the[*extension directory*](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#view-source-code)also includes instructional files, like the`README`, which contain information to help you complete further configuration tasks or generally use the extension.

After installation, you can[reconfigure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#reconfigure)an extension (specify new parameter values) as well as[update](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#update-version)an extension to a newer version. You can also[uninstall](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#uninstall)an extension from your project at any time.

Both theFirebaseCLI and theFirebaseconsole allow you to install, view, and manage extensions.
