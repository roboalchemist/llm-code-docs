The primary goal for Pipeline queries rules support is to match the filtering
capabilities of the existing Rules engine. While Pipeline queries offer a rich
set of features, the Rules engine is restricted to recognizing simple filters to
ensure query satisfiability and security.

## Supported Filter Expressions

For a query to be constrained by your rules, it must use standard comparison
operators against constants. The following filter types are recognized by the
Rules engine:

- Equality and Inequality: `eq`, `neq`.
- Comparisons: `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`.
- Membership: `in`, `arrayContains`.

Here are some examples:

- `where(eq("foo", 2))`
- `where(lt("foo", 2))`
- `documents("/user/1", "/user/2").where(...)`

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Complex expressions, such as arithmetic within a filter (For example, `where(eq("foo" * 2, 10))`) or string functions like `strContains`, are not recognized for constraining queries.

## Request Properties

You can continue to use the `request` object to validate authentication and
query context, though some properties available in standard queries are not
supported in pipelines.

### Supported properties

The new engine continues to support the following properties:

- `request.auth`: Access user uid and token data.
- `request.method`: Identifies the operation (For example, `get`, `list`).
- `request.path`: The path of the resource being accessed.
- `request.time`: The server-side timestamp of the request.

### Unsupported properties

The `request.query` properties such as `limit`, `offset`, and `orderBy` are
unsupported for Pipelines rule checks due to the complexity of determining these
values in multi-stage queries.

## Pipeline stage handling and permissions

There are different pipeline stages that map to specific granular operations in
security rules:

- `allow list` permissions: Triggered by `collection()`, `collectionGroup()`, and `database()` stages.
- `allow get` permissions: Triggered by the `documents()` stage, which is treated similarly to a batch `get` operation.
- Field modification stages: Rules only operate on stored data and not derived values. If a pipeline includes stages that modify fields (For example, `AddFields`, `ReplaceWith`, `Select`), the Rules engine stops applying filter constraints after that stage is encountered.
- Literals stage: The `literals()` stage does not read from the database but can incur costs. To prevent abuse, it must be paired with another stage (like `collection()`) that can be verified by rules.
