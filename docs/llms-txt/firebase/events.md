Events provide insight on what is happening in your app, such as user actions, system events, or errors.

Google Analyticsautomatically logs some[events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6317485)for you; you don't need to add any code to receive them. If your app needs to collect additional data, you can log up to 500 differentAnalyticsevent types in your app. There is no limit on the total volume of events your app logs. Note that event names are case-sensitive and that logging two events whose names differ only in case results in two distinct events.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you've set up your project and can accessAnalyticsas described in[Get Started withAnalyticsfor C++](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/cpp/start#before_you_begin).

## Log events

After you have initialized the`firebase::analytics`module, you can use it to log events with the[`LogEvent()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/firebase/analytics#logevent)method.

To help you get started, theAnalyticsSDK defines a number of recommended events that are common among different types of apps, including retail and ecommerce, travel, and gaming apps. To learn more about these events and when to use them, browse the[Events and properties](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735)articles in the Firebase Help Center.
| **Note:** To get the maximum detail in reports, log the suggestedAnalyticsEvents that make sense for your app and their prescribed parameters. This also ensures that you benefit from the latestGoogle Analyticsfeatures as they become available.

You can find implementation details for recommended events in the following locations:

- Suggested events: see the list of[`Event`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/group/event-names)constants.
- Prescribed parameters: see the list of[`Parameters`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/group/parameter-names)constants.

The following example demonstrates how to log a suggested[`SELECT_CONTENT`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics.Event#SELECT_CONTENT)Event:  

```c++
  const analytics::Parameter kSelectContentParameters[] = {
    analytics::Parameter(analytics::kParameterItemID , id),
    analytics::Parameter(analytics::kParameterItemName, "name"),
    analytics::Parameter(analytics::kUserPropertySignUpMethod, "Google"),
    analytics::Parameter("favorite_food", mFavoriteFood),
    analytics::Parameter("user_id", mUserId),
  };
  analytics::LogEvent(
    analytics::kEventSelectContent, kSelectContentParameters,
    sizeof(kSelectContentParameters) / sizeof(kSelectContentParameters[0]));
```

In addition to the prescribed parameters, you can add the following parameters to any event:

- Custom parameters: Custom parameters are not represented directly in yourAnalyticsreports, but they can be used as filters in[Audience](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317509)definitions that can be applied to every report. Custom parameters are also included in data[exported to BigQuery](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318765)if your app is linked to a BigQuery project.

- `VALUE`Parameter:[`VALUE`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics.Param#VALUE)is a general purpose parameter that is useful for accumulating a key metric that pertains to anAnalyticsEvent. Examples include revenue, distance, time and points.

If your application has specific needs not covered by a suggestedAnalyticsEvent type, you can log your own customAnalyticsEvents as shown in this example:

    };
    analytics::LogEvent(
        analytics::kEventLevelUp, kLevelUpParameters,
        sizeof(kLevelUpParameters) / sizeof(kLevelUpParameters[0]));
  }

  LogMessage("Complete");

  // Wait until the user wants to quit the app.
  while (!ProcessEvents(1000)) {
  }

  analytics::Terminate();
  delete app;

  LogMessage("Shutdown");

  return 0;
}
```

## View events in the Android Studio debug log

You can enable verbose logging to monitor logging of events by the SDK to help verify that events are being logged properly. This includes both automatically and manually logged events.

You can enable verbose logging with a series of adb commands:

<br />

```
adb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE
```  

```
adb shell setprop log.tag.FA-SVC VERBOSE
```  

```
adb logcat -v time -s FA FA-SVC
```

<br />

This command displays your events in the Android Studio logcat, helping you immediately verify that events are being sent.

## View analytics events in the dashboard

You can view aggregated statistics about yourAnalyticsevents in theFirebaseconsole dashboards. These dashboards update periodically throughout the day. For immediate testing, use the logcat output as described in the previous section.

To access this data in theFirebaseconsole:

1. In the[Firebaseconsole](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open your project.
2. Select**Analytics** from the menu to view theAnalyticsreporting dashboard.

The**Events** tab shows the event reports that are automatically created for each distinct type ofAnalyticsevent logged by your app. Read more about the[dashboard](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11014767).
