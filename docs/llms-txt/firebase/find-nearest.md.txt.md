## Behavior

### Distance Measure

The `find_nearest` stage supports the following options for vector distance:

- `euclidean`: Measures the `euclidean` distance between the vectors. To learn more, see [Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).
- `cosine`: Compares vectors based on the angle between them which lets you measure similarity that isn't based on the vectors magnitude. We recommend using `dot_product` with unit normalized vectors instead of COSINE distance, which is mathematically equivalent with better performance. To learn more see [Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).
- `dot_product`: Similar to `cosine` but is affected by the magnitude of the vectors. To learn more, see [Dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).

### Choose the distance measure

Depending on whether or not all your vector embeddings are normalized, you can
determine which distance measure to use to find the distance measure. A normalized
vector embedding has a magnitude (length) of exactly 1.0.

In addition, if you know which distance measure your model was trained with,
use that distance measure to compute the distance between your vector
embeddings.

**Normalized data**

If you have a dataset where all vector embeddings are normalized, then all three
distance measures provide the same semantic search results. In essence, although each
distance measure returns a different value, those values sort the same way. When
embeddings are normalized, `dot_product` is usually the most computationally
efficient, but the difference is negligible in most cases. However, if your
application is highly performance sensitive, `dot_product` might help with
performance tuning.

**Non-normalized data**

If you have a dataset where vector embeddings aren't normalized,
then it's not mathematically correct to use `dot_product` as a distance
measure because dot product doesn't measure distance. Depending
on how the embeddings were generated and what type of search is preferred,
either the `cosine` or `euclidean` distance measure produces
search results that are subjectively better than the other distance measures.
Experimentation with either `cosine` or `euclidean` might
be necessary to determine which is best for your use case.

**Unsure if data is normalized or non-normalized**

If you're unsure whether or not your data is normalized and you want to use
`dot_product`, we recommend that you use `cosine` instead.
`cosine` is like `dot_product` with normalization built in.
Distance measured using `cosine` ranges from `0` to `2`. A result
that is close to `0` indicates the vectors are very similar.

### Limit the results

You can limit the number of documents returned by the query by setting the <var translate="no">limit</var>
field.

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("cities")
      .findNearest({
          field: 'embedding',
          vectorValue: vector([1.5, 2.345]),
          distanceMeasure: 'euclidean',
          limit: 10,
      })
      .execute();

### Retrieving the Calculated Vector Distance

You can retrieve the calculated vector distance by assigning a
<var translate="no">distance_field</var> output property name on the `find_nearest` stage, as shown in
the following example:

As an example, for the following collection:

### Node.js

    await db.collection('cities').doc('SF').set({name: 'San Francisco', embedding: vector([1.0, -1.0])});
    await db.collection('cities').doc('TO').set({name: 'Toronto', embedding: vector([5.0, -10.0])});
    await db.collection('cities').doc('AT').set({name: 'Atlantis', embedding: vector([2.0, -4.0])});

Perform a vector search with a requested output <var translate="no">distance_field</var>:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("cities")
      .findNearest({
          field: 'embedding',
          vectorValue: vector([1.3, 2.345]),
          distanceMeasure: 'euclidean',
          distanceField: 'computedDistance',
      })
      .execute();

Which produces the following documents:

    {name: 'San Francisco', embedding: vector([1.0, -1.0]), computedDistance: 3.3584259705999178},
    {name: 'Atlantis', embedding: vector([2.0, -4.0]), computedDistance: 6.383496299051172},
    {name: 'Toronto', embedding: vector([5.0, -10.0]), computedDistance: 12.887553103673328}

## Limitations

As you work with vector embeddings, note the following limitation:

- The maximum supported embedding dimension is 2048. To store larger indexes, use [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction).
