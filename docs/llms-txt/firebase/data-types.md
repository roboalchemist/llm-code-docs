This page describes the data types thatCloud Firestoresupports.

## Data types

The following table lists the data types supported byCloud Firestore. It also describes the sort order used when comparing values of the same type:

| Array                 | By element values                                                      | An array cannot contain another array value as one of its elements. Within an array, elements maintain the position assigned to them. When sorting two or more arrays, arrays are ordered based on their element values. When comparing two arrays, the first elements of each array are compared. If the first elements are equal, then the second elements are compared and so on until a difference is found. If an array runs out of elements to compare but is equal up to that point, then the shorter array is ordered before the longer array. For example,`[1, 2, 3] < [1, 2, 3, 1] < [2]`. The array`[2]`has the greatest first element value. The array`[1, 2, 3]`has elements equal to the first three elements of`[1, 2, 3, 1]`but is shorter in length.                                                                           |

| Geographical point    | By latitude, then longitude                                            | At this time we do not recommend using this data type due to querying limitations. It is generally better to store latitude and longitude as separate numeric fields.

| Map                   | By keys, then by value                                                 | Represents an object embedded within a document. When indexed, you can query on subfields. If you exclude this value from indexing, then all subfields are also excluded from indexing. Key ordering is always sorted. For example, if you write`{c: "foo", a: "bar", b: "qux"}`the map is sorted by key and saved as`{a: "bar", b: "qux", c: "foo"}`. Map fields are sorted by key and compared by key-value pairs, first comparing the keys and then the values. If the first key-value pairs are equal, the next key-value pairs are compared, and so on. If two maps have all of the same key-value pairs, then map length is considered. For example, the following maps are in ascending order: `{a: "aaa", b: "baz"}` `{a: "foo", b: "bar"}` `{a: "foo", b: "bar", c: "qux"}` `{a: "foo", b: "baz"}` `{b: "aaa", c: "baz"}` `{c: "aaa"}` |

## Value type ordering

When a query involves a field with values of mixed types,Cloud Firestoreuses a deterministic ordering based on the internal representations. The following list shows the order:

1. Null values
2. Boolean values
3. Integer and floating-point values, sorted in numerical order
4. Date values
5. Text string values
6. Byte values
7. Cloud Firestorereferences
8. Geographical point values
9. Array values
10. Vector embeddings
11. Map values

## Numeric ordering

Cloud Firestoresorts all numeric values (`Integer`\&`Floating point`) interleaved with each other. Floating point comparison follows the total ordering of[IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)with the notable exception being thatCloud Firestorenormalizes all`NaN`values, and considers it less than`-Infinity`.
