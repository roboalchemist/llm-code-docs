Firebase Extensionshelp you reduce time spent on development, maintenance, and growth of your app.

When you find aFirebase Extensionthat solves a need for your app or project, all you do is install and configure the extension. If you need multiple configurations of the extension, you can install the extension multiple times, with a different configuration for each instance you install.

With extensions, you don't spend time researching, writing, and debugging the code that implements functionality or automates a task for your app or project.

To install or manage extensions, you must be assigned one of these roles:[Owner or Editor](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/roles-basic)or[Firebase Admin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/roles-predefined-all-products).

To install an extension, your project must be on the**Blaze** (pay as you go) plan. Although there is no charge for installing an extension, you might be charged for your use of Firebase services or Cloud services such as[Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing), if your usage exceeds the services' free tier.

You can also evaluate extensions before installing them on a project using theExtensionsemulator, a component of theFirebase Local Emulator Suite.

## Official Firebase extensions

The**officialFirebaseextensions** are developed and tested by Firebase andFirebase Extensionspartner services. These extensions are reliable and secure.

### Browse Firebase extensions

Browse Firebase extensions in the[ExtensionsHub](https://extensions.dev/extensions).

## View the source code of an extension

To find a link to the source code for an extension, click**Learn more** on the extension's card in theExtensionsHub.

### Contents of an extension's source code

An extension's source directory includes:

- **extension.yaml file** --- Contains the extension's metadata and defines the[resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/overview-use-extensions#resources)created, the Google APIs and[access roles](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/permissions-granted-to-extension)required for operation, and any user-configured parameters (environment variables) for the extension

- **functions directory**--- Contains the files for the source code for the extension

- **README file**--- Lists the extension's metadata (but in more human-readable format) as well as the content from the PREINSTALL file

- **PREINSTALL file**--- Describes how the extension works, any necessary pre-installation tasks, configuration requirements, and details about the extension

- **POSTINSTALL file**--- Describes specific usage instructions and any further integration requirements

## Resources for an extension

Every Firebase project contains several types of "resources". Project resources can include things like deployed Cloud Functions, database instances,Cloud Storagebuckets, Cloud Scheduler jobs, and Cloud Secret Manager data.

When you install an extension, Firebase creates new*extension-instance-specific*resources in your project. These resources are required by the extension to operate.

Note that, if you[uninstall an instance of an extension](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#uninstall), all the resources that Firebase created specifically for that instance of the extension to operate (like a set of functions) are deleted. However, the following are***not***deleted:

- Any artifacts created by the extension (like stored images).

- Any other resources in your project, like a database instance orCloud Storagebucket. Even if the extension interacted with these other resources, they are not*extension-specific*, so they aren't deleted if the extension is uninstalled.

## Using theFirebaseconsole, theFirebaseCLI, or autogenerated SDKs {: #console-vs-cli}

You can install and manage extensions using either the[Firebaseconsole](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=console)or the[FirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=cli), or in code using[autogenerated SDKs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=sdk).

## Next Steps

- View detailed information about an extension before you install the extension ([ExtensionsHub](https://extensions.dev/extensions)or[FirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions#view-details)).

- Install an extension into your Firebase project using either the[Firebaseconsole](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=console), the[FirebaseCLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=cli). or[autogenerated SDKs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions?platform=sdk).
