| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (HTTP error code = 400) Request parameters were invalid. An extension of type `google.rpc.BadRequest` is returned to specify which field was invalid.                | Potential causes include invalid registration, invalid package name, message too big, invalid data key, invalid TTL, or other invalid parameters. **Invalid registration** : Check the format of the registration token you pass to the server. Make sure it matches the registration token the client app receives from registering with FCM. Do not truncate the token or add additional characters. **Invalid package name** : Make sure the message was addressed to a registration token whose package name matches the value passed in the request. **Message too big** : Check that the total size of the payload data included in a message does not exceed FCM limits: 4096 bytes for most messages, or 2048 bytes in the case of messages to topics. This includes both the keys and the values. **Invalid data key** : Check that the payload data does not contain a key (such as from, or gcm, or any value prefixed by google) that is used internally by FCM. Note that some words (such as collapse_key) are also used by FCM but are allowed in the payload, in which case the payload value will be overridden by the FCM value. **Invalid TTL** : Check that the value used in ttl is an integer representing a duration in seconds between 0 and 2,419,200 (4 weeks). **Invalid parameters**: Check that the provided parameters have the right name and type. |
| `UNREGISTERED` (HTTP error code = 404) App instance was unregistered from FCM. This usually means that the token used is no longer valid and a new one must be used.                    | This error can be caused by missing registration tokens, or unregistered tokens. **Missing Registration** : If the message's target is a `token` value, check that the request contains a registration token. **Not registered** : An existing registration token may cease to be valid in a number of scenarios, including: - If the client app unregisters with FCM. - If the client app is automatically unregistered, which can happen if the user uninstalls the application. For example, on iOS, if the APNs Feedback Service reported the APNs token as invalid. - If the registration token expires (for example, Google might decide to refresh registration tokens, or the APNs token has expired for iOS devices). - If the client app is updated but the new version is not configured to receive messages. For all these cases, remove this registration token from the app server and stop using it to send messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `SENDER_ID_MISMATCH` (HTTP error code = 403) The authenticated sender ID is different from the sender ID for the registration token.                                                    | A registration token is tied to a certain group of senders. When a client app registers for FCM, it must specify which senders are allowed to send messages. You should use one of those sender IDs when sending messages to the client app. If you switch to a different sender, the existing registration tokens won't work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (HTTP error code = 429) Sending limit exceeded for the message target. An extension of type `google.rpc.QuotaFailure` is returned to specify which quota was exceeded. | This error can be caused by exceeded message rate quota, exceeded device message rate quota, or exceeded topic message rate quota. **Message rate exceeded** : The sending rate of messages is too high. You must reduce the overall rate at which you send messages. Use exponential backoff with a minimum initial delay of 1 minute to retry rejected messages. **Device message rate exceeded** : The rate of messages to a particular device is too high. See [message rate limit to a single device](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#device_throttling). Reduce the number of messages sent to this device and use exponential backoff to retry sending. **Topic message rate exceeded**: The rate of messages to subscribers to a particular topic is too high. Reduce the number of messages sent for this topic and use exponential backoff with a minimum initial delay of 1 minute to retry sending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `UNAVAILABLE` (HTTP error code = 503) The server is overloaded.                                                                                                                         | The server couldn't process the request in time. Retry the same request, but you must: - Honor the Retry-After header if it is included in the response from the FCM Connection Server. - Implement exponential backoff in your retry mechanism. (e.g. if you waited one second before the first retry, wait at least two seconds before the next one, then 4 seconds and so on). If you're sending multiple messages, consider applying jittering. For more information, see [Handling retries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/scale-fcm#exponential_backoff), or check the [FCM status dashboard](https://status.firebase.google.com/cloud-messaging/) to identify if there are any ongoing service disruptions affecting FCM. Senders that cause problems risk being denylisted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `INTERNAL` (HTTP error code = 500) An unknown internal error occurred.                                                                                                                  | The server encountered an error while trying to process the request. You could retry the same request following suggestions in [Handling retries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/scale-fcm#exponential_backoff) or checking the [FCM status dashboard](https://status.firebase.google.com/cloud-messaging/). to identify if there are any ongoing service disruptions affecting FCM.
