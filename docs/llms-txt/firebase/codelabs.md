Try these codelabs to learn hands-on how Firebase can help you use TensorFlow Lite models more easily and effectively.

## Digit classification (introduction to model deployment)

Learn how to use Firebase's model deployment features by building an app that recognizes handwritten digits. Deploy TensorFlow Lite models withFirebase ML, analyze model performance withPerformance Monitoring, and test model effectiveness withA/B Testing.

## Sentiment analysis

In this codelab, you use your own training data to fine-tune an existing text classification model that identifies the sentiment expressed in a passage of text. Then, you deploy the model usingFirebase MLand compare the accuracy of the old and new models withA/B Testing.

## Content recommendation

Recommendation engines let you personalize experiences to individual users, presenting them with more relevant and engaging content. Rather than building out a complex pipeline to power this feature, this codelab shows how you can implement a content recommendation engine for an app by training and deploying an on-device ML model.
