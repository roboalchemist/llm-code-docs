You can integrate deploys toFirebase Hostingvia a GitHub Action. Here's what this GitHub Action can do for you:

- Creates a new preview channel (and its associated preview URL) for every PR on your GitHub repository.

- Adds a comment to the PR with the preview URL so that you and each reviewer can view and test the PR's changes in a "preview" version of your app.

- Updates the preview URL with changes from each commit by automatically deploying to the associated preview channel. The URL doesn't change with each new commit.

- *(Optional)*Deploys the current state of your GitHub repo to your live channel when the PR is merged.

Reminder: When using preview URLs, your app interacts with the*real*backend resources of your Firebase project.

## Set up the GitHub Action to deploy toFirebase Hosting

1. Create a GitHub repository (public or private) or use an existing one. You must have admin permissions for the repository.

2. In a local version of your repo, set upFirebase Hostingusing the[`firebase init`command](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#initialize).

   - If you've NOT set upHosting, run this version of the command from the root of your local directory:

     ```
     firebase init hosting
     ```
   - If you've ALREADY set upHosting, then you just need to set up the GitHub Action part ofHosting. Run this version of the command from the root of your local directory:

     ```
     firebase init hosting:github
     ```
3. Follow the CLI prompts, and the command will automatically take care of setting up the GitHub Action:

   - Creates a service account in your Firebase project with permission to deploy toFirebase Hosting.

   - Encrypts that service account's JSON key and uploads it to the specified GitHub repository as a[GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

   - Writes GitHub workflow`yaml`configuration files that reference the newly created secret. These files configure the GitHub Action to deploy toFirebase Hosting.

4. In GitHub, create a new branch and commit the workflow`yaml`files created by the CLI.

5. Publish the branch to your GitHub repository.

6. Merge the branch.

That's it! Any subsequent PR in this GitHub repo will automatically get its own "preview URL"!
