In theCrashlyticsdashboard, you can click into an issue and get a detailed event report.

You can customize those reports to help you better understand what's happening in your app and the circumstances around events reported toCrashlytics.

### Log custom keys

Custom keys help you get the specific state of your app leading up to a crash. You can associate arbitrary key-value pairs with your crash reports, then use the custom keys to search and filter crash reports in theFirebaseconsole.

### Log custom log messages

To give yourself more context for the events leading up to a crash, you can add customCrashlyticslogs to your app.Crashlyticsassociates the logs with your crash data and displays them in theCrashlyticsdashboard.

### Log user identifiers

To diagnose an issue, it's often helpful to know which of your users experienced a given crash.Crashlyticsincludes a way to anonymously identify users in your crash reports.

### Report exceptions

In addition to automatically reporting your app's*fatal* events (like crashes), theCrashlyticsSDK can report non-fatal exceptions as*non-fatal*events. For Futter and Unity, if you have exceptions that are expected, you can have the SDK report them as non-fatal events, as well.

These non-fatal events are logged on-device and then sent along with the next fatal event report or when the end-user restarts the app.

### Get breadcrumb logs

Breadcrumb logs give you a better understanding of the interactions that a user had with your app leading up to a crash, non-fatal, or ANR event. These logs can be helpful when trying to reproduce and debug an issue.

### Enable opt-in reporting

By default,Crashlyticsautomatically collects crash reports for all your app's users. To give users more control over the data they send, you can enable opt-in reporting by disabling automatic reporting and only sending data toCrashlyticswhen you choose to in your code.

View instructions for enabling opt-in reporting:[iOS+](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/ios/customize-crash-reports#enable-reporting)[Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/android/customize-crash-reports#enable-reporting)[Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/flutter/customize-crash-reports#enable-reporting)[Unity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/unity/customize-crash-reports#enable-reporting)

### Include GWP-ASan reports to debug memory corruption issues

Crashlyticscan help you debug crashes caused by native memory errors by collecting GWP-ASan reports. These memory-related errors can be associated with memory corruption within your app, which is the leading cause of app security vulnerabilities.
