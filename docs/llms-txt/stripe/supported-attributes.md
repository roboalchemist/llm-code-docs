# Supported attributes

Review a complete list of attributes supported in Radar rules.

Use the following attributes within Radar to write rules. Learn how to write effective [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference.md).

## Payment method specific attributes

Rules that evaluate payment method specific attributes (for example, `:card_bin:` or `:sepa_debit_fingerprint:`) always treat non-Boolean attributes as missing for transactions that don’t use that payment method. Therefore, rules that depend on such attributes can’t act on transactions that don’t use the relevant payment method. Read more on [missing attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference.md#missing-attributes).

### 3D Secure

| **Attribute**                     | **Type**  | **Example value** |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| **is\_3d\_secure**                | *Boolean* | true              | Identifies if the payment uses a 3D Secure source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **is\_3d\_secure\_authenticated** | *Boolean* | true              | Identifies if the payment was authenticated after a successfully completed 3D Secure verification (either risk-based or challenge-based).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **has\_liability\_shift**         | *Boolean* | true              | A rough approximation whether the payment might have liability shift, in which case the [liability shift rule](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#disputed-payments) might apply for this payment. True if a non-wallet card payment had liability shift prior to authorization, but the gateway might downgrade liability shift due to network rules, making `has_liability_shift` inaccurate. Conversely, `has_liability_shift` might be false for certain digital wallets that actually have liability shift. |

## Transaction rule attributes

Write rules using these attributes to evaluate transactions from any payment method screened by Radar.

### Risk scores and levels

| **Attribute**   | **Type**                  | **Example value** |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **risk\_level** | *Case-insensitive string* | normal            | The risk level of a given payment, as determined by Stripe. The supported values are: **normal**, **elevated**, **highest**, **not\_assessed**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **risk\_score** | *Numeric*                 | 50                | The risk score of a given payment, as determined by Stripe. The values range between 0 (least risky) and 100 (riskiest). By default, a risk score of 65 or above corresponds to a risk level of **elevated**, while a risk score of 75 or above corresponds to a risk level of **highest**. You can adjust the thresholds at [Risk Settings](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-settings.md). |

## Attributes for platforms

Attributes specific to platforms allow you to create rules for either transactions for your connected accounts or for the connected accounts themselves.

Availability depends on your charge type and Radar tier:

| Rule type         | Availability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
