# Capital metrics

Access financing offer data in the Stripe Dashboard.

> Capital for platforms is available in [public preview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases.md).

The Capital page in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital) can help you understand the performance of your Capital program. The page displays metrics for originations, conversion, and the level of engagement with financing offers that were delivered to your connected accounts.

It also provides detailed insights into the status and specifics of these offers. Capital metrics refresh nightly. You can see different insights on the [Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/reporting.md#overview-tab) tab and the [Financing offers](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/reporting.md#financing-offers-tab) tab.

## Overview tab

In the **Overview** tab, you can view information about your offer funnel and insights about your Capital program.

### Offer funnel

- **Active offers** and **In-progress financing** show the current state of your Capital program.
- **Fully repaid financing** shows the lifetime metric from the start of your Capital program.

Review your email recipients regularly to make sure the recipient of monthly offer emails is a decision maker who can agree to Capital financing for each connected account. When there is no owner specified for a connected account, Stripe sends Capital offer emails to the connected account support alias, which might not be a recipient who can make decisions. |

## Financing offers tab

In the **Financing offers** tab, you can view topline metrics for:

- Pending offers
- Active offers
- In-progress financings
- Fully paid financings.

Pending offers refer to connected accounts that qualify for potential offers, but the offers haven’t yet been created. An offer might not be created if the connected account is deny-listed, unsubscribed from offers, or if they don’t have a valid email address.

| The overflow menu (⋯) | If you have a Stripe-hosted Capital page, your operational support team can use the overflow menu (⋯) on the far right to manually share a link with a connected account that will take them to the Stripe hosted Capital dashboard to review and apply for an offer.                                                                               |

Click a financing offer from the table to see the following information:

- Offered and accepted financing details including amount, fee, and withholding rate
- Offer creation date
- Remaining balance
- If the email offer has been delivered, whether the connected account has clicked the link to view the offer

1. Select **Analyze** to explore your data with Sigma.

Sigma provides Capital data in three tables:

| [financing_offers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/stripe-schema?tableName=financing_offers)                                                 | This table contains all information about the financing offers we have created for merchants on your platform, such as an offered principal or premium, and the terms for offers that have been accepted.                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [financing_balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/stripe-schema?tableName=financing_balances)                                             | This table contains daily balance snapshots for each paid out financing for connected accounts on your platform. Starting from payout to being fully paid, each financing has a daily balance snapshot in the table. You can see these broken down by the remaining principal and premium. |
| [connected_account_financing_transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/stripe-schema?tableName=connected_account_financing_transactions) | This table contains all financing transactions, such as payouts, paydowns, and reversals, for all Capital financing for connected accounts on your platform. This information mirrors what’s available in the Financing Transactions API.                                                  |

For detailed documentation on how to use Sigma for Capital data, refer to [Financing offers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/stripe-schema?tableName=financing_offers) in the Stripe Data Schema.

## Platform earnings

Platform earnings are calculated per financing and paid out on a monthly cadence at the start of the month. It’s categorized as a Stripe fee. You can check your platform earnings in two places in the Dashboard:

- [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/all-activity) page: Navigate to the **All activity** section, and use the Dashboard filter **Type: Stripe fees** to identify the line item with a description that matches **Revenue Share: Capital**.
- [Balance Report](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance): Navigate to the **Balance change from activity** section, and download the file for **Additional Stripe fees** to identify transactions with a description that matches **Revenue Share: Capital**.
