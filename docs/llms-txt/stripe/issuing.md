# Issuing

Use the Stripe Issuing API to create, manage, and distribute payment cards for your business.

Issuing is available in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Economic Area. Learn more about [availability by country](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/global.md).

[Stripe Issuing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/overview) allows you to create a commercial card program for your users without setup fees. You can create your own card designs, and approve transactions in real time. You can build Stripe Issuing alongside [Financial Accounts for platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-accounts/connect.md) to attach cards to open loop wallets, and offer your users additional money movement options. To learn more about Issuing, see [How Issuing Works](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/how-issuing-works.md).
