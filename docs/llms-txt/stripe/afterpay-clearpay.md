# Afterpay and Clearpay payments

Offer your customers flexible financing while getting paid upfront with Afterpay (also known as Clearpay in the UK).

> Afterpay has rebranded to Cash App Afterpay in the US. This update gives your business access to Cash App users without requiring any changes, unless you have custom Afterpay components. For more information about the change, see the [Cash App Afterpay support page](https://support.stripe.com/questions/afterpay-is-now-branded-as-cash-app-afterpay-in-the-us).

Afterpay is a global payment method that allows your customers to split purchases into 4 interest-free installments, or longer term interest-bearing monthly installments (US only).

For information on payment method transaction fees, refer to [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods).

To pay with Afterpay, customers are redirected to Afterpay’s site, where they authorize the payment by agreeing to the terms of a payment plan, then return to your website to complete the order. Afterpay offers payment options based on factors such as customer credit, prior account history, order amount, and the type of goods or services being underwritten. After payment acceptance, the full amount of the order (minus fees) is made available to your Stripe account upfront, and Afterpay collects the purchase amount from your customer, who repays Afterpay directly over time. For more information, see [Payment options and limits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay.md#collection-schedule).

> Afterpay and Clearpay only support domestic transactions, meaning you can only sell to customers in the same country as your business. If you’re using [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md), Stripe handles a customer’s payment method eligibility automatically. If you use [payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types), you must either configure your integration so that it only presents Afterpay and Clearpay to eligible customers, or use dynamic payment methods.

## Payment flow 
![](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/videos/afterpay_clearpay_payment_demo.mp4)
## Get started 

You don’t have to integrate Afterpay and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Afterpay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:

- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart.md): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.
- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart.md): Our drop-in UI components.

[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links.md) also supports adding Afterpay from the Dashboard.

If you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure Afterpay as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay/accept-a-payment.md).

You can also let customers know Afterpay payments are available by including the [Payment Method Messaging Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/payment-method-messaging.md) on your product, cart, and payment pages. We recommend adding a site messaging Element to help drive conversion.

## Payment options and limits 

Payment options vary by cart order size and country. In the US, Afterpay presents customers with Pay in 4, monthly installments, or both options. For all other markets, Afterpay presents customers with Pay in 4 only.

- **Pay in 4**: customers pay for purchases in four or fewer interest-free, bi-weekly payments over a 6 week term.
- **Monthly installments**: (US only) customers pay for purchases over a 6 or 12 month term that includes capped interest.

Afterpay collects the first installment from the customer immediately, and the next installment either 2 weeks or 1 month after, depending on the payment schedule. You can accept payments from customers in the same country that you registered your Stripe account. Payments must also match the local currency of the country.

The following table lists total transaction limits and installment schedules by country.

| Stripe account and customer country | Currency | Transaction limits |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Australia                           | AUD      | 1 - 2,000 AUD      |
| Canada                              | CAD      | 1 - 2,000 CAD      |
| New Zealand                         | NZD      | 1 - 2,000 NZD      |
| United Kingdom                      | GBP      | 1 - 1,200 GBP      |
| United States                       | USD      | 1 - 4,000 USD      |

### United States

In the US, a customer can be presented with both Pay in 4 and monthly installments, depending on the order amount:

| Cart order range     | Pay in 4 | Monthly Installments                 |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1 - 399.99 USD       | Yes      | No                                   |
| 400 - 2,000 USD      | Yes      | Interest-bearing 6 or 12 month loans |
| 2,000.01 - 4,000 USD | No       | Interest-bearing 6 or 12 month loans |

## Prohibited business categories

For the complete list, see the [terms of service](https://stripe.com/afterpay-clearpay/legal#restricted-businesses).

## Add Afterpay branding to your website

Let your customers know you accept payments with Afterpay by including the [Payment Method Messaging Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/payment-method-messaging.md) on your product and cart pages.

Afterpay also provides static [visual assets and branding guidance](https://www.afterpay.com/retailer-resources). In AU, CA, NZ and the US, consumers know Afterpay as ‘Afterpay’. In the UK, they know it as ‘Clearpay’. Make sure you pick the right location (see the footer in the [Afterpay documentation](https://www.afterpay.com/retailer-resources)) so that you get the appropriate assets. For Clearpay, see the [UK assets and branding guidance](https://www.clearpay.co.uk/en-GB/retailer-resources).

## Disputes 

Customers must authenticate Afterpay payments by logging into their Afterpay account. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. Afterpay covers losses incurred from customer fraud or the inability to repay installments. However, Stripe might contact you on behalf of Afterpay and request to stop or pause a shipment before any losses are incurred. It’s important to comply promptly with these requests.

Customers can dispute Afterpay payments in certain cases—for example, if they don’t receive the goods they paid for. Customers have up to 120 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a dispute. The dispute process works like this:

After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:

- Email
- The Stripe Dashboard
- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md))

Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Afterpay resolves the dispute.

Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the purchase order [using the Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding.md#respond). This evidence can include:

- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to you)
- The tracking ID
- The shipping date
- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt
- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or proof of receipt

If you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api.md).

This information helps Afterpay determine if a dispute is valid or if they should reject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as possible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within 14 calendar days. Afterpay makes a decision within 30 calendar days of evidence submission. If Afterpay resolves the dispute with you winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Afterpay rules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.

## Refunds 

You can refund Afterpay charges up to 120 days after the original payment. Refunds for Afterpay payments are asynchronous.

## Connect 

You can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works.md) with Afterpay to process payments on behalf of a connected account. *Connect* (Connect is Stripe's solution for multi-party businesses, such as marketplace or software platforms, to route payments between sellers, customers, and other recipients) users can use Afterpay with the following charge types:

- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges.md)
- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md)
- [Separate Charges and Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md)

Stripe and Afterpay rely on merchant category codes (MCC) to determine eligibility of the connected accounts against the Afterpay [prohibited business categories](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay.md#prohibited-business-categories). Make sure that you set [correct MCCs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc.md) for your connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe.

## Buyer country filtering

Buyer country filtering applies when you enable a dynamic payment method on the Payment Element or Checkout Session. Afterpay only displays as a payment method option if the buyer’s country is supported.

We determine the buyer’s country in the following priority order:

1. Shipping address country - The two-letter country code, not the full name of the country.
1. Geocoded country - The country based on the client-side IP address.
