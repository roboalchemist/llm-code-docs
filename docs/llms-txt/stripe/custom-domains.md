# Use your custom domain

Learn how to bring your own custom domain to Stripe Checkout, Payment Links, and customer portal.

# Stripe-hosted page

> This is a Stripe-hosted page for when payment-ui is stripe-hosted. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains?payment-ui=stripe-hosted.

If you’re using the [Stripe-hosted page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted) for Checkout, you can add your own custom domain to Stripe. Adding custom domains is a paid feature. For information about cost, see Checkout’s [Pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing).

## Add your custom domain to the Stripe Dashboard

Decide what subdomain to use with your Checkout Sessions, Payment Links, and customer portal.

> If your domain is `example.com`, we recommend using `payments.example.com` as your custom subdomain. You can replace `payments` with anything you like, as long it’s a valid subdomain. You can’t use a path like `example.com/checkout` and must specify a subdomain of your existing domain.

After you decide on a subdomain, visit the [Custom domains settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) to start the domain connection process.

On the settings page click **Add your domain**.

In the pop up, enter your desired subdomain. Click **Add** when you’re done. You’ll see the popup update with instructions for setting up your DNS records.

Your custom domain is activated automatically when your DNS records are verified. To disable this behavior, uncheck the **Switch to this domain once added** checkbox.

> #### When will my domain be added?
> 
> When your domain is in the `Adding...` state, we wait to verify your DNS records that you set up in the next step. After Stripe verifies the DNS records, we create TLS certificates for your subdomain, set up the correct CDN routing, and then your domain is `ready` to enable and use.

## Identify your DNS Provider

To start, figure out what service is managing your DNS records, so you know exactly where to login and create the new records.

If you **already know** your DNS provider, you can move on to the next section.

Often, it’s the same place you registered your domain, but sometimes the DNS provider is different from your domain registrar.

If you’re not certain who your DNS provider is, try looking up your domain’s nameservers, replacing **stripe.com** with your own domain in this command:

```bash
nslookup -querytype=NS stripe.com
```

You’ll see a list of nameservers for your domain in the output. Here’s some example output for **stripe.com**:

```
# Looks like AWS is providing our DNS here:
stripe.com	nameserver = ns-423.awsdns-52.com.
stripe.com	nameserver = ns-705.awsdns-24.net.
stripe.com	nameserver = ns-1087.awsdns-07.org.
stripe.com	nameserver = ns-1882.awsdns-43.co.uk.
```

If you’re more comfortable using a browser-based tool, go to [MXLookup’s DNS Lookup tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/DnsLookup.aspx) and enter your domain. It might be able to tell you who your DNS provider is (but not always).

## Create required DNS records

In this section, you’ll create the DNS records you need to connect your domain. As you go through each step, check each checkbox to keep track of where you are in the process.

Select the tab that matches your DNS provider from the tabs below—this gives you specific, guided instructions for creating the required DNS records. If your DNS provider isn’t an option, follow the Standard instructions:

#### Standard instructions

These are standard instructions for creating your DNS records. If you have issues with any of the steps, please contact your DNS provider for more assistance.

> To track your progress, go through each step  and check it off when you’ve completed it.

- [ ] Sign into your DNS provider
      Most DNS providers have a control panel you can sign into to manage your DNS. Find your provider’s control panel page and sign in.

- [ ] Find the page to manage the DNS for your domain
      Now that you’re logged in, find where you can manage the DNS records for your domain in your provider’s control panel.

      If you’re having issues finding the right page, you can:

      - See if your DNS provider has a help article for adding new DNS records that can point you in the right direction.
      - Contact your DNS provider for additional support.

- [ ] Create your CNAME record
      From your DNS control panel, add a new record that maps your desired subdomain to Checkout. Most DNS providers ask you for the record type, name, value, and TTL or expiration when creating a new record.

      > This record is what connects your subdomain to Stripe Checkout.

      Enter these values and save the new DNS record:

| Field          | Instructions                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

        Some providers may expect a trailing period (`.`) after the CNAME value. Make sure to verify that your CNAME value matches the format your provider expects. |
| **TTL/Expiry** | Enter `300`                                                          | An expiration of 5 minutes (300 seconds) is OK. Your DNS provider might not allow you to change the TTL value. If this field is missing or you can’t change it, it’s safe to ignore this part of the configuration.                         |

- [ ] Create your TXT record
      From your DNS control panel, add a new TXT record.

      > This TXT record lets us verify that you’re the owner of this domain. This is required to issue TLS certificates for your domain, so you can continue to accept payments securely.

      Enter these values and save the new DNS record:

- [ ] Verify your CNAME record is setup
      After you save your DNS record, verify that it has the correct values.

      #### Verify in your terminal

      1. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.
      1. Replace **checkout.powdur.me** with your custom domain in the following command and run it from your terminal:

      ```bash
      
      nslookup -querytype=CNAME checkout.powdur.me
      ```

      You should see output like:

      ```
      <your subdomain> 	canonical name = hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com.
      ```

         An example of what the form for adding your TXT record might look like when filled out.

      1. Click **Save**.

      1. You’ll see a new table row for the new DNS record, with the following values:

         - **Type**: `TXT`
         - **Name**: `_acme-challenge.<your subdomain>`
         - **Content**: `<your unique TXT value…>`
         - **Proxy status**: DNS only
         - **TTL**: 5 minutes

- [ ] Verify your CNAME record is setup
      After you save your DNS record, verify that it has the correct values.

      #### Verify in your terminal

      1. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.
      1. Replace **checkout.powdur.me** with your custom domain in the following command and run it from your terminal:

      ```bash
      
      nslookup -querytype=CNAME checkout.powdur.me
      ```

      You should see output like:

      ```
      <your subdomain> 	canonical name = hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com.
      ```

      When you see that output, move onto the next step.

      #### Verify with your web browser

      1. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.
      1. Open the [NSLookup Online Tool](https://coding.tools/nslookup).
      1. Enter your custom domain name in the **Domain or IP Address** field.
      1. Select **CNAME (Canonical name record)** from the **Query Type** dropdown.
      1. Click **Nslookup** to query for your CNAME record.

      You should see `canonical name = hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com` in the output. When you see that output, move onto the next step. If you don’t see that output at first, wait a few minutes and try the query again.

- [ ] Verify your TXT record
      After you save your DNS record, verify that it has the correct values.

      #### Verify in your terminal

      1. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.
      1. Replace **checkout.powdur.me** with your custom domain in the following command and run it from your terminal:

      ```bash
      
      nslookup -querytype=TXT _acme-challenge.checkout.powdur.me
      ```

      You should see output like this:

      ```
      _acme-challenge.<your domain>   text = "<your unique TXT record value>"
      ```

      If you don’t see your unique TXT record value in the output, wait a bit longer and try running the command again.

      #### Verify with your web browser

      1. Wait up to 10 minutes for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.
      1. Open the [NSLookup Online Tool](https://coding.tools/nslookup).
      1. Enter `_acme-challenge.[your custom domain name]` in the **Domain or IP Address** field.
      1. Select **TXT (Text record)** from the **Query Type** dropdown.
      1. Click **Nslookup** to query for your CNAME record.

      You’ll see the TXT record value you entered in the previous step in the output. If you don’t see that output at first, wait a few minutes and try the query again.

      When you finish this step, your DNS records are configured.

If you need any additional information, please read Cloudflare’s official developer guides, starting with [Manage DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).

Now that you’ve created your DNS records and verified them, Stripe verifies the connection and provisions your domain on our end. We’ll send you an email and a Dashboard notification when the domain is ready for you to enable it. You can also visit the [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) at any time to see the current status of your custom domain connection.

## Optional: Test your custom domain

### Create a test payment link

You receive a notification when your custom domain is added and enabled for testing.

1. Go to the [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains).
1. Verify you have an `Added` indicator above your custom domain name.
1. [Create a payment link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/create.md) in a sandbox.

You see your new custom domain in the details page of your newly created payment link.

## Optional: Removing your custom domain

If you need to remove your custom domain for any reason, you can. If you remove your custom domain, you’ll need to remove any DNS records you created for your custom subdomain and follow this guide again to add it back.

To remove your custom domain completely:

1. Go to the [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) for custom domains.
1. Click the **Remove** button.
1. Read the popup confirmation, and click **Remove** to confirm the removal.
1. Login to your DNS provider and delete the two DNS records you previously created for your custom subdomain.

> After you cancel your subscription, payment links and the customer portal link that use your custom domain stop working. You can copy and share new `buy.stripe.com` or `billing.stripe.com` links for each of your existing links.

## Optional: Using custom domains with Connect

When combining custom domains with a Connect integration, we match the same rules as our other [branding settings](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization.md):

| Connect integration type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                       | Which account’s custom domain is used? |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Destination charge             | Your integration uses `payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]`. See [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md) to read more.                         | The **platform account’s** domain.     |
| `on_behalf_of`                 | Similar to the destination charge, but the settlement merchant is different. See [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md#settlement-merchant) to read more. | The **connected account’s** domain.    |
| Direct charge                  | Your integration passes in the connected account ID in the `Stripe-Account` header. See [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges.md) to read more.                   | The **connected account’s** domain.    |
| Separate charges and transfers | Charges and transfers are handled separately from the Checkout Session. See [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md) to read more.               | The **platform account’s** domain.     |

## Optional: Troubleshooting your integration

If you’ve gone through this guide and activated your custom domain in live mode but still aren’t seeing it used for your Checkout Sessions, you might be using an unsupported Checkout integration type.

Stripe has three types of Checkout integrations, and we only support server-side redirects today. Use this table to figure out what kind of integration you’re using:

| Integration type                                                                  | You’re using this type if…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                    | Works with custom domains? |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Client-only integration                                                           | If you’re not creating Checkout Sessions from your server and are only using client-side [stripe.redirectToCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/deprecated/redirect_to_checkout) and providing items such as SKUs or Plans.                                                                                                 | This integration path is deprecated.                                     | **✗ No**                   |
| Server-side Checkout Session creation and client-side `stripe.redirectToCheckout` | If you’re creating Checkout Sessions from your server and redirecting your customers client-side by using [stripe.redirectToCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/deprecated/redirect_to_checkout) and providing the Checkout Session ID.                                                                                    | This was the standard documented integration path before September 2021. | **✗ No**                   |
| Server-side Checkout Session creation and redirect                                | If you’re creating Checkout Sessions and redirecting your customers to the returned [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-url) all server-side. See the [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?integration=checkout) guide for an example. | This is the standard documented integration path since September 2021.   | **✓ Yes**                  |

If you’re using an unsupported integration type, use our [Accept a payment guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?integration=checkout) to switch to using server-side redirects so you can start using custom domains.

## Optional: Troubleshooting CAA DNS records

The following CAA DNS records issues can occur when you attempt to add a custom domain to Checkout:

- Your CAA record doesn’t include `letsencrypt.org` as a valid CA issuer.
- You have a CAA record at the same level as your custom domain name.

### Your CAA record doesn’t include letsencrypt.org as a valid CA issuer

Stripe uses [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) to generate TLS certificates for your custom domain. This ensures that all requests to your custom domain are secure and encrypted.

As a result, if you have an existing `CAA` DNS record, you need to include `letsencrypt.org` as a valid issuer.

To add Let’s Encrypt as an issuer:

1. Go to your DNS panel and find the existing `CAA` record for your domain, and make a note of its current values.
1. Add a new record at the same level as your other `CAA` records, and enter these values:
   - **Name**: This should be the same as your other CAA records. There is usually a name of `@` for CAA records on the root of the domain (for example, `powdur.me`).
   - **Flags**: `0`
   - **Tag**: `issue`
   - **Value**: `letsencrypt.org`
   - **TTL**: 3600 seconds (1 hour) is a good default.
1. Save the record.

Most DNS updates take effect within an hour, but could take up to 72 hours to update globally.

To read more about setting up Let’s Encrypt CAA records, see their [CAA guide](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/).

### Your CAA record is at the same level as your custom domain name

If you received an error in the Dashboard about your CAA record being at the same level as your custom domain name, there’s already an existing `CAA` DNS record for the custom domain name that you’re trying to connect to Checkout. For example, if you’re trying to connect **checkout.powdur.me** to Checkout but there’s already a `CAA` DNS record at that domain, Stripe returns an error.

You have a few options for fixing this issue:

1. You can move the `CAA` record down a level:
   - If you want a custom domain name of **checkout.powdur.me**, you can create a duplicate `CAA` record with the same values at **powdur.me** instead.
   - Once the new `CAA` record has propagated, you can safely remove the conflicting `CAA` record from your DNS provider.
   - Once the removal has propagated, you can try to add your custom domain to the Dashboard again.
1. You can choose a custom domain name above your `CAA` record.
   - If your `CAA` record lives at **checkout.powdur.me**, you could choose a custom domain name like **pay.checkout.powdur.me**.

## Optional: Troubleshooting a blocked domain

Cloudflare, our domain provider, occasionally blocks some domains from being automatically added to Cloudflare as part of an additional security check. If you’re seeing an error message in the [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) about Cloudflare blocking your domain, you can email [abusereply@cloudflare.com](mailto:abusereply@cloudflare.com) to resolve the issue.

When emailing Cloudflare, copy and paste this email template and change any of the bold **[placeholders]** to your own information:

**To:** abusereply@cloudflare.com

**Subject:** Unblock request for **[insert your domain name]**

Cloudflare,

We’re in the process of adding a custom domain name to Stripe Checkout that leverages Cloudflare. It’s currently blocked by you. Can you please unblock this hostname for us?

Domain/Hostname we are attempting to add: **[insert your domain name]**

Association with the domain: **[provide an explanation of your association with/ownership of the domain]**

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Thanks,**[Your name]**
