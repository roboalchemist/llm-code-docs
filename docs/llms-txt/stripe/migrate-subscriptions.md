# Migrate subscriptions to Stripe Billing

Learn about migrating subscriptions from other sources to Stripe.

You can import existing *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis) from third-party billing systems (such as Zuora, Recurly, Chargify, or Chargebee) into Stripe Billing. You can also migrate subscriptions from an in-house billing system or from a different Stripe account.

Use the [Billing migration toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit.md) to migrate your subscriptions without writing code. Alternatively, you can use the [Stripe APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions.md) to import subscriptions with manual scripts.

## Before you begin

You must know:

- Your current payment processor.
- Your current subscription provider.
- Your *pricing model* (The pricing model consists of the products or services you sell, how much they cost, what currency you accept for payments, and the service period to charge (for subscriptions). To build the pricing model, you use Products—what you sell—and Prices—how much and how often to charge for your products).
