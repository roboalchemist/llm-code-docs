# Create a subscription

Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.

When you create a subscription with `collection_method=charge_automatically`, the first invoice is finalized as part of the request. The `payment_behavior` parameter determines the exact behavior of the initial payment.

To start subscriptions where the first invoice always begins in a `draft` status, use [subscription schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules.md#managing) instead. Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing configurations that change over time.

## Returns

The newly created `Subscription` object, if the call succeeded. If the attempted charge fails, the subscription is created in an `incomplete` status.

## Parameters

  Use `allow_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice can’t be paid. Creating Subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication.md) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

  Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication.md), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

  Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription’s first invoice can’t be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer action is needed, this parameter doesn’t create a Subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/upgrades.md#2019-03-14) to learn more.

  `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a Subscription.

  Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first Invoice status.

        - `payment_settings.payment_method_options.card.mandate_options.description` (string, optional)
          A description of the mandate or subscription that is meant to be displayed to the customer.

      - `payment_settings.payment_method_options.card.network` (string, optional)

      - `payment_settings.payment_method_options.card.request_three_d_secure` (enum, optional)
        We strongly recommend that you rely on our SCA Engine to automatically prompt your customers for authentication based on risk level and [other requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication.md). However, if you wish to request 3D Secure based on logic from your own fraud engine, provide this option. Read our guide on [manually requesting 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#manual-three-ds) for more information on how this configuration interacts with Radar and our SCA Engine.
Possible enum values:
        - `any`
          Use `any` to manually request 3DS with a preference for a `frictionless` flow, increasing the likelihood of the authentication being completed without any additional input from the customer. 3DS will always be attempted if it is supported for the card, but Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

        - `automatic`
          (Default) Our SCA Engine automatically prompts your customers for authentication based on risk level and other requirements.

        - `challenge`
          Use `challenge` to request 3DS with a preference for a `challenge` flow, where the customer must respond to a prompt for active authentication. Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).
