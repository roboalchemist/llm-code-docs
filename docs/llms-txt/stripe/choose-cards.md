# Choose which type of card to issue

Decide on physical or virtual cards for your cardholders.

Stripe offers several options for the types of cards that can be issued to cardholders. This page describes these options at a high level, including tradeoffs and use cases for each.

You can issue multiple card types simultaneously for your card program. You can also transition to different options as your business needs change. For example, if you wanted to create a custom card, you could issue an instant physical card while you’re working with the Stripe team to manufacture your custom design.

| **Overview**       | Includes all the card information required for digital transactions, but there’s no physical card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | A customizable card that’s shipped to cardholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Use cases**      | Best for use cases where card transactions are expected to be completely digitized, or where you plan to use your card to complete a backend process, such as:
  - Third-party logistics (a business is using a third party to fulfill a customer’s order)
  - B2B payments (a business is paying a supplier for a good or service)
  - Buy now, pay later payments (a business is paying a merchant) | Best for use cases where you expect to support a high degree of in-person point-of-sale transactions and you don’t want to rely on digital wallets alone, such as:
  - Fleet purchases
  - Contractor purchases
  - Expense management                                                          |
