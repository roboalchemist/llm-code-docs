## Reader software releases 

- [deviceSoftwareVersion (iOS)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-ios/docs/Classes/SCPReader.html#/c:objc\(cs\)SCPReader\(py\)deviceSoftwareVersion)
- [softwareVersion (Android)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-reader/software-version.html)

The software on the Stripe Reader M2 consists of a firmware version, configuration name, and key identifier. The reader **software version** joins these three components with underscores into a single string.

| Latest Version                       |
| ------------------------------------ |
| `2.01.00.35-SZZZ_Prod_US_v12-480001` |

#### Firmware versions 

> In PCI listings, the firmware identifier is in the format `CHB3x.<batch>-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is a placeholder for all firmware versions. All firmware versions are PCI compliant.
> 
> Specifically, a PCI firmware ID `ABCDD` maps to firmware version `AA.BB.CC.DD`. For example, `CHB3x.01-21021` maps to firmware version `2.01.00.21`.
