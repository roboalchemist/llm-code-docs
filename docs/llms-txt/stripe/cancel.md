# Cancel subscriptions

Learn how to cancel existing subscriptions.

Customers can also manage their subscriptions, invoices, and billing information through the Stripe-hosted [customer portal cancellation page](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/cancellation-page.md).

This guide describes how to use the [Subscription API](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#cancel_subscription) or the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) to manage customer subscriptions.

If you want to keep a subscription active but temporarily stop collecting payment, you can [pause payment collection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment.md). Pausing payment collection doesn’t affect the [subscription status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md#subscription-statuses), which we recommend using as the trigger for starting or stopping service to your customer.

*Subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis) cancel automatically after up to eight unsuccessful attempts to bill the customer. You can configure the number of attempts in your Dashboard [subscription settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic). Learn more about revenue recovery settings, such as [Smart Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries.md#smart-retries) and configurable [customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails.md#configure-emails).

## Cancel subscriptions 

You can cancel customer subscriptions manually with the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel.md) or in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions). By default, cancellation takes effect immediately and *invoices* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) are no longer generated for canceled subscriptions. After it’s canceled, you can no longer update the subscription or its [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata.md).

> If you set a custom cancellation date, you can’t provide a refund. A credit proration is always generated. To prevent a credit proration from generating, make sure the custom cancellation date is within the current billing period and `proration_behavior` is set to `none`.

#### Dashboard

To cancel a subscription in the Dashboard:

1. From the [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) page, click the overflow menu (⋯), then select **Cancel subscription**.
1. Choose when to end the subscription: immediately, at the end of the period, or on a custom day.
1. Choose to provide a refund for a [prorated](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md) amount, refund the last payment in full, or provide no [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds.md).
1. After finalizing all settings, click **Cancel subscription**.

#### API

To cancel a subscription using the API:

```curl
curl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:"
```

```cli
stripe subscriptions cancel {{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

subscription = client.v1.subscriptions.cancel('{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}')
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
subscription = client.v1.subscriptions.cancel("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}")
```

```php
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$subscription = $stripe->subscriptions->cancel('{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}', []);
```

```java
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeClient client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

SubscriptionCancelParams params = SubscriptionCancelParams.builder().build();

// For SDK versions 29.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1()' from the following line.
Subscription subscription =
  client.v1().subscriptions().cancel("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}", params);
```

```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.cancel('{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}');
```

```go
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.SubscriptionCancelParams{
  SubscriptionExposedID: stripe.String("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}"),
}
result, err := sc.V1Subscriptions.Cancel(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Subscriptions;
Subscription subscription = service.Cancel("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}");
```

### Prorate for usage-based billing

If a subscription is part of the way through a paid billing period, you can prorate the cancellation by passing the [prorate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel.md#cancel_subscription-prorate) parameter.

When you prorate a cancellation, you can optionally invoice for:

- Outstanding prorations
- [Metered usage](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md#usage-based-pricing)

If you don’t prorate the subscription, all metered usage gets discarded and the customer won’t receive credit for any potential prorations.

Create a final invoice immediately using the [invoice_now](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel.md#cancel_subscription-invoice_now) parameter. If you owe the customer a credit after cancellation, you can add the credit to their credit balance to apply to future invoices. To [refund your customer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/refunding-credit-balance-to-customer-after-subscription-downgrade-or-cancellation), issue [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds.md#issuing) and then [adjust their account balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance.md#modifying) back to zero.

### Cancel at the end of the current billing period

To cancel a subscription at the end of the current billing period, set `cancel_at_period_end` to `true`:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d cancel_at_period_end=true
```

```cli
stripe subscriptions update {{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  --cancel-at-period-end=true
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

subscription = client.v1.subscriptions.update(
  '{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}',
  {cancel_at_period_end: true},
)
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
subscription = client.v1.subscriptions.update(
  "{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}",
  {"cancel_at_period_end": True},
)
```

```php
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$subscription = $stripe->subscriptions->update(
  '{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}',
  ['cancel_at_period_end' => true]
);
```

```java
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeClient client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

SubscriptionUpdateParams params =
  SubscriptionUpdateParams.builder().setCancelAtPeriodEnd(true).build();

// For SDK versions 29.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1()' from the following line.
Subscription subscription =
  client.v1().subscriptions().update("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}", params);
```

```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.update(
  '{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}',
  {
    cancel_at_period_end: true,
  }
);
```

```go
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.SubscriptionUpdateParams{
  CancelAtPeriodEnd: stripe.Bool(true),
  SubscriptionExposedID: stripe.String("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}"),
}
result, err := sc.V1Subscriptions.Update(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
var options = new SubscriptionUpdateOptions { CancelAtPeriodEnd = true };
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Subscriptions;
Subscription subscription = service.Update("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}", options);
```

This allows the subscription to complete the duration of time the customer has already paid for. You can reactivate subscriptions scheduled for cancellation by updating `cancel_at_period_end` to `false`. You can reactivate the subscription at any time up to the end of the period.

### Cancel after scheduled changes or future billing periods 

To schedule a subscription to end after a specified number of billing periods, [create a subscription schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules.md). Set the schedule length by specifying one or more phases and intervals, and set its [end_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create.md#create_subscription_schedule-end_behavior) attribute to `cancel`.

With an end behavior of `cancel`, subscription schedules automatically manage the subscription’s [cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel.md#custom-cancel-date) attribute. When the schedule is in its last phase, the subscription’s cancel date is set to the phase’s end date, otherwise, the cancel date isn’t set on the subscription.

As a result, adding a new phase to a schedule that’s currently in its last phase removes the cancel date. If the subscription is in its last billing period when extending or removing the cancel date, this might update the period end and billing cycle anchor. See how to [set a custom cancel date](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel.md#custom-cancel-date) for more details.

### Configure automatic cancellation after a dispute 

> #### Limited support
> 
> This feature is only supported for disputed credit and debit card payments opened in the *full amount*. The delay for any automatic cancellation isn’t compatible with [test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/simulate-subscriptions.md).

When a customer [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes.md) a charge for a subscription, the subscription continues to cycle, which can create more disputed charges. You can change this behavior in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) to cancel subscriptions instead. Changes to the subscription take effect after approximately one hour.

Under [Manage disputed payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), select one of the following:

- **cancel the subscription immediately without prorating** – The subscription cancels immediately without any prorating. You can’t restart a canceled subscription. You must create a new subscription for the customer if you want to continue billing them.

- **cancel the subscription at the end of the period** – The subscription cancels at the end of the current billing period and [cancel_at_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-cancel_at_period_end) is set to `true`. This allows you time to work through the dispute process before the cancellation occurs.

For subscriptions managed with [schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules.md), the subscription is first released from the schedule and then canceled. This means the rest of the scheduled changes won’t take effect.

## Handle invoice items when canceling subscriptions

Your customer might still be billed for pending [invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription.md#adding-draft-invoice-items) on a subscription in the following cases:

- The subscription cancellation includes a final invoice
- Your customer has another active subscription

To prevent billing your customer for pending invoice items, you must [manually delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#delete_invoiceitem) the invoice items.

Similarly, any [usage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage.md) reported during the billing period bills at the end of the period. To avoid a final usage charge, use the [clear_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#update_subscription-items-clear_usage) parameter to [update the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api.md#update_subscription) and remove the metered price.

If you set the subscription to cancel at period end, any pending prorations are left in place and still collected at the end of the period. If you cancel the subscription before the end of the period, invoice items remain and won’t be processed unless you specifically generate an invoice that includes them.

When you cancel a subscription, all `open` and `draft` invoices for that subscription have their `auto_advance` property set to `false`. This [pauses automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection.md) for these invoices and prevents automatic reminder emails from sending. You can still manually attempt to collect payment and send emails.

## Identify cancellation events 

Stripe sends the following events for canceled subscriptions.

| Event                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Sent for any subscription update, including when `cancel_at_period_end` is set to `true`.                                                                                                                       |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Sent when a subscription is canceled. The cancellation can result from a direct call to delete the subscription or when a subscription with `cancel_at_period_end: true` reaches the end of its billing period. |

## Stop a pending cancellation 

You can stop a scheduled cancellation through the [Update Subscription API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md) or the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions). You can’t reactivate a canceled subscription.

#### Dashboard

To stop a scheduled cancellation in the Dashboard:

1. On the [Subscriptions page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions), select the subscription you want to update.
1. From the Subscription details page, click **Actions**, then select **Don’t cancel**.

#### API

To stop a scheduled cancellation using the API, set `cancel_at_period_end` to `false`. This action only affects subscriptions that haven’t reached the end of their billing period.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d cancel_at_period_end=false
```

```cli
stripe subscriptions update {{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \

Subscription subscription = service.Update("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}", options);
```

> Prior to version [2018-02-28](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades.md#2018-02-28), *any* parameter sent to the [Update Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md) stops a pending cancellation.

## Set a custom cancel date 

Use the [cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md#update_subscription-cancel_at) parameter to cancel a subscription at a future timestamp.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d cancel_at=1723766400
```

```cli
stripe subscriptions update {{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
  --cancel-at=1723766400
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

subscription = client.v1.subscriptions.update(

  SubscriptionExposedID: stripe.String("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}"),
}
result, err := sc.V1Subscriptions.Update(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
var options = new SubscriptionUpdateOptions
{
    CancelAt = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(1723766400).UtcDateTime,
};
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Subscriptions;
Subscription subscription = service.Update("{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}", options);
```

When you schedule a cancel date that occurs before the billing period ends, the subscription’s items’ [current_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_item/object.md#subscription_item_object-current_period_end) updates to match the `cancel_at` date. This creates prorations for the change in the current period, unless your update [disables](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md#disable-prorations) prorations.

For `billing_mode=flexible` subscriptions with `status=trialing`, adding, updating, or removing the `cancel_at` value doesn’t affect the [trial_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-trial_end) date.

For subscriptions using [billing_mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create.md?api-version=2025-04-30.preview#create_subscription-billing_mode), you can use enum helpers with the `cancel_at` parameter to simplify canceling a subscription at the end of a billing period. The `min_period_end` and `max_period_end` helpers allow you to specify when to cancel a subscription based on the billing periods for all subscription items.

| Event            | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_period_end` | Selects the timestamp for the billing period that ends earliest. |
| `max_period_end` | Selects the timestamp for the billing period that ends last.     |

These helpers resolve timestamps immediately, reducing the risk of later changes to an item’s `current_period_end` affecting the resolved cancellation timestamp.

If you schedule a cancel date that occurs more than one period away, the subscription’s cycle remains unaffected until the subscription renews into the period that contains the `cancel_at` date. The `items.current_period_end` for the renewal then shortens to match the `cancel_at` date.

For example, your customer subscribes to a 120 USD per year licensed subscription that renews on January 1, 2024. They set the subscription to cancel on July 1, 2024. The final invoice subtotal on January 1 calculates as 60 USD and the `items.current_period_end` is July 1.

Changing, adding, or removing a scheduled cancel date within the current period updates the `items.current_period_end` and creates prorations. In the above example, on February 15 you update the cancel date to October 1. The current period end becomes October 1, and Stripe creates prorations for 30 USD for the additional quarter. To invoice the prorated items immediately instead of in a final invoice on October 1, pass a [proration_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update.md#update_subscription-proration_behavior) of `always_invoice` in the update, or separately [create a one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription.md#generating-invoices).

## Cancellation with billing cycle anchor

The subscription’s [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor) property might change if it tracked the previous cancel date. During the first period, Stripe preserves any anchor you [originally set](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle.md#new-subscriptions) on the subscription. When the first period finishes, or if you didn’t provide a custom anchor when creating the subscription, the anchor resets to the [current period start](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items/object.md#subscription_item_object-current_period_start). This reset behavior for the billing cycle anchor is only guaranteed for subscriptions created after June 2024. Subscriptions created before this date might exhibit the legacy behavior where the [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor) property remains unchanged after cancellation removal or extension.

Adding a cancel date or moving an existing one closer to the current time shortens the [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor) to match the new cancel date. In the above example, on February 15 you update the cancel date to April 1. The period end and billing anchor become April 1, and Stripe creates prorations for -30 USD to credit your customer for unused time for April 1 to July 1.
