# Use a prebuilt Stripe-hosted payment page

[Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) is a low-code, prebuilt payment page that Stripe hosts or that you can embed into your website. Checkout uses the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md).

## Create a payments form to accept payments on your website

Accept one-time and subscription payments from more than 40 local payment methods.

## Payment UIs 

You can use two different payment UIs with the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md). The following images highlight which aspects of the checkout UI Stripe hosts in each option. You can also see these options by [exploring our demo](https://checkout.stripe.dev).
