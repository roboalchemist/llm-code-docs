# Types of events

This is a list of all public snapshot events we currently send for /v1 resources, which is continually evolving and expanding.

Stripe events use the `resource.event` naming convention. Events that occur on subresources like `customer.subscription.updated` don’t trigger a corresponding event for the parent resource (`customer.updated`).

Stripe creates event types marked as **Selection required** only when at least one [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) is listening for it. A webhook set to listen to all events doesn’t satisfy this requirement and won’t generate **Selection required** event types.
