# Dispute and fraud card monitoring programs

Learn about the monitoring programs operated by the card networks, and what to do if you're placed into one.

> #### Upcoming changes to Visa monitoring programs
> 
> The [Visa section](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#visa-programs) describes Visa’s new monitoring program and corresponding changes to existing programs.

To learn more about the steps you can take to prevent disputes and fraud, refer to our [prevention guide](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention.md).

As part of your financial obligations to the *card networks* (A network that processes the transactions of a particular card brand. It might be an intermediary in front of an issuing bank as with Visa or Mastercard, or a standalone entity as with American Express), you must keep [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes.md) (also called chargebacks) and fraud at acceptable levels. If they exceed the thresholds dictated by a network (for example, [Visa](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#visa-programs) or [Mastercard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#mastercard-programs)), the network places you into one of their monitoring programs. As part of a program, you can incur monthly fines and additional fees until you reduce your dispute or fraud levels in a sustained way.

Stripe can work with you on a remediation plan to reduce the levels of disputes or fraud related to your account. We also communicate directly with the networks and relay information on a monthly basis. Download our [remediation template](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/compliance/monitoring_program_remediation_template.pdf) to get started.

While monitoring programs are comparatively rare, take them seriously. If you’re placed into one, you must take immediate action to address the situation. Failure to comply with the requirements of a program within the specified time period can result in the network refusing to process further payments to you. This can put your ability to accept any credit card payments [at risk](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/match.md).

> This page is a general guide for Stripe users, not a comprehensive reference for card network monitoring programs. For complete and up to date information about monitoring programs, see the documentation provided by the networks.

## Understanding disputes and chargebacks

For the purposes of monitoring programs, a dispute or chargeback occurs when funds move out of an account due to a disputed payment, regardless of the reason. The terms “dispute” and “chargeback” are interchangeable. The Visa monitoring program refers to disputes, while the Mastercard and AusPayNet monitoring programs refer to chargebacks.

Monitoring programs don’t consider refunds when identifying disputes. In some cases, if you issued a full refund at least 10 days before a dispute, we can ask to have the dispute removed from the account. The issuer might have missed the refund and raised the dispute by mistake, but that rarely happens.

Similarly, monitoring programs don’t consider dispute outcomes. If they did, they’d have to wait for the outcome of every dispute, which can take months, before including it in their calculations. They’re also more interested in how successfully you prevent disputes than in whether you win them.

Some disputes where you have no liability don’t appear in your Dashboard or API responses because Stripe handles them on your behalf. They don’t count toward your Stripe dispute or fraud rates, and we don’t charge you for them. However, monitoring programs still include them in their calculations. That can create a discrepancy between your data and the dispute rates that the networks calculate for you, especially if you issue a lot of refunds. For example:

- You refunded the payment before the customer submitted the dispute.
- The dispute duplicates a previously resolved dispute.
- The card network created or processed the dispute in error.

In some cases, the data reported to Stripe by the card networks doesn’t match the data visible in your Dashboard. It can happen because of discrepancies or formatting issues in your statement descriptors, having multiple Merchant IDs (MIDs), or double-counted charges. If Stripe updates your MID during a month, it can affect your Mastercard data. If you think a card network made a calculation error, contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/).

The following scenarios don’t count as disputes:

- Unescalated [inquiries](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work.md#inquiries), where a *card issuer* (The entity that issued a payment card to a cardholder. This could be a bank, such as with the Visa or Mastercard network, or it could be the card network itself, such as with American Express) begins an investigation but never returns the disputed payment.
- [Early fraud warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work.md#early-fraud-warnings) (EFWs), which are informational messages from card network reports about suspected fraud. Although they aren’t disputes, they’re considered fraudulent (regardless of their outcome), and Visa’s [VAMP](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#VAMP) program includes them in its calculations.
- Non-disputed funds that move through a card network’s dispute system. Such movement can occur as part of Visa’s [Rapid Dispute Resolution](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work.md#respond-dispute) program.

## Monitoring program calendars

Visa and Mastercard monitoring programs track activity by month, while the AusPayNet monitoring program tracks activity by quarter.

Visa and Mastercard programs calculate monthly rates differently. Visa calculates the ratio of disputes or fraud to the total number of payments in the same calendar month. Mastercard calculates the ratio of disputes or fraud to the total number of payments in the previous month. Both networks assign a dispute or fraud report to the month in which they received it, regardless of when the original payment occurred.

Visa and Mastercard monitoring programs use specific nomenclature to refer to their monthly rate calculations:

A “data month” is the month in which a network receives a dispute or fraud report. Mastercard refers to two different data months, one for disputes and the other for sales.

A “report month,” “reporting month,” or “identification month” is the month in which a program identifies a business based on its data meeting a threshold. It’s usually the month after the data month containing that data.

## Estimate your dispute or fraud rate

If you have [Stripe Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma) or [Data Pipeline](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline), you can use it to [track your estimated dispute or fraud rate for a given monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data.md#tracking-monitoring-programs). We offer [a guide to help you implement a continuous fraud management process](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data) using those tools.

If you don’t have either of those products, you can manually estimate your dispute rate. Export your Visa or Mastercard disputes from the **Payments** tab in your Dashboard and compare them to your payments according to a program’s formula. Networks count payments by their capture date and disputes by their creation date. For accounts outside the US, count payments and disputes for a calendar month. For accounts in the US, there’s a delay between receiving disputes from our financial partner and reporting them to the card network. To account for that delay, count payments for a calendar month, and count disputes from the 5th of that month to the 5th of the following month.

You can also track EFWs using the [Early Fraud Warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/early_fraud_warnings.md) API. In addition, when we receive a fraud report for a payment that hasn’t already been disputed or refunded, we send a notification to the primary email on your account.

## Visa monitoring programs 

Visa evaluates your activity monthly against the thresholds established in their monitoring programs. If Visa places you in a program, Stripe notifies you.

### Regional considerations 

Except for the [Visa Secure Excessive Fraud Program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#vsefp), which applies to US businesses only, Visa enforces its monitoring programs on all businesses in all Stripe supported countries.

Visa places individual accounts in its programs, but identifies an account by the static component of its [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors.md) and its acquiring bank. Because banks often vary by country or region, one Stripe business might represent multiple monitored accounts to Visa.

- A Stripe business that uses one statement descriptor in Canada and a second statement descriptor in both Canada and the US qualifies as three accounts to Visa: one for each descriptor in each country.
- A Stripe business that uses the same statement descriptor in Ireland, France, and Germany results in only one account because Visa aggregates its EU volume.
- A Stripe business with multiple statement descriptors represents that many Visa accounts. To aggregate the dispute and fraud rates:
  - Give each descriptor the same static prefix.
  - If updating existing statement descriptors, ask Stripe to contact Visa and request that they aggregate your transactions.
  - Make the change at the end of a month so it doesn’t affect the rate calculations for that month.

### VAMP: Visa Acquirer Monitoring Program  (Effective May 15, 2025)

VAMP monitors an account’s disputes and fraud, and its card testing activity. Visa calculates these thresholds separately for monitoring purposes. If you exceed Visa’s threshold for either disputes and fraud, or for enumeration attempts, your account enters into monitoring for only the exceeded category.

Refer to Visa’s [announcement](https://corporate.visa.com/en/sites/visa-perspectives/security-trust/security-program-takes-aim-payments-fraud.html) and [fact sheet](https://corporate.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/corporate/visa-perspectives/security-and-trust/documents/visa-acquirer-monitoring-program-fact-sheet-2025.pdf) for more details on the VAMP program.

#### Disputes and fraud monitoring

VAMP disputes and fraud monitoring applies to users with an unusually high level of disputed payments and fraud on their account. Every month, Visa analyzes the previous month’s count and rate of disputes and fraud for each account to determine whether it meets their monitoring program thresholds. Visa calculates the following metrics:

- The total number of disputes and fraud (VAMP count). Disputes include all payment disputes, both fraudulent and non-fraudulent, as identified by Visa’s TC15 reporting. Fraud is defined as [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work.md#early-fraud-warnings) data sourced from Visa’s TC40 reports
- The total USD volume of disputes and fraud (VAMP volume)
- The ratio of VAMP count to the total count of all captured payments (VAMP ratio)

Visa excludes disputes and fraud from its VAMP count if any of the following conditions apply:

- The dispute was resolved through pre-dispute products, such as Stripe’s [dispute prevention](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention-preview.md)
- The TC40 fraud qualified for Compelling Evidence 3.0

> The same fraudulent transaction might appear in both the TC40 and TC15 reports. Any transaction that appears in both reports will be counted twice for the VAMP count.

Each month, Visa calculates the VAMP count, ratio, and volume from the previous month. Visa places an account in monitoring based on the following thresholds for its disputes and fraud:

| Criteria    | Non-compliant threshold | Excessive threshold                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VAMP count  | 5                       | - 150 in CEMEA
  - 1,500 elsewhere                                                                                                 |
| VAMP ratio  | 0.5%                    | - Effective May 15, 2025
    - 1.5% in LAC
    - 2.2% elsewhere
  - Effective Apr 1, 2026
    - 2.2% in CEMEA
    - 1.5% elsewhere |
| VAMP volume | N/A                     | - 75,000 USD in CEMEA
  - N/A elsewhere                                                                                            |

Visa assesses fees to merchants that exceed the `Excessive` threshold and may assess fees to merchants that exceed the `Non-Compliant` threshold. If Visa assesses fines, Stripe notifies the account about the fee.

> Visa granted an advisory period that expires on October 1, 2025. During this period, Visa waives fines to any merchant enrolled in VAMP for disputes and fraud monitoring. If your account’s September dispute and fraud metrics exceed the threshold and enters VAMP in October, fines will apply.

#### Enumeration monitoring

VAMP enumeration monitoring applies to users with an unusually high level of enumeration attempts on their account. Visa monitors enumeration attacks to encourage you to identify and [mitigate card testing attacks](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing.md). Visa uses the following metrics to identify businesses in the enumeration monitoring program:

- The total number of enumerated transactions (VAMP enumeration count). Visa defines enumerated transactions as card testing activity that reaches the processor regardless of whether the payment was approved or declined. Visa uses a machine learning model that identifies enumerated authorization transactions.
- The ratio of VAMP enumeration count to the total count of authorization transactions (VAMP enumeration ratio)

Visa places an account that exceeds all of the following criteria into `Excessive` monitoring for enumeration:

| Criteria               | Threshold |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| VAMP enumeration count | 300,000   |
| VAMP enumeration ratio | 20%       |

Visa doesn’t assess fines for VAMP enumeration monitoring.

#### View your VAMP metrics

Accounts can view Stripe’s estimates of their VAMP metrics in their [VAMP dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/cbmp/vamp). The dashboard has the following sections:

| Section                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| History                               | View which months Visa identified your account as exceeding `Excessive` thresholds over the previous 12 program months. Identifications in a month are based on data from the previous month.                |
| Historical and current program status | View the breakdown of the VAMP metrics from Visa whenever your account has exceeded the Visa `Excessive` thresholds.                                                                                         |
| Projected program status              | Stripe estimates your VAMP metrics so that you can track your VAMP metrics throughout the date and take action to prevent identification in VAMP. These estimates may differ from Visa’s final VAMP numbers. |

### Visa Secure Excessive Fraud Program (US-only) 

The Visa Secure Excessive Fraud Program applies only to US-based businesses with US-based custom accounts and an excessive level of fraud on domestic Visa 3D-Secure-authenticated (3DS) transactions on US-issued cards.

> By default, Stripe allows all authenticated 3DS payments to go through. You can adjust your rules to block 3DS payments that are flagged as high risk. You can also consider other signals that usually apply to normal charges, such as velocity, transaction size, and CVC/AVS checks.

Visa calculates the fraud level using [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work.md#early-fraud-warnings) data sourced from their TC40 reporting. Businesses are placed into this program if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:

- The total USD volume of EFWs for Visa 3DS-authenticated payments (Fraud volume)
- The ratio of the USD volume of EFWs for Visa 3DS-authenticated payments to the USD volume of all captured Visa 3DS-authenticated payments (Fraud rate)

An EFW belongs to the month in which the TC40 was reported, not the month when the reported payment was captured. For example, calculations for February include 3DS-authenticated payments captured in February and EFWs reported in February for 3DS-authenticated payments, even if the potentially fraudulent payments were captured in January. The February calculations don’t consider any payments captured in January.

| Fraud volume | Fraud rate | Fines                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 75,000 USD   | 0.9%       | None, but you lose liability shift on domestic 3DS transactions until you fully exit the program. |

## Mastercard monitoring programs 

Mastercard’s Excessive Chargeback Program (ECP) consists of two levels: [Excessive Chargeback Merchant (ECM)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#ecm) and [High Excessive Chargeback Merchant (HECM)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#hecm), and it applies to users in all supported countries. The [Excessive Fraud Merchant (EFM) Compliance Program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#efm) is a separate program that applies to users in all supported countries besides Germany, India, and Switzerland.

If your account exceeds program thresholds, Mastercard places you into that program and Stripe notifies you. If you exceed both EFM and ECP thresholds, you’re placed in EFM but not ECP. However, Mastercard tracks both thresholds. For example, you exceed EFM and ECP thresholds in March and April, but exceed only ECP thresholds in May. In April, you’re placed in month 2 of EFM and fined accordingly. In May, you’re placed in month 3 of ECP despite the EFM identifications taking precedence in prior months.

### Remediation 

Mastercard removes you from a program when your chargebacks drop below the program threshold for 3 consecutive months. If you’re in HECM, and your chargebacks drop below the HECM threshold but still meet the ECM threshold, you move to the ECM level.

Monitoring your chargeback and fraud levels accurately is important. For example, Mastercard counts a chargeback regardless of whether it was hidden due to a refund, regardless of *liability shift* (With some 3D Secure transactions, the liability for fraudulent chargebacks (stolen or counterfeit cards) shifts from you to the card issuer), and regardless of its outcome.

As part of the remediation process, Stripe can require you to provide details on the steps you’re taking and your timeline for implementing them.

### ECP: Mastercard Excessive Chargeback Program 

Users are placed into ECP if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:

- The total number of payment chargebacks (chargeback count)
- The ratio of the chargeback count for the current month to the total number of captured payments from the preceding month ([chargeback rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring.md#dispute-rate-usage))

A payment chargeback belongs to the month in which it’s raised, not the month when the original payment was captured. For example, calculations for February use payments captured in January and chargebacks raised in February, including chargebacks for payments captured in February.

### ECM: Mastercard Excessive Chargeback Merchant 

| Dispute Count | Chargeback Rate | Fines                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100-299       | 1.5-2.99%       | Fines begin in month two and continue at increasing rates in subsequent months. See the timeline below for details. |

| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine        | Issuer recovery assessment |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 1                                     | 0 USD       | No                         |
| 2-3                                   | 1,000 USD   | No                         |
| 4-6                                   | 5,000 USD   | Yes                        |
| 7-11                                  | 25,000 USD  | Yes                        |
| 12-18                                 | 50,000 USD  | Yes                        |
| 19+                                   | 100,000 USD | Yes                        |

Issuer recovery assessment applies an additional 5 USD per chargeback fee for each chargeback over 300 chargebacks. For example, a merchant identified in month 4 of ECM with 400 disputes is assessed a 5,500 USD fine (5,000 USD + (400-300) x 5 USD).

### HECM: Mastercard High Excessive Chargeback Merchant 

| Dispute Count | Chargeback Rate | Fines                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 300+          | 3%              | Fines begin in month two and continue at increasing rates in subsequent months. See the timeline below for details. |

| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine        | Issuer recovery assessment |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 1                                     | 0 USD       | No                         |
| 2                                     | 1,000 USD   | No                         |
| 3                                     | 2,000 USD   | No                         |
| 4-6                                   | 10,000 USD  | Yes                        |
| 7-11                                  | 50,000 USD  | Yes                        |
| 12-18                                 | 100,000 USD | Yes                        |
| 19+                                   | 200,000 USD | Yes                        |

Mastercard communicates total fine amounts to merchants through Stripe.

### EFM: Mastercard Excessive Fraud Merchant Compliance Program 

Users are placed into EFM if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for all of the following criteria:

- Number of e-commerce Mastercard payments
- The total USD volume of fraud-related chargebacks (net fraud volume) with dispute reason code 4837 or 4863
- The ratio of the number of fraud-related chargebacks in the current month to the number of e-commerce transactions in the preceding month (fraud chargeback rate)
- The percentage of Mastercard payments that use 3-D Secure (3DS)

The fraud chargeback rate uses a similar calculation to the chargeback rate for ECP, but it considers only fraud-related chargebacks.

EFM applies to users who meet all of the following conditions:

- Minimum of 1,000 e-commerce Mastercard payments
- Net fraud volume is greater than 50,000 USD (15,000 USD for Australia)
- Fraud chargeback rate is greater than 0.50% (0.20% for Australia)
- Total 3DS Mastercard payment count is less than or equal to:
  - 10% of total Mastercard payment count (non-regulated countries)
  - 50% of total Mastercard payment count (regulated countries)

| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1                                     | 0 USD       |
| 2                                     | 500 USD     |
| 3                                     | 1,000 USD   |
| 4-6                                   | 5,000 USD   |
| 7-11                                  | 25,000 USD  |
| 12-18                                 | 50,000 USD  |
| 19+                                   | 100,000 USD |

You can request that Mastercard suspend an assessed fine one time during an open case. However, only do so if you’re confident that you’ll be below the threshold to exit the program for the next 3 months. If you request a suspension of fines and fall below the threshold for 2 months, but exceed it in the following month, fine assessments continue until you exit the program.

## AusPayNet monitoring programs 

The AusPayNet (APN) Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud mitigation program is designed to reduce CNP payments fraud within the Australian payment industry (AU-based users and cardholders only). Where user fraud rates exceed certain defined thresholds for two consecutive quarters, the APN reserves the option to mandate [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#sca) for all transactions. Stripe notifies you if your account exceeds program thresholds for the preceding quarter.

### FMP: APN Fraud Monitoring Program 

Users who meet or exceed both the following criteria thresholds are placed into FMP:

- **Fraud chargeback amount**: Total value (in AUD) of fraudulent chargebacks received in the quarter is greater than 50,000 AUD.
- **Fraud-to-sales ratio**: The ratio of fraud chargeback amount to sales value in the quarter is greater than or equal to 0.20%

| 1                                       | You must implement fraud controls to reduce fraudulent chargebacks. We recommend performing [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#sca) on a subset of CNP transactions that you define as high risk.                                                                |
| 2                                       | You must do one or more of the following:
  - Perform risk based SCA (as above)
  - Use SCA on all CNP transaction (excluding [SCA exempted transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs.md#sca-exemptions))
  - Introduce more sensitive or effective fraud controls |
| 3                                       | You must pass all CNP transactions through to the cardholder’s issuing bank for SCA. Failure to do so might result in off-boarding.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4+                                      | You might be off-boarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

When your CNP transactions fall below the threshold criteria for FMP for one quarter, APN releases you from the FMP and SCA obligations.

### SCA: Strong Customer Authentication 

SCA is an authentication method in which you verify cardholder’s identity using at least two of the following factors:

- Knowledge factor: something only the cardholder knows, for example a password
- Possession factor: something only the cardholder possess, for example a mobile phone
- Inherence factor: something the cardholder is, for example fingerprint or facial recognition

### SCA exemptions 

APN exempts the following types of transactions from the SCA requirement:

- Recurring transactions: Series of repeated transactions with SCA applied on the first charge of the recurring series
- Trusted customer transactions: Transactions where you have previously identified/authenticated the cardholder and the cardholder uses the same card on file with matching identifiers
- Wallet transactions: Digital or mobile wallet transactions where the cardholder identity has been verified and each subsequent transaction is authorized by the cardholder using biometrics or a passcode

## Best practices for preventing fraud and disputes

Following these guidelines can help you avoid being placed into card network monitoring programs.

### Prevent identifiable fraud

Consider using separate authorization and capture in combination with review rules. Issuers are required to report possible fraud for a captured payment, even if it gets refunded, but aren’t required to report it for a payment authorization. If you identify and reverse a fraudulent or suspicious payment authorization before it’s captured, it isn’t reported.

### Prevent disputes for canceled subscriptions

- Offer a quick and easy way to cancel. An in-app cancellation button is often the best solution, because it doesn’t require the cardholder to wait to confirm their refund.
- Clearly communicate billing terms up front prior to accepting cardholder information.
- Require the cardholder to click a button that confirms their agreement to the billing terms.
- If offering a free or discounted trial, send a reminder before it expires allowing the cardholder an opportunity to cancel.
- Implement a flexible refund or return policy. For example, if a user cancels the day after being billed, offer a full or prorated refund.
- Send billing reminders, especially if on a yearly *subscription* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). Typically 7 days before a yearly renewal and 2 to 3 days before a monthly renewal.
- Third party solutions, such as Ethoca and Verifi. These companies work with certain issuers so that an alert is raised when a chargeback is about to be initiated, allowing the user an opportunity to refund.

### Prevent disputes for unreceived products

- Clearly communicate shipping times prior to checkout.
- Clearly and quickly communicate any shipping delays and offer an option for the cardholder to receive a refund if they don’t want to wait.
- Ship items quickly and provide the cardholder with a tracking number when the item has been shipped.
- For higher value goods, require a signature upon delivery to prevent missing packages or potential “friendly fraud.”
- Make sure items are well stocked and either indicate when an item is backordered or remove it from the site.

### Prevent disputes for unacceptable products

- Implement a flexible refund policy and issue them under reasonable circumstances.
- Clearly describe the items being sold and display accurate images when possible.
- Reevaluate any products which tend to see higher dispute rates for these reasons. It’s possible the items could be defective.
- Clearly display the full price of the item, including any taxes, and make sure to present it to the cardholder before accepting their payment information.

### Prevent friendly fraud disputes

A [friendly fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/fraud-types.md#friendly-fraud) dispute occurs when a customer disputes a legitimate charge that they believe to be fraudulent. The best way to prevent such disputes is to collect as much information as possible when capturing a payment. For example, clearly communicate billing terms and shipping times, require the cardholder to agree to the terms of service, ship only to verified addresses, or require a signature upon delivery.

### Prevent other types of disputes

Less common disputes, such as `general` or `duplicate`, can indicate things like an unrecognized statement descriptor or a confusing billing statement. Normally, such disputes make up a small percentage of the total. However, if you find any of them to be very common, it could indicate some other issue at the root of the problem. For example, a large number of `general` disputes can result from poorly designed receipts that make customers question the amounts they were charged.
