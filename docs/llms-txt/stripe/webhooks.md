# Webhooks for Stripe Issuing and Financial Accounts for platforms

Learn about webhook events for Stripe Issuing and Financial Accounts for platforms and why they occur.

Stripe uses webhooks to notify your application when an [event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) happens in your account. Use webhooks to handle asynchronous [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md) such as the [creation of an Issuing authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-issuing_authorization.created) or an ACH transfer. To view the Financial Accounts for platforms-related webhook events, log in to your Stripe account with Financial Accounts for platforms enabled.

## Issuing webhook events

The following table lists the webhook events for Issuing.

> Connect webhooks are for activity on any connected account. All events on the connected account are sent to the Connect webhooks. This includes the events generated by Financial Accounts for platforms and Issuing integrations. For more information see [Connect Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks.md).

| [issuing_authorization.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-issuing_authorization.created) | Occurs whenever an authorization is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                              |
| [issuing_authorization.request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-issuing_authorization.request) | Represents a synchronous request for authorization, see [Using your integration to handle authorization requests](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/authorizations.md). You must create a webhook endpoint that explicitly subscribes to this event type to access it. Webhook endpoints that subscribe to all events won’t include this event type. |                                              |
