# Product tax codes

Stripe Tax uses product tax codes to determine a product's tax rate.

> [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.

Stripe Tax uses product tax codes (PTCs) to associate products with tax rates. For example, a jurisdiction can charge one tax rate for products in the **Clothing & Footwear** category and a different tax rate for products in the **School Uniforms** category.

You can either:

- set a preset product tax code in your [tax settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax).
- set a product tax code for [each of your products individually](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true).

Stripe Tax uses the preset product tax code for products that don’t have a PTC set directly.

## All tax codes

The following table describes the available product tax codes. If a product doesn’t fit any of the specific codes, use one of the codes with “General” in its name.

You can also fetch this list of tax codes [using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes/list.md).
