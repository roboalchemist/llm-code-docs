Possible enum values:
      - `any`
        Use `any` to manually request 3DS with a preference for a `frictionless` flow, increasing the likelihood of the authentication being completed without any additional input from the customer. 3DS will always be attempted if it is supported for the card, but Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).
