# Accept in-person payments

# Accept in-person payments 

This guide shows you how to accept in-person payments in your own point of sale (POS) application using Stripe Terminal. You don’t need any hardware to complete these steps with our [simulated reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md#simulated-reader).

When you’re ready to use a physical reader, you only need to update the [reader registration step](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart.md#register-reader) (for server-driven integrations) or [reader discovery step](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart.md#discover-reader) (for SDK integrations).

### Create Locations for your readers

[Create Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md) to organize your readers. Locations group readers and allow them to automatically download the reader configuration needed for their region of use. You must assign a Location to each reader when you [register it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers.md), which you can do using the API or the Dashboard.

### Register a reader

A simulated reader lets you get started quickly and build a working integration without requiring physical hardware. Create a simulated reader by using the special registration code `simulated-s700`. Keep track of your reader ID so you can use it later to process a payment on the reader.

### Create a PaymentIntent

Create a PaymentIntent on your server. A PaymentIntent tracks the customer’s payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed attempts and ensuring they’re only charged once. Store the PaymentIntent ID to process later.

### Process the PaymentIntent on your reader

Create a PaymentIntent with the specific amount, and process the payment on your simulated reader. The reader prompts the customer to present their card by inserting or tapping it before attempting authorization.

### Simulate card presentment on your reader

> In a real transaction flow, the customer inserts or taps their card on the physical reader. With a simulated reader, you simulate the card presentment step by making another API call.

This call successfully confirms the PaymentIntent with a test card. You can also try other test cards.

### Capture the PaymentIntent

After the PaymentIntent is confirmed successfully, you can capture it to move the funds.

### Handle errors

Each error scenario has a specific code that your application needs to handle. Errors usually require intervention from a cashier in the store, show an appropriate message in your point-of-sale application so they can react accordingly. Refer to the [error handling documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment.md?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#handle-errors) for more details.

### Run the application

Run your server and go to http://localhost:4242.

### Use a test card number to try your integration

You can configure the simulated reader to test different flows within your point of sale application such as different card brands or error scenarios like a declined charge. To enable this behavior, pass a test payment method to the [present payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method.md) API call.

| Scenario            | Card Number      |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Payment succeeds    | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment is declined | 4000000000009995 |

```

> #### Terminal access on macOS
> 
> The Stripe Terminal SDK requires local network access. When using macOS, you must explicitly allow your browser apps access to local network devices. For more information, see the [Stripe Support article](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ensuring-stripe-terminal-javascript-sdk-functionality-on-macos-15).

### Create a ConnectionToken endpoint

To connect to a reader, your back end needs to give the SDK permission to use it with your Stripe account by providing it with the secret from a [ConnectionToken](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/connection_tokens.md). Create connection tokens only for trusted clients, and [pass a location ID](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md#connection-tokens) when creating a connection token to control access to readers. ​​If you’re using Connect, [scope the connection token](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect.md) to the relevant connected accounts.

### Install the SDK

This script must always load directly from https://js.stripe.com for compatibility with the latest reader software. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy yourself as this could break your integration without warning. We also provide an npm package that makes it easier to load and use the Terminal JS SDK as a module. For more information, check out [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/terminal-js).

### Create Locations for your readers

[Create Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md) to organize your readers. Locations group readers and allow them to automatically download the reader configuration needed for their region of use. You must assign a Location to each reader when you [register it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers.md), which you can do using the API or the Dashboard.

### Fetch ConnectionToken

To give the SDK access to this endpoint, create a function in your web application that requests a ConnectionToken from your back end and returns the secret from the ConnectionToken object.

### Initialize the SDK

To initialize a `StripeTerminal` instance in your JavaScript application, provide the `onFetchConnectionToken` function. You must also provide the `onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` function to handle unexpected disconnects from the reader.

### Discover readers

The Stripe Terminal SDK comes with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. To use the simulated reader, call `discoverReaders` to search for readers, with the simulated option set to true. ​To discover intended readers more easily, filter by location.

### Connect to the simulated reader

When `discoverReaders` returns a result, call `connectReader` to connect to the simulated reader.

### Create a PaymentIntent

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a PaymentIntent. A PaymentIntent tracks the customer’s payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed payment attempts and ensuring they’re only charged once. Return the PaymentIntent’s client secret in the response. If you’re using Connect, you can also specify [connected account information](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect.md) based on your platform’s charge logic.

### Fetch the PaymentIntent

Make a request to your server for a PaymentIntent to initiate the payment process.

### Collect payment method details

Call `collectPaymentMethod` with the PaymentIntent’s client secret to collect a payment method. When connected to the simulated reader, calling this method immediately updates the PaymentIntent object with a [simulated test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md#simulated-test-cards). When connected to a physical reader, the connected reader waits for a card to be presented.

### Process the payment

After successfully collecting payment method data, call `processPayment` with the updated PaymentIntent to process the payment. A successful call results in a PaymentIntent with a status of `requires_capture` for manual capture or `succeeded` for automatic capture.

### Create an endpoint to capture the PaymentIntent

Create an endpoint on your back end that accepts a PaymentIntent ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it.

### Capture the PaymentIntent

If you defined `capture_method` as `manual` during PaymentIntent creation, the SDK returns an authorized but not captured PaymentIntent to your application. When the PaymentIntent status is `requires_capture`, notify your back end to capture the PaymentIntent.

For connected accounts, before manually capturing a payment, inspect the PaymentIntent’s ‘application_fee_amount’ and modify it if needed.

### Run the application

Run your server and go to [localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242).

### Use a test card number to try your integration

You can configure the simulated reader to test different flows within your point of sale application such as different card brands or error scenarios like a declined charge. To enable this behavior, insert this line of code before you call `collectPaymentMethod`.

| Scenario            | Card Number      |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Payment succeeds    | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment is declined | 4000000000009995 |

### Create Locations for your readers

[Create Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md) to organize your readers. Locations group readers and allow them to automatically download the reader configuration needed for their region of use. You must assign a Location to each reader when you [register it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers.md), which you can do using the API or the Dashboard.

### Configure your app

To prepare your app to work with the Stripe Terminal SDK, make a few changes to your Info.plist file in Xcode.

#### Location

Enable location services with the following key-value pair.

```bash
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Location access is required to accept payments.</string>
```

#### Background Modes

Make sure that your app runs in the background and remains connected to Bluetooth readers.

```bash
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>\n<array>\n<string>bluetooth-central</string>\n</array>
```

#### Bluetooth Peripheral

Pass app validation checks when submitting to the App Store.

```bash
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Bluetooth access is required to connect to supported bluetooth card readers.</string>
```

#### Bluetooth Always

Allow your app to display a Bluetooth permission dialog.

```bash
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>\n<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers.</string>
```

### Fetch ConnectionToken

Implement the ConnectionTokenProvider protocol in your app, which defines a single function that requests a connection token from your back end.

### Initialize the SDK

To get started, provide your ConnectionTokenProvider. You can only call `setTokenProvider` once in your app, and must call it before accessing `Terminal.shared`.

### Discover readers

The Stripe Terminal SDK comes with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. To use the simulated reader, call `discoverReaders` to search for readers, with the simulated option set to true.

### Connect to the simulated reader

When the `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders` delegate method is called, call `connectReader` to connect to the simulated reader.

### Create a PaymentIntent

Create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) object using the SDK. A PaymentIntent tracks the customer’s payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed payment attempts and ensuring the customer is only charged once.

### Process the PaymentIntent

Call `processPaymentIntent` with the PaymentIntent to collect a payment method and authorize the payment. When connected to the simulated reader, calling this method immediately updates the PaymentIntent object with a [simulated test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md#simulated-test-cards). When connected to a physical reader, the connected reader waits for a card to be presented. A successful call results in a PaymentIntent with a status of `requires_capture` for manual capture, or `succeeded` for automatic capture.

### Create an endpoint to capture the PaymentIntent

Create an endpoint on your back end that accepts a PaymentIntent ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it.

> #### Terminal access on macOS
> 
> The Stripe Terminal SDK requires local network access. When using macOS, you must explicitly allow your browser apps access to local network devices. For more information, see the [Stripe Support article](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ensuring-stripe-terminal-javascript-sdk-functionality-on-macos-15).

### Create a ConnectionToken endpoint

To connect to a reader, your back end needs to give the SDK permission to use it with your Stripe account by providing it with the secret from a [ConnectionToken](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/connection_tokens.md). Create connection tokens only for trusted clients, and [pass a location ID](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md#connection-tokens) when creating a connection token to control access to readers. ​​If you’re using Connect, [scope the connection token](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect.md) to the relevant connected accounts.

### Install the SDK

To install the SDK, add `stripeterminal` to the dependencies block of your build.gradle file.

#### Gradle

Add the dependencies to your build.gradle file:

#### Groovy

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...

    // Stripe Terminal SDK
    implementation 'com.stripe:stripeterminal:5.0.0'
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...

    // Stripe Terminal SDK
    implementation("com.stripe:stripeterminal:5.0.0")
}
```

#### GitHub

The Stripe Android SDK is open-sourced. [View on GitHub.](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android)

### Install the SDK

To install the Tap to Pay SDK, add `stripeterminal-taptopay` and `stripeterminal-core` to the dependencies block of your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file.

If you already have `stripeterminal` dependencies, replace them with the following by adding the dependencies to your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file:

#### Groovy

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...

    // Stripe Tap to Pay SDK
    implementation 'com.stripe:stripeterminal-taptopay:5.0.0'
    implementation 'com.stripe:stripeterminal-core:5.0.0'
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...

    // Stripe Tap to Pay SDK
    implementation("com.stripe:stripeterminal-taptopay:5.0.0")
    implementation("com.stripe:stripeterminal-core:5.0.0")
}
```

### Create Locations for your readers

[Create Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md) to organize your readers. Locations group readers and allow them to automatically download the reader configuration needed for their region of use. You must assign a Location to each reader when you [register it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers.md), which you can do using the API or the Dashboard.

### Verify ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission

Add a check to make sure that the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission is enabled in your app.

### Verify user location permission

Override the `onRequestPermissionsResult` method in your app and check the permission result to verify that the app user grants location permission.

### Fetch ConnectionToken

Implement the ConnectionTokenProvider interface in your app, which defines a single function that requests a connection token from your back end.

### Configure TerminalApplicationDelegate

To prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of long-running Terminal SDK processes, your application must subclass `Application` and call out to the `TerminalApplicationDelegate` from the `onCreate` method.

### Initialize the SDK

To get started, provide the current application context, the ConnectionTokenProvider, and a TerminalListener object.

### Discover readers

The Stripe Terminal SDK comes with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. To use the simulated reader, call `discoverReaders` to search for readers, with the simulated option set to true.

### Discover readers

The Stripe Terminal SDK comes with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. To use the simulated reader, call `discoverReaders` to search for readers, with the simulated option set to true. To discover intended readers more easily, filter by location.

### Connect to the simulated reader

When `discoverReaders` returns a result, call `connectReader` to connect to the simulated reader.

### Create a PaymentIntent

Create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) object using the SDK. A PaymentIntent tracks the customer’s payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed payment attempts and ensuring the customer is only charged once.

### Process the PaymentIntent

Call `processPaymentIntent` with the PaymentIntent to collect a payment method and authorize the payment. When connected to the simulated reader, calling this method immediately updates the PaymentIntent object with a [simulated test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md#simulated-test-cards). When connected to a physical reader, the connected reader waits for a card to be presented. A successful call results in a PaymentIntent with a status of `requires_capture` for manual capture, or `succeeded` for automatic capture.

### Create an endpoint to capture the PaymentIntent

Create an endpoint on your back end that accepts a PaymentIntent ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it.

### Capture the PaymentIntent

If you defined `capture_method` as `manual` during PaymentIntent creation, the SDK returns an authorized but not captured PaymentIntent to your application. When the PaymentIntent status is `requires_capture`, notify your back end to capture the PaymentIntent.

For connected accounts, before manually capturing a payment, inspect the PaymentIntent’s `application_fee_amount` and modify it if needed.

### Run the application

Run your server and go to [localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242).

### Use a test card number to try your integration

You can configure the simulated reader to test different flows within your point of sale application such as different card brands or error scenarios like a declined charge. To enable this behavior, insert this line of code before you call `collectPaymentMethod`.

| Scenario            | Card Number      |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Payment succeeds    | 4242424242424242 |
| Payment is declined | 4000000000009995 |

Create connection tokens only for trusted clients, and [pass a location ID](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md#connection-tokens) when creating a connection token to control access to readers. ​​If you’re using Connect, [scope the connection token](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect.md) to the relevant connected accounts.

### Install the SDK

```bash
yarn install @stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
```

### Create Locations for your readers

[Create Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones.md) to organize your readers. Locations group readers and allow them to automatically download the reader configuration needed for their region of use. You must assign a Location to each reader when you [register it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers.md), which you can do using the API or the Dashboard.

### Fetch ConnectionToken

To give the SDK access to this endpoint, create a function in your web application that requests a ConnectionToken from your back end and returns the secret from the ConnectionToken object.

### Configure permissions

#### Android

Add a check to make sure that the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission is enabled in your app.

#### iOS

To prepare your app to work with the Stripe Terminal SDK, make a few changes to your Info.plist file in Xcode.

#### Location

Enable location services with the following key-value pair.

```bash
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Location access is required to accept payments.</string>
```

#### Background Modes

Make sure that your app runs in the background and remains connected to Bluetooth readers.

```bash
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>\n<array>\n<string>bluetooth-central</string>\n</array>
```

#### Bluetooth Peripheral

Pass app validation checks when submitting to the App Store.

```bash
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Bluetooth access is required to connect to supported bluetooth card readers.</string>
```

#### Bluetooth Always

Allow your app to display a Bluetooth permission dialog.

```bash
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>\n<string>This app uses Bluetooth to connect to supported card readers.</string>
```

### Set up the context provider

Pass the `onFetchConnectionToken` function to `StripeTerminalProvider` as a prop.

### Initialize the SDK

To initialize a `StripeTerminal` instance in your React Native application, call the initialize method from `useStripeTerminal` hook. You must call the `initialize` method from a component nested within `StripeTerminalProvider` and not from the component that contains the `StripeTerminalProvider`.

### Discover readers

The Stripe Terminal SDK comes with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. To use the simulated reader, call `discoverReaders` to search for readers, with the simulated option set to true.

### Connect to the simulated reader

When `discoverReaders` returns a result, call `connectReader` to connect to the simulated reader.

### Create a PaymentIntent

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a PaymentIntent. A PaymentIntent tracks the customer’s payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed payment attempts and ensuring they’re only charged once. Return the PaymentIntent’s client secret in the response. If you’re using Connect, you can also specify [connected account information](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect.md) based on your platform’s charge logic.

### Fetch the PaymentIntent

Make a request to your server for a PaymentIntent to initiate the payment process.

### Collect payment method details

Call `collectPaymentMethod` with the PaymentIntent’s client secret to collect a payment method. When connected to the simulated reader calling this method immediately updates the PaymentIntent object with a [simulated test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing.md#simulated-test-cards). When connected to a physical reader the connected reader waits for a card to be presented.

### Process the payment

After successfully collecting payment method data, call `processPayment` with the updated PaymentIntent to process the payment. A successful call results in a PaymentIntent with a status of `requires_capture` for manual capture or `succeeded` for automatic capture.

### Create an endpoint to capture the PaymentIntent

Create an endpoint on your back end that accepts a PaymentIntent ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it.

### Capture the PaymentIntent

If you defined `capture_method` as `manual` during PaymentIntent creation, the SDK returns an authorized but not captured PaymentIntent to your application. When the PaymentIntent status is `requires_capture`, notify your back end to capture the PaymentIntent.
