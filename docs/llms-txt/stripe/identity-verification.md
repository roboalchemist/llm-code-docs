# Identity verification for connected accounts

Use identity verification to reduce risk on your platform when using Connect.

Every country has its own requirements that accounts must meet so that Stripe can pay out funds to individuals and companies. These are typically known as [Know Your Customer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations) (KYC) requirements. Regardless of the country, broadly speaking, the requirements Stripe must meet are:

- Collecting information about the individual or company receiving funds
- Verifying information to establish that we know who our customers are

*Connect* (Connect is Stripe's solution for multi-party businesses, such as marketplace or software platforms, to route payments between sellers, customers, and other recipients) platforms collect the required information from users and provide it to Stripe. This can include information about the legal entity and personal information about the representative of the business, and those who own or control the business. Stripe then attempts verification. In some cases, Stripe might be able to verify an account by confirming some or all of the keyed-in data provided. In other cases, Stripe might require additional information, including, for example, a scan of a valid government-issued ID, a proof of address document, or both.

This page explains the verification flow options to meet Stripe KYC requirements, but the recommended way to manage verification is to integrate [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding.md), which lets Stripe take care of the complexity around the basic KYC obligations. Handling the details of account verification is initially complex and requires vigilance to keep up with the constantly evolving regulatory changes around the world.

If you decide to handle account verification yourself, continue reading to learn about the verification flow options, how API fields translate to companies and individuals, and how to localize information requests. Also, read [Handling Identity Verification with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification.md) to learn how to programmatically provide information and handle requests.

Even after Stripe verifies a connected account, platforms still must [monitor for and prevent fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices.md#fraud). Don’t rely on Stripe’s verification to meet any independent legal KYC or verification requirements.

## Verification requirements 

Verification requirements for connected accounts vary by account, depending on:

- Country
- Capabilities
- Business type (for example, individual, company)
- Business structure (for example, public corporation, private partnership)
- The service agreement type between Stripe and the connected account
- The risk level

You must collect and verify specific information to enable charges and *payouts* (A payout is the transfer of funds to an external account, usually a bank account, in the form of a deposit). For example, for a company in the US, you might need to collect:

- Information about the business (for example, name, address, tax ID number).
- Information about the person opening the Stripe account (for example, name, date of birth).
- Information about [beneficial owners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions) (for example, name, email).

At certain variable thresholds—usually when a specified amount of time has passed or volume of charges have been made—you might need to collect and verify additional information. Stripe temporarily pauses charges or payouts if the information isn’t provided or verified according to the thresholds for [required information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information.md). For example, additional information might include verification of the company tax ID number.

## Onboarding flows 

As the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information from your connected accounts *up front* (Upfront onboarding is a type of onboarding where you collect all required verification information from your users at sign-up) or *incrementally* (Incremental onboarding is a type of onboarding where you gradually collect required verification information from your users. You collect a minimum amount of information at sign-up, and you collect more information as the connected account earns more revenue). Up-front onboarding collects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental onboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.

| Onboarding type | Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Up-front**    | - Normally requires only one request for all information
  - Avoids the possibility of payout and processing issues due to missed deadlines
  - Exposes potential risk early when accounts refuse to provide information |
| **Incremental** | - Accounts can onboard quickly because they don’t have to provide as much information                                                                                                                                    |

To determine whether to use up-front or incremental onboarding, review the [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information.md) for your connected accounts’ locations and capabilities. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact to connected accounts, requirements might change over time.

For connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can customize the behavior of [future requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates.md) using the `collection_options` parameter. To collect the account’s future requirements, set [`collection_options.future_requirements`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create.md#create_account_link-collection_options-future_requirements) to `include`.

## Business type 

The specific KYC information depends on the [type of business entity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object.md#account_object-business_type). They’re:

- `individual`: Collect information about the person.
- `company`: Collect information about the company. Depending on the countries your connected accounts are in, you might also have to collect information about [beneficial owners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions).
- `non_profit`: Collect information about the non-profit organization.
- `government_entity` (available for US connected accounts only): Collect information about the government entity.

If you or your users are unsure of their entity type, the information might be in the business formation documents or tax documents for that entity.

See the [list of requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information.md) for different business types by country. When you know what information to collect, you can read more about [handling identity verification with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification.md).

## Business structure 

For all business types other than `individual`, you can further classify your user’s business by identifying its legal (business) structure. A business structure describes the details of a business entity such as day-to-day operations, tax burdens, liability, and organizational schema. You can classify it by using [company[structure]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create.md#create_account-company-structure) in the `Accounts` object.

Providing this information to Stripe gets you the most accurate business classification for compliance purposes. While it isn’t required, it can reduce onboarding requirements. For example, you’re required to provide owner information for private companies, but not for public companies. If you don’t provide information on the `structure`, Stripe defaults to classifying the company as private and requires you to provide owner information. See the [list of requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information.md) for the supported business structures in all countries.

## Internationalization and localization

If you support users in multiple countries, consider internationalization and localization when asking for information. Creating an interface that uses not only the user’s preferred language but also the proper localized terminology results in a smoother onboarding experience.

For example, instead of requesting a business tax ID from your users, regardless of country, request:

- EIN, US
- Business Number, Canada
- Company Number, UK

You can find recommended country-specific labels along with the other [required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information.md).
