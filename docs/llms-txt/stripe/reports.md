# Revenue Recognition reports

Generate and export revenue reports using Stripe Revenue Recognition.

Stripe Revenue Recognition automatically generates reports that you can view in the Stripe Dashboard and export as CSV files. These reports include key information such as revenue and deferred revenue. They’re available in both aggregate views for high-level analysis, and detailed views so you can validate&nbsp;data.

## Integration requirements 

Stripe Revenue Recognition assumes that you’ve properly modeled your business. This includes:

- Modeling subscriptions using [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview.md), and [customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer.md).
- Setting taxes using the [default_tax_rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-default_tax_rates) attribute, not as line items.
- Setting discounts using the [discount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object.md#subscription_object-discount) object, not as *invoice* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) items.

> Revenue recognition requirements vary based on a number of factors, including the location of your business and the goods and services that you sell. You need to make sure that you understand and comply with the requirements applicable to your business, and that you model your business accordingly.

## Dashboard 

The Revenue Recognition section of your Dashboard provides high-level information regarding the operations and financial health of your business. It includes [graphs for recognized revenue and deferred revenue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition), a [monthly summary](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition), and a [revenue waterfall report](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/accounting-reports).

The Revenue Recognition section is also where you can manage your Stripe integration, such as [uploading your revenue data](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import), [defining custom rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules) on how to treat your revenue, and [mapping to the chart of accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/chart-of-accounts.md) that you use in your general ledger.

> Revenue Recognition generates reports from transactions processed by Stripe. Expect a 72 hour delay before the data displays in the Dashboard.
> 
> Also, all report information is accessible only after you [import the data](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import.md).

### Revenue graphs 

The revenue graphs in the Dashboard provide a high-level view of your business by displaying revenue activity over time. The recognized revenue graph shows your net recognized revenue and the deferred revenue graph shows your ending balance per month.

The monthly and daily charts differentiate between open and closed accounting periods using colors. The figures continue to change until the accounting period closes. Toggling to the daily view provides a day-by-day snapshot of recognized and deferred revenue for the selected month. Revenue from usage-based billing is recognized in full when invoices finalize, or when the accounting period closes.

### AR aging graphs 

The accounts receivable (AR) aging graphs in the Dashboard provide a high-level view of your accounts receivable activity over time. Use this information to understand the financial health of your customers. The balance graph shows the outstanding invoice amounts for the specified periods. The summary table shows unpaid invoice amounts and categorizes them by how long the invoices have been outstanding for the specified period.

### Monthly summary 

The [monthly summary](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/monthly-summary.md) provides a detailed breakdown of activity for the last complete month. Use this information to understand how your activity affected revenue and to book journal entries. You can also see activity that contributed to your net revenue. For example, you can see the portions of new billings that you recognized, and contra revenue items. This section also lists changes to deferred revenue based on your activity, like portions of new billings that you haven’t recognized and contra revenue items.

The monthly summary only shows details if you had activity.&nbsp;For example, if you don’t have any contra revenue, the monthly summary doesn’t include it.

### Revenue waterfall 

The [revenue waterfall](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/waterfall.md), sometimes called a revenue schedule chart, displays expected recognizable revenue over time. Use this to understand how activity from each period affects revenue in future periods.

This report shows expected revenue amounts based on historical billings. It doesn’t model future billings and it doesn’t predict future revenue from those potential billings. The expected future revenue amounts change as you add future billings.

### Statements and CSV reports 

Use the [Statements tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/statements) to access all key financial reports associated with revenue recognition in Stripe. You can view summaries and detailed breakdowns, download financial documents, and share feedback on the reports.
