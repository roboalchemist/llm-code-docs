## Recurring revenue recovery options

Stripe recommends including the following recurring revenue recovery options in your integration. As you complete each item, check it off. Your browser’s cache stores the state of each checkbox so you can refer back to this page to see what you’ve completed so far.

- [ ] Set up failed payment retries
      Retrying failed payments is one of the most effective ways to recover revenue. It requires no manual intervention from you or the customer.

      You can set up Smart Retries and custom retry schedules in the Stripe Dashboard without writing any code. Smart Retries use data points to find the best time to retry the payment and are more effective than scheduled retries.

- [ ] Set up automatic customer emails
      Set up automated customer emails to notify customers of possible issues. You can enable these based on your business’s use cases. Many businesses use failed payment and 3D Secure emails to help customers immediately fix failing payments.
