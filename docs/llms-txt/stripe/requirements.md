# Financial Accounts for platforms requirements

Understand the requirements for using Stripe Financial Accounts for platforms.

*Financial Accounts for platforms* (A collection of API endpoints and cloud- and web-based features that enable platforms to offer embedded financial solutions to their users) have compliance requirements and restrictions in addition to those needed for [Stripe Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments.md). They apply to both the platform and its connected accounts. Offer your Financial Accounts-based financial services only to businesses that meet the requirements.

## Fraud management process

Stripe requires that Financial Accounts platforms maintain a fraud risk management process. The process must include proactive measures to prevent and monitor unauthorized or fraudulent activity, and take steps to remediate it. This includes:

- Establishing processes to identify and understand the business of your customers.
- Implementing robust tools to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts.
- Educating Connected Accounts on how fraud can occur, and establishing a robust process for alerting Connected Accounts when suspected fraud occurs.
- Conducting root cause analyses after fraud incidents occur to identify opportunities to improve controls.

See the [Financial Accounts for platforms Fraud guide](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-accounts/connect/examples/fraud-guide.md) for best practices on implementing and maintaining a fraud risk management program.

## Supported countries

Stripe Financial Accounts for platforms are available only to platforms and connected accounts located in the United States. To be considered a US business, you must be able to demonstrate:

- Your business physically operates from an address within the United States and that address can’t be a PO box, highway contract box, or private mailbox.
- Your business has at least one account representative that lives at an address within the United States.  That address can’t be a PO box, highway contract box, or private mailbox.

Business owners that reside in certain countries outside of the US are permissible, but might require enhanced review. Additionally, you can’t use the Financial Account to send or receive funds to or from sources outside the United States. Stripe prohibits using Financial Accounts for any dealings, engagement, or sale of goods or services linked directly or indirectly with jurisdictions Stripe has deemed high risk, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions.

## Business use cases only

Stripe Financial Accounts for platforms are available only to platforms with B2B use cases. Stripe doesn’t offer financial accounts to consumers or provide Financial Accounts for platforms features for consumer purposes.

## Connected account types

Financial Accounts for platforms only supports connected accounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted dashboard and where your platform is responsible for requirements collection and loss liability, including Custom connected accounts. Learn how to [create connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration.md?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct) that work with Financial Accounts for platforms.

As a platform with connected accounts, you’re responsible for maintaining a minimum API version, communicating terms of service updates to your connected accounts, handling information requests from them, and providing them with support. Because your platform is ultimately responsible for the losses your connected accounts incur, you’re also responsible for vetting them for fraud. To learn more, read the [Financial Accounts for platforms fraud guide](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-accounts/connect/examples/fraud-guide.md).

## Supported countries of residence

Stripe Financial Accounts for platforms currently supports businesses in the US only, but the business owners and authorized persons of those businesses can reside in over 150 countries. Some countries of residence, however, can require a more detailed review before you can onboard them to your platform.

Stripe prohibits using Financial Accounts for platforms for any dealings, engagement, or sale of goods or services linked directly or indirectly with jurisdictions Stripe has deemed high risk, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions.
