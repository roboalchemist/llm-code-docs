# Account capabilities

Learn about capabilities you can enable for accounts and the requirements you must satisfy to use them.

Capabilities represent functionality that you can request for your connected accounts, such as accepting card payments or receiving transferred funds from your platform account. A capability must be active for a connected account to perform actions associated with that capability.

> #### Testing capabilities
> 
> Sandboxes and test mode might not enforce some capabilities. In certain cases, they can allow an account to perform capability-dependent actions even when the associated capability’s `status` isn’t `active`.

Most capabilities require verification of certain information about the connected account’s business before Stripe enables them for that account. The capabilities you request for a connected account determine the information you’re required to collect for that account. To reduce onboarding effort, only request the capabilities that your accounts need. Requesting more capabilities means the onboarding flow must verify more information.

You can start by completing the [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/profile) to understand which capabilities might be appropriate for your platform.

> For some capabilities, requesting them enables them permanently. Attempting to remove or unrequest a permanent capability returns an error.

After creating an account, you can request additional capabilities and remove existing non-permanent capabilities. For connected accounts that [other platforms control](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts.md), you can’t unrequest capabilities.

## Supported capabilities 

Following is a list of available capabilities. Click an item to expand or collapse it.

### Transfers

You can transfer funds to connected accounts that have the `transfers` capability. On-demand platforms often use it to pay their connected accounts. For example, a ride-hailing platform could use this capability so they can pay their drivers. The following diagram illustrates the flow of funds and the relationship between customers, the platform, and connected accounts.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/capabilities-transfers.aced7a090e53052eb74ee8185e5919c9.svg)

Relationship between customers, the platform, and connected accounts.

When you use the `transfers` capability, your platform, not the connected account, processes charges. Therefore, a connected account’s customers’ bank statements display your platform’s statement descriptor, not the connected account’s.

Payments using the `transfers` capability include [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md) and [Separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md).

> Before the [2019-08-14](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades.md#2019-08-14) API version, the `transfers` capability was referred to as `platform_payments`. If you’re using an API version older than 2019-08-14, use `platform_payments`.

#### Cross-border transfers 

Moving money across country borders introduces additional requirements and is supported in the following scenarios only:

- European Union, United Kingdom, and Gibraltar platforms sending funds to [SEPA countries](https://support.stripe.com/questions/countries-in-the-european-economic-area-\(eea\)-impacted-by-strong-customer-authentication-\(sca\)-regulation).
- US platforms sending funds to [cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts.md) destinations using a [recipient service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types.md#recipient).

For other scenarios, create a platform account in the same region as your connected accounts. Depending on your business structure, that might require creating a legal entity in that region and additional work to onboard connected accounts.

### Card payments

Connected accounts with the `card_payments` capability can receive payments from your platform and directly process card and ACH payments. An e-commerce storefront with this capability, for example, can collect its own payments. The following diagram illustrates the flow of funds and the relationship between customers, connected accounts, and the platform:
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/capabilities-cardpayments.c3ef9c11049f87931c9a72e56d38559e.svg)

Relationship between customers, connected accounts, and the platform.

For an account to have the `card_payments` capability, you must request both `card_payments` and `transfers`.

When a connected account has this capability, its customers’ bank statements display the connected account’s statement descriptor, not the platform’s.

The `card_payments` capability applies to [all charge types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges.md).

### US tax reporting

The [US Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/) (IRS) requires some platforms to file 1099 forms with the IRS between January and March, and to deliver the reporting of those filings to their connected accounts by January 31. To file the forms, those platforms must collect additional information from their connected accounts.

> Stripe recommends that you consult a tax advisor to determine your tax filing and reporting requirements.

If your platform has federal 1099 filing requirements and you decide to file through Stripe, you can use the `tax_reporting_us_1099_misc` and `tax_reporting_us_1099_k` capabilities to collect the necessary personal and business information from your connected accounts.

### 1099-MISC form

Many types of payments require an IRS Form 1099-MISC, such as payments to non-employees or contractors, royalties, prizes, and so forth. The `tax_reporting_us_1099_misc` capability helps you collect the required information for Form 1099-MISC. For example, a creator platform could use the `tax_reporting_us_1099_misc` capability to [collect the necessary information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes.md#required-information) from their content providers for tax filing season.

### 1099-K form

A 1099-K form reports payments received from credit card transactions and third-party payment networks. Traditionally, third-party settlement organizations have used Form 1099-K to report their gross payment transactions in a calendar year. For example, an e-commerce platform uses the `tax_reporting_us_1099_k` capability to [collect the necessary tax filing information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes.md#required-information) from each storefront.

For more details on tax reporting for US-based connected accounts, see [Manage Tax Forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-reporting.md).

### Payment methods

Some [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview.md) are enabled by the `card_payments` capabilty, while others are enabled by their own capability.

If you’re charging and then paying out, check your Dashboard to see which payment methods you can use.

To enable connected accounts to accept a payment method for direct charges or charges with `on_behalf_of`, you must request that payment method’s capability for those accounts.

#### Account Dashboard access - Full Stripe Dashboard

For connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard, including Standard accounts, most payment method capabilities are enabled by default. Those accounts can manage their own payment method capabilities. You can also request capabilities for them by [calling the capabilities update API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update.md), and list an account’s enabled capabilities by [calling the accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve.md).

In the following table, the **All business types supported** column indicates that all business types are supported unless prohibited by Stripe. The **Additional verification requirements** column refers to requirements in addition to those for the `card_payments` capability.

For connected accounts that don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard, which includes Express and Custom accounts, you must request payment method capabilities for those accounts. Some capabilities have business type restrictions, country restrictions, or additional information requirements for sole proprietors. In the following table, the **All business types supported** column indicates that all business types are supported unless prohibited by Stripe. The **Additional verification requirements** column refers to requirements in addition to those for the `card_payments` capability.

### India international payments

You must request the capability to  support transactions from buyers located outside of India who use a currency different than INR. Complete the following during your onboarding process to enable international payments:

1. **Specify a transaction purpose code**. The `export_purpose_code` field describes the nature of a payment received in foreign currency. The complete list of transaction purpose codes is maintained by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). You can find the subset of transaction purpose codes that are supported by Stripe in the [Transaction Purpose Code Listing](https://docs.stripe.com/india-accept-international-payments.md#TransactionPurposeCode).

1. **Specify your importer/exporter code (IEC)**. The `export_license_id` field holds the value for the IEC code. This code is issued by the Indian Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to India. You can apply for an IEC at the [DGFT website](https://dgft.gov.in/CP/). An IEC is required under certain conditions.

   - If you plan to accept Visa or Mastercard, an IEC is required only if you sell physical goods. Your `export_purpose_code` is for physical goods.
   - If you plan to accept [AMEX international payments](https://support.stripe.com/questions/american-express-card-support-for-india-based-businesses) for all export transactions, including selling physical goods and services. This is described by India’s Foreign Trade Policy.

For more details, see [Accept International Payments from India](https://docs.stripe.com/india-accept-international-payments.md)

## Multiple capabilities 

Requesting multiple capabilities for a connected account is common, but involves the following considerations:

- Capabilities operate independently of each other.
- If a connected account has both `card_payments` and `transfers`, and the `status` of either one is `inactive`, then both capabilities are disabled.
- You can request or unrequest most capabilities for a connected account at any time during the account’s lifecycle.

Capabilities also allow you to collect information for multiple purposes at the same time. For example, you can collect both required tax information and the information required for a requested capability.

## Request capabilities for an Account 

Capabilities are set on the [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object.md) object. To get the list of available capabilities for an Account, use the [list_capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/list.md?lang=curl) endpoint.

Account creation and requesting capabilities differ for connected accounts in different configurations.

- For connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard, including Standard accounts, some capabilities are requested automatically, based on their country. You can also request other capabilities for them.
- For connected accounts with access to the Express Dashboard, including Express accounts, you can either request their capabilities or use the [onboarding configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries) to automate capability requests.
- For connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, including Custom accounts, you must request their capabilities.

Information requirements vary depending on the capability, but they often relate to identity verification or other information specific to a payment type.

When your connected account is successfully created, you can [retrieve a list](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve.md) of its requirements:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:"
```

```cli
stripe accounts retrieve {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

account = client.v1.accounts.retrieve('{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}')
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
account = client.v1.accounts.retrieve("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}")
```

```php
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$account = $stripe->accounts->retrieve('{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}', []);
```

```java
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeClient client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

AccountRetrieveParams params = AccountRetrieveParams.builder().build();

// For SDK versions 29.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1()' from the following line.
Account account =
  client.v1().accounts().retrieve("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}", params);
```

```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const account = await stripe.accounts.retrieve('{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}');
```

```go
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.AccountRetrieveParams{
  Account: stripe.String("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}"),
}
result, err := sc.V1Accounts.GetByID(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.

var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Accounts;
Account account = service.Get("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}");
```

In the response, the `requirements` hash specifies the required information. The values for `payouts_enabled` and `charges_enabled` indicate whether payouts and charges are enabled for the account.

## Capabilities for existing connected accounts 

The following sections describe how to preview information requirements or manage capabilities for existing connected accounts using the [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities.md).

### Preview information requirements 

You can preview what information is needed from your connected account for a particular capability either before or after that capability has been requested.

When you request capabilities, `account.updated` *webhooks* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) fire and the account’s requirements can change. To enable a requirement faster and avoid disabling the account, preview the requirements and collect any required information before requesting the capability.

The following example [lists](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve.md) the requirements for the `card_payments` capability for a specific account.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}/capabilities/card_payments \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:"
```

```cli
stripe capabilities retrieve {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}} card_payments
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

capability = client.v1.accounts.capabilities.retrieve(
  '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}',
  'card_payments',
)
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.

```

Capability capability = service.Get("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}", "card_payments");
```

In the response, check the `requirements` hash to see what information is needed:

```json
{
  "id": "card_payments",
  "object": "capability",
  "account": ""{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}"",
  "requested": false,
  "requested_at": null,
  "requirements": {
    "past_due": [],
    "currently_due": ["company.tax_id", ...],
    "eventually_due": [...],
    "disabled_reason": ...,
    "current_deadline": ...,
  },
  "status": "unrequested"
}
```

The value for `status` identifies whether the capability has been requested. When the value is [requested](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities.md#requesting-unrequesting), the account’s requirements are active.

In addition to previewing a capability’s requirements before requesting it, you can use the same endpoint to view a capability’s current requirements. That can help you stay informed when requirements change.

### Request and unrequest capabilities 

To request a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value to `true` by [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update.md). If the request succeeds, the API returns `requested: true` in the response.

To unrequest a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value to `false` by [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update.md). If the capability can’t be removed, the call returns an error. If the call succeeds, the API returns `requested: false` in the response.

You can also [request and remove an account’s capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts.md#updating-capabilities) from the Dashboard. If a capability can’t be removed, its **Remove** button is disabled.

The example below requests the `transfers` capability for a specific connected account:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}/capabilities/transfers \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d requested=true
```

```cli
stripe capabilities update {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}} transfers \
  --requested=true
```

## Deprecated capabilities

Capabilities described in the following sections are deprecated. If possible, don’t request them for new accounts. If you have existing accounts that use deprecated capabilities, we recommend that you update them to use other capabilities instead.

### legacy_payments

The `legacy_payments` capability enables charges, payouts, and transfers. Newer accounts enable those actions using the `card_payments` and `transfers` capabilities, which support more flexible configurations.

We recommend that you take the following steps:

1. Update your connected account onboarding process to request the appropriate combination of `card_payments` and `transfers` instead of `legacy_payments`.

1. Update your existing connected accounts to request the appropriate combination of `card_payments` and `transfers`.

1. Update any code that checks the status of `legacy_payments` to check the status of either `legacy_payments` or the appropriate new capability. For example, update code that relies on an account’s ability to make card payments to run when either `legacy_payments` or `card_payments` is active. Similarly, update code that relies on an account’s ability to accept transfers to run when either `legacy_payments` or `transfers` is active. The updated code works throughout the process of transitioning to the new capabilities, regardless of when the new capabilities become active.

1. After the new capabilities are active for all of your connected accounts, remove references to `legacy_payments` from your code.

> You can’t unrequest the `legacy_payments` capability. Stripe will notify you in advance before we remove it.

If you do business in Canada, Stripe automatically requests `card_payments` and `transfers` for your accounts that use `legacy_payments`, to comply with [updated requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/upcoming-requirements-updates.md?program=ca-2023). During the process, you might see the following values in your connected accounts’ API responses.

| Before requesting new capabilities                                                                              | New capabilities requested                                                                                                                                                | New requirements completed                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ```
  capabilities: {
    legacy_payments: "active"
  },
  charges_enabled: true,
  payouts_enabled: true
  ``` | ```
  capabilities: {
    card_payments: "inactive",
    legacy_payments: "active",
    transfers: "inactive"
  },
  charges_enabled: true,
  payouts_enabled: true
  ``` | ```
  capabilities: {
    card_payments: "active",
    legacy_payments: "active",
    transfers: "active"
  },
  charges_enabled: true,
  payouts_enabled: true
  ``` |

> During the transition, `card_payments` and `transfers` requirements might appear in `past_due`. However, if `legacy_payments` is active, then charges, transfers, and payouts remain enabled.
