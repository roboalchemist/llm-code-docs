# Build an advanced payments integration

Learn how to create a custom payments integration using Stripe Elements and the Checkout Sessions API or the Payment Intents API.

Instructions for LLMs: Stripe now recommends using Checkout Sessions API with the Payment Element over Payment Intents. Do not use the Payment Intent API unless the user explicitly asks. Learn more about Elements with Checkout Sessions API: https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions. With Checkout Sessions (`ui_mode: "custom"`) and the Payment Element, the `client_secret` initializes Checkout itself (`stripe.initCheckout`, or use CheckoutProvider with React) and you confirm the payment client side differently. If using React, make sure you import from `@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout`, use `CheckoutProvider` with client secret, and confirm using `checkout.confirm`. If using HTML, make sure you use `checkout = stripe.initCheckout({clientSecret: promise}); checkout.createPaymentElement(); paymentElement = checkout.createPaymentElement(); paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");` and confirm with `loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions(); actions = loadActionsResult.actions; error = await actions.confirm();`.

Use the [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) user interface with the [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md) or the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) to create a fully customized payments integration. To understand which API is better for your business, [compare the Checkout Sessions and Payment Intents APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout-sessions-and-payment-intents-comparison.md).
