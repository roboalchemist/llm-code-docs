# Get started with tax reporting

Use the Stripe 1099 tax reporting product to create, modify, file, and deliver tax forms for your connected accounts.

Stripe provides [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities.md#tax-reporting) and a tax reporting dashboard to help platforms meet their [tax reporting obligations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-tax-reporting-and-filing-for-platforms-and-marketplaces).

Log in to your Stripe account and use the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) view in the Dashboard to create, modify, file, and deliver 1099 tax forms for your connected accounts. If you use a [team](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams.md), only team members with the Tax Analyst or Administrator [user role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles.md) can access all tax-related features.

> Action forms in the `Needs attention` state to get missing name, address, and taxpayer ID (SSN or EIN) details from your connected accounts. You need this information for filing.

## Get ready for tax season

- [Configure](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting.md#set-tax-form-default-settings) your platform’s tax settings for tax year 2025. You need to do this even if you previously used the Stripe 1099 tax reporting product.
- Start reviewing [forms in the Needs attention state](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identify-forms-missing-information.md) with missing tax information.
- Starting in August, you can edit tax forms [in your Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=dashboard) or through [CSV](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=csv).
  - Provide any [missing identity information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identify-forms-missing-information.md) required for filing.
  - (Optional) [Update form totals](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md) to reflect payment transactions outside of Stripe.
  - (Optional) [Export transaction logs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods.md#export-transaction-logs) to check which Stripe transactions have contributed to a 1099 form’s total.
- If you’re planning to use e-delivery, enable both e-delivery and outreach from Stripe as delivery preferences in your [tax form settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms).

## Prepare for Stripe outreach to your connected accounts [October 30th]

- Publish a [support article](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-faqs.md) explaining the tax timeline and your partnership with Stripe for taxes. View the [example article](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-faqs.md).
- Required for e-delivery:
  - Use the *Missing Email Address* filter in your 1099 dashboard or [export tax forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=csv) as a CSV to identify missing email addresses, since Column B will be blank if the email is missing. [Update email addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update.md#update_account-email) with the Accounts API so we can email your connected accounts.
  - Make sure that your [Connect branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding) and your [support email address](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) are up to date.
  - Prepare your support teams for tax season 2025. View the [example FAQs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-faqs.md) your support team might receive from your connected accounts.
- Recommended for e-delivery:
  - Notify your connected accounts when Stripe outreach occurs. View the [example email copy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-communication.md#email-template:-post-stripe-email).

## Review tax form totals and identity information [December 31]

- Stripe begins [outreach](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough.md) to your connected accounts starting the week of November 3 if you have opted into e-delivery / outreach from Stripe. We recommend opting in by **January 5** so we can contact all of your accounts for pre-filing confirmation by January 15, the last possible day for automated outreach from Stripe. Note, we don’t send outreach emails to platforms’ connected accounts until *7 days* after you enable the setting.
- Continue [actioning forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identify-forms-missing-information.md) in `Needs attention` and reach out to accounts with missing information.
- Audit tax calculations on some 1099 tax forms.
- Verify your [tax form settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) so you’re ready to file 1099 tax forms in January.

## Prepare, file, and deliver 1099 tax forms [January 22]

- Input [State Tax Registration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements.md) or withholding numbers for all states where you plan to file.
- [File tax forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms.md) in your Stripe Dashboard no later than January 22. You can begin filing forms on January 12.
  - When you press ‘File’ Stripe files any forms in a ‘Ready’ or ‘Ready!’ state.
    - If you have forms in a ‘Needs Attention’ state and wish to file them, you need to [explicitly update the filing requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=csv#tax-form-status) for these forms before filing.
- Stripe e-delivers or postmarks tax forms for postal delivery by January 31.
- After February 13, payee identity updates (name, TIN, address) stop flowing onto the 1099 tax forms that haven’t been filed yet. This doesn’t impact forms that you already filed by February 13.

## Set tax form default settings

To configure the settings for tax forms in your account you must log in as the account owner. If you use a team, any user that has the Administrator user role for your account can configure settings. To get started with generating your tax forms for 2025, open the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) page of the Dashboard, and then click **Get started**.
![Tax dashboard with the get started button highlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-net-new-user-landing-experience.6ed30557253b2ce8785af2deff182a8b.png)

Choose the default tax form to generate for your connected accounts, the [calculation method](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods.md) to use for your tax form totals, the type of filer for your business, and the kind of transactions you process. We recommend that you use a tax advisor to determine which options are right for your business. You can change almost all [tax form settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings.md) at any time for the forms that you haven’t filed.
![Select a form type screen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step.9fdf3acbf457f95499c2bdaa81ce7c2c.png)

Select a form type
![Tax calculation screen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step1.a54d8be2498440b91e4229e8426424a6.png)

Select tax calculation
![Type of filer screen](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step2.dd51a20dca664351848d6b48572ef368.png)

Select type of filer

Select types of transactions processed

Next, confirm the business information that displays as the **Payer details** on all of your tax forms. Make any necessary changes, then click **Continue**.
![Business information screen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-business-info-step.56acf3720225276598592dffe50c9f34.png)

Next, add state registration or withholding IDs for the states you plan to file with. You can enter these at any time in the future through [tax form settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings.md). If you intend to file in either Delaware and Pennsylvania, include your state IDs during this step to prevent possible rejection of your filings.
![State filing screen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-state-filing-step.200b96a91d14dd22795110ac6865399e.png)

The next step involves choosing your delivery preferences to meet IRS obligations around delivering 1099 forms to payees. We offer two forms of [delivery](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/deliver-tax-forms.md):

- *E-delivery through an interface built by Stripe:* Owners of eligible connected accounts receive an electronic copy of the 1099 form through their Stripe interface. If the connected account previously did not have access to a Stripe interface, the Stripe Express Dashboard or Stripe Embedded Components may be used. Stripe sends an email invite to the connected account owners to confirm their tax details, collect their consent, and provide access to the electronic copy of the form. Read more about [how e-delivery works](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes.md).

- *Paper delivery through postal mail:* Stripe delivers the 1099 forms to the owners of eligible connected accounts through postal mail based on the address on the tax form. If e-delivery is enabled, but the connected account hasn’t provided e-delivery consent at the time of filing, we fall back on postal delivery to meet IRS obligations.

As a final step, you can view a summary of your tax form settings to confirm your choices. After you confirm your settings, the tax forms dashboard opens, where you can view all of your tax forms for 2025.
![Summary screen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-summary-step.5bdede405d7cfef3c01442f44794bd0a.png)

## View and filter tax forms

You can view all of the tax forms for your connected account using the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) dashboard. Click the appropriate tab to filter the forms displayed. To display the **State filing status**, **Federal filing status**, or **Delivery filing status** instead of **Overall filing status**, click the gear icon to the right of the column heading and select the status to display.
![Tax reporting page of the Dashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax_reporting_dashboard_new.c5898c0728da3cc9b274a72c2dd13229.png)

You can apply any of the existing filters to limit the results to only those records that match the filter criteria. For example, to display only records for a specific payee, choose the Payee name filter and then enter all or part of a name to match. The records displayed include only the records for payees with Payee names that match the string you used for the filter.

You can use the following filters to display tax forms:

| Filter name                    | Filter values                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Understand tax form status

Stripe automatically calculates the overall status for each tax form, and allows you to apply filing requirements for each form as appropriate. The [filing requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=csv#tax-form-status) appears as a visual indicator in the tax form status. You can view the status for both State and Federal tax forms.

| Status          | Description                                                                                                                                                         | Next steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Exported        | The tax form was included in a state filing export, which you can find on the [bulk jobs listing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms/?showJobs=true). | You must download the export and manually submit these to the appropriate state reporting agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Needs attention | The tax form is above the IRS or state threshold, but requires additional information before filing.                                                                | Most tax forms require additional information before filing. You can [update the form](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md) or update the connected account. If you determine that you shouldn’t file the tax form, or you want to file with incomplete information, you can [update the filing requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md).                                                                               |

## Understand tax form TIN status

Platforms need valid TINs on the tax forms to ensure that the IRS and/or state accepts the forms, and Stripe displays the status of the TIN in the Tax Form Editor as follows:

| Status      | Description                                                                      | Next steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Verified    | Name & TIN are verified                                                          | No further action required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Mismatch    | Name + TIN didn’t match the records in IRS and need to be resolved before filing | Follow up with the account to get a name + TIN that matches IRS records. If you still want to file the form in this state, change the [Filing requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms.md?method=csv#tax-form-status) to **Required even if incomplete**. |
| Overwritten | Platform has overwritten the Name and/or TIN                                     | Verify the name + TIN directly with the IRS and/or use a third party TIN verification tool. You can still file this form in this status.                                                                                                                                       |
| Provided    | Name and TIN were inherited from Connect Settings, but Stripe didn’t verify.     | Verify the name + TIN directly with the IRS and/or use a third party TIN verification tool. You can still file this form in this status.                                                                                                                                       |
| Missing     | Name or TIN not provided and needs to be resolved before filing                  | Follow up with the account to get a name + TIN that matches IRS records. If you still want to file the form in this state, change the Filing requirement to **Required even if incomplete**.                                                                                   |

## Understand tax form delivery status

Stripe sends your tax forms using the delivery method you set for your account, either mail or e-delivery. The [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) page shows the delivery status for your tax forms. The following table describes each possible delivery status.

| Status           | Description                                                      | Next steps                                                                                                                                         |
