# Moving money using ReceivedDebit objects

Learn how external account holders can pull funds from a financial account.

Certain processes initiated outside of Financial Accounts for platforms result in money being pulled out of a financial account. This includes:

- Spending money on a card through [Stripe Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions.md#transactions-with-financial-accounts-for-platforms)
- Pulling money out of a financial account into an external account using ACH debits
- Pulling money out of a platform’s financial account into that platform’s Stripe Payments balance using [top-ups](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-accounts/connect/moving-money/payouts.md#top-ups)

These money movements result in the creation of `ReceivedDebit` objects. You don’t create `ReceivedDebits` directly, rather you observe `ReceivedDebit` object creation with webhooks. If there are insufficient funds in the account, the `ReceivedDebit` fails in most cases.

## Retrieve a ReceivedDebit 

Use `GET /v1/treasury/received_debits/{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}` to retrieve the `ReceivedDebit` with the associated ID.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_debits/{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}"
```

```cli
stripe treasury received_debits retrieve {{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}} \
  --stripe-account {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

received_debit = client.v1.treasury.received_debits.retrieve(
  '{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}',
  {},
  {stripe_account: '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}'},
)
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
received_debit = client.v1.treasury.received_debits.retrieve(
  "{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}",
  options={"stripe_account": "{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}"},
)
```

```php
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$receivedDebit = $stripe->treasury->receivedDebits->retrieve(
  '{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}',
  [],
  ['stripe_account' => '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}']
);
```

```java
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeClient client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

ReceivedDebitRetrieveParams params = ReceivedDebitRetrieveParams.builder().build();

RequestOptions requestOptions =
  RequestOptions.builder().setStripeAccount("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}").build();
// For SDK versions 29.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1()' from the following line.

ReceivedDebit receivedDebit =
  client.v1().treasury().receivedDebits().retrieve(
    "{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}",
    params,
    requestOptions
  );
```

```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const receivedDebit = await stripe.treasury.receivedDebits.retrieve(
  '{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}',
  {
    stripeAccount: '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}',
  }
);
```

```go
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.TreasuryReceivedDebitRetrieveParams{
  ID: stripe.String("{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}"),
}
params.SetStripeAccount("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}")
result, err := sc.V1TreasuryReceivedDebits.Retrieve(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
var requestOptions = new RequestOptions
{
    StripeAccount = "{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}",
};
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Treasury.ReceivedDebits;
Stripe.Treasury.ReceivedDebit receivedDebit = service.Get(
    "{{RECEIVED_DEBIT_ID}}",
    null,
    requestOptions);
```

If successful, the response returns the `ReceivedDebit` object with the associated ID. Some of the parameters in the response have additional details that are only returned when you add them as values to the `expand[]` parameter. The fields that you can expand have an “Expandable” comment in the following response example. See [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects.md) to learn more about expanding object responses.

## List ReceivedDebits 

Use `GET /v1/treasury/received_debits` to retrieve all `ReceivedDebits` for a financial account. You must specify a financial account ID for the `financial_account` parameter. You can filter the results by the standard list parameters or by `status`.

```json
{
  // Standard list parameters
  "limit", "starting_after", "ending_before",
  // Filter by FinancialAccount (Required)
  "financial_account": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  // Filter by status
  "status": "succeeded" | "failed"
}
```

The following request retrieves the last successful [ReceivedDebit object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_debits/object.md) that occurred before the provided `ReceivedDebit` for the financial account identified.

```curl
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_debits \

## Test ReceivedDebits 

Financial Accounts for platforms provides test endpoints for `ReceivedDebit` objects. In testing environments, use `POST /v1/test_helpers/treasury/received_debits` to simulate `ReceivedDebit` creation. You can’t create `ReceivedDebit` objects in live mode, so using this endpoint enables you to test the flow of funds when a third party initiates creation of a `ReceivedDebit`. Set `financial_account` to the ID of the financial account to send money from. Set `network` to `ach` and optionally provide the ABA financial address details for the `source_details.aba` parameter. As in live mode, test `ReceivedDebits` fail if there are insufficient funds available.

## ReceivedDebit webhooks 

Stripe emits the following `ReceivedDebit` events to your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) endpoint:

- `treasury.received_debit.created` on `ReceivedDebit` creation.
