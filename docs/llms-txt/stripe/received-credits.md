# Moving money using ReceivedCredit objects

Learn how to move money into a financial account from another financial account or bank account.

When funds move into a financial account, Stripe creates a corresponding [ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits.md) object on the account. A `ReceivedCredit` contains information on how the funds were sent and from what account, where possible. You can send funds to a financial account with the account’s routing and account numbers for `ach` and `us_domestic_wire`, or the financial account ID for transfers between financial accounts.

When the origin of the funds is another financial account, the `ReceivedCredit` contains a `linked_flows.source_flow` reference to the originating money movement. In this case, the source `OutboundPayment` has `stripe` as its `network` value.

## Retrieve a ReceivedCredit 

Use `GET /v1/treasury/received_credits/{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}` to retrieve the [ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits.md) with the specified ID.

The following request retrieves the `ReceivedCredit` with the specified ID. The response for this request includes expanded [Transaction object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions.md) details.

```curl
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_credits/{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}} \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}" \
  -d "expand[]"=transaction
```

```cli
stripe treasury received_credits retrieve {{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}} \
  --stripe-account {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}} \
  -d "expand[0]"=transaction
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

received_credit = client.v1.treasury.received_credits.retrieve(
  '{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}',
  {expand: ['transaction']},
  {stripe_account: '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}'},
)
```

```python

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
received_credit = client.v1.treasury.received_credits.retrieve(

  ['stripe_account' => '{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}']
);
```

```java

);
```

```go

sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.TreasuryReceivedCreditRetrieveParams{
  ID: stripe.String("{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}"),
}
params.AddExpand("transaction")
params.SetStripeAccount("{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}")
result, err := sc.V1TreasuryReceivedCredits.Retrieve(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.

var options = new Stripe.Treasury.ReceivedCreditGetOptions
{
    Expand = new List<string> { "transaction" },

var requestOptions = new RequestOptions

    StripeAccount = "{{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}",
};
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Treasury.ReceivedCredits;
Stripe.Treasury.ReceivedCredit receivedCredit = service.Get(
    "{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}",
    options,
    requestOptions);
```

If successful, the response provides the requested `ReceivedCredit` object. Some of the parameters in the response have additional details that are only returned when you add them as values to the `expand[]` parameter of your request. The fields that you can expand have an `Expandable` comment in the following response example. See [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects.md) to learn more about expanding object responses.

## List ReceivedCredits 

Use `GET /v1/treasury/received_credits` to retrieve all of the `ReceivedCredits` for the financial account with the ID of the required `financial_account` parameter. You can filter the list with the standard list parameters, by `status`, or by `linked_flows.source_flow_type`.

```
{
  // Standard list parameters
  "limit", "starting_after", "ending_before",
  // Filter by FinancialAccount (required)
  "financial_account": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  // Filter by status
  "status": "succeeded" | "failed",
  // Filter by `source_flow_type`
  "linked_flows.source_flow_type": nil | "payout" | "outbound_payment"
}
```

The following request retrieves the `ReceivedCredits` that have a status of `failed` for the specified financial account.

```curl
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_credits \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}" \

## Test ReceivedCredits 

Use `POST /v1/test_helpers/treasury/received_credits` to simulate receiving funds in a financial account. To simulate a bank transfer from an account outside of Stripe to your financial account, set `initiating_payment_method_details` to the values of the external bank account, and set `network` to `ach` or `us_domestic_wire`.

The following request creates a test `ReceivedCredit` from an external bank account using an `OutboundPayment` between two financial accounts on the same platform.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/treasury/received_credits \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}}" \
  -d financial_account={{DESTINATION_FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
  -d network=ach \
  -d amount=1234 \
  -d currency=usd
```

```cli
stripe test_helpers treasury received_credits create  \
  --stripe-account {{CONNECTEDACCOUNT_ID}} \
  --financial-account={{DESTINATION_FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
  --network=ach \
  --amount=1234 \
  --currency=usd
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.

var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.TestHelpers.Treasury.ReceivedCredits;
Stripe.Treasury.ReceivedCredit receivedCredit = service.Create(options, requestOptions);
```

If successful, the response returns a `ReceivedCredit` object. The following is an example of a response for a bank transfer.

```json

  }
}
```

## ReceivedCredit webhooks 

Stripe emits the following `ReceivedCredit` events to your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) endpoint:

- `treasury.received_credit.created` on `ReceivedCredit` creation.
- `treasury.received_credit.{{new_status}}` when an `ReceivedCredit` changes status. Available status value options include:
  - `treasury.received_credit.succeeded`
  - `treasury.received_credit.failed`
