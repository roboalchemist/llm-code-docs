# Resolve webhook signature verification errors

Learn how to fix a common error when listening to webhook events.

When processing webhook events, we recommend securing your endpoint by [verifying](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md#verify-official-libraries) that the event is coming from Stripe. To do this, use the `Stripe-Signature` header and call the `constructEvent()` function with three parameters:

- `requestBody`: The request body string sent by Stripe.
- `signature`: The Stripe-Signature header in the request sent by Stripe.
- `endpointSecret`: The secret associated with your endpoint.

This function might look like this:

#### Ruby

```ruby
Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(request_body, signature, endpoint_secret)
```

#### Python

```python
stripe.Webhook.construct_event(request_body, signature, endpoint_secret)
```

#### PHP

```php
\Stripe\Webhook::constructEvent($request_body, $signature, $endpoint_secret);
```

#### Java

```java
Webhook.constructEvent(requestBody, signature, endpointSecret);
```

#### Node.js

```javascript
stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(requestBody, signature, endpointSecret);
```

#### Go

```go
webhook.ConstructEvent(requestBody, signature, endpointSecret)
```

#### .NET

```dotnet
EventUtility.ConstructEvent(requestBody, signature, endpointSecret);
```

If you get the following `Webhook signature verification failed` error, at least one of the three parameters you passed to the `constructEvent()` function is incorrect.

```
Webhook signature verification failed. Err: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload.
```

## Check the endpoint secret

The most common error is using the wrong endpoint secret. If you’re using a webhook endpoint created in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks), open the endpoint in the Dashboard and click the **Reveal secret** link near the top of the page to view the secret. If you’re using the Stripe CLI, the secret is printed in the Terminal when you run the `stripe listen` command.

In both cases, the secret starts with a `whsec_` prefix, but the secret itself is different. Don’t verify signatures on events forwarded by the CLI using the secret from a Dashboard-managed endpoint, or the other way around. Finally, print the `endpointSecret` used in your code, and make sure that it matches the one you found above.

## Check the request body

The request body must be the body string that Stripe sends in UTF-8 encoding without any changes. When you print it as a string, it looks similar to this:

```
{
  "id": "evt_xxx",
  "object": "event",
  "data": {
      ...
  }
}
```

### Retrieve the raw request body

Some frameworks might edit the request body by doing things like adding or removing whitespace, reordering the key-value pairs, converting the string to JSON, or changing the encoding. All of these cases lead to a failed signature verification.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of frameworks that might parse or mutate the data using common configurations, and some tips on how to get the raw request body.

| stripe-node library with Next.js [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) | Try disabling `bodyParser` and using `buffer(request)`, like in [this example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/pages/api/webhooks.ts). |

If you’re using the stripe-node library with Express, make sure that `app.use(express.json())` is placed *after* the webhook route. In Express, the order of middleware configuration matters. If `express.json()` is applied before your webhook route, it parses the request body before signature verification, causing the verification to fail. For example:

```javascript
// Webhook route in its original request form
app.post('/webhook', ...);

// Parse the request body in JSON for other routes
app.use(express.json());

// Put other routes here
app.post('/another-route', ...);
```

### AWS API Gateway with Lambda function

To retrieve the raw request body for the AWS API Gateway with Lambda function, in the API Gateway, set up a **Body Mapping Template** of content type `application/json`:

```
{
  "method": "$context.httpMethod",
  "body": $input.json('$'),
  "rawBody": "$util.escapeJavaScript($input.body).replaceAll("\\'", "'")",
  "headers": {
    #foreach($param in $input.params().header.keySet())
    "$param": "$util.escapeJavaScript($input.params().header.get($param))"
    #if($foreach.hasNext),#end
    #end
  }
}
```

Then, in the Lambda function, access the raw body with the event’s `rawBody` property and the headers with the event’s `headers` property.

## Check the signature

Print the `signature` parameter, and confirm that it looks similar to this:

```
t=xxx,v1=yyy,v0=zzz
```

If not, check if you have an issue in your code when trying to extract the signature from the header.
