When you send an API request, Stripe creates an object and logs the request for your account. This page describes how to filter API request logs and view log entries for your account in the Developers Dashboard.

## How requests are logged

This table describes the different ways Stripe logs an API request for your account.

| Source    | API call                                                                  | Logs                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| API       | When you manually trigger an event with the Stripe CLI.                   | Logs the API call on the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page. |
| API       | When user actions in your app or website result in an API call.           | Logs the API call on the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page. |
| API       | When you call an API directly with the Stripe CLI.                        | Logs the API call on the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page. |
| Dashboard | When you call an API by modifying your Stripe resources in the Dashboard. | Logs the API call on the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page. |

## View your default API version

When you send requests to Stripe, you may specify an API version with the `Stripe-Version` header. If you don’t specify an API version, Stripe uses your account’s default API version. Use these steps to find all of the API versions used by your account within the last week. If you’re using the latest API version, the version is labeled `Latest`.

1. Open the [Developers Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers).
1. Your account’s default **API version** is labeled `Default`.

To view a list of versions, see the [API changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades.md#api-versions).

## View API requests by source

Use these steps to filter requests by an API call source.

1. Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page.
1. Click **More**.
1. In **Source**, select **Dashboard** or **API** to filter requests by source.
1. Click **Apply**.

## Find common integration errors

Use this filter to discover common integration errors by error code and API endpoint.

1. Open the [Developers Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com).
1. In **Recent errors**, select the filter button (:filter:).
1. Select an error type.
1. Click an error to view the request payload that failed and the reason.

## Filter by resource ID

When you create, update, or delete a Stripe resource using Stripe APIs, Stripe returns a resource ID in the response payload. For example, when you [Create a customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create.md), Stripe returns a customer ID (in `id`), such as `cus_ImZZa3EEvvQQQU`. Use these steps to filter API requests by resource ID.

1. Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page.
1. Enter the resource ID in the **Filter by resource** ID text field.

## Apply advanced filters

You can use the inline navigation to filter API requests by **Date**, **Status**, **Method** and **API endpoint**, or apply additional filters to troubleshoot requests. Use these steps to filter API requests by API version, error type, error code, and other filters, such as an IP address.

1. Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) page.
1. Click **More**.
   - To filter by version, select an option in the **API version** dropdown menu. For example, `2025-10-29.clover`.
   - To filter by error type, select an option in the **Error type** dropdown menu. For example, `card_error`.
   - To filter by error message, select an option in the **Error code** dropdown menu. For example, `bank_account_unverified`.
1. Click **Apply**.
