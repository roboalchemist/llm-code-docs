# Marketing your Capital program

Build marketing assets for Capital.

> Capital for platforms is available in [public preview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases.md).

This guide shows how to build marketing assets for Capital that educate your users and promote the Capital program. Learn how to co-brand your product with Stripe and develop content that adheres to [regulatory requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md) applicable to Capital.

Financing is a highly regulated space, and all customer-facing material referencing Stripe Capital must be approved by Stripe and its financial partners before publication. Submit material for review and approval using the [Change Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

## Marketing requirements

Depending on your Capital integration type, additional platform marketing might be optional.

- **No-code integration**: For no-code integrations, Stripe sends offer emails on your behalf. While this isn’t required, we recommend that you [send an announcement email](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing.md#announcement-email) and develop a marketing landing page using our [messaging guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing.md#messaging).
- **Embedded components:** You can use embedded components to notify users of their offers within your product. If you’re using embedded components, you can either use Stripe’s no-code promotional emails or send your own offer notification to market offers outside of the Dashboard. You must review and comply with the section on [sending offer notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing.md#financing-notifications).
- **API integration**: For API integrations where you’re responsible for notifying users about their Capital offers, you must review and comply with the section on [sending offer notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing.md#financing-notifications) to build an email campaign or in-Dashboard notifications with the [Capital API](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/api-integration.md#retrieve-financing-offers).

> You must submit any customer-facing materials related to Capital to Stripe for review prior to being published using the [Change Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

## Marketing approval process

To make sure Stripe meets its marketing oversight requirements for platforms offering Stripe Capital, you must maintain records of all marketing materials you use to promote your Capital program. All marketing material must be reviewed, approved, and retained by Stripe and its financial partners to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Items that must be submitted to Stripe for approval include:

- Offer materials regardless of channel
- Email marketing including proposed targeting populations
- Website or UX material referencing the Stripe Capital product
- Blog posts or social media referencing the Stripe Capital product
- In-app or push notifications
- Customer testimonials

You must submit any marketing materials that you create to Stripe’s compliance team for review using the [Change Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835) prior to use or publication. Our team of compliance specialists reviews these assets and will respond by email with edits or an approval in a timely manner. The standard turnaround time is 5-7 business days.

To receive approval, the material must align with the requirements and guidelines detailed in this guide. You may not use any marketing assets that don’t pass Stripe review and approval.

When submitting your materials, you must do the following:

1. Read and adhere to the guidelines on this page. Marketing assets aren’t usable until they have been approved by Stripe.
1. Provide your platform name.
1. Provide full screen shots or products that include headings and footers in a legible or high resolution format.
1. The preferable format for materials is an editable Google doc, however  a PDF or any other format where all text is legible is acceptable.
1. Describe the type of marketing material you’re submitting (for example, landing pages, web banners, emails, search engine marketing, and whether the asset is text only or includes images and text). If submitting web pages, include the associated URLs.
1. Describe where all CTA links direct to (for example, a landing page URL or log-in screens).

## Sending offer notifications 

As part of your Capital marketing program, you can set up offer notifications so your connected accounts know when they’re eligible for financing. You must notify all eligible connected accounts about available offers.

With the no-code option, Stripe sends co-branded offer emails on your behalf. If you’re using the API integration, you must build and deploy your own email campaign.

To get started select your integration type below.

#### No-Code

### No-code email overview 

Emails are a primary channel for notifying customers about their financing offers. Stripe Capital handles this with our no-code email service. For more information on how to enable offer emails through Stripe, see [Set up a no-code integration](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration.md).

All emails are co-branded with your logo and brand colors. To see the end-to-end user experience, including the offer email, check out the [Capital demo experience](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital/demo). You can customize the colors and logo in the email by adjusting your [Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-interface).

> Adjusting Connect settings changes your branding for all of Connect, not just Capital.

Stripe sends a series of emails to notify customers of their offer and keep them informed about their payment progress.

The following is a list of the emails Stripe sends:

1. First offer email: This email notifies the customers about their first prequalified offer. We send it as soon as a customer becomes eligible.
1. Weekly update emails: If a customer has an active financing, we send them a weekly email updating them on the current amount paid, and linking to a Stripe-hosted active financing page.
1. Repeat offer email: After a customer has paid their financing, we send them an additional offer email as soon as they’re eligible.
1. Offer email: If a customer doesn’t accept an offer, they’ll receive an additional offer email every 30 days if they’re eligible.
1. Additional transactional emails: In addition, Stripe will send other relevant transactional emails to users, such as those relevant for application questions or financing payment.

Learn more about our [no-code email service](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration.md) or contact your Stripe account team member.

#### API

### Sending your own offer emails 

If you want to send your own financing offer emails instead of using our no-code email services, you can do so with the [Capital API](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/api-integration.md). You must notify all eligible connected accounts of their offer.

Below are recommendations on how to set up an email program, and sample email templates.

#### Email overview and cadence

Below are recommendations on how to set up an email program, and sample email templates.

We recommend sending customers a drip campaign for their first offer, and re-engaging them every 30 days with their new offer if they don’t accept.

The following list contains an overview of each email. You can see the email templates below for more details on each email.

1. 1st-3rd offer email: These emails notify the customers about their first offer. The first email is sent as soon as a customer becomes eligible, with the remainder being sent 7 and 14 days after. Financing offers expire after 30 days, so these emails span the entire duration of the financing. Make sure to configure your email campaign so that these first offer emails stop after a user accepts an offer.
1. Refill offer email: If a user is eligible for a refill offer, send them an email notifying them about the additional funding.
1. Repeat offer email: When a customer has paid their financing, we send them an additional offer email as soon as they’re eligible again.
1. Re-engagement email: If a customer doesn’t accept an offer, they receive an additional offer email every 30 days if they’re eligible.

When you deliver these emails, you must also meet Stripe’s compliance requirements:

1. Comply with relevant marketing and communications requirements such as  [email opt-out CAN-SPAM requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md#can-spam) for the US and [PECR](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md#pecr) for the UK.
1. Comply with our [document retention requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md#recordkeeping), which includes copying [capital-offers@stripe.com](mailto:capital-offers@stripe.com) on all email campaigns.
1. Comply with [UDAP requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md#udap).

  Do you have any questions regarding your financing offer for [company name]? If so, we’re here to help. As a reminder, you can see your offer here:

  We know getting funding can be complicated and time intensive. Fortunately, our financing program with Stripe Capital works differently than traditional financing. We’ve simplified the application process and rather than making fixed payments, you’ll automatically pay the amount through a percentage of your [company name] sales, which allows you to pay more when business is busy, and less if things slow down.

  If you have any questions, you can learn more about the program here [add link to your landing page or [How it works](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-stripe-capital-works.md)], or reply to this email to get in touch with our partners at Stripe.

1. Receive your funds: After your application is reviewed, if you are approved the funds are deposited into your bank account, typically in as little as one to two business days after approval.
1. Pay as you earn*: You’ll automatically pay the financing with a fixed percentage of your sales, until the total amount is paid. Stripe Capital loans have a minimum amount due each payment period. If the amount that you pay through sales doesn’t meet the minimum required, your bank account will be automatically debited the remaining amount at the end of the period.

### Marketing to ineligible users 

Not all customers are eligible for a Capital offer. Any marketing material that is available to an audience of both eligible and ineligible users should clearly explain how eligibility is determined, and how customers can learn if they have an offer available. Direct marketing which only targets recipients ineligible for financing isn’t currently supported. Here’s an example of the type of language you can use on marketing content available to a broader audience of both eligible and ineligible users:

Eligibility is based on a combination of factors, such as your payment history on  payments. If you’re eligible for an offer, we’ll send you an email. If you haven’t received any notification from us, that means you’re not eligible for an offer at this time.

If you’d like to receive a financing offer, but aren’t eligible at this time, we recommend migrating more of your business’ payments to  payment solution. While not guaranteed, increased payment volume and your history with  payment solution might increase your likelihood of getting a financing offer.

### Terminology reference 

The list of approved and prohibited language isn’t exhaustive. For any questions, contact the Capital team at [capital-review@stripe.com](mailto:capital-review@stripe.com).

## Promote your Capital program 

When your Capital program goes live, you’ll want to share information about it. Because not all of your customers will be eligible for Capital, it’s important to make sure any broader marketing such as a landing page doesn’t promise eligibility. Instead, you can use marketing to explain how the program works, why it’s important, and where customers can check if they’re eligible. Review our messaging guide for help crafting your marketing materials. We also recommend referencing your broader vision for embedded finance if you’re also using Stripe Treasury or Stripe Issuing.

> You must submit any customer-facing materials related to Capital to Stripe for review prior to being published using the [Change Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

### Announcement email 

Whether you’re building a stand alone email or adding copy to an existing newsletter, emails are a great way to introduce Capital to your customer base. Try to keep your email short and to the point, but make sure to include these key points:

- A brief introduction to the program
- Where customers will learn about their offer (make sure to touch on eligibility since not all visitors to your page will be eligible)
- Link to a blog post, landing page, or place where they can check their eligibility
- Compliance disclosures
- Opt out/unsubscribe ability so that the customer may exercise their right to not receive Capital marketing or be eligible to receive an offer

Refer to our messaging guide for help crafting your email copy. Refer to our [regulatory compliance guide](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md) to check that your marketing adheres to the relevant guidelines.

### Landing pages and blog posts 

Evergreen content like landing pages and blog posts can be a great way to excite prospective customers about your financing program, and educate existing customers about how it works. The following sections provide tips for developing your content. We also recommend reviewing the messaging guide.

**Suggested page structure**

1. Brief introduction to the program
1. Why financing can help their business
1. How the program works
1. Where customers will learn about their offer (make sure to touch on eligibility since not all visitors to your page will be eligible)
1. Links to FAQs, docs or any other pages you’d created
1. Compliance disclosures (default disclaimer)

#### Landing page URL and site navigation 

Here are a few examples for landing page URL options and site navigation categories. You can also use the name of your program such as “[Platform name] Capital” as the navigation category.

- `/capital`
- `/financing`
- `/business-financing`

### Blog-post content 

We understand that blog posts are a common tool to increase your own company’s organic growth, so you might decide to promote Stripe Capital through such content. Because blog posts are not space constrained, you have some additional things to consider when creating this type of marketing content:

- Comparisons: Due to the additional regulatory complexity of comparing Stripe Capital against other competitors or different loan products, you may not directly compare Stripe Capital against any competitors’ offerings.
- Testimonials: Writing about your customer’s experiences in a blog post related to Stripe Capital falls under “testimonials” rules and must adhere to specific [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance.md#testimonials).
- Substantiating claims: Blog posts sometimes make large claims about overall successes, such as “Stripe Capital helps our users double their output.” Make sure that you have accurate and verifiable data for any quantifiable claims. You must validate these claims and provide supporting evidence upon request. Every claim must be substantiated and readily available for the duration the content is active, and for up to five years following its last use.

### Social posts 

Social posts such as organic and paid ads can help drive awareness of your program and tell a broader story about your investment in embedded finance. Because much of this audience might not be eligible for a financing, refer to the section [How to market to ineligible users](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing.md#market-ineligible).

Social media is often space constrained. When you create content for this channel, don’t use approved marketing phrases out of context or reduced down to be misleading. Don’t use language that references eligible financing amounts, specific dollar amounts for financing fees, nor specific percentages of sales that go towards payment, because those are dynamically generated fields for formal financing offers.

### LinkedIn organic templates

Optional image text (up to 6 words): Financing now available with [Platform name + program name]

### Press releases 

You can use press releases as a way to attract new customers or develop a larger story about your company’s investment in embedded finance. We’re happy to help you develop the right story and support its release. If you’re interested in doing a press release, submit a draft using the [Change Request Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).
