# How Stripe Capital works

Learn how Stripe Capital provides financing for eligible businesses.

If you’re a *Connect* (Connect is Stripe's solution for multi-party businesses, such as marketplace or software platforms, to route payments between sellers, customers, and other recipients) platform and you want to provide financing to your connected accounts, see [How Capital for platforms works](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-capital-for-platforms-works.md) instead.

Stripe Capital works differently by country. Capital is currently available in the United States (US), United Kingdom (GB), France (FR), Germany (DE), and Australia (AU).

Select your country to learn how Capital works:

#### US

Stripe Capital offers financing for eligible users processing payments through Stripe. Under the Stripe Capital program, business financing doesn’t have late fees, early payment fees, or origination fees. Instead, the total amount you pay is your advance amount plus a flat fee. Your payments are withheld directly from your sales on Stripe.

## Financing types

Stripe, with our financial partner, uses a combination of eligibility criteria (including overall processing volume and history on Stripe) to extend a financing offer. If your US business is eligible, and has at least 3 months of processing history, Stripe might send you an email and Dashboard notification to advise you of an available offer.

Each offer specifies the type of financing being offered, which might be a loan or merchant cash advance. You can’t request a particular financing type under the Stripe Capital program.

- **Merchant cash advance:** A merchant cash advance is a purchase of a the future receivables for a business by YouLend; it’s not a loan or credit transaction. Purchased receivables are withheld from the payment processing volume of the business in a percentage specified in the YouLend Advance Agreement. Unlike a loan, there’s no fixed payment schedule or periodic debits. Instead, the payments that a business needs to make vary based on payment processing volumes.
- **Loans:** Business-purpose term loans are made by Celtic Bank to eligible businesses. These loans have a maximum term, and periodic payments. If withholdings from payment processing receivables don’t meet a minimum amount (typically on a 30 or 60-day basis), shortfalls are debited from a linked bank account.

## Eligibility

Stripe, together with our financing partner, determines your eligibility for an offer based on a variety of factors related to your Stripe accounts, including your processing volume and the size of your customer base. We regularly review your business for offer eligibility. If you become eligible, you receive an email, and can view your offer in the Dashboard under the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital). To receive emails regarding new offers, update [your email settings](https://go.stripe.global/subscribe?tmp_source=none) to opt into receiving Stripe Capital emails.

You might see a banner in the Stripe Dashboard that indicates that you’re on track for a future offer. This isn’t a guarantee of a future offer or of specific terms and doesn’t reflect a credit decision or evaluation.

> If your business has multiple Stripe accounts, a financing offer might be generated based on the combined information from those accounts. Changes to one account without corresponding updates to others might affect your financing eligibility. This includes changes to your business name, Employee Identification Number (EIN), and business address.

### Minimum eligibility requirements

To qualify for a financing offer through Stripe Capital, your business must:

- Have processed payments on Stripe for 3 months or more.
- Have a processing volume of 5,000 USD minimum per year and an average processing volume of USD 1,000 for the last 3 months.
- Be in good standing with Stripe Capital. If your business previously applied for a Capital offer and was rejected, you’re not eligible to receive a new offer for 30 days.
- Be based in the US. The Stripe Capital program only supports businesses located or incorporated in the US. Business representatives must also provide a physical US home address. Certain geographic limitations might apply. Funding might not be available in certain states because of local rules and regulations.

Meeting the minimum eligibility requirements doesn’t guarantee that your business qualifies for a Stripe Capital offer.

### Important underwriting considerations

In addition to the minimum requirements, Capital’s underwriting models might evaluate other characteristics of your business to determine eligibility. We’ve highlighted some key considerations:

- **A growing business.** How much you process through Stripe influences the size of your financing offer. Businesses with positive growth trajectories are more likely to be eligible for an offer.
- **A steady processing record.** A consistent, steady processing record with limited periods of low or zero volume shows stability in your business and increases your likelihood of qualifying for an offer.
- **A large customer base.** Businesses with more customers are more likely to be eligible for an offer.
- **A low dispute rate.** Businesses with low rates of unresolved chargebacks are more likely to qualify for funding.

### Additional steps you can take

The more information we can see about the health of your business, the better we can evaluate your eligibility for a Capital offer.

- **Connect your business bank account.** Securely [linking your bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/linked-external-accounts.md) lets Stripe view your bank balances and transactions to better determine your eligibility for an offer.
- **Bring more processing volume onto Stripe.** Our underwriting model is based on the payment volume that you process on Stripe. Shifting transaction volume from other payment sources onto Stripe increases your overall Stripe processing volume and improves your likelihood of receiving an offer.

### Future eligibility terms

We base future eligibility and offer terms on your current processing activity on Stripe. Many factors influence this decision, including your Stripe activity, risk assessments, industry standards, and evolving market conditions. We evaluate these elements continuously. Also keep in mind that:

- We don’t offer account-specific insights regarding future eligibility.
- We don’t have emergency or on-demand access to Capital.
- We don’t offer a manual review process for account eligibility.

### Get feedback on your eligibility

If you have any questions regarding your offer eligibility, contact us directly at [capital@stripe.com](mailto:capital@stripe.com). See our [Privacy Center](https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#stripe-capital) for more information. Stripe determines your eligibility for a financing offer based on a variety of factors related to your Stripe accounts, including your processing volume and the size of your customer base.

## Review your offer

Your offer is typically valid for 30 days, after which we re-evaluate your business to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer. Go to the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) in the Stripe Dashboard to customize the amount of your offer up to the maximum offer amount. The offer terms adjust based on the amount you choose. If you’re seeking financing at a later time, continue checking your email and the **Capital** tab of the Dashboard to make sure you’re reviewing your most current offer. In some cases, we extend additional offers to you while you’re actively paying your current financing.

After you select an offer, we review your application. There might be requests for additional information related to your business to complete the review of your application. If you’re approved, we transfer the funds to your Stripe account, typically in as few as 1-2 business days. To make sure funds successfully disburse from your Stripe account, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

## No impact to your personal credit

Applying for financing through Stripe Capital might require a personal credit check under some circumstances, but this credit check doesn’t affect your personal credit score.

## Build your business credit history

When you apply for financing through Stripe Capital, Stripe might obtain your business’s credit history through the Small Business Financial Exchange. Additionally, Stripe Capital may report performance or payment history to the Small Business Financial Exchange, who uses this information to build a financial profile for your business, which can help your business get access to financing from other providers.

## Linked accounts

You always have control over the bank accounts that you share with Stripe and can [update or disconnect your linked accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/linked-external-accounts.md) at any time.

## Pay down your financing

The total cost of your financing is your loan or advance amount plus a flat fee. Payment of your financing occurs automatically by deducting a percentage of your Stripe sales, known as the *repayment rate*. This means you pay more when your business has higher sales and less if business slows down. The single flat fee isn’t charged upfront—it’s paid over the length of the financing.

There’s no prepayment penalty, and you can make additional payments or pay the total amount you owe in full at any point in the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard.

Stripe automatically evaluates you for a new offer as you pay down your financing, regardless of whether you make additional payments or pay it off early.

## Financing payments

Stripe Capital financing is generally paid through withholding from payment processing receivables at a rate specified in your financing agreement. Depending on your financing type, there may be periodic minimum payment requirements and a finite term.

Specifically, if you took out a loan, you must repay a minimum amount toward your loan every payment period. Amounts withheld as a percentage of your sales at the payment rate count toward your minimum. However, if the total amount you repay through sales doesn’t meet the minimum, you must pay the remaining amount at the end of the period. If you haven’t met the minimum by the end of each payment period, Stripe automatically debits the balance needed to meet your minimum from your bank account or account balance. You can also make manual payments toward your minimum through your Dashboard. You can view your minimum in the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard or in your loan agreement.

If you’re unable to meet your minimum for one or more periods, reach out to support and we’ll work with you to get back on track and meet your loan obligations. If you continue to miss your minimums, we might take additional action, as detailed in your loan agreement.

> #### Fixed payment loans
> 
> If your loan has a fixed payment instead of a minimum payment, Stripe stops withholding from your Stripe sales when you meet the fixed payment amount. If your sales withholdings don’t meet the fixed payment by the end of the payment period, Stripe automatically debits the balance. You can also make manual payments at any time through your Dashboard using the **Make payment** option. Your financing agreement will specify whether there is a fixed payment amount.

### Examples

The following example scenarios demonstrate how the minimum payment process works for loans.

**Example 1: You successfully meet your minimum through daily sales deductions.**

- Your minimum amount is 2,000 USD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.
- In that period, you repaid 2,500 USD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).
- You’ve successfully met your minimum plus an additional 500 USD toward your total balance for this payment period.
- In the next 60-day period, you still must meet the minimum of 2,000 USD.

**Example 2: You don’t meet your minimum through daily sales deductions.**

- Your minimum is 2,000 USD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.
- In that period, you repaid 1,500 USD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).
- On March 1, you still owe 500 USD toward your minimum (2,000 USD – 1,500 USD = 500 USD) and you must pay the remaining balance of your minimum.
- On March 1, Stripe automatically debits 500 USD from your bank account or account balance to meet your minimum.

## Security interests

Stripe Capital loan agreements typically include security interests taken as collateral for your loan. A *UCC-1* (A publicly available notice filed by a creditor that secures the creditor's interest in certain assets of a debtor. Creditors file UCC-1 statements with the secretary of state where a business debtor is incorporated at the time a loan first originates) financing statement might be filed in connection with your loan based on several factors, including the size of your loan, facts and circumstances about your business, and so on. After you finish paying off your loan, you can [contact us](mailto:capital@stripe.com) with a request to terminate a UCC-1 filing. For merchant cash advances, a security interest may be taken under certain circumstances, as specified in the Stripe Capital advance agreement.

> #### Unknown secured party
> 
> Creditors sometimes use a third party to file and maintain lien positions as the registered agent of the creditor. Wolters Kluwer is Stripe Capital’s third-party representative. If you’re unsure of what creditor the third party is acting on behalf of, we recommend that you contact the third party directly.

## Taxes

Tax reporting often depends on your specific situation, so we encourage you to talk with a tax advisor. In general, funds through Stripe Capital wouldn’t be considered taxable income at the time of receipt, and the amounts withheld to satisfy your obligations aren’t tax deductible.

*Stripe Capital loans are issued by Celtic Bank, powered by Stripe. Stripe Capital merchant cash advances are provided by YouLend.*

#### GB

Stripe Capital offers financing for eligible UK users processing payments through Stripe. We don’t charge early repayment fees or origination fees. Instead, the total amount you owe is your financing amount plus a fixed fee. Your payments are a percentage of your sales and adjust to your processing volume on Stripe.

## Eligibility

Stripe, with our financial partner, uses a combination of factors, including overall processing volume and history on Stripe to determine eligibility for a financing offer. Eligible UK businesses with at least 6 months of processing history receive an email and Dashboard notification if we have an offer available. Stripe has partnered with YouLend to evaluate UK financing applications.

We evaluate your business daily for eligibility, which includes your fixed fee pricing, based on your processing volume and history on Stripe. While many traditional financial products have hidden fees or compounding interest, Stripe Capital financing has a single fixed fee that you pay back over the length of the financing. You don’t pay interest over time, and we don’t charge early payment fees.

Paying off your active financing offer doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer. When you’re eligible for a new offer, it appears automatically in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital). Eligibility for additional financing offers involves several factors. Typically, eligibility for additional funding is linked to businesses that maintain consistent repayments and have repaid a significant portion of their existing funding.

We assess every business regularly, even those actively paying on a financing offer. Even if you aren’t eligible for a new offer today, you might be eligible in the future. For questions regarding eligibility, contact our partner, Youlend at [stripecapital@youlend.com](mailto:stripecapital@youlend.com). To receive emails regarding new offers, update [your email settings](https://go.stripe.global/subscribe?tmp_source=none) to opt into receiving Stripe Capital emails.

You might see a banner in the Stripe Dashboard that indicates that you’re on track for a future offer. This isn’t a guarantee of a future offer or of specific terms and doesn’t reflect a credit decision or evaluation.

> If your business has multiple Stripe accounts, a financing offer might be generated based on the combined information from  those accounts. Changes to one account without corresponding updates to others might affect your financing eligibility. This includes changes to your business name, Employee Identification Number (EIN), and business address.

- Have a processing volume of 5,000 GBP minimum per year and an average processing volume of 1,000 GBP for the last 3 months.

- Be a representative, controller, or director with significant ownership (at least 25%)
- Have an address in the UK to support a credit check
- Be at least 18 years old on the date of the application

The more information we can see about the health of your business, the better we can evaluate your eligibility for Stripe financing.

Our underwriting model is based on the payment volume that you process on Stripe. Shifting transaction volume from other payment sources onto Stripe increases your overall Stripe processing volume and improves your likelihood of receiving an offer.

### Get feedback on your eligibility

If you have any questions regarding your offer eligibility, contact us directly at [capital@stripe.com](mailto:capital@stripe.com). See our [Privacy Center](https://stripe.com/gb/privacy-center/legal#stripe-capital) for more information. All financing requests are subject to final review before approval. Financing is provided by YouLend.

## Review your offer

When you log into the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard, you can use a slider to choose a custom amount (up to the maximum offer amount). The financing fee and payment percentage adjust based on the amount you choose.

Your offer is available for 30 days. After that point, your business is automatically re-evaluated to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer. If you’re seeking financing at a later time, check the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard to see if you have another offer. We’ll also send you an email if you have an offer.

## Apply for financing

After you accept an offer, we review your application. If you’re approved, we transfer the funds to your linked bank account, typically within 1 business day. To make sure funds are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

When you apply, our partner, YouLend conducts a soft credit check as part of your application. This credit check won’t impact your credit score, but might be visible to other organisations carrying out credit searches. If approved, when you receive financing, a hard footprint will be left on your credit record, which will impact your credit score.

Applicants who are the director and a beneficial owner of the business must provide a personal guarantee as part of the application for financing.

## Payment

The total amount you owe is your financing amount plus a fixed fee, which is paid throughout the course of the financing. You won’t pay any interest, early payment fees or origination fees. You’ll automatically pay both the financing and the fixed fee through a percentage of your sales until you pay the total amount you owe. This means you pay more when business is busy and less if things slow down.

After you pay your financing, we automatically evaluate your business for a new offer. Paying your financing early doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer. When you’re eligible for a new offer, it appears automatically in your Dashboard.

If you’re approved for additional financing offers before you pay off your current financing offer, you’ll receive a standardized payment percentage rate across your active financing offers to match your most recently accepted financing offer. Payment of your newly accepted offer begins once your active financing offer is paid off so you will only pay off one financing offer at a time.

**Example: You’re currently paying Financing Offer 1 at a 20% payment percentage rate and received additional financing.**

If you apply, we approve you for *financing offer 2* with a 15% payment percentage rate, we will update the rate for *financing offer 1* to 15%. Payment for *financing offer 2* begins when you’ve paid off *financing offer 1*. As a result, your overall payment percentage rate will be 15%.

## Taxes

Tax reporting is often dependent on your specific situation, so we encourage you to talk with a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting. For more assistance, contact our partner, YouLend, at [stripecapital@youlend.com](mailto:stripecapital@youlend.com).

If you’re seeking financing at a later time, check the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard to see if you have another offer. We’ll also send you an email if you have an offer.

## Apply for financing

After you accept an offer, we and our financing partner, YouLend GmBH, review your application. If you’re approved, the funds are transferred to your linked bank account, typically within 1 business day. To make sure you receive the funds, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

If you’re a director or a beneficial owner of the business, you must provide a personal guarantee as part of the application for financing.

## Payment

The total amount you owe is your financing amount plus a fixed fee, that you pay throughout the course of the financing. You won’t pay any interest, early payment fees or origination fees. You’ll automatically pay both the financing and the fixed fee through a percentage of your sales until you pay the total amount you owe. This means you pay more when business is busy and less if things slow down. This is subject to a minimum weekly repayment amount that we expect your sales to exceed, but which you’re obligated to pay under your Business Loan Agreement.

## Additional financing

As you pay your financing, we automatically evaluate your business for a new offer. Paying your financing early doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer. When you’re eligible for a new offer, it automatically displays in your Dashboard.

If you’re approved for additional financing offers before you pay off your current financing, you’ll receive a standardized payment percentage rate across your active financings to match your most recently accepted financing offer. Payment of your newly accepted financing begins when your active financing is paid off, so you only pay off one financing at a time.

For example, assume that you’re currently paying the first financing offer at a 20% payment percentage rate and have received an offer for additional financing.

If you apply for and are approved for the second financing offer with a 15% payment percentage rate, we’ll update the rate for the first financing offer to 15%. Payment for the second financing offer begins after you’ve paid off the first one. As a result, your overall payment percentage rate would be 15%.

## Taxes

Tax reporting often depends on your specific situation, so we recommend that you contact a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting.

#### AU

Stripe Capital offers financing for eligible Australian businesses processing payments through Stripe. We don’t charge early repayment fees or late fees. Instead, the total amount you owe is your loan amount plus a fixed fee. Your payments are a percentage of your sales and adjust to your processing volume on Stripe.

## Eligibility

Stripe, together with our financial partner, uses a combination of factors, including overall processing volume and history on Stripe to determine eligibility for a financing offer. Eligible Australian businesses with at least 3 months of processing history receive an email and Dashboard notification if they have an offer available. Stripe partners with Fundbox to evaluate applications.

We evaluate your business regularly for eligibility, which includes how we calculate your fixed fee pricing, based on your processing volume and history on Stripe. While many traditional financial products have hidden fees or compounding interest, Stripe Capital financing has a single fixed fee that you pay back over the length of the loan. You don’t pay interest over time, and we don’t charge early payment fees or late fees. Paying off your active loan doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer.

When you’re eligible for a new Stripe Capital offer, it appears automatically in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital). Eligibility for additional offers takes several factors into account. Typically, eligibility for additional funding is linked to businesses that maintain consistent repayments and have repaid a significant portion of their existing funding. We assess every business regularly, even those actively paying a loan. Even if you aren’t eligible for a new offer today, you might be eligible in the future.

For questions regarding eligibility, [email our partner, Fundbox](mailto:stripe-capital@fundbox.com). To receive emails regarding new offers, update [your email settings](https://go.stripe.global/subscribe?tmp_source=none) to opt into receiving Stripe Capital emails.

You might see a banner in the Stripe Dashboard that indicates that you could be eligible for a future offer. This isn’t a guarantee of a future offer, or a promise of specific terms, and it doesn’t reflect a credit decision or evaluation.

> If your business has multiple Stripe accounts, we might generate a financing offer based on the combined information from those accounts. Changes to one account without corresponding updates to others might affect your financing eligibility. This includes changes to your business name, business identification number, and business address.

### Minimum eligibility requirements

To qualify for an offer through Stripe Capital, your business must:

- Be located or incorporated in Australia. We don’t support New Zealand at this time.
- Have processed payments on Stripe for at least 3 months.
- Have an average processing volume of 1,000 AUD for the last 3 months.
- Be in good standing with Stripe Capital. If your business previously applied for a Capital offer that we rejected, you’re ineligible to receive a new offer for 90 days.

Additionally, the person applying for and guaranteeing the offer must:

- Be a representative, controller, or director with significant ownership (at least 25%)
- Be at least 18 years old on the date of the application
- Be able to provide an address in Australia

Meeting the minimum eligibility requirements doesn’t guarantee that your business qualifies for a Stripe Capital offer.

In addition to the minimum requirements, Stripe, along with our partner, Fundbox, evaluate many other characteristics of your business to determine eligibility. We’ve highlighted some key considerations:

- **A growing business**: How much you process through Stripe influences the size of your funding offer. Businesses with positive growth trajectories are more likely to be eligible for an offer.
- **A steady processing record**: A consistent, steady processing record with limited periods of low or zero volume shows stability in your business and increases your likelihood of qualifying for an offer.
- **A large customer base**: Businesses with more customers are more likely to be eligible for an offer.
- **A low dispute rate**: Businesses with low rates of unresolved chargebacks are more likely to qualify for funding.

### Additional steps you can take

The more information we can see about the health of your business, the better we can evaluate your eligibility for Stripe financing.

We base our underwriting model on the payment volume that you process on Stripe. Shifting transaction volume from other payment sources onto Stripe increases your overall Stripe processing volume and improves your likelihood of receiving an offer.

## Review your offer

When you log into the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard, you can use a slider to choose a custom amount (up to the maximum offer amount). The financing fee and payment percentage adjust based on the amount you choose.

Your offer is available for 30 days. After 30 days, we automatically re-evaluate your business to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer. If you’re seeking financing at a later time, check the [Capital tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital) of your Dashboard to see if you have another offer. We’ll also send you an email if you have an offer.

## Apply for financing

After you accept an offer, we and our financing partner review your application. If you’re approved, the funds are transferred to your linked bank account, typically within 1 business day. To make sure you receive the funds, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

If you’re a director or a beneficial owner of the business, you must provide a personal guarantee as part of the application for financing.

## Loan payment

The total amount you owe is your financing amount plus a fixed fee, that you pay throughout the course of the financing. You won’t pay any interest, early payment fees or origination fees. You’ll automatically pay both the financing and the fixed fee through a percentage of your sales until you pay the total amount you owe. This means you pay more when business is busy, and less if things slow down.

You generally pay Stripe Capital financing through withholding from payment processing receivables at the rate specified in your financing agreement. There are periodic minimum payment requirements and a finite term that mandates that you repay a minimum amount toward your loan every payment period. Amounts withheld as a percentage of your sales at the payment rate count toward your minimum payment requirement. However, if the total amount you repay through sales doesn’t meet the minimum payment requirement, you must pay the remaining amount at the end of the period. Stripe automatically debits the balance needed to meet your minimum payment requirement from your Stripe account balance or bank account.

You can also make manual payments toward your minimum through your Dashboard. You can view your minimum in the Capital tab of your Dashboard or in your loan agreement. If you can’t meet your minimum for one or more periods, contact our financing partner, Fundbox, at stripe-capital@fundbox.com and they can work with you to get back in compliance and meet your loan obligations. If you continue to miss your minimums, we might take additional action, as detailed in your loan agreement.

The following example scenarios demonstrate how the minimum payment process works for loans. **Example 1**: You successfully meet your minimum through daily sales deductions.

- Your minimum amount is 2,000 AUD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.
- In that period, you repaid 2,500 AUD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).
- You’ve successfully met your minimum plus an additional 500 AUD toward your total balance for this payment period.
- In the next 60-day period, you still must meet the minimum of 2,000 AUD.
- 

**Example 2**: You don’t meet your minimum through daily sales deductions.

- Your minimum is 2,000 AUD for the 60-day period ending on March 1.
- In that period, you repaid 1,500 AUD of your loan balance through Stripe deducting a fixed percentage of your sales volume (the repayment rate).
- On March 1, you still owe 500 AUD toward your minimum (2,000 AUD − 1,500 AUD = 500 AUD) and you must pay the remaining balance of your minimum.
- On March 1, Stripe automatically debits 500 AUD from your bank account or account balance to meet your minimum.

## Additional financing

As you pay your financing, we automatically evaluate your business for a new offer. Paying your financing early doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer. When you’re eligible for a new offer, it automatically displays in your Dashboard. If you’re approved for additional financing offers before you pay off your current financing, the proceeds of your subsequent financing pay off the outstanding balance of your current financing, and you receive the net amount of the offer.

## Taxes

Tax reporting is often dependent on your specific situation, so we recommend that you contact a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting.

Financing is provided by Fundbox, an external third-party provider, with payments facilitated by Stripe. Funding amounts, rates, and terms are based on review and approval of a completed application, and are subject to change. Financing offers might require additional documentation.
