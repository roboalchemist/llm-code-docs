## Recognized revenue 

Items can be broken down into two categories: revenue and contra revenue. The following table explains each item under recognized revenue:

| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Starting balance                             | The ending balance of the deferred revenue from the previous month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Less recognized revenue                      | The portion of deferred revenue that was recognized this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Less credits issued                          | The remaining deferred revenue erased due to refunds, disputes, voids, uncollectible invoices, and credit notes.

| Ending balance                               | The ending balance of the deferred revenue from this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Finalized invoice example 

This example includes only one *invoice* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) with the following assumptions:

- The invoice finalizes on July 10, 2025.
- The invoice has only one line item whose service period is from July 20, 2025 to September 17, 2025.
- The amount for the invoice line item is 60 USD, out of which 12 USD is recognized in July and 48 USD is deferred.

The monthly summary for July 2025 would look like this:

| **Recognized revenue**                       |         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Revenue from billings this month             | 12 USD  |
| **Net revenue**                              | 12 USD  |
| **Deferred revenue**                         |         |
| Starting balance Jul 1 UTC                   | 0 USD   |
| Deferred change from new billings this month | 60 USD  |
| Less recognized revenue                      | -12 USD |
| **Ending balance Jul 31 UTC**                | 48 USD  |
| **Future scheduled billings**                |         |
| Starting balance Jul 1 UTC                   | 0 USD   |
| **Ending balance Jul 31 UTC**                | 0 USD   |

Continuing on this example, if the invoice is refunded on August 15, 2025, the monthly summary for August 2025 would look like this:

| **Recognized revenue**        |         |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| Less refunds                  | -12 USD |
| **Net revenue**               | -12 USD |
| **Deferred revenue**          |         |
| Starting balance Aug 1 UTC    | 48 USD  |
| Less credits issued           | -48 USD |
| **Ending balance Aug 31 UTC** | 0 USD   |
| **Future scheduled billings** |         |
| Starting balance Aug 1 UTC    | 0 USD   |
| **Ending balance Aug 31 UTC** | 0 USD   |

## Standalone payment example 

The revenue of a standalone payment is recognized when the payment occurs. This example has only one charge with the following assumptions:

- The charge occurs on July 15, 2025.
- The charge’s amount is 17 USD.

The monthly summary for July 2025 would look like this:

| **Recognized revenue**                       |        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Revenue from billings this month             | 17 USD |
| **Net revenue**                              | 17 USD |
| **Deferred revenue**                         |        |
| Starting balance Jul 1 UTC                   | 0 USD  |
| Deferred change from new billings this month | 17 USD |
| Less recognized revenue                      | 17 USD |
| **Ending balance Jul 31 UTC**                | 0 USD  |
| **Future scheduled billings**                |        |
| Starting balance Jul 1 UTC                   | 0 USD  |
| **Ending balance Jul 31 UTC**                | 0 USD  |
