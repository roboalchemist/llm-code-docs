# Customize invoices

Learn how to customize the content and branding of your invoices.

You can customize the content of an *invoice* (Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer. They track the status of payments from draft through paid or otherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate invoices, or you can manually create a one-off invoice) in the following ways:

- Through the API
- Through the invoice editor
- Through the subscription editor
- Through [invoice templates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template.md)
- Through account [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)

You can also set a customer preferred language and include public information in your [account details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true). Because you know more about your customers and your business than Stripe does, make sure your invoices include all of the required information. Your invoices must be accurate, charge the appropriate tax, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your region.

## Branding 

Stripe allows you to customize (as well as preview) email receipts, hosted invoices, invoice PDFs, and so on, in your [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding).

Icons and logos must be in JPG or PNG format, less than 512kb in size, and equal to or greater than 128px by 128px.

- **Icon**—A square, digital-friendly icon or logo.
- **Logo**—A non-square logo to override some uses of the icon.
- **Brand color**—Used on receipts, invoices, and the customer portal.
- **Accent color**—Used as a background on emails and pages.

### Apply brand settings 

Brand settings apply to your whole account and take effect in many places.

| Setting          | Emails                 | Checkout & Payment Links | Customer portal | Hosted Invoice Page | Invoice PDFs |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| **Icon**         | Yes                    | Yes                      | Yes             | Yes                 | Yes          |
| **Logo**         | No                     | Yes                      | No              | No                  | Yes          |
| **Brand color**  | Yes                    | No                       | Yes             | Yes                 | Yes          |
| **Accent color** | Yes (background color) | Yes                      | Yes             | Yes                 | No           |

## Invoice numbering 

Stripe automatically generates invoice numbers to help track and reconcile invoices. Invoice numbers have a prefix and suffix, such as `586A2E-0139` or `MYSHOP-1203`. (​​The full invoice number is always unique across your account in both schemes.) ​​Stripe supports two invoice numbering schemes:

- ​​**Sequentially for each customer (customer-level)**—Uses a unique prefix for each customer and assigns invoice numbers sequentially for a given customer.
- ​​**Sequentially across your account (account-level)**—Uses the same prefix for every customer and assigns invoice numbers sequentially across your entire account.

Stripe chooses a default behavior based on the country your Stripe account is based in. [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en) member countries and the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include) typically require account level sequencing. All other countries default to customer level sequencing because it doesn’t expose the total number of invoices. When switching between schemes or updating prefixes, only future invoices use the new settings. This doesn’t impact existing invoices.

> Invoice requirements vary by jurisdiction. Consult with a professional for guidance on your specific use case. You’re responsible for verifying that the invoices you issue meet local tax requirements.

### Customer level prefixes 

When you configure an invoice to use customer-level numbering, each invoice number begins with the customer’s unique invoice prefix.

For example, if one of your customers is a business named Typographic, you might set the prefix to `TYPGRA`. The first invoice number for Typographic would be `TYPGRA-0001`, the second would be `TYPGRA-0002` and so on.

​​You can override prefixes so that you can trace invoices back to your customers. You can set prefixes on the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) in the Dashboard or with the API by using the [invoice_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create.md#create_customer-invoice_prefix) parameter. Prefixes have to be between 3 and 12 characters and they can’t match any other customer prefix, including prefixes that are no longer in use.

### Account level prefixes 

When you configure an invoice to use account-level numbering, each invoice number starts with a common prefix and has a sequential number.

For example, if your business is named Rocket Rides, you might set the prefix to `RKTRIDE`. Your first invoice would be `RKTRIDE-0001`, a second invoice to a different customer would be `RKTRIDE-0002`, another invoice to the first customer would be `RKTRIDE-0003`, and so on.

Stripe automatically assigns the account-wide prefix, but you can override it to make it clearer that these invoices come from you. If you want to modify the prefix for your account, you can change it in [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). This requires that your account’s default API version is at least [2020-03-02](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades.md#2020-03-02). Prefixes have to be between 3 and 12 characters and they can’t match any customer prefix, including prefixes that are no longer in use.

> ​​You can’t use a customer prefix as an account prefix. This includes prefixes that are no longer in use.

### Connect account prefixes 

When creating invoices with the `on_behalf_of` parameter, Stripe uses the connected account as the merchant of record. Each merchant of record maintains its own separate invoice number sequence, which means:

- Each connected account has its own invoice numbering sequence that starts at `0001`.
- Invoices for the same customer from different connected accounts (specified using `on_behalf_of`) can have the same invoice number prefix and suffix.
- The merchant of record determines which invoice sequence is used, not the platform account.

### Set the next invoice number 

By default, invoice numbers start at `0001`. If you’d like to use a different starting invoice number, however, you can change it. For example, some users—when migrating existing customers to Stripe Invoicing—want their invoice numbers to continue where their old system left off. If the user left off at invoice number `123` in their old system, Stripe allows them to resume the invoice number at `124`.

​​Set the number on the **Customer details** page or with the API by using the [next_invoice_sequence](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create.md#create_customer-next_invoice_sequence) parameter. If you’re using account-level prefixes, set the next invoice number in the **Next invoice sequence** field in [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).

You can only set the next invoice number to numbers greater than any numbers used on an invoice. The maximum allowed invoice number is 1,000,000,000 regardless of how you set it. Use the lowest value possible so that you don’t reach this limit.

## Invoice fields 

Learn more about the different Invoice fields, including memo, footer, and custom fields. To set the same value on these fields for groups of customers, you can use [Invoice Templates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template.md).

### Default memo 

A memo is included in invoice PDFs, invoice emails, and the [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page.md). Memos are commonly used as a notes section, thanking the invoiced customer for their business, or giving more context around the invoice (such as a note from the salesperson who talked to the customer).

You can set a default memo field for your account in [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). ​​Any new invoices use this value. You can also specify the memo on [Invoice Templates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template.md), which replaces the default memo on invoices using a template.

You can specify a different memo for a particular invoice when you create or update it in the Dashboard. You can also specify a memo using the API by calling [update invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update.md#update_invoice-description) and including the `description` parameter.

### Default footer 

​​Invoice PDFs can include an optional footer text block. The footer field is often used for contractual or legally required text. A common use case is displaying legally required company registration information, such as a UK Companies House registration number.

Like the memo field, you can set the default footer value in [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) or specify footers on [Invoice Templates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template.md). ​​You can specify a different footer for a particular draft invoice when you create or update it in the Dashboard, or with the API by calling [update Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update.md#update_invoice-footer). If an invoice has been [finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions.md#finalized), you can’t update its footer field.

### Default item prices 

You can issue invoices with line item prices that exclude inclusive tax. Tax-exclusive prices are only shown in the invoice PDF. That means, when using inclusive tax, the Hosted Invoice Page and invoice emails show tax-inclusive prices. You can define the settings for net prices in the Dashboard or API.

- **Include inclusive tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices including the inclusive tax. (This is the default.)
- **Exclude tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices excluding tax.

> #### Order precedence
> 
> If you set a default for line item prices at the customer level, it takes precedence over account-level settings.

### Custom fields 

Add custom fields to enhance your invoice PDF documents and help you comply with your business practice and tax reporting obligations. Custom fields allow you to provide up to four key-value pairs ​​that display in the invoice header. You can set up to four custom field key-value pairs in the [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), with the [Invoices API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-custom_fields), or with [Invoice Templates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template.md).

Some common uses for custom fields are:

- Purchase Order (PO) numbers
- Contractor numbers
- Tax compliance

#### Custom field inheritance 

You can set custom invoice fields on the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-invoice_settings-custom_fields) object. Any custom fields you set at the customer level apply to all of the draft invoices you generate for that customer. You can always modify these inherited custom fields while the invoice is still a draft. After the invoice finalizes, you can’t update the custom fields.

## PDF page size 

You can set the page size for your invoice PDF, including finalized invoices, to A4 (8.27 x 11.69 inches) or Letter (8.5 x 11 inches).

#### Dashboard

To set the page size using the Dashboard, go to the [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), and find the **Advanced options** section. Then, in the **PDF page size** sub-section, select **A4** or **Letter**.
![Advanced options on the Invoice Editor](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-page-size.3a72380d4dc6061ea9b86ef8e59a97d6.png)

**Advanced options** on the Invoice Editor

#### API

To set the page size using the API, you can [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-rendering-pdf) or [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update.md#update_invoice-rendering-pdf) an invoice and set the `rendering["pdf"]["page_size"]` parameter with the preferred page size.

The default PDF page size is A4 for customers with a Japanese locale and Letter for customers with other locales. You can set the `rendering["pdf"]["page_size"]` parameter back to `auto` to turn on this default behavior.

This is an example of creating an invoice with A4 as the PDF page size:

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d customer="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}" \
  -d "rendering[pdf][page_size]"=a4
```

```cli
stripe invoices create  \
  --customer="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}" \
  -d "rendering[pdf][page_size]"=a4
```

```ruby
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = Stripe::StripeClient.new("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

invoice = client.v1.invoices.create({
  customer: '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',
  rendering: {pdf: {page_size: 'a4'}},
})
```

```python
# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
client = StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")

# For SDK versions 12.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1' from the following line.
invoice = client.v1.invoices.create({
  "customer": "{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",
  "rendering": {"pdf": {"page_size": "a4"}},
})
```

```php
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
$stripe = new \Stripe\StripeClient('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

$invoice = $stripe->invoices->create([
  'customer' => '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',
  'rendering' => ['pdf' => ['page_size' => 'a4']],
]);
```

```java
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeClient client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

InvoiceCreateParams params =
  InvoiceCreateParams.builder()
    .setCustomer("{{CUSTOMER_ID}}")
    .setRendering(
      InvoiceCreateParams.Rendering.builder()
        .setPdf(
          InvoiceCreateParams.Rendering.Pdf.builder()
            .setPageSize(InvoiceCreateParams.Rendering.Pdf.PageSize.A4)
            .build()
        )
        .build()
    )
    .build();

// For SDK versions 29.4.0 or lower, remove '.v1()' from the following line.
Invoice invoice = client.v1().invoices().create(params);
```

```node
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = require('stripe')('<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>');

const invoice = await stripe.invoices.create({
  customer: '{{CUSTOMER_ID}}',
  rendering: {
    pdf: {
      page_size: 'a4',
    },
  },
});
```

```go
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
sc := stripe.NewClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>")
params := &stripe.InvoiceCreateParams{
  Customer: stripe.String("{{CUSTOMER_ID}}"),
  Rendering: &stripe.InvoiceCreateRenderingParams{
    PDF: &stripe.InvoiceCreateRenderingPDFParams{
      PageSize: stripe.String(stripe.InvoiceRenderingPDFPageSizeA4),
    },
  },
}
result, err := sc.V1Invoices.Create(context.TODO(), params)
```

```dotnet
// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
var options = new InvoiceCreateOptions
{
    Customer = "{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",
    Rendering = new InvoiceRenderingOptions
    {
        Pdf = new InvoiceRenderingPdfOptions { PageSize = "a4" },
    },
};
var client = new StripeClient("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");
var service = client.V1.Invoices;
Invoice invoice = service.Create(options);
```

## Group line items 

To help your customers better understand your invoices (including PDFs, Hosted Invoice Page, and invoice emails), categorize, and display invoice line items under different groups. You can also hide groups of line items. If some line items are excessively detailed, you can configure it so that only their group-level subtotal is visible to your customers.

## Default payment terms 

Under **Default payment terms** in [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice), you can select when the payment is due after you send the invoice. You can also choose whether to include a link to a payment page in the invoice email. Customers can visit this link to pay, download, and see the status of their invoice. Lastly, you can manage your accepted payment methods in this section.

## Customer preferred languages 

When you create a customer, use the **Language** dropdown to add their preferred language. (You can also add or edit a customer’s preferred language in the **Customer details** page or when creating an invoice.) Stripe uses the chosen language to localize invoice emails and PDFs, receipt emails and PDFs, as well as credit note PDFs. To update the language through the API, use the [preferred_locales](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-preferred_locales) field.

Stripe Invoicing supports the following languages:

- Bulgarian
- Chinese (Hong Kong)
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Chinese (Taiwan)
- Croatian
- Czech
- Danish
- Dutch
- English (United Kingdom)
- English (United States)
- Estonian
- Filipino
- Finnish
- French (Canada)
- French (France)
- German
- Greek
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Latvian
- Lithuanian
- Malay (Malaysia)
- Malayalam
- Maltese
- Norwegian
- Polish
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Portuguese (Portugal)
- Romanian
- Russian
- Slovak
- Slovenian
- Spanish (Latin America)
- Spanish (Spain)
- Swedish
- Thai
- Turkish
- Vietnamese

## Billing and shipping addresses 

Stripe uses a customer’s [address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-address) as the billing address on the invoice PDF. You can add or edit a customer’s address on the **Customer details** page. If you don’t set the `address` field, Stripe renders the shipping address as the billing address on the PDF.

To render shipping details on the Invoice PDF, set the [shipping_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create.md#create_invoice-shipping_details) field. If you don’t set the `shipping_details` field, Stripe renders the shipping address from the customer’s [shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object.md#customer_object-shipping) field on the PDF.

## Public support information 

Invoices include any public information that you specified under [Public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public), such as your support email address or business website. Using these settings, you can also choose to include a support phone number in customer-facing documents—like invoice PDFs and emails—or default to your business address.
