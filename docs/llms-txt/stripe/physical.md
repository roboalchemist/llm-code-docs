# Physical cards

Issue physical cards at Stripe.

Whether you want to start issuing physical cards in as little as two days or design a fully custom card, we have options that fit your issuing needs. Stripe guides you to the solution that best aligns with your desired level of customization and speed to market, and partners with industry-leading, global card printers to produce your cards.

## Standard card 

This option allows you to quickly get started with a card incorporating your company’s logo. These are best if you want to prioritize speed-to-market, if basic branding is sufficient for your cardholders, or if you need to issue only a few cards.

- **Easy setup**: Go directly to the [Designs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/personalization-designs) tab in the Dashboard to get started.

- **Simple branding**: Choose between a black or white card and add your company’s logo.

- **Go live**: Issue a card in as little as two days after onboarding to Issuing.

### Cost per standard card

Standard cards are 3.50 USD each in the US, 3.50 GBP in the UK, and 3,50 EUR in the EU. [Shipping costs](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/ship-cards.md) apply for each region.

## Custom card 

This option is the best when you want to craft a unique design that represents your brand. These are best if your physical card is a core identifier of your business or if you want to build brand affinity with your cardholders. Custom cards are subject to minimum orders of 2,500 cards and require significant planning and investment.

- **Hands-on design sessions**: Stripe schedules live design sessions to walk through different options and recommendations.

- **Extensive customization**: Tailor your card to meet your brand goals. Choose between different card materials, such as plastic and metal, and a variety of packaging options.

- **Go live**: Go live with your card in 8-10 weeks. This can vary depending on the complexity of the card and packaging.

Custom card prices depend on the level of customization of your card design. See [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/topics/issuing) for more details.

## Launch your card 

The following illustration captures the timeline for each type of card. If you’re interested in custom cards, we recommend starting with standard cards for a pilot launch while we work on the custom cards in parallel. Custom cards typically take 8-10 weeks to produce, though this can vary depending on the design complexity. We advise you on the timeline during your guided design sessions.

## Digital wallet support 

[Digital wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/digital-wallets.md) support Stripe-issued physical cards. A cardholder can add a representation of your physical card to their digital wallet for Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay. Because of market variations, the lead times for digital wallets vary depending on region and might require partnering with Stripe. See [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/topics/issuing) for more details.

## Get support for physical cards 

Different logos on the back of Issuing cards can make it unclear who you should contact for support (for example, Stripe, Visa, or the platform).

- **End user**: If a business or platform issued your card, contact them for support—Stripe can’t assist end users directly.
- **Platform user**: If your cardholders ask for help, contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login). Tell your cardholders to reach out to you for support.
