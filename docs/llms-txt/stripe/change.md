# Modify subscriptions

Change existing subscriptions to cancel, pause, apply prorated charges and credits, and more.

You can change existing subscriptions without having to cancel and recreate them. Set up the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management.md) to let your customers manage their own subscriptions and billing details through a Stripe-hosted page.

For changes that automatically create a new [subscription invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription.md), use [pending updates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates.md) so that the updates are only applied if the new invoice is successfully paid.

## Billing impacts

Not all subscription changes affect billing or generate prorations:

- *Billing-related updates* create prorations and can generate invoices. These include changing prices, quantities, billing periods, or adding or removing subscription items.
- *Non-billing updates* apply immediately without prorations. These include updating metadata, payment methods, tax settings, or applying discounts.

To see billing impacts before making changes, [preview prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md#preview-proration).

> Configuration updates, like metadata and payment methods, don’t generate invoices with `proration_behavior=always_invoice` because they don’t change the amount owed for the current billing period. For a complete list, see [What doesn’t trigger prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations.md#no-prorations).
