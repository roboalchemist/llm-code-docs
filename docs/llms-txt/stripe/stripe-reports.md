# Stripe reporting

Use reports to help analyze and understand your business.

Use prebuilt reports to understand basic activity on your account or across [multiple accounts in an organization](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/multiple-accounts.md) such as payments, payouts, fees, and balance changes. View the reports in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reporting), or download a CSV to complete accounting tasks.
