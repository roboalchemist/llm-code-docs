# Stripe decline codes

Learn about Stripe decline codes and how to resolve them when a charge fails.

Stripe uses its own decline codes, which cover many of the same potential reasons as the traditional [issuer decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/network-codes.md), but define the problem more clearly. Use the following tables to help resolve issues relating to Stripe decline codes.

> Stripe provides the guidance formerly communicated in deprecated decline codes in [advice codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/card.md#retrying-issuer-declines) instead.

## Card Decline Codes 

These are the Stripe decline codes that are used for card payments:

| `authentication_required`           | The card was declined because the transaction requires authentication such as *3D Secure* (3D Secure (3DS) provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects businesses from liability for fraudulent card payments). | When using Stripe’s front ends, in most cases a soft decline from an issuer triggers an authentication flow, allowing the customer to try again and authenticate their card. In some cases, such as *off-session payments* (A payment is described as off-session if it occurs without the direct involvement of the customer, using previously-collected payment information), you might need to request the customer to retry. If the card issuer returns this [decline code](https://support.stripe.com/questions/authenticated-payment-declined-with-an-authentication-required-decline-code) despite a successfully authenticated transaction, the customer needs to contact their card issuer for more information. |
| `authentication_not_handled`        | Related to `authentication_required`. You tried to proceed without performing the required authentication, so the issuer declined again.                                                                                                                      | Run the EMV 3D Secure (3DS) or strong customer authentication (SCA) flow. For off-session payments, collect and prepare authentication on-session first, then fall back to on-session if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `approve_with_id`                   | The payment can’t be authorized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Attempt the payment again. If you still can’t process it, the customer needs to contact their card issuer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
