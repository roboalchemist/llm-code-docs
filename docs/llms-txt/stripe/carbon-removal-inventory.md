# Carbon removal inventory

Learn about available carbon removal inventory.

## Available products

*Products* (Products represent the different types of carbon removal units that are available for purchase) represent the carbon removal inventory available for purchase. All products come from *offtake agreements* (A contractual agreement to purchase carbon removal at a certain price if and when tons of carbon removal are delivered and verified) with carbon removal suppliers in [Frontier’s portfolio](https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio?track=offtake).

### Buy the portfolio

Avoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires a portfolio of technologies. By purchasing the Frontier offtake portfolio, you accelerate the development of a range of carbon removal technologies while simultaneously maximizing the likelihood that your tons are delivered by the expected delivery year.

Frontier conducts diligence on carbon removal technologies to grow this portfolio as the industry evolves.

To provide users with price certainty, we take on the underlying pricing risk. If the actual price per ton delivered is less than price per ton sold, we’ll use all excess funds to buy more carbon removal. If the actual price per ton delivered is greater than the price per ton sold—for example, if only the more expensive suppliers can deliver—the price doesn’t change for you and the losses are borne by us.

We aim to fulfill orders from a diverse set of suppliers within Frontier’s offtake portfolio. However, we won’t fractionalize deliveries in quantities less than 1 ton (for example, an order for 4 tons might include deliveries from up to 4 suppliers).

### Buy from individual suppliers

If you’re excited about a particular technology or want to align purchases with company-specific attributes (for example, geography), you can also purchase from individual suppliers.

## Pricing

Our goal is to bring new buyers into the market, not to make money. We price the products as close to cost as possible.

Fees help cover our underlying costs of administering the carbon removal portfolio. Frontier receives these fees for services including, but not limited to, sourcing, performing diligence, negotiating offtake agreements with, monitoring the progress of, and reallocating demand between carbon removal suppliers.
