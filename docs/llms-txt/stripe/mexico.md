## How we calculate taxes

When both your business and your customer are in Mexico, Stripe calculates Mexican VAT unless the sale is exempt or zero-rated.

If you’re a remote seller registered for VAT in Mexico and providing services to customers located in Mexico, Mexican VAT is typically collected on sales to both individuals and business customers.

When goods are shipped into Mexico from abroad, Stripe treats the sale as an export and doesn’t calculate tax, unless you choose to calculate tax on cross-border sales of goods into Mexico through the tax registration settings. Cross-border sales of goods into Mexico might also be subject to import taxes and customs duties in Mexico, which Stripe doesn’t calculate.

Stripe Tax doesn’t support the reduced VAT rates that apply in the Northern or Southern Border Region of Mexico.
