# Fraud prevention rules

Use fraud prevention rules to guard your business.

Fraud prevention rules allow you to take action whenever a payment matches certain criteria.

Stripe Radar provides built-in rules to help detect and guard against fraud risk on card, ACH and SEPA Direct Debit payments for all Stripe users.

*Radar for Fraud Teams* (Radar for Fraud Teams helps you fine-tune how Radar operates, get fraud insights on suspicious charges, and assess your fraud management performance from a unified dashboard) and [Radar for Platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-for-platforms.md) users can use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) to create custom rules based on the unique business logic specific to your business. For example, you can:

- **Request 3D Secure** (3DS) for all payments that support it and are made by a new customer
- **Allow** all payments from your call center’s IP address
- **Block** payments made from a location or card issued outside your country
- **Review** all payments greater than 1,000 USD that have been made with a prepaid card
- **Review and automatically pause payouts** on accounts that have a high dispute rate *(with Radar for Platforms)*

> EU merchants might be affected by the [Geo-blocking Regulation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/eu-geo-blocking-regulation-changes) and its prohibitions on blocking payments from customers based in EU member states.

## Built-in rules

The following rules are available by default for all Radar users, unless flagged as custom rules, which are only available for Radar for Fraud Teams or Radar for Platforms users.

### AI risk checks 

All Radar offerings provide a set of default rules based on the judgments of our AI models, which are:

`if :risk_level: = 'highest'`

The rule blocks and won’t process payments with a high risk of fraud. This rule is enabled by default for all Radar users.

`if :risk_level: = 'elevated'`

The default behavior for Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams and Radar for Platforms is to place payments into review that we suspect have an elevated risk of fraud.

Radar for Platforms has additional account-level AI models which are incorporated through two default rules:

`if :account_risk_level: = 'highest'`

`if :account_risk_level: = 'elevated'`

We calculate account-level risk utilizing KYC information, transactions, geographic signals and behavioral patterns.

### Traditional card checks 

A payment can still succeed even when the *CVC* (The card verification code (CVC) or card verification value (CVV) is a three- or four-digit number printed directly on a card used to verify the entered card number) or address (*AVS* (The address verification system (AVS) is used to pass billing address information to issuers to verify the data if available)) check fails because issuers evaluate numerous signals when deciding to authorize a payment. A card issuer might still consider a payment that fails CVC or postal code verification legitimate, and therefore approve it.

You can enable Radar’s built-in rules to block certain payments that the card issuer approved. When enabled, these rules also affect attaching a card to a customer, and creating a customer, if you create the card and customer together.

#### CVC and AVS Rules

Effective December 17, 2024, the Dashboard shows these rules to new customers and existing customers who haven’t used the legacy CVC or AVS rules.

`if CVC verification fails based on risk score`

Enable this rule to block payments that fail a card issuer’s CVC verification check, unless Stripe evaluates it as low-risk. This rule doesn’t block payments where the customer doesn’t provide the CVC number because they, for example, use a *wallet* (A digital wallet is a contactless payment method that stores payment options, such as credit and debit cards, allowing customers to use a smart device to make a purchase), or their card’s issuer doesn’t support its verification.

`if Postal code verification fails based on risk score`

Enable this rule to block payments that fail a card issuer’s postal code verification check, unless Stripe evaluates it as low-risk. This rule doesn’t block payments where the customer doesn’t provide the postal code, or their card’s issuer doesn’t support its verification.

#### Legacy CVC and AVS Rules

Effective December 17, 2024, the Dashboard shows these rules to existing customers who have enabled at least one of the rules.

`if CVC verification fails`

Enable this rule to block payments that fail a card issuer’s CVC verification check. This rule doesn’t block payments where the customer doesn’t provide the CVC number because they, for example, use a *wallet* (A digital wallet is a contactless payment method that stores payment options, such as credit and debit cards, allowing customers to use a smart device to make a purchase), or their card’s issuer doesn’t support its verification.

`if postal code verification fails`

Enable this rule to block payments payments when they fail a card issuer’s postal code verification check. This rule doesn’t block payments where the customer doesn’t provide the postal code, or their card’s issuer doesn’t support its verification.

### Built-in rules to request 3D Secure 

Using *3D Secure (3DS)* (3D Secure (3DS) provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects businesses from liability for fraudulent card payments) prompts customers to complete an additional authentication step before they can complete the purchase flow. If 3DS authenticates a payment, the [liability](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#disputed-payments) for any fraud-related disputes for that payment typically shift from the seller to the issuer. This means that in most cases, the seller isn’t responsible for fraud costs on 3DS authenticated payments.

Stripe automatically handles soft decline codes indicating that 3DS is required by issuers. We also trigger 3DS when necessary, adhering to regulations such as the [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA) mandated by the PSD2. Disabling Radar doesn’t prevent 3DS from being triggered in cases where it’s necessary.

Stripe supports three legacy built-in rules to request 3DS when using Radar with [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) or [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md):

1. `if 3D Secure is recommended for card` (Deprecated)
   - Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication based on risk.
1. `if 3D Secure is supported for card` (Deprecated)
   - Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication as long as their card supports it.
1. `if 3D Secure is required for card` (Deprecated)
   - Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication if the card historically [required 3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#three-ds-cards).
   - Regardless of this rule, Stripe automatically triggers 3DS:
     - If a soft decline code indicates the issuer requires 3DS.
     - In adherence to regulations such as PSD2’s [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) mandate.

Because 3DS requires your customer to go through an additional layer of authentication, indiscriminate use of 3DS might lower conversion rates.

Requesting 3DS doesn’t necessarily mean the issuer actually performs 3DS. For more details about possible outcomes, refer to the [3D Secure documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure.md).

#### Custom rules to request 3D Secure  and act on specific outcomes

After attempting 3DS authentication, if you have [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) or [Radar for Platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-for-platforms.md), you can evaluate the result in allow, block, or review rules.

The most important attributes for custom Radar rules are:

- `is_3d_secure` which is true if the card is supported, 3DS was attempted by the issuer and the user didn’t fail authentication. We generally recommend using this in block rules.
- `is_3d_secure_authenticated` which is true if 3DS was attempted by the issuer and the user successfully went through a full authentication. Using this attribute in a block rule excludes legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t fall into a clear failure or successful authentication such as processing errors.
- `has_liability_shift` which is true if Stripe expects the payment to be covered under the *liability shift* (With some 3D Secure transactions, the liability for fraudulent chargebacks (stolen or counterfeit cards) shifts from you to the card issuer) rule. This might [not always be the same as 3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#disputed-payments), for example Apple Pay in certain regions.

For custom rules, we recommend keeping `Request 3DS` and `Block` rules aligned depending on your [risk appetite](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data). However, don’t block transactions where 3DS isn’t supported, such as some wallets.

Here are some examples that show how to achieve this for different use cases:

#### Request 3D Secure based on Radar risk level

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level and above a certain amount.

| Radar rule                                                               | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Request 3D Secure if :risk_level: != 'normal' and :amount_in_usd: > 25` | This rule checks for Radar’s risk level then requests 3DS on all charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. |

In this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.

#### Always require 3D Secure based on Radar risk level

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level of elevated or high, and above a certain amount. If cards don’t support 3DS, you don’t want to accept them.

| Radar rule                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Request 3D Secure if :risk_level: != 'normal' and :amount_in_usd: > 25`                                                                                                                                                 | This rule checks for Radar’s risk level then requests 3DS on all charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Block if not :is_3d_secure:  and :risk_level: != 'normal' and :amount_in_usd: > 25 and  not :is_off_session:  and  :digital_wallet: != 'apple_pay'  and  not (:digital_wallet: = 'android_pay'  and  :has_cryptogram:)` | This rule blocks payments without a 3DS flow for charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. However, it accepts legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t have a clear failure or successful authentication such as `attempt_acknowledged`. It accepts off-session payments such as recurring subscription charges and wallets such as Apple Pay or Google Pay to succeed. |

#### Only accept fully 3D Secure authenticated transactions if 3D Secure is supported

You rely on Stripe triggering 3DS when necessary in cases such as [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA), but don’t want to accept [edge cases](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object.md#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-result) such as processing errors.

| Radar rule                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Block if :is_3d_secure: and not :is_3d_secure_authenticated:` | This rule blocks payments where the card is enrolled in 3DS and 3DS was attempted but the user didn’t successfully authenticate. Cards that don’t support 3DS, SCA exemptions, off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges), and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay) are accepted. |

#### Request 3D Secure based on Metadata

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges with a custom metadata attribute.

| Radar rule                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Request 3D Secure if ::foo:: = 'bar'` | This rule checks for a metadata condition and then requests 3DS. To check Customer metadata, replace `::foo:: = 'bar'` with a value like `::customer:trusted:: = 'false'`. |

In this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.

#### Always require 3D Secure based on Metadata

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges with a custom metadata attribute and block cards that don’t support it.

| Radar rule                                                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Request 3D Secure for all new cards and review if 3D Secure wasn’t supported

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all new cards and manually review charges from cards that don’t support 3DS.

| Radar rule                                                                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.

#### Always require 3D Secure for certain issuer countries

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges from card issuers originating from countries on a [custom list](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists.md) and block cards that don’t support it.

#### Always require 3D Secure based on Radar risk level and review edge cases

You want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level and block cards that don’t support 3DS, but manually review edge cases.

## When to create rules

Only the account owner, administrators, and developers can create rules. If you need [team members](https://support.stripe.com/questions/can-i-invite-other-team-members-or-my-developer-to-use-my-stripe-account) to create rules, check your [team settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) to make sure they have administrative access.

Stripe’s default rules can block a substantial number of fraudulent payments. Businesses that need more control over which payments they want to review, allow, or block can write custom rules through Radar for Fraud Teams. Platforms can write custom rules through Radar for Platforms to calibrate payments risk for their platform and connected accounts and apply account-specific rules.

Consider the following when deciding whether to enable custom rules:

- Whether you see certain features or user behaviors as more risky (for example, use of a disposable email).
- Whether you want to implement rules based on the payment method (for example, automatically blocking SEPA Direct debits that exceed a certain risk score).
- Whether you want to implement rules based on payment amounts or perceived risk level (for example, automatically review if the payment is over 500 USD, automatically allow if the payment is under 5 USD).
- Whether your existing disputed and refunded payments share any common patterns (for example, similar amounts, card types, or countries).
- Whether you have existing rules you want to migrate to Stripe—many of these rules might already be covered by Stripe’s AI models, and you can check how our system performs for your business before customizing it.
- For platforms: Whether you want to automatically raise reviews and optionally pause payouts on accounts.

### How to create effective rules

While rules can help you automate your existing workflows, they can also negatively affect your business if used incorrectly. For example, a rule can automatically allow a large number of payments that are fraudulent or block a large number of legitimate payments if it’s not set up properly.

Keep the following in mind while setting up rules:

- By default, rules apply to all Radar-supported payment methods unless you define a specific payment method in the rule predicate using the `payment_method_type` attribute.
- Rules only apply to future payments and don’t apply to any that you’ve already processed.
- Request 3DS rules only apply when using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout.md), [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md), or [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse.md), and are evaluated before review, block, and allow rules.
- Before implementing any block rule to block all payments or pause payouts for accounts that meet its criteria, consider whether you’d rather review such payments or accounts first.
- Implement allow rules minimally, because they override Stripe’s default rules along with any other custom rules that match the same criteria.
- You can create a maximum of 200 transaction rules and 100 account rules.

## Construct transaction rules

You can add and manage rules from the [Rules tab of the Radar page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) in the Dashboard.

To add a new rule:

1. Click **+ Add rule**.
1. Choose the type rule type from the sub-menu.
1. In the rule editor, construct a rule using the syntax `{action} if {attribute} {operator} {value}` where:
   - `{action}`: How Radar responds when the rule criteria is met. This value is pre-populated based on the rule type selection you chose.
   - `{attribute}`: The element of the transaction to evaluate, such as the amount or card type. Begin typing with `:` to open a list of valid attributes. You can also evaluate your custom metadata by enclosing it in double colons, for example, `::product_sku::`.
   - `{operator}`: How to compare the attribute to the value, such as `=`, `>`, `!=`, and so on.
   - `{value}`: The value of the attribute to evaluate.
1. Click **Test rule**.
1. Correct any detected validation errors, if necessary.
1. On the **Review new rule** page, review how this rule performs against your recent transactions to confirm whether you want to enable it. If the rule might impact transactions from more than one payment method, use the payment method filter to view rule performance by payment method (for example, ACH or Cards).
1. Click **Add rule** to begin applying this rule to all future transactions.

### Review rules

Stripe still processes payments normally when they meet a review rule’s criteria. But we place them into your [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar) so your team can look at them more closely. Setting up a rule that’s too broad can result in too many payments being placed into your review queue, slowing down your customers and burdening your review team.

Stripe’s rule testing interface runs a simulation on the last 6 months of charges to determine how many legitimate, fraudulent, and blocked payments would have been affected by the rule, had it been implemented. While testing a rule and examining the last 6 months, make sure that:

- **Overall volume of payments is low**. Reviewing these payments shouldn’t create a burden to your team.
- **Human reviewers add value**. A human reviewer can generally identify if a payment was fraudulent with greater confidence than the automated system.
- **The rule results in a mix of successful and refunded or disputed payments**. This means that additional inspection on these types of payments can help separate legitimate payments from those that are fraudulent.

The following is an example of how to improve a review rule created by a business that wants to review pre-paid credit cards.

| Original rule                         | Improved rule                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if :card_funding: = 'prepaid'`       | `if :is_disposable_email: and :card_funding: = 'prepaid'` |
| Too broad—results in too many reviews | More focused—results in a smaller number of reviews       |

### Block rules

You can use block rules to block payments that you’re confident are fraudulent, or based on any restrictions your business has in place (such as blocking payments from prepaid cards). If you’re not sure how to apply block rules, we recommend placing payments in review using a review rule. After spending some time reviewing these payments for potential false positives, you can confirm whether you want to create a block rule instead.

Block rules only impact fraudulent and successful payments, because already-blocked payments are unaffected. While testing a rule, make sure that you:

- **Keep false positives as low as possible**. During testing, Stripe identifies the number of successful and disputed payments that would’ve been matched by the rule. A good block rule results in significantly more fraudulent payments blocked than legitimate payments.
- **Minimize unnecessary rules**. If your rule appears to perform very well but is already covered by an existing rule, your newer rule might not be necessary. Similarly, if the results during testing appear to be mixed, consider setting up a review rule instead so you can gather more information about those types of payments.

The following is an example of how to improve a block rule created by a business that’s suffering from a high level of fraud from payments outside the US:

| Original rule                                        | Improved rule                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if :card_country: != 'US'`                          | `if :card_country: != 'US' and :risk_level: = 'elevated'` |
| Too broad—high number of legitimate payments blocked | More focused—results in a smaller number of reviews       |

### Allow rules

### Allow rule availability

The ability to create allow rules isn’t immediately available to all users. If you’d like to enable this feature, [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact).

Allow rules override all of your other rules, so use them with caution. Many businesses might not need to implement allow rules. If you have concerns that an allow rule could let through even a small number of fraudulent payments, consider adjustments to further restrict these rules before implementing them.

Allow rules apply to all new payments as soon as you create the rule. This includes any payments that are similar to previously blocked payments. While testing a rule, make sure that you:

- **Examine the number of previously blocked payments that would have been allowed**. Allow rules override all other rules and Stripe’s risk assessment. When testing a new allow rule, all of the payments shown would have been allowed if this rule were active. This can include payments that had been blocked or disputed, impacting your future dispute rates.
- **Continue to block any high-risk payments**. You can do this by adding the following to any allow rule: `and :risk_level: != 'highest'`
- **Evaluate a history of legitimate transactions at your business**. You can analyze connections between your own customers to allow a higher volume of transactions based on a history of legitimate purchases. This helps you block fewer payments from customers that have a proven history at your business. To do this, review the [attributes list](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference.md#supported-attributes) and look for attributes that include the word “customer.”

The following is an example of how to improve an allow rule for a business that generally (but not always) sees good payments coming from customers in the United Kingdom:

| Original rule                                  | Improved rule                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `if :ip_country: = 'GB'`                       | `if :ip_country: = 'GB' and :risk_level: != 'highest'`           |
| Too broad—some fraudulent payments are allowed | More focused—a smaller number of fraudulent payments are allowed |

## Maintaining your rules

As your business continues to grow, you want to be sure that your rules continue to reflect the types of customers that you want to do business with. The following are some best practices to keep rules current for the state of your business.

### Regularly monitor rules to ensure they’re still effective

#### Rule metrics

Fraud patterns constantly change, so we provide [metrics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules) to show how these rules are performing. These metrics vary depending on the type of rule, because the rule types perform different actions.
![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rule-performance.8d495f28c352641ff7b710df3c3df2ed.png)

You may spot a difference in the number of payments that matched review rules and the number of payments sent to your review queue in the same time period. Since only *successful* payments are placed in review, payments that match a review rule’s criteria but get declined by the issuer, for example, are not sent to your review queue.

Use the **rule performance chart** to understand the behavior of your Radar rules. Look for unexpected spikes or declines in the number of payments matching your rules, such as allow rules letting too many payments through or block rules blocking too many. These spikes may indicate a change in the types of payments your business is receiving or that might warrant updates to the rules themselves. Updates made to rules are displayed as triangles on the graph and can help you compare the impact of the change before and after you make it.

**Color-coded lines** track the number of payments that match [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/3d-secure.md) rules, allow rules, block rules, and review rules. **Triangular symbols** on these graph lines represent updates to rules of the corresponding type.

You can find information about the effectiveness of your rules and see how many payments each one has taken action against. You can also view and download a filtered list of every payment that a rule has been applied to. Evaluate this information to help you decide if you need to make changes to any rules or remove them entirely.

To view additional commands, click the overflow menu (⋯) menu. Additional commands include: **Disable**, **Enable**, **Edit** or **Delete** for any rule.

You can also use our reporting products Sigma and Data Pipelines to [query disputes and fraud data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data.md), including rule decisions and attributes for each individual payment.

#### Evaluate rule effectiveness

You can find information about the effectiveness of your rules and see how many payments each one has affected. You can also view and download a filtered list of every payment that a rule has been applied to. Review the sample questions in the following table to help you decide if you need to make changes to any rules or remove them entirely.

**Allow rules**

For allow rules, Radar for Fraud Teams users can view:

If these disputed metrics are high, you might consider writing more narrowly targeted allow rules, so that you’re not allowing payments through that are eventually disputed.

- **Allowed payments**—The total number of payments allowed by your rules.
- **Volume, allowed payments**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with payments allowed by your rules.
- **Risk score**—The corresponding [risk outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation.md#risk-outcomes) assigned by our AI models to the set of payments allowed by your rules.
- **Disputes from overrides**—The total number of allowed payments that were disputed.
- **Volume, disputes from overrides**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with disputes from allowed payments.

**Block rules**

For block rules, we display:

If estimated false positive rate metrics are high, you might consider writing more narrowly targeted block rules or reviewing which payments are covered by the rule to avoid blocking as many non-fraudulent payments.

- **Blocked payments**—The total number of payments blocked by your rules.
- **Volume, blocked payments**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with payments blocked by your rules.

Radar for Fraud Teams users can also view:

- **Risk score**—The corresponding [risk outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation.md#risk-outcomes) assigned by Stripe’s AI models to the set of payments allowed by your rules.
- **Est. false positive rate**—The estimated percentage of non-fraudulent payments that were blocked for both your block rules as a set and by individual rules. (These estimates are made using the estimated false positive rates of the corresponding AI risk scores, which we calculate with experiments across the Stripe network.)
- **Est. fraudulent payments prevented**—The estimated number of fraudulent payments that your block rules prevented. Stripe uses AI risk scores, calculated by analyzing millions of transactions across the Stripe network, to predict payments with a high probability of being disputed or declined due to fraud and estimate which of those payments were successfully blocked by your rules.

For review rules, Radar for Fraud Teams users can view:

- **Payments sent to review**—The total number of payments that were sent to manual review by your rules.
- **Volume, approved reviews**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with approved payment reviews.
- **Refund rate**—The percentage of reviews that were refunded.
- **Disputes from approved reviews**—The total number of payments that were approved in your review, but were ultimately disputed.
- **Volume, disputes from approved reviews**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with disputes from approved payment reviews.

#### View rule history

You can view a history of changes made to your Radar rules. This audit trail helps you understand when a rule was created, edited, enabled, or disabled, and by which user on your team.

To see the activity for a specific rule, go to the [Rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/rules) tab on the Radar page and click the name of rule.

The **Rule activity** log shows a summary of all modifications. Click on the specific event to see more details, such as the complete rule predicate before and after the update. You can only see rule changes for the past 180 days.

Regularly reviewing this activity can help you correlate rule modifications with their impact on your business.

### Regularly monitor your manual review queue

If your review queue is getting too large to manage, check to see if you have the right rules in place. If most reviews end up being refunded as fraudulent, consider some additional rules to block payments. Likewise, if most payments are approved, consider making your review rules more focused.

### Analyze your disputed and refunded payments

[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes.md) are inherently linked to fraud, so the more you do to reduce fraud, the lower your dispute rate. Check to see if disputed payments share any similar characteristics (for example, from the same locations or of similar amounts). You can also perform this type of investigation by looking at payments that have been refunded during a review. If you see trends, you can test and create the appropriate rules. If any payments appear to be fraudulent, refund and report them as fraud to avoid potential disputes.

You can also use our reporting products, Sigma and Data Pipeline, to [query disputes and fraud data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data.md).

You can respond to any incoming disputes using the Dashboard or through the API, and our [dispute documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes.md) includes some suggestions on how to present a well documented case.

### Anticipate large changes to your business that might impact your fraud rate

If you’re planning any major product releases or changes to your service (for example, a new, high-value product or expanding your service into new countries), you might want to monitor these payments in the beginning. For these kinds of changes, it’s a good practice to set up some review rules so you can examine any new payments. Reviewing these payments and identifying patterns can help you set up new rules to protect your business from fraud.

## Rules support multiple payment methods (New)

By default, Radar rules screen payments for cards, ACH and SEPA Direct Debits for most users. We support the high risk block rule for all of these payment methods for all Stripe Radar users. For Radar for Fraud Teams or Radar for Platforms users, we also support custom rules using the `:payment_method_type:` attribute to write rules that apply only to specific payment methods, for example: `if :payment_method_type: = 'us_bank_account'`. Learn more about [supported attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes.md).

## Construct account rules

With Radar for Platforms, you can also add and manage account rules from the Rules tab of the Radar page in the Dashboard. To add a new rule:

1. Click **+ Add rule**.
1. Choose the rule type: “Review” or “Payout pause” (which will raise a review AND payout pause).
1. In the rule editor, construct a rule using the syntax `{action} if {attribute} {operator} {value}` where:
   - `{action}`: How Radar responds when the rule criteria is met. This value is pre-populated based on the rule type selection you chose.
   - `{attribute}`: The element of the transaction to evaluate, such as the amount or card type. Begin typing with `:` to open a list of valid attributes.
   - `{operator}`: How to compare the attribute to the value, such as `=`, `>`, `!=`, and so on.
   - `{value}`: The value of the attribute to evaluate.
1. Click **Test rule**.
1. Correct any detected validation errors, if necessary.
1. On the **Review new rule** page, view which accounts would match this rule today to confirm whether you want to enable it.
1. Click **Activate rule** to begin applying this rule to all existsing and future accounts.

Testing account-level rules takes longer than transaction testing, but we recommend testing to avoid unintentionally raising accounts for review or pausing automatic payouts. First test raising accounts for review behavior. Then test automatic payout pauses after you’re confident the rule impacts accounts as expected.
