# Disputes on Connect platforms

Learn about the dispute responsibilities on Connect platforms.

## Direct charges

For connected accounts that use [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges.md) and where your platform isn’t liable for negative balances (including Standard accounts), those accounts handle their own disputes. The disputed funds and dispute fees are taken from their balance, not the platform’s.

For connected accounts where your platform is *liable for negative balances* (The responsibility for managing risk and recovering negative balances on connected accounts. Stripe or the Connect platform can be liable for negative balances on connected accounts) (including Custom and Express accounts), you’re ultimately responsible for any disputes involving those accounts.

For direct payments on connected accounts where your platform is liable for negative balances, Stripe debits disputed amounts and fees from the connected account’s balance. However, your platform is ultimately liable. If Stripe can’t debit the disputed amount and fee from the connected account, Stripe debits it from your platform account.

## Destination and separate charges and transfers

For [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges.md) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers.md), with or without `on_behalf_of`, Stripe debits dispute amounts and fees from your platform account.

We recommend setting up [a webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md) to listen to [dispute created events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-charge.dispute.created). When that happens, you can attempt to recover funds from the connected account by reversing the transfer through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers) or by [creating a transfer reversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfer_reversals/create.md).

If the connected account has a negative balance, Stripe attempts to [debit its external account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances.md#automatically-debit-connected-accounts) if `debit_negative_balances` is set to `true`.

If you challenge the dispute and win, you can transfer the funds that you previously reversed back to the connected account. If your platform has an insufficient balance, the transfer fails. Prevent insufficient balance errors by [adding funds to your Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds.md).

> Retransferring a previous reversal is subject to [cross-border transfer restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities.md#transfers-cross-border), meaning you might have no means to repay your connected account. Instead, wait to recover disputed cross-border payment transfers for destination charges with `on_behalf_of` until after a dispute is lost.

To automate dispute management and handle chargebacks, browse [Fraud Stripe Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud) on the App Marketplace.

## Provide Connect embedded components to allow your connected accounts to respond to disputes

Your connected accounts can use [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components.md) to manage disputes from within your site.

The following components support dispute management:

- [Payments component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/payments.md): Displays all of an account’s payments and disputes.
- [Disputes list component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/disputes-list.md): Displays all of an account’s disputes.
- [Disputes for a payment component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/disputes-for-a-payment.md): Displays the disputes for a single specified payment. You can use it to include dispute management functionality on a page with your payments UI.

Note: The following is a preview/demo component that behaves differently than live mode usage with real connected accounts. The actual component has more functionality than what might appear in this demo component. For example, for connected accounts without Stripe dashboard access (custom accounts), no user authentication is required in production.
