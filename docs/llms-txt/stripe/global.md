[Stripe Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing.md) provides the tools and infrastructure to do business across borders, whether you’re starting a new card program or expanding an existing one.

## Local issuing

Most Issuing programs use local Issuing. This means the Issuer (the financial institution providing cards) and the Stripe platform are in the same region as the connected account and cardholder. For example, if your business is  established in Europe, you can issue cards to any company or individual residing in any European Economic Area (EEA) country.

Locally issued cards can be used anywhere your card network (Visa or Mastercard) is accepted. They’re denominated in USD, EUR, or GBP depending on your platform’s location. Automatic currency conversion occurs as necessary.
