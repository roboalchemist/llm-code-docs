## Pre-approved FAQ

Use the following pre-approved copy for FAQs hosted on your website or your user dashboard.

**How do you determine who qualifies for an offer?**

Eligibility is determined based on a combination of factors, including overall sales volume and history with [Brand Name]. Eligible US businesses will receive an email [and Dashboard notification] if they have an offer available.

**Do I have to pay interest?**

No, you’ll pay one flat fee that doesn’t change. You won’t pay any interest on top of this fee.

**Will applying for an offer affect my personal credit rating?**

No, there is no personal credit check. All offers are based on your history with [brand name].

**Can I request a different offer amount?**

When you log into your [brand name] Dashboard, you can use a slider to choose a custom amount (up to the maximum offer amount). The loan fee and repayment rate adjust based on the amount you choose.

**When do I need to pay the flat fee?**

You’ll automatically pay the flat fee through a percentage of your sales until the total amount owed is repaid. The fee isn’t charged up-front.

**How does repayment work?**

Repayment is collected automatically through a percentage of your [brand name + payment] sales as they’re processed which means you pay down more when business is busy and less if things slow down. As long as you meet your minimum payment requirement, what you pay each day adjusts to your sales.

**What is a minimum payment?**

A minimum payment is the minimum amount that you’re expected to repay every repayment period. That period will be determined during underwriting and based on the total term of your loan offer. If your automatic repayments do not meet this minimum, you’ll be required to pay the remaining amount at the end of the period. You can view your minimum payment amount in the Dashboard or in your loan agreement.

**How do I make my minimum payment?**

If your payments deducted from sales cover the minimum payment requirement for payment period, no action will be taken. If you have not met the minimum payment amount by the end of the payment period, Stripe will automatically debit your bank account or account balance the balance needed to meet your minimum payment. There’s no action needed on your part.

**After I accept an offer, how quickly will I get my funds?**

If your application is approved, you’ll see the funds in your bank account typically in as soon as 2 business days. To make sure that funds are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

**Can I have my Capital funds paid out to a card?**

We currently don’t support disbursal of funds to a card. To make sure that funds are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

**What happens when my offer expires?**

Each offer is available for 30 days. After that point, your business will automatically be re-evaluated to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer.

**Can I repay my loan early?**

Yes, you can make additional payments or pay the total amount owed in full at any point by clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your Dashboard. There are no additional fees for early repayment.

**Will repaying early qualify me for a new offer?**

After you repay the total amount owed, we’ll automatically evaluate you for a new offer. Repaying early doesn’t automatically qualify you for a new offer.

**How should I report these funds on my taxes?**

Tax reporting is often dependent on your specific situation, so we encourage you to talk with a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting. In general, Stripe Capital funds would not be considered taxable income at the time of receipt, and the amounts withheld to satisfy your obligations are not tax deductible.

**Who can I contact to learn more about the Stripe Capital program?**

If you have additional questions about how our financing program through Stripe Capital works, you can contact our partners at [capital+support@stripe.com](mailto:capital+support@stripe.com).

## Pre-approved user support article template

Use the following pre-approved copy for a support article about Stripe Capital that you can host on your website. This template uses a placeholder platform name (“Rocket Rides”), which you can replace with your platform name.

### Stripe Capital

Rocket Rides has partnered with Stripe to offer eligible businesses access to fast, flexible financing through the Stripe Capital program.

### Eligibility

Rocket Rides businesses are automatically reviewed for eligibility on a daily basis, and we’ll send you an email if your business qualifies for an offer. The criteria for eligibility is based on a number of factors including your transaction volume and history with Rocket Rides.

Eligible US businesses will receive an email if they have an offer to apply for available.

### Offer structure

If eligible, you’ll receive an email with your personalized offers and you can choose the one that works best for your business. Each offer will outline:

- The financing amount: The dollar amount that will be deposited into your bank account
- The flat fee: The fee you’ll pay over time in exchange for the financing amount – there are no other fees and or compounding interest
- The total amount owed: The sum of the financing amount and the flat fee
- The repayment rate: The percentage of your daily card transactions processed through Rocket Rides that will be withheld to repay the total amount owed

Here’s an example offer you might receive:

- financing amount: 17,000 USD
- flat fee: 1700 USD
- total amount owed: 18,700 USD
- repayment rate: 12%

If you accepted the example offer above and were approved, you would receive 17,000 USD in the bank account associated with your Rocket Rides account within 1-2 days along with your usual payout. Stripe would then withhold 12% of your daily transaction total in addition to the usual processing fees until you’ve paid down the total amount owed of 18,700 USD (the 17,000 USD advanced plus the 1,700 USD flat fee).

### Repayment

You’ll automatically repay the financing over time through a percentage of your transactions according to your repayment rate. The repayment process will begin automatically 1-2 business days after the funds have been deposited into your account. The more card sales you process through Rocket Rides Payments, the faster you’ll repay.

If you would prefer to repay faster or repay the entire outstanding balance, you can arrange to make a manual payment in addition to the withheld amounts by clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your loan overview page. There are no additional fees for early repayment.

Repaying early doesn’t guarantee subsequent financing offers. Accounts are automatically reviewed for additional offers on a daily basis and we’ll send you an email if you qualify for any additional offers.

You’re expected to repay a minimum amount every repayment period. That period will be determined during underwriting and based on the total term of your loan offer. If the total payments deducted from your sales cover the minimum payment requirement, then you’ll continue to pay back your loan through a percentage of your transactions.

However, if payments deducted from your sales over that period happen to fall below the minimum payment requirement, you’ll be required to pay the remaining amount. Stripe automatically debits your bank account or account balance for the balance needed to meet your minimum payment. You can view your minimum payment amount in the Dashboard or in your loan agreement.

To see a daily summary of your repayment progress, see the loan overview page.

### Pre-loan and general questions

**Am I eligible for a loan through Stripe Capital? (eligible)**

Thank you for your interest in Stripe Capital!

We’re pleased to inform you that you currently qualify for a loan offer through Stripe Capital. You can see all terms in your Stripe Capital application form, which was sent to you in email by Stripe.

You can choose a loan amount (from a pre-set range) that’s best for your business in your Stripe Capital application, with the highest being the maximum amount your account currently qualifies for.

Once you select an amount, you’ll proceed with filling out an application confirming a few details about your account and your business. Let us know if you have any questions along the way!

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**Am I eligible for a loan through Stripe Capital? (not eligible)**

Thank you for your interest in Stripe Capital! You don’t currently qualify for an offer through Stripe Capital.

Eligibility is based on a variety of factors, including your account’s transaction volume and history with [platform name] Payments. Businesses are reviewed for eligibility on a daily basis, and we send an email when you’re eligible for an offer.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**How does Stripe Capital work and how is repayment structured?**

Thanks for your interest in Stripe Capital! I’m happy to explain how it works at a high level.

Eligibility is based on a variety of factors, including your account’s history with [platform] Payments. If you become eligible, we’ll email you with a few offers, including the maximum amount you’re eligible for, and let you choose the one that works best for you. After a final review of your loan application and if you are approved, the money is then transferred to your bank account.

To pay down your loan, Stripe automatically withholds a percentage of each of your transactions. How it works:

– Loan amount. This is the amount of money that will be deposited into your bank account. For example: 17,000 USD. – Loan fee. This is the amount you’ll pay for the loan itself. For example: 1,000 USD. (There are no other fees or interest charges.) – Total amount due. This is the total amount of money you’ll have to pay back. In this case, 18,000 USD. (17,000 USD + 1,000 USD = 18,000 USD) – Withhold rate. This is the percentage of your daily transactions that we’ll withhold to pay down your loan. For example: 7%. – Minimum payment. Every 60 days, you have to pay 1/9 of the total amount due. In this case, you’d have to pay 2,000 USD every 60 days. (18,000 USD / 9 = 2,000 USD.)

Note: This example assumes a 60-day repayment period which may vary across loans. Refer to your loan contract for your specific minimum repayment period, which might be different.

In this example, the loans are designed so that withholding 7% of your transactions for 60 days should satisfy the 2,000 USD minimum payment requirement. But, if withholding 7% of your sales for 60 days only added up to 1,500 USD, we’d debit your bank account or account balance for the remaining 500 USD.

If you take a loan and later decide you want to pay it off early, you can do so at no extra cost.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What is the typical interest rate associated with loans through Stripe Capital?**

Loans from Stripe Capital have a fixed fee, not an interest rate. This one fee is the only cost associated with your loan. If you take a loan from Stripe Capital, keep the following considerations in mind:

– Loan amount. This is the amount of money that will be deposited into your bank account. – Loan fee. This is the amount you’ll pay for the loan. – Withhold rate. This is the percentage of your daily sales we’ll withhold to pay down your loan. For example: 7%.

Generally speaking, a loan’s interest rate depends on how quickly the loan is paid off. Contractually, you have up to 18 months to pay back the total amount due (the loan amount + loan fee).

However, given that you pay down your loan through per-transaction withholding, how quickly you pay down your loan (and thus, the loan’s “interest” rate) varies on a case-by-case basis. For example, if your sales are going really well, you’ll pay a little more towards your loan each day, and so maybe you’ll pay down your loan in 7 months. But, if your sales slow down, you’ll pay a little less on your loan each day, and so maybe you’ll pay down your loan in 14 months.

No matter how quickly you pay down your loan, the loan fee doesn’t change, which means the loan’s interest rate would vary depending on your sales

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What is the repayment length of a loan?**

Thanks for your interest in Stripe Capital! Each loan offer is tailored specifically to your account - as such, repayment lengths might vary from business to business. On average, Stripe Capital expects most borrowers to take between 9-10 months to pay down their loan completely. You have a maximum of 9-18 months to pay down your loan, depending on your loan offer. You can also repay your loan in full or through partial manual payments at no extra cost.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What is Stripe Capital? How do [platform] and Stripe work together?**

We’ve partnered with Stripe to give businesses access to financing to invest in growth and manage cash flow. Through this partnership, [platform] can connect you with Stripe Capital, which is a program offering small business loans originated by Celtic Bank. Stripe helps [platform] identify merchants using [platform] Payments who might be eligible for these loans, so be on the lookout for an email from Stripe about your eligibility for a Stripe Capital loan.

### User has an active loan

**I accepted my loan, where are my funds?**

Great news! Your application for funding through Stripe Capital has been approved, and your loan funds have been deposited to the bank account connected to [platform] (this usually happens within 1-2 days of being approved). These funds are transferred to your bank account. To make sure that funds are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**Can I have my Capital funds paid out to a card?**

Stripe Capital currently doesn’t support disbursing funds to a card. To make sure that funds are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**How can I view reporting on my loan through Stripe Capital?**

For detailed reporting for your Stripe Capital loan, view the Stripe Capital loan overview page (accessible through the link in the email from Stripe). Additionally, every week, Stripe will email you with details on your loan progress and payments made.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**Can I pay down my existing loan through Stripe Capital in full or in part?**

Yes, you do have the ability to pay down your loan early in full or with manual one-off payments. Yes, you can make additional payments or pay the total amount owed in full at any point by clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your Capital Dashboard.

Your loan doesn’t accrue interest (so there’s no penalty for using the maximum term to pay off the loan), and paying down a current loan early isn’t a guarantee of a subsequent loan offer. Accounts are automatically reviewed for additional funding on a daily basis. We’ll email you when you’re qualified for any future offers.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**Can I obtain an additional loan through Stripe?**

Thanks for reaching out regarding this question!

At present, borrowers in the Stripe Capital program are limited to a single loan at a time. However, once you pay off your current loan, your business might become eligible for a subsequent loan offer. Additionally, I have noted your interest in obtaining a second loan, and will communicate this feedback to the Stripe Capital team.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What happens if I don’t make my minimum payment through withholdings on my [platform] payments account?**

If your per-transaction withholdings don’t cover your minimum payment requirement, Stripe Capital, our partner, debits the difference from your linked bank account or account balance at the end of your payment period. If this debit fails, then Stripe reaches out to you to help you meet your payment obligations and determine next steps.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What happens if I can’t make a minimum payment on time?**

Please reach out to Stripe support directly by emailing capital+support@stripe.com and they can work with you to help you meet your obligation.

Sent on behalf of Celtic Bank.

**What happens if I want to stop using [platform]?**

We understand you still have an active loan and want to make sure you have the information you need to manage repayment. For this loan, we’ve partnered with Stripe, a leading payments platform, to connect you with Stripe Capital. Please reach out to the Stripe Capital team at capital+support@stripe.com where they can share the next best steps on how to continue to access your loan information and manage repayment.

**Can I pay my existing financing through Stripe Capital in full or in part?**

Yes, you do have the ability to pay your financing early in full or with manual one-off payments. To make manual payments, reach out to Stripe’s capital partner, YouLend, at stripecapital@youlend.com.

Your financing doesn’t accrue interest, so there’s no penalty or interest rate for using the maximum term to pay off the financing. Paying down a current financing early isn’t a guarantee of a subsequent or an earlier financing offer. Accounts are automatically reviewed for additional funding on a daily basis. We’ll email you when you’re qualified for any future offers.

**Can I obtain an additional financing through Stripe?**

Thanks for reaching out regarding this question!

At present, borrowers in the Stripe Capital program are limited to a single financing at a time. However, once you pay off your current financing, your business might become eligible for a subsequent offer. Additionally, I have noted your interest in obtaining a second financing, and will communicate this feedback to the Stripe Capital team.

**What happens if I want to stop using [platform]?**

We understand you still have an active financing and want to make sure you have the information you need to manage payment. For this financing, we’ve partnered with Stripe, a leading payments platform, to connect you with Stripe Capital. Please reach out to the Stripe Capital team at capital+support@stripe.com where they can share the next best steps on how to continue to access your financing information and manage payment.
