# Migrate to the Payment Element with the Payment Intents API

Accept many payment methods with a single Element.

> #### Interested in subscriptions, tax, discounts, shipping, or currency conversion?
> 
> Migrate to the [Payment Element with the Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration-ewcs.md), an integration that manages subscriptions, tax, discounts, shipping, and currency conversion for you.

Previously, each payment method (cards, iDEAL, and so on) required a separate Element. By migrating to the Payment Element, you can accept many payment methods with a single Element.

PaymentIntents and SetupIntents each have their own set of migration guidelines. See the appropriate guide for your integration path, including example code.

> If your integration still uses the Charges API with tokens, follow the [Migrating to the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration.md#web) guide first.

# PaymentIntent migration

> This is a PaymentIntent migration for when integration-path is one-time. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration?integration-path=one-time.

If your existing integration uses the [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) API to create and track payments or save card details during a payment, follow the steps below to use the Payment Element.

## Enable payment methods

> This integration path doesn’t support BLIK or pre-authorized debits that use the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS).

View your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a *PaymentIntent* (The Payment Intents API tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods).

By default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.

## Update Elements instance [Client-side]

Next, update your client-side code to pass `mode`, `currency`, and `amount` when you create the Elements instance. For use with a PaymentIntent, set the `mode` to `'payment'` and the `currency` and `amount` to what you’ll charge your customer.

#### Javascript

### Before

```javascript
const stripe =
    Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const elements = stripe.elements();
```

### After

```javascript
const stripe =
    Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'payment',
  currency: 'usd',
  amount: 1099,
};
const elements = stripe.elements(options);
```

#### React

### Before

```jsx
 const stripePromise =
     loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');

 function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
};
```

### After

```jsx
const stripePromise =
    loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'payment',
  currency: 'usd',
  amount: 1099,
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
};
```

## Optional: Save payment details during a payment

If your existing integration also saves payment details during a payment, use the `setup_future_usage` option when creating the Elements group instead of passing it at the confirm payment stage with `stripe.confirmCardPayment`. The Payment Element will use this information to display additional input fields and show mandates as needed.

> You can’t save some payment methods during payments. You can still enable these payment methods for other use cases, but customers won’t see them as an option when setting up future payments. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) for more details about what’s supported.

#### Javascript

```javascript
const stripe =
    Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'payment',
  currency: 'usd',
  amount: 1099,setup_future_usage: 'off_session',
};
const elements = stripe.elements(options);
```

#### React

```jsx
const stripePromise =
    loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'payment',
  currency: 'usd',
  amount: 1099,setup_future_usage: 'off_session',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
};
```

You also need to pass `setup_future_usage` when creating your PaymentIntent.

#### curl

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \
  -u <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>: \
  -d "customer"="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}" \-d "setup_future_usage"= "off_session" \
  -d "amount"=1099 \
  -d "currency"="usd" \
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
intent = Stripe::PaymentIntent.create({
  customer: customer['id'],setup_future_usage: 'off_session',
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'usd',
})
```

#### Python

```python
intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
  customer=customer['id'],setup_future_usage='off_session',
  amount=1099,
  currency='usd',
)
```

#### PHP

```php
$intent = \Stripe\PaymentIntent::create([
  'customer' => $customer->id,'setup_future_usage' => 'off_session',
  'amount' => 1099,
  'currency' => 'usd',
]);
```

#### Java

```java
PaymentIntentCreateParams params =
  PaymentIntentCreateParams.builder()
    .setCustomer(customer.getId()).setSetupFutureUsage(PaymentIntentCreateParams.SetupFutureUsage.OFF_SESSION)
    .setAmount(1099L)
    .setCurrency("usd")
    .build();
PaymentIntent paymentIntent = PaymentIntent.create(params);
```

#### Node.js

```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  customer: customer.id,setup_future_usage: 'off_session',
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'usd',
});
```

#### Go

```go
params := &stripe.PaymentIntentParams{
  Customer: stripe.String(customer.ID),SetupFutureUsage: stripe.String("off_session"),
  Amount: stripe.Int64(1099),
  Currency: stripe.String(string(stripe.CurrencyUSD)),
}
```

#### .NET

```csharp
var options = new PaymentIntentCreateOptions
{
    Customer = "{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",SetupFutureUsage = "off_session",
    Amount = 1099,
    Currency = "usd",
};
```

## Optional: Additional Elements options [Client-side]

The [Elements object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_without_intent) accepts additional options that influence payment collection. Based on the options provided, the Payment Element displays available payment methods from those you’ve enabled. Learn more about [payment method support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md).

## Add the Payment Element [Client-side]

If you’re using [React Stripe.js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js), update to the latest package to use the Payment Element.

You can now replace the Card Element and individual payment methods Elements with the Payment Element. The Payment Element automatically adjusts to collect input fields based on the payment method and country (for example, full billing address collection for SEPA Direct Debit) so you don’t have to maintain customized input fields anymore.

The following example replaces `CardElement` with `PaymentElement`:

#### JavaScript

```html
<form id="payment-form"><div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Mount the Payment Element here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const paymentElement = elements.create("payment");
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

#### React

```jsx
 return (
   <div className="CheckoutForm"><PaymentElement />
    <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
);
```

If your payment flow already always collects details like the customer’s name or email address, you can prevent the Payment Element from collecting this information by passing the [fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-fields) option when creating the Payment Element. If you disable the collection of a certain field, you must pass that same data back with [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment).

## Update your PaymentIntent creation call [Server-side]

The Payment Element allows you to accept multiple payment methods. You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. We prioritize payment methods that increase conversion and are most relevant to the customer’s currency and location.

Any of the additional elements options passed when creating the Elements group in the earlier step should also be passed when creating the PaymentIntent.

#### curl

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \
  -u <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>: \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2025-10-29.clover" \
  -d "amount"=1099 \
  -d "currency"="usd" \-d "automatic_payment_methods[enabled]"=true \
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
intent = Stripe::PaymentIntent.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'usd',# In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
})

```

#### Python

```python
intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
  amount=1099,
  currency='usd',# In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods={
    'enabled': True,
  },
)
```

#### PHP

```php
$intent = \Stripe\PaymentIntent::create([
  'amount' => 1099,
  'currency' => 'usd',// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  'automatic_payment_methods' => [
    'enabled' => 'true',
  ],
]);
```

#### Java

```java

// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
Stripe.apiKey = "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>";
PaymentIntentCreateParams params =
  PaymentIntentCreateParams.builder()
    .setAmount(1099L)
    .setCurrency("usd")// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
    .setAutomaticPaymentMethods(
      PaymentIntentCreateParams.AutomaticPaymentMethods
        .builder()
        .setEnabled(true)
        .build()
    )
    .build();
PaymentIntent paymentIntent = PaymentIntent.create(params);
```

#### Node.js

```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'usd',// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### Go

```go

// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
stripe.Key = "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>"
params := &stripe.PaymentIntentParams{
  Amount: stripe.Int64(1099),
  Currency: stripe.String(string(stripe.CurrencyUSD)),// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  AutomaticPaymentMethods: &stripe.PaymentIntentAutomaticPaymentMethodsParams{
    Enabled: stripe.Bool(true),
  },
}
pi, _ := paymentintent.New(params)
```

#### .NET

```csharp

// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
StripeConfiguration.ApiKey = "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>";
var options = new PaymentIntentCreateOptions
{
    Amount = 1099,
    Currency = "usd",// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
    AutomaticPaymentMethods = new PaymentIntentAutomaticPaymentMethodsOptions
    {
        Enabled = true,
    },
};
var service = new PaymentIntentService();
var paymentIntent = service.Create(options);
```

#### Stripe CLI

```bash
stripe payment_intents create \
  --stripe-version="2025-10-29.clover" \
  --amount=1099 \
  --currency=usd \-d "automatic_payment_methods[enabled]"=true
```

> Each payment method needs to support the currency passed in the PaymentIntent and your business needs to be based in one of the countries each payment method supports. See the [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md) page for more details about what’s supported.

## Update the submit handler [Client-side]

Instead of using individual confirm methods like `stripe.confirmCardPayment` or `stripe.confirmP24Payment`, use [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to collect payment information and submit it to Stripe.

To confirm the PaymentIntent, make the following updates to your submit handler:

- Call `await elements.submit()` to trigger form validation and collect any data required for [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-wallets).
- Optional: Move PaymentIntent creation to the submit handler. This way you only create the PaymentIntent when you’re sure of the final amount.
- Pass the `elements` instance you used to create the Payment Element and the `clientSecret` from the PaymentIntent as parameters to `stripe.confirmPayment`.

When called, `stripe.confirmPayment` attempts to complete any [required actions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md), such as authenticating your customers by displaying a 3DS dialog or redirecting them to a bank authorization page. When confirmation is complete, users are directed to the `return_url` you configured, which normally corresponds to a page on your website that [provides the status of the payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md#web-post-payment).

If you want to keep the same checkout flow for card payments and only redirect for redirect-based payment methods, you can set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`.

The following code example replaces `stripe.confirmCardPayment` with `stripe.confirmPayment`:

### Before

```javascript
// Create the PaymentIntent and obtain clientSecret
const res = await fetch("/create-intent", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
});

const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await res.json();

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (!stripe) {
    // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
    // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
    return;
  }

  setLoading(true);


  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```

### After

```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (!stripe) {
    // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
    // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
    return;
  }

  setLoading(true);
// Trigger form validation and wallet collection
  const {error: submitError} = await elements.submit();
  if (submitError) {
    handleError(submitError);
    return;
  }
// Create the PaymentIntent and obtain clientSecret
  const res = await fetch("/create-intent", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  });

  const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await res.json();
// Use the clientSecret and Elements instance to confirm the setup
  const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    elements,
    clientSecret,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete',
    },
    // Uncomment below if you only want redirect for redirect-based payments
    // redirect: "if_required",
  });

  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```

## Handle post-payment events [Server-side]

Stripe sends a [payment_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart.md) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

Listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.

In addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:

# SetupIntent migration

> This is a SetupIntent migration for when integration-path is future. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration?integration-path=future.

If your existing integration uses the [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents.md) API for future payments, follow the steps below to use the Payment Element.

## Enable payment methods

> This integration path doesn’t support BLIK or pre-authorized debits that use the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS).

View your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a *SetupIntent* (The Setup Intents API lets you build dynamic flows for collecting payment method details for future payments. It tracks the lifecycle of a payment setup flow and can trigger additional authentication steps if required by law or by the payment method).

By default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.

## Update Elements instance [Client-side]

Next, update your client-side code to pass the `mode` and `currency` when you create the Elements instance. For use with a SetupIntent, set the `mode` to `'setup'` and the `currency` to what you’ll charge your customer in the future.

#### Javascript

### Before

```javascript
const stripe =
    Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const elements = stripe.elements();
```

### After

```javascript
const stripe =
    Stripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'setup',
  currency: 'usd',
};
const elements = stripe.elements(options);
```

#### React

### Before

```jsx
 const stripePromise =
     loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');

 function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
};
```

### After

```jsx
const stripePromise =
    loadStripe('<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>');
const options = {
  mode: 'setup',
  currency: 'usd',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
};
```

## Optional: Additional Elements options [Client-side]

The [Elements object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_without_intent) accepts additional options that influence payment collection. Based on the options provided, the Payment Element displays available payment methods from those you’ve enabled. Learn more about [payment method support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md).

## Add the Payment Element [Client-side]

If you’re using [React Stripe.js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js), update to the latest package to use the Payment Element.

You can now replace the Card Element and individual payment methods Elements with the Payment Element. The Payment Element automatically adjusts to collect input fields based on the payment method and country (for example, full billing address collection for SEPA Direct Debit) so you don’t have to maintain customized input fields anymore.

The following example replaces `CardElement` with `PaymentElement`:

#### JavaScript

```html
<form id="payment-form"><div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Mount the Payment Element here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const paymentElement = elements.create("payment");
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

#### React

```jsx
 return (
   <div className="CheckoutForm"><PaymentElement />
    <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  </div>
);
```

If your payment flow already always collects details like the customer’s name or email address, you can prevent the Payment Element from collecting this information by passing the [fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-fields) option when creating the Payment Element. If you disable the collection of a certain field, you must pass that same data back with [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup).

## Update your SetupIntent creation call [Server-side]

Because the Payment Element allows you to accept multiple payment methods, we recommend using `automatic_payment_methods`. When you enable it, Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of  payment methods available for your customers. We prioritize payment methods that increase conversion and are most relevant to the currency and location of the customer.

Add the `automatic_payment_methods` attribute to the endpoint on your server that creates the SetupIntent.

Any of the additional elements options passed when creating the Elements group in the earlier step should also be passed when creating the SetupIntent.

#### curl

```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \
  -u <<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>: \
  -H "Stripe-Version: 2025-10-29.clover" \
  -d "customer"="{{CUSTOMER_ID}}" \-d "automatic_payment_methods[enabled]"=true
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
intent = Stripe::SetupIntent.create({
  customer: customer['id'],# In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
})
```

#### Python

```python
intent = stripe.SetupIntent.create(
  customer=customer['id'],# In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods={
    'enabled': True,
  },
)
```

#### PHP

```php
$intent = \Stripe\SetupIntent::create([
  'customer' => $customer->id,// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  'automatic_payment_methods' => [
    'enabled' => true,
  ],
]);
```

#### Node.js

```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.setupIntents.create({
  customer: customer.id,// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### Stripe CLI

```bash
stripe setup_intents create \
  --stripe-version="2025-10-29.clover" \
  --customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \-d "automatic_payment_methods[enabled]"=true
```

> You can’t save some payment methods for future payments. For more information, see [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md).

## Update the submit handler [Client-side]

Instead of using individual confirm methods like `stripe.confirmCardSetup` or `stripe.confirmP24Setup`, use [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup) to collect payment information and submit it to Stripe.

To confirm the SetupIntent, make the following updates to your submit handler:

- Call `await elements.submit()` to trigger form validation and collect any data required for [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-wallets).
- Optional: Move SetupIntent creation to the submit handler. This way you only create the SetupIntent when the user is ready to submit their payment method details.
- Pass the `elements` instance you used to create the Payment Element and the `clientSecret` from the SetupIntent as parameters to `stripe.confirmSetup`.

When called, `stripe.confirmSetup` attempts to complete any [required actions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md), such as authenticating your customers by displaying a 3DS dialog or redirecting them to a bank authorization page. When confirmation is complete, users are directed to the `return_url` you configured, which normally corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the `SetupIntent`.

If you want to keep the same flow for saving card payment details and only redirect for redirect-based payment methods, set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup#confirm_setup_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`.

The following code examples replaces `stripe.confirmCardSetup` with `stripe.confirmSetup`:

### Before

```javascript
// Create the SetupIntent and obtain clientSecret
const res = await fetch("/create-intent", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
});

const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await res.json();

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (!stripe) {
    // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
    // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
    return;
  }

  setLoading(true);


  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```

### After

```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  if (!stripe) {
    // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
    // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
    return;
  }

  setLoading(true);
// Trigger form validation and wallet collection
  const {error: submitError} = await elements.submit();
  if (submitError) {
    handleError(submitError);
    return;
  }
// Create the SetupIntent and obtain clientSecret
  const res = await fetch("/create-intent", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  });

  const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await res.json();
// Use the clientSecret and Elements instance to confirm the setup
  const {error} = await stripe.confirmSetup({
    elements,
    clientSecret,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete',
    },
    // Uncomment below if you only want redirect for redirect-based payments
    // redirect: "if_required",
  });

  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```

### Test charging a saved SEPA Debit PaymentMethod

Confirming the  SetupIntent  using iDEAL, Bancontact, or Sofort, generates a [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit.md) *PaymentMethod* (PaymentMethods represent your customer's payment instruments, used with the Payment Intents or Setup Intents APIs). SEPA Direct Debit is a [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) payment method that transitions to an intermediate `processing` state before transitioning several days later to a `succeeded` or `requires_payment_method` state.

#### Email

Set `payment_method.billing_details.email` to one of the following values to test the PaymentIntent status transitions. You can include your own custom text at the beginning of the email address followed by an underscore. For example, `test_1_generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com` results in a SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod that always fails when used with a PaymentIntent.

| Email Address                                          | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceed@example.com`         | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`.                                            |
| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDelayed@example.com`  | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded` after at least three minutes.               |
| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com`            | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method`.                              |
| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFailDelayed@example.com`     | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method` after at least three minutes. |
| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDisputed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`, but a dispute is created immediately.      |

#### PaymentMethod

Use these PaymentMethods to test that the PaymentIntent status transitions. These tokens are useful for automated testing to immediately attach the PaymentMethod to the SetupIntent on the server.
