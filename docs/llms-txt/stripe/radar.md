Use Stripe Radar to protect your business against fraud.

[Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) provides real-time fraud protection and requires no additional development time. [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) adds customization capabilities and deeper insights and trend analysis for your business. [Radar for Platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-for-platforms.md), currently in public preview, provides protection against both transaction and account risk.

Radar evaluates transactions in real-time, using AI algorithms to assess the risk of fraud. All Radar pricing tiers [charge a fee](https://stripe.com/radar/pricing) for each transaction they evaluate, including the first transaction and all subsequent transactions for recurring payments. The exception is Stripe Billing users, who are only billed for the first transaction—subsequent transactions aren’t billed. Radar for Platforms also charges a connected account fee.

Radar screens all payment attempts types (such as successful, declined, blocked, and flagged for review) and the following payment method types:

- [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards.md)
- [Wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets.md)  (when the underlying payment method is a card)
- [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit.md)
- [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit.md)
- [Other popular payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/local-payment-methods.md) (Preview)

Radar doesn’t screen SetupIntents for non-card payment methods. Learn more about Radar’s [features](https://docs.stripe.com/radar.md#features).

## Design your integration with your fraud strategy

[Set up your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/optimize-fraud-signals.md): Make sure your payment integration collects the transaction data needed for Stripe to assess fraud risk.

[Radar Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-session.md): Use Radar Session to apply Radar protection to your non-Stripe tokenized payments.

[Try out rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/testing.md): Simulate fraudulent payments in a *sandbox* (A sandbox is an isolated test environment that allows you to test Stripe functionality in your account without affecting your live integration. Use sandboxes to safely experiment with new features and changes) or perform what-if analyses for new rules.
