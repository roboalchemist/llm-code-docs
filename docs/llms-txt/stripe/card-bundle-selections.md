# Customize card bundle

Make your card bundle selections.

During the design phase, Stripe provides a design form where you can choose from the following standard options. Additionally, there are many innovative products in the physical cards market, such as LED-powered cards that light up in point-of-sale terminals, wooden cards, and recycled ocean plastic cards. These options are outside our standard offerings, but we can arrange expert-driven sessions to help you learn more about them.

## Choose card body

The following table displays the available card body options. We can also ship you generic samples of these materials. “Core color options” refers to the color on the edge of the card.

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Knockout                   | Adds distinction in areas where you can expose the core color of the card. For example, if you have a metal card, you can showcase the metal material on your brand logo by choosing to expose it in that specific area.                                                                                                                                  | ✓ Supported | ✓ Supported     | ✓ Supported       | - Not supported  |
| Post laminate finish (PLF) | Highlights certain areas or logos on the card by adding a different texture on top. For example, you can choose to have a glossy finish on the card and then apply a matte PLF on your logo, or vice versa. This creates an elevated texture on the logo compared to the rest of the card, providing a visual and tactile distinction.                    | ✓ Supported | ✓ Supported     | ✓ Supported       | - Not supported  |
| Metallic foil              | Applies a thin layer of metallic foil onto the surface of the card, creating a reflective and shiny appearance. You can use this technique to partially highlight or mask the metalized effect on the face of the card by using translucent or opaque inks. The combination of the foil and the inks creates a striking visual effect on the card design. | ✓ Supported | ✓ Supported     | ✓ Supported       | - Not supported  |
| Metallic ink               | Prints silver or gold ink over the card and then your design is printed on top to create a metallic appearance. Metallic ink is also commonly used for logos or product identifiers, adding a touch of elegance and shine to the card design.                                                                                                             | ✓ Supported | ✓ Supported     | ✓ Supported       | ✓ Supported      |
| Pearlescent ink            | Provides a metallic sheen with “sparkles” to either specific parts or the entire card. It can give a shiny quality to almost any image or design element when overprinted. Pearlescent ink adds a subtle shimmer and depth, enhancing the overall visual appeal of the card design.                                                                       | ✓ Supported | ✓ Supported     | ✓ Supported       | ✓ Supported      |
| Accessibility notch        | Assists individuals with visual impairments. This notch is designed to provide tactile feedback and aid in the identification and orientation of the card.                                                                                                                                                                                                | ✓ Supported | - Not supported | - Not supported   | - Not supported  |
