# Wallets

Learn about wallet payments with Stripe.

Wallets let your customers pay online or in person, using either of the following:

- A saved payment credential (a tokenized card or bank account stored in the wallet).
- A stored wallet balance (funds held in an account with the wallet provider).

At checkout, the wallet typically authenticates your customer and passes payment details or a payment token to you or your payment processor. You don’t have to directly handle your customer’s sensitive data.

## Considerations 

Consider the following before you enable a wallet:

- **Coverage varies by country and device:** Some wallets are tied to specific platforms or operating systems, or are only popular in certain regions.

- **Checkout and post-purchase flows can differ:** The timing and behavior of refunds, disputes, and chargebacks can be different from those of card payments. Also, wallets often don’t offer the same level of customer support as cards.

- **In person versus online:** Some wallets are primarily used for online payments, while others are primarily used for in-person payments (through NFC or QR codes). Make sure you enable the right type for your use case.

Wallets might not fit your business if you sell *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis). Some wallets don’t support recurring payments, and others have limited support (for example, requiring customer re-authentication, limiting merchant-initiated charges, or restricting retries). If subscriptions are core to your business, confirm that the wallet supports:

- Token or billing agreement creation for future charges.
- Merchant-initiated recurring transactions (where applicable).
- Updating and continuity when the underlying card changes.
- Your required retry and dunning behavior.

## Payment flow 

Customers *confirm* (Confirming an intent indicates that the customer intends to use the current or provided payment method. Upon confirmation, the intent attempts to initiate the portions of the flow that have real-world side effects) the transaction by authenticating their wallet credentials at checkout. If using mobile, they can authenticate with fingerprint or face recognition, their mobile passcode, or by logging into their wallet app. On the web, they can also scan a QR code with their mobile phone to complete the transaction.

1 Cards and bank debit methods including SEPA debit, AU BECS direct debit, and ACSS debit support both `on_session` and `off_session` with [setup future usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage). All other payment method types either don’t support `setup_future_usage` or only support `off_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm.md#confirm_payment_intent-return_url) to indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the payment.
