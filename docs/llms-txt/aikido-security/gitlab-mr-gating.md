# GitLab MR Gating

Aikido GitLab MR gating runs security checks on merge requests (MRs). It focuses on **newly introduced** issues in the MR.

Use it to catch risky changes before they land on your main branch. You decide what should fail the gate.

### How it works

* You authorize Aikido to access your GitLab group.
* You pick repositories and scan types in Aikido.
* On each MR update, Aikido scans the MR diff.
* Aikido publishes results back to GitLab as pipeline checks and comments.
* You can make failed checks block merging in GitLab.

### Pick the right guide

Start with the page that matches your GitLab plan. Then configure repositories in the dashboard.

* **GitLab Free**
  * Use a dedicated GitLab user plus a Personal Access Token (PAT).
  * Follow: [GitLab Free: MR Scans Setup](https://help.aikido.dev/pr-and-release-gating/gitlab-mr-gating/gitlab-free-mr-scans-setup).
* **GitLab Premium, Ultimate, or GitLab Server (self-managed)**
  * Use a **Service Account** plus an Access Token.
  * Follow: [GitLab Premium, Ultimate & Server: MR Scans Setup](https://help.aikido.dev/pr-and-release-gating/gitlab-mr-gating/gitlab-server-ci-mr-gating-via-aikido-dashboard-with-a-service-account-token).

### What to expect after setup

* Aikido runs MR scans when commits are pushed to the MR branch.
* Results show up in the MR under **Pipelines**.
* If you enable **Pipelines must succeed**, a failing scan can block the merge.

Start with one repository first. Confirm checks run and comments appear as desired. Then roll out to more repos.
