# Handling Captcha challenges

Many applications have implemented anti-bot protection mechanism such as Captcha. Depending on the used Captcha, the agents can automatically solve these.&#x20;

## Aikido can solve these catchas by itself

Below is a list of challenge types that the agents can solve autonomously and no additional actions are required.&#x20;

|                                       |
| ------------------------------------- |
| ReCaptcha v2 - no ip-check configured |
| ReCaptcha v3 - no ip-check configured |
| reCAPTCHA v2 Enterprise               |
| reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise               |
| Cloudflare Turnstile                  |
| Geetest v3 / v4                       |
| ImageToText                           |

## Captchas where Aikido needs some help from you

The following Captchas our agents cannot solve automatically. For the pentest to proceed, the following additional actions are required.&#x20;

## Clarification on ReCaptcha ip-check support&#x20;

When reCAPTCHA is configured without IP checks, validation does not depend on the client’s IP address. Google instead evaluates non-IP signals (such as browser behavior and execution context), so a token can still be validated even if it is submitted from a different IP.

When IP checks are enabled, reCAPTCHA binds the challenge/token to the originating IP address and expects the same IP during verification. Our agents use multiple IPs to solve checks and bypass bot protections, so validation can fail under IP enforcement.

For this reason, additional IP allowlisting is required when reCAPTCHA IP checks are enabled.
