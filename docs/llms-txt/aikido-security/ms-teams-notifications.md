## Connecting Aikido to Microsoft Teams <a href="#connecting-aikido-to-ms-teams" id="connecting-aikido-to-ms-teams"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that only **Aikido admin users** can link a new Microsoft Team to your Aikido workspace.

If you are using the **OLD version** of the Microsoft Teams Integration, **please delete all alerts** before setting up the new version. You can setup the new version by removing the integration and then following the steps below.\
\
App requires application-level permissions; access is limited to the Microsoft it's installed in, not the whole org.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to connect Aikido to Microsoft Teams:

#### Step 0. Uninstall the MS Teams Integration v1  <a href="#id-1-click-add-integration" id="id-1-click-add-integration"></a>

In case you are still running the old MS Teams integration, first **uninstall** this one from the Aikido UI!

#### Step 1. Install the Aikido app in Microsoft Teams <a href="#id-1-click-add-integration" id="id-1-click-add-integration"></a>

* Open the [Aikido app](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/c2baec07-db8a-49de-b066-c0ddc19cc9c0?source=store-copy-link) in the Microsoft Teams app store and click "Add to a Team". &#x20;
* Select a channel for initial installation. You can configure alerts for all public channels of the selected Team later.

This is not easily possible due to restrictions imposed by Microsoft. We recommend creating a private Team with a public channel instead. But we describe a [workaround on this page](https://help.aikido.dev/getting-started/chat-and-alerts/send-alerts-to-private-microsoft-teams-channels).

Please ensure that no moderation settings are configured for the selected channel that prevent bots from sending messages. Uninstall the app and try the process again using a different channel. If this does not help, please contact the Aikido support team.
