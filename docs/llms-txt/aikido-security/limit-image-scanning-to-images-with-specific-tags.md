# Limit Image Scanning to Images with Specific Tags

By default, Aikido will always scan **the last image that was uploaded** in your docker repository.

In some cases it might be interesting to make sure only an image tagged with a specific tag (such as 'production-') is scanned.

Aikido allows you to set a tag filter per image. Go to [container settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/container-image-registry)and click the triple dots action menu to enable this

![Docker repo management interface with options to add, scan, or edit tag filters.](https://3149773201-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FyKbzcQGrx7UtrG0nPZZ7%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-2c8429e78f255cd5d870c1f26ebd92eff2f9e1df%2Flimit-image-scanning-to-images-with-specific-tags_ff0ba934-e45e-48d7-97fb-6ee210259479.png?alt=media)

It's possible to scan only images that start with specific words such as 'production-12345678'. To do this, enter the tag production-\* using \* as a wildcard.
