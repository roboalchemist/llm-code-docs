# Getting Started

### Overview

`comfy-cli` is a [command line tool](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli) that makes it easier to install and manage Comfy.

### Install CLI

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pip theme={null}
  pip install comfy-cli
  ```

  ```bash homebrew theme={null}
  brew tap Comfy-Org/comfy-cli
  brew install comfy-org/comfy-cli/comfy-cli
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To get shell completion hints:

```bash  theme={null}
comfy --install-completion
```

### Install ComfyUI

Create a virtual environment with any Python version greater than 3.9.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash conda theme={null}

  conda activate comfy-env
  ```
