  description: >
    <Warning>

    **Experimental API:** This API is experimental and subject to change. 

    Endpoints, request/response formats, and behavior may be modified without
    notice.

    </Warning>


    API for Comfy Cloud - Run ComfyUI workflows on cloud infrastructure.


    This API allows you to interact with Comfy Cloud programmatically,
    including:

    - Submitting and managing workflows

    - Uploading and downloading files

    - Monitoring job status and progress


    ## Cloud vs OSS ComfyUI Compatibility


    Comfy Cloud implements the same API interfaces as OSS ComfyUI for maximum
    compatibility,

    but some fields are accepted for compatibility while being handled
    differently or ignored:


    | Field | Endpoints | Cloud Behavior |

    |-------|-----------|----------------|

    | `subfolder` | `/api/view`, `/api/upload/*` | **Ignored** - Cloud uses
    content-addressed storage (hash-based). Returned in responses for
    client-side organization. |

    | `type` (input/output/temp) | `/api/view`, `/api/upload/*` | Partially used
    - All files stored with tag-based organization rather than directory
    structure. |

    | `overwrite` | `/api/upload/*` | **Ignored** - Content-addressed storage
    means identical content always has the same hash. |

    | `number`, `front` | `/api/prompt` | **Ignored** - Cloud uses its own fair
    queue scheduling per user. |

    | `split`, `full_info` | `/api/userdata` | **Ignored** - Cloud always
    returns full file metadata. |


    These fields are retained in the API schema for drop-in compatibility with
    existing ComfyUI clients and workflows.
