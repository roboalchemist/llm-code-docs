    <Tab title="Portable or self deployed users">
      Make sure your ComfyUI is updated.

      * [Download ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/download)
      * [Update Guide](/installation/update_comfyui)

      Workflows in this guide can be found in the [Workflow Templates](/interface/features/template).
      If you can't find them in the template, your ComfyUI may be outdated. (Desktop version's update will delay sometime)

      If nodes are missing when loading a workflow, possible reasons:

      1. You are not using the latest ComfyUI version (Nightly version)
      2. Some nodes failed to import at startup
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Desktop or Cloud users">
      * The Desktop is base on ComfyUI stable release, it will auto-update when there is a new Desktop stable release available.
      * [Cloud](https://cloud.comfy.org) will update after ComfyUI stable release, we will update the Cloud after ComfyUI stable release.

      So, if you find any core node missing in this document, it might be because the new core nodes have not yet been released in the latest stable version. Please wait for the next stable release.
