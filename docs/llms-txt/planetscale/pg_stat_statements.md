# Extensions: pg_stat_statements

> pg_state_statements is a PostgreSQL extension that tracks execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server. It provides insights into query performance, allowing you to identify slow queries and optimize them

## Dashboard Configuration

This extension requires activation via the PlanetScale Dashboard before it can be used. It must be enabled through shared libraries and requires a database restart.

To enable pg\_stat\_statements:

<Steps>
  <Step>From the PlanetScale organization dashboard, select the desired database</Step>
  <Step>Navigate to the **Clusters** page from the menu on the left</Step>
  <Step>Choose the branch whose extensions you'd like to configure in the "**Branch**" dropdown</Step>
  <Step>Select the **Extensions** tab</Step>
  <Step>Enable pg\_stat\_statements and configure its parameters</Step>
  <Step>Click **Queue extension changes** to apply the configuration</Step>
  <Step>Once you're ready to apply the changes, click "**Apply changes**"</Step>
</Steps>

### pg\_stat\_statements.track

* **Type**: Select
* **Options**: top, all
* **Default**: `top`
* **Description**: Which statements to track. 'top' tracks top-level statements only, 'all' tracks all statements including nested ones.

### pg\_stat\_statements.track\_utility

* **Type**: Boolean

## Usage

After enabling the extension through the dashboard, you can install it in your database:

```sql  theme={null}
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

Then you can query the statistics view:

```sql  theme={null}
-- View the most time-consuming queries
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_exec_time,
    mean_exec_time,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
