# PlanetScale Support

> PlanetScale’s team has a combined 600 years of experience running databases at scale.

Our support goes well beyond what you might have experienced with other providers.
We partner closely with our customers whether they are launching a AAA game or planning brand new architecture.
Even with the Standard tier, you can expect timely, and thorough responses from engineers.
We also have an active [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/pDUGAAFEJx) where you can chat with staff as well as a [GitHub Discussion board](https://github.com/planetscale/discussion/discussions).
If you’re looking into Vitess or already running it on your own, the security of knowing you have a direct line to the core maintainers and co-creators of Vitess is invaluable.
