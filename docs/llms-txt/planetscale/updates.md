# Cluster updates

> PlanetScale occasionally releases software updates for your Postgres cluster.

## How to update your cluster

To check if your cluster has any available updates, go to the **Clusters** page in your PlanetScale dashboard and look for the "Cluster update available" indicator.

<Note>
  If you make any other cluster changes that require a cluster restart, such as enabling an extension, we will roll out the latest updates during that cluster restart.
</Note>

To update your cluster:

<Steps>
  <Step>Click the **"Queue update"** button on your Clusters page. This will queue the updates without immediately starting the update process.</Step>
  <Step>You should see "This cluster has queued changes". You can batch additional cluster changes before applying them if needed.</Step>
  <Step>Once you're ready, click **"Apply changes"**.</Step>
  <Step>In the confirmation modal, review the warning that applying changes will close any open connections. Make sure your application is equipped to handle closed connections, then click **"Apply changes"** to confirm.</Step>
  <Step>You can view the status of your changes under the **Changes** tab.</Step>
</Steps>
