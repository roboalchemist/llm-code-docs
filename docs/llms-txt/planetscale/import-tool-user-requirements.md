# Import user permissions

> When importing a database using our [Import tool](/docs/vitess/imports/database-imports), you will need to connect to your existing database with a user that has the proper permissions to set up the necessary configurations to start importing data.

Below is the minimum set of permissions needed and what each allows the user to do:

| Scope  | Databases                                               | Grant                | Description                                                                  |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global | n/a                                                     | `PROCESS`            | Enable the user to see all processes with SHOW PROCESSLIST.                  |

| Global | n/a                                                     | `REPLICATION CLIENT` | Enable the user to ask where source or replica servers are.                  |
| Global | n/a                                                     | `RELOAD`             | Enable use of FLUSH operations.                                              |

| Table  | `<DATABASE_NAME>`                                       | `SHOW VIEW`          | Enable use of SHOW VIEW.                                                     |

<Note>
  The descriptions in the table above were taken from the MySQL docs. For a full list of all possible grants and their
  impact, please refer to the [GRANT Statement page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html) of the MySQL
  docs, and locate the section titled **Privileges Supported by MySQL**.

## Script to create user

This MySQL script can be used to create a user with the necessary permissions inside of your database. You will need appropriate database permissions to run the script. The username will be `migration_user`. Make sure to update the following variables:

* `<SUPER_STRONG_PASSWORD>` — The password for the `migration_user` account.
* `<DATABASE_NAME>` — The name of the database you will import into PlanetScale.

```sql  theme={null}
CREATE USER 'migration_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<SUPER_STRONG_PASSWORD>';
GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, RELOAD ON *.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SHOW VIEW, LOCK TABLES ON `<DATABASE_NAME>`.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON `ps\_import\_%`.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON `_vt`.* TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE mysql.rds_show_configuration TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.func TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.tables_priv TO 'migration_user'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'migration_user'@'%';
```
