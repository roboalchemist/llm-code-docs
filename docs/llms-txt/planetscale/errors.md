# PlanetScale database error reference

This documentation covers some commonly encountered errors and approaches for addressing them.

<Note>
  If you are facing issues or have questions that were not answered in the documentation, the best course of action is to [open a support ticket](https://planetscale.com/contact).

  Additionally, you can find some broader limitations in the [PlanetScale system limits documentation](/docs/vitess/troubleshooting/planetscale-system-limits).

## MySQL and Vitess errors

All PlanetScale databases are powered by Vitess and MySQL.

Many errors you encounter will contain a substring of the form `SQL Error [XXXX]` where `XXXX` is some integer number.
Often, these are errors that are passed along back to the client from MySQL.
There are hundreds of MySQL error codes documented on the [MySQL error codes page](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).

For example, say you encounter this error:

```
Error synchronizing data with database Reason:
SQL Error [1364] [HY000]:
target: unigate.-.primary:
vttablet: rpc
error: code = Unknown desc = (errno 1364) (sqlstate HY000) (CallerID: unsecure_grpc_client):
Sql: ...
BindVars: {}
```

The second line says `SQL Error [1364]`, which corresponds to the [ER\_NO\_DEFAULT\_FOR\_FIELD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_no_default_for_field) error in MySQL.
Knowing this, you can make the appropriate changes to your query or schema to mitigate the error.
You can also search the MySQL docs and other online sources using the error code, as there is a long history of MySQL questions and answers online.

One specific code you may come across is `SQL Error [1105]`, which represents an [unknown error](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html#error_er_unknown_error) in MySQL.
On PlanetScale, it's likely that such an error is actually coming from Vitess, which also has an [error documentation page](https://vitess.io/docs/api/reference/errors/query-serving/).
Note that a number of older Vitess errors used the `1105` code, but there are many other errors documented there as well.
We recommend you reference this for Vitess-specific errors.

Below, we document more common errors from our customers, and provide suggestions for how to address them.

One option is to make changes to your application code that reduce the number of long-running transactions.

This can allow long-running transactions to execute quicker, and you also may get a higher concurrent transaction limit.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If this was caused by an OOM, you should see if there are changes you can make to your queries to reduce memory pressure on your database. This could mean consolidating queries or building indexes to reduce the number of pages needing to be brought into memory during query execution. If this is not possible, you will likely need to [upgrade](/docs/vitess/cluster-configuration#adjust-your-cluster-size) to a larger cluster size. |

## PlanetScale-specific errors

You also may encounter error messages in the PlanetScale UI or on specific PlanetScale features such as [safe migrations](/docs/vitess/schema-changes/safe-migrations) or [workflows](/docs/vitess/scaling/workflows).
Here, we document a selection of those errors you may run into.
