# Data requests

## End-user data requests

Some laws require you and your company to allow your end-users to control their personal data. PlanetScale allows you to access, export, or delete their personal data.

Reach out to [support@planetscale.com](/docs/vitess/managed/) for additional support with accessing, exporting, or deleting personal data.

## Data portability

PlanetScale does not offer the migration of specific metadata between regions. PlanetScale does support migrating a database between regions for PlanetScale Managed.

## Data deletion

Users can request to have their personal data removed by contacting [support@planetscale.com](/docs/vitess/managed/).

## Need help?

Get help from [the PlanetScale Support team](https://support.planetscale.com/), or join our [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/planetscale/discussion/discussions) to see how others are using PlanetScale.
