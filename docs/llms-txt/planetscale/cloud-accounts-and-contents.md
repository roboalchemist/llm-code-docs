# Cloud accounts and contents

## Cloud accounts

PlanetScale is not responsible for the general configuration of services shared across the cloud organization in which the AWS Organizations member account or GCP project is provisioned. The customer is solely responsible for managing account access outside that granted to PlanetScale.

## Content restrictions

The data stored in PlanetScale Managed databases is contained entirely in the customer's AWS Organizations member account or GCP project.

Customers are responsible for all content that is stored in the databases they have created.
