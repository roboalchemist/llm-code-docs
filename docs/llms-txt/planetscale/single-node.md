# Single node

> Single node Postgres databases come with a single primary and no replicas, and are a great cost-effective option for development or production workloads that do not require high availability.

<Note>
  Single node is only available for network-attached storage databases. You cannot create a single node
  [Metal](/docs/metal) database.
</Note>

Single node databases are available on all network-attached storage cluster sizes and begin at \$5/month. For full single node pricing, see the [pricing](https://planetscale.com/pricing) page.

To create a single node database, just select "**Single node**" and your cluster size during the database creation process.

## Resizing your single node database

You can upsize or downsize your single node Postgres database by going to "**Clusters**", selecting the cluster size from the dropdown, and clicking "**Queue instance changes**", "**Apply changes**". During the resize, we will surge a new replica on the selected size, sync your data, promote the replica to primary, and decommission the old node.

## Switch from single node to HA

To upgrade your single node database to an HA cluster, go to the Clusters page, select the "HA Primary + Multi-replica" option, choose your cluster size from the dropdown (network-attached storage or [Metal](/docs/metal)), click "Queue instance changes", and click "Apply changes".

During this process, 2 additional replicas across 3 Availability Zones are added to your database cluster. If you selected a Metal cluster, your data is copied over to the new instances with locally-attached storage. It follows the process described in the [Upgrading to a Metal database documentation](/docs/metal/create-a-metal-database#upgrading-an-existing-database-to-metal).

## Switch from HA to single node

To switch an HA database with 1 primary and 2+ replicas to single node, go to your Clusters page, select "Single node", choose a cluster size, click "Queue instance changes", and click "Apply changes".

This will remove any existing replicas you have and leave you with a single non-HA primary.
