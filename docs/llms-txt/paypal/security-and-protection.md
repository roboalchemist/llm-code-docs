## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to activate wallet monitoring or early fraud alerts?

No. Any eligible debit or credit card you add to PayPal will automatically receive early fraud monitoring and real-time alerts about unusual activity we’ve detected or blocked. Use the [PayPal app](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet) and enable push notifications to get real-time app notifications and review alert details right away. [Learn more about early fraud alerts](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-paypals-wallet-monitoring-feature-help1044).

### What exactly is a passkey?

Passkeys are a new secure login standard, which allows you to securely log in to PayPal without entering a password. They allow you to log in to PayPal using the same biometrics or device password you use to unlock your device. [Learn more about passkeys](https://www.paypal.com/cshelp/article/what-is-a-passkey-and-how-do-i-use-it-to-log-in-to-my-paypal-account-help997).

### How long do I have to dispute a transaction?

To take advantage of Purchase Protection, we require that PayPal accounts be kept in good standing and ask that a dispute be filed within 180 days of your purchase or payment. [Learn more about Purchase Protection](https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/buyer-purchase-protection).
