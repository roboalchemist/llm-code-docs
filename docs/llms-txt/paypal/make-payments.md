### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What’s required to use payouts from PayPal?

You’ll need a PayPal Business account that’s linked to a bank. Then, you’ll need to request access to PayPal Payouts. [Request access now](https://www.paypal.com/unifiedonboarding/entry?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US&products=PAYOUTS).

Our enterprise-scale solution, Enterprise Payouts, offers more customization and requires developer support. [Learn more about integrating Enterprise Payouts](https://www.paypal.com/us/enterprise/global-payouts).

#### How much money can I send?

There’s no limit on the total amount of the payout. The maximum individual payment to an existing PayPal or Venmo account holder is $60,000 USD or its equivalent in local currency (the limit is $20,000 USD for new PayPal or Venmo account holders). Payouts are funded using your PayPal balance, so be sure to add enough to cover your payout total, including fees.

#### Which countries can receive payouts?

PayPal Payouts is supported in over 95 countries in over 23 currencies. Enterprise Payouts supports 200+ markets and 50+ currencies.

Note that currency restrictions do not allow conversion of Argentine Pesos, Brazilian Real, or Malaysian Ringgit. PayPal currency conversion rates apply should the sender or the recipient choose to convert the payments.
