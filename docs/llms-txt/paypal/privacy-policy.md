## Definitions

“Personal Data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.

“PayPal Giving Fund” or “we” in this statement means PayPal Giving Fund, a Donor Advised Fund (“DAF”) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).

“You” in this statement means a Participating Nonprofit, as defined in the [PayPal Giving Fund Nonprofit User Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/paypal-giving-fund/policies/nonprofit-user-agreement), or a donor.

## Understanding Your Privacy Rights and Choices

When it comes to how your Personal Data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices. Some Personal Data is required for our services to function. If you are a participating nonprofit organization, you may review and update your Personal Data that you have provided in your PayPal Giving Fund profile anytime, by visiting [https://www.paypal.com/givingfund/profile](https://www.paypal.com/givingfund/profile).

You can control how Personal Data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.

Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for us to provide our services. We use email, phone, and paper mail, depending on the situation, to communicate with you.

If you are a participating nonprofit organization, you can indicate your preferences at registration or change your communication settings in your profile. You may also contact us.

You also have choices regarding disclosures we make that are considered optional. If you indicate that you would like to allow optional disclosures, third parties may contact you for various reasons. For example, donors and fundraisers have a choice about whether we share their contact information with the charities they support. Participating non-profit organizations, in turn, can choose whether to share their contact information with our partner organizations (websites and online services with which we partner to donate to PayPal Giving Fund), so that they can be contacted about campaigns to benefit them on the partner websites.

## Tracking technologies like cookies

The PayPal Giving Fund website is hosted by PayPal. PayPal or its authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect Personal Data whenever you use our services or visit our website. The information collected with these technologies may help personalize your experience on the website, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.

You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.

Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, our website does not respond to the DNT settings.

If you want to know more about how PayPal-hosted websites use cookies, read its [Cookie Statement](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cookie-full). To learn how to opt out of this kind of tracking technology, visit [About Ads](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN).
