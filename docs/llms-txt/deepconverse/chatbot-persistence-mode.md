# Chatbot Persistence mode

Persistence mode allows you to choose between clearing your chat conversation or saving it upon the page reload. \
\
There are two options in Persistence Mode&#x20;

### Persist

When you select this, upon the page reload, the conversation won't be cleared and will resume from where it was paused.&#x20;

### Clear on Reload

Upon selecting this option, the chat conversation is cleared and once the page is reloaded, it starts the chatbot from the beginning of the flow.

### Clear on Tab Close

Upon selecting this option, the chat conversation is cleared and once the tab is closed, it starts the chatbot from the beginning of the flow.&#x20;

### How to choose the mode?

You can access/enable Persistence mode, by going to settings of the chatbot and selecting "Features" on the left help panel. \
\
Click on the Widget setting and you can see a dropdown for persistence mode which allows you to choose between the options.&#x20;
