# Intent action responses

When the chatbot understands an **intent** it can respond by taking the user through a **Flow**. The flow is a conversational workflow that walks customers through different actions and/or provides information.

When you add a **intent** it is automatically associated with a flow. &#x20;

### Flows <a href="#multi_step_response" id="multi_step_response"></a>

Flows are authored using our Conversation Flow Builder. Flows can be used to author API callouts, forms, questions, conditional rules and make use of prebuilt building blocks (Add On).
