# Multiple Sites

{% hint style="info" %}
Feature available with **Enterprise** plan
{% endhint %}

DeepConverse supports working with multiple site implementations. Such a setup allows you to onboard multiple active sites (help centers, marketing sites, development sites) on the platform.&#x20;

This feature helps organizations create:

* Sandbox environments
* Multi brand environments

The dashboard is always is acting within the context of the site that is currently active. You can see the active site on the top right corner. <br>

Active Site is ***Deepconverse-Stg5***&#x20;

On hovering over the site you can select and switch to another one of the active sites. Once selected that site now becomes active and all objects, analytics that are associated with the selected site are shown.
