# Service Levels and Response Times

We realize the importance of keeping your sales and support infrastructure from disruptions. As such we work hard to maintain the uptime of our platform and services. In an event of a disruption or questions our team will provide support and guidance for all reported issues.&#x20;

**Our SLA excludes the following performance issues**:

* Issues caused by factors outside of our reasonable control
* Issues that resulted from any actions or inaction by you or a third-party
* Changes to your platform without notice of impact to DeepConverse

### Service Levels

DeepConverse offers different levels of service for issues reported to us. The service level represents our timeline and commitment of providing you with a first response. The SLA is for the first response to your issue and will depend on the support plan your organization has. We will strive to provide subsequent responses to you as quickly as possible. \ <br>
