Make sure that the **Start Date** and **End Date** are entered appropriately matching the time when you want the announcement to be displayed on the chatbot(s) along with the description and title for the announcement you create and click on submit which creates an announcement which can be used on the chatbots. \

**Note**: When you click on the pencil Icon to edit the Announcement and if you made changes to any announcement, the toggle bar for Active goes inactive, make sure that you change it back to active after if any changes are made to an existing announcement. \
