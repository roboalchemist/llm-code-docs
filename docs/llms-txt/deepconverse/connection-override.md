# Connection Override

You can override the connection being used in the `Connector` node by adding a property in the chatbot with the connection you would like to override it with.

{% hint style="info" %}
`connector_connection_override__salesforce`
{% endhint %}

Use the above property in the chatbot and put the value as the connection you would like to use in the Salesforce Connector calls.
