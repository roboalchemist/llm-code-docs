# What is the Conversation Flow Builder?

The **Conversation Flow Builder** allows you to build out the conversation as a flow using key conversation elements such as Questions, Answers, Forms, Backend Integrations etc.&#x20;

You can view the flow as how the conversation would move when users either type their messages to questions or provide information requested from them. Each of the nodes in the conversation can be connected to build out how our chatbot should talk to the customers.

### What are nodes in the Flow Builder?&#x20;

Nodes are the building blocks of the conversation. These are specific elements available to ask users questions, present information to them, call external systems and do actions.&#x20;

Each of the nodes can be connected with transitions which represents how the conversation flows when a user takes an action.&#x20;

Nodes have events, properties and some additional properties specific to the type of node being used.
