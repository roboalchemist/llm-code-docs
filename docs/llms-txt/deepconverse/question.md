# Question

The *Question* node allows you to present some information to the customers and ask questions. Answers to the questions can be added as *Transitions* and connected to other nodes in the flow.

The *Answers (Transitions)* are shown to the users after the messages as quick reply buttons. On selection of one of the buttons the user moves ahead in the conversation.
