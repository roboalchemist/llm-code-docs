# Embedding Guides on your website

Guides can be added to your website via two methods. You can either embed a specific Guide directly on a webpage or have the Guide open in a popup on the page. Both these methods are fairly simple and allow flexibility in adding Guides to your websites.

### Embed a Guide on a Webpage

Each Guide has a unique URL that can be used to open it. To embed the Guide in your webpage you can use the URL and add it as an IFrame on the webpage. &#x20;

To get the IFrame code snippet Open the Guide you would like to deploy and click **Advanced** **>** **Deployment**.

### Show Guide in a popup Modal

We also support showing a Guide in a modal popup. This allows use of the majority of the screen a user has with the Guide in focus. We provide a lightweight script that runs an IFrame Guide in a modal window.&#x20;

The modal is shown when any of the HTML elements (such as buttons, links etc.) containing the CSS class **dc-guide-{guide\_id}** are clicked.
