4. After selecting the site click **OK**
5. The flow would be copied to the target site and is now available for use.

#### Notes

* When you copy a guide flow to a site that already has the flow id, *a new version would be created for that guide under the same flow id*
* If the target site does not have the flow id a new flow will be created with the latest version being copied.
