Use Copilot to build visual models in the Canvas with natural language prompts.

[Copilot](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot.md) seamlessly integrates with [Canvas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/canvas.md), a drag-and-drop experience that helps you with build your visual models using natural language prompts. Before you begin, make sure you can access [Canvas](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/use-canvas.md#access-canvas).

2. In the dbt Copilot prompt box, enter your prompt in natural language for Copilot to build the model(s) you want. You can also reference existing models using the `@` symbol.
