## Installing <!-- -->dbt-yellowbrick

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-yellowbrick`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-yellowbrick<!-- -->

For <!-- -->Yellowbrick Data<!-- -->-specific configuration, please refer to [Yellowbrick Data<!-- --> configs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/yellowbrick-configs.md)

## Profile configuration[​](#profile-configuration "Direct link to Profile configuration")

Yellowbrick targets should be set up using the following configuration in your `profiles.yml` file.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
company-name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: yellowbrick
      host: [hostname]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      port: [port]
      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [dbt schema]
      role: [optional, set the role dbt assumes when executing queries]
      sslmode: [optional, set the sslmode used to connect to the database]
      sslrootcert: [optional, set the sslrootcert config value to a new file path to customize the file location that contains root certificates]
  
```

### Configuration notes[​](#configuration-notes "Direct link to Configuration notes")

This adapter is based on the dbt-postgres adapter documented here [Postgres profile setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/postgres-setup.md)

#### role[​](#role "Direct link to role")

The `role` config controls the user role that dbt assumes when opening new connections to the database.

#### sslmode / sslrootcert[​](#sslmode--sslrootcert "Direct link to sslmode / sslrootcert")

The ssl config parameters control how dbt connects to Yellowbrick using SSL. Refer to the [Yellowbrick documentation](https://docs.yellowbrick.com/5.2.27/client_tools/config_ssl_for_clients_intro.html) for details.
