Snowflake column size change

[Snowflake plans to increase](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/un-bundled/bcr-2118) the default column size for string and binary data types in May 2026. `dbt-snowflake` versions below v1.10.6 may fail to build certain incremental models when this change is deployed.

 Assess impact and required actions

If you're using a `dbt-snowflake` version below v1.10.6 or have not yet migrated to a [release track](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks.md) in the dbt platform, your adapter version is incompatible with this change and may fail to build incremental models that meet *both* of the following conditions:

* Contain string columns with collation defined
* Use the `on_schema_change='sync_all_columns'` config

To check whether this change affects your project, run the following [list](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/list.md) command:

```bash
dbt ls -s config.materialized:incremental,config.on_schema_change:sync_all_columns --resource-type model
```

* If the command returns `No nodes selected!`, no action is required.

* If the command returns one or more models (for example, `Found 1000 models, 644 macros`), you may be impacted if those models have string columns that don't specify a width. In that case, upgrade to a version that includes the fix:

  * **dbt Core**: `dbt-snowflake` v1.10.6 or later. For upgrade instructions, see [Upgrade adapters](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/install-dbt.md#upgrade-adapters).
  * **dbt platform**: Any release track (Latest, Compatible, Extended, or Fallback).
  * **dbt Fusion engine**: v2.0.0-preview\.147 or higher.

  This ensures your incremental models can safely handle schema changes while maintaining required collation settings.

### Behavior changes[​](#behavior-changes "Direct link to Behavior changes")

dbt Core v1.7 expands the amount of sources you can configure freshness for. Previously, freshness was limited to sources with a `loaded_at_field`; now, freshness can be generated from warehouse metadata tables when available.

As part of this change, the `loaded_at_field` is no longer required to generate source freshness. If a source has a `freshness:` block, dbt will attempt to calculate freshness for that source:

* If a `loaded_at_field` is provided, dbt will calculate freshness via a select query (previous behavior).
* If a `loaded_at_field` is *not* provided, dbt will calculate freshness via warehouse metadata tables when possible (new behavior).

This is a relatively small behavior change, but worth calling out in case you notice that dbt is calculating freshness for *more* sources than before. To exclude a source from freshness calculations, explicitly set `freshness: null`.

Beginning with v1.7, running [`dbt deps`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/deps.md) creates or updates the `package-lock.yml` file in the *project\_root* where `packages.yml` is recorded. The `package-lock.yml` file contains a record of all packages installed and, if subsequent `dbt deps` runs contain no updated packages in `dependencies.yml` or `packages.yml`, dbt-core installs from `package-lock.yml`.

To retain the behavior prior to v1.7, there are two main options:

1. Use `dbt deps --upgrade` everywhere `dbt deps` was used previously.
2. Add `package-lock.yml` to your `.gitignore` file.

## New and changed features and functionality[​](#new-and-changed-features-and-functionality "Direct link to New and changed features and functionality")

* [`dbt docs generate`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/cmd-docs.md) now supports `--select` to generate [catalog metadata](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/catalog-json.md) for a subset of your project.
* [Source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/source-freshness.md) can now be generated from warehouse metadata tables.

### MetricFlow enhancements[​](#metricflow-enhancements "Direct link to MetricFlow enhancements")

* Automatically create metrics on measures with [`create_metric: true`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models.md).
* Optional [`label`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models.md) in semantic\_models, measures, dimensions, and entities.
* New configurations for semantic models - [enable/disable](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/enabled.md), [group](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/group.md), and [meta](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta.md).
* Support `fill_nulls_with` and `join_to_timespine` for metric nodes.
* `saved_queries` extends governance beyond the semantic objects to their consumption.

### For consumers of dbt artifacts (metadata)[​](#for-consumers-of-dbt-artifacts-metadata "Direct link to For consumers of dbt artifacts (metadata)")

* The [manifest](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json.md) schema version has been updated to v11.

* The [run\_results](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json.md) schema version has been updated to v5.

* There are a few specific changes to the [catalog.json](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/catalog-json.md):

  <!-- -->

  * Added [node attributes](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/run-results-json.md) related to compilation (`compiled`, `compiled_code`, `relation_name`) to the `catalog.json`.
  * The nodes dictionary in the `catalog.json` can now be "partial" if `dbt docs generate` is run with a selector.

### Model governance[​](#model-governance "Direct link to Model governance")

dbt Core v1.5 introduced model governance which we're continuing to refine. v1.7 includes these additional features and functionality:

* **[Breaking change detection](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/versions.md#detecting-breaking-changes) for models with contracts enforced:** When dbt detects a breaking change to a model with an enforced contract during state comparison, it will now raise an error for versioned models and a warning for models that are not versioned.
* **[Set `access` as a config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/access.md):** You can now set a model's `access` within config blocks in the model's SQL file or in the project YAML file (`dbt_project.yml`) for an entire subfolder at once.
* **[Type aliasing for model contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/contract.md):** dbt will use each adapter's built-in type aliasing for user-provided data types—meaning you can now write `string` always, and dbt will translate to `text` on Postgres/Redshift. This is "on" by default, but you can opt-out.
* **[Raise warning for numeric types](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/contract.md):** Because of issues when putting `numeric` in model contracts without considering that default values such as `numeric(38,0)` might round decimals accordingly. dbt will now warn you if it finds a numeric type without specified precision/scale.

### dbt clean[​](#dbt-clean "Direct link to dbt clean")

[dbt clean](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/clean.md) only cleans paths within the current working directory. The `--no-clean-project-files-only` flag will delete all paths specified in the `clean-targets` section of `dbt_project.yml`, even if they're outside the dbt project.

Supported flags:

* `--clean-project-files-only` (default)
* `--no-clean-project-files-only`

### Additional attributes in run\_results.json[​](#additional-attributes-in-run_resultsjson "Direct link to Additional attributes in run_results.json")

The run\_results.json now includes three attributes related to the `applied` state that complement `unique_id`:

* `compiled`: Boolean entry of the node compilation status (`False` after parsing, but `True` after compiling).
* `compiled_code`: Rendered string of the code that was compiled (empty after parsing, but full string after compiling).
* `relation_name`: The fully-qualified name of the object that was (or will be) created/updated within the database.

### Deprecated functionality[​](#deprecated-functionality "Direct link to Deprecated functionality")

The ability for installed packages to override built-in materializations without explicit opt-in from the user is being deprecated.

* Overriding a built-in materialization from an installed package raises a deprecation warning.

* Using a custom materialization from an installed package does not raise a deprecation warning.

* Using a built-in materialization package override from the root project via a wrapping materialization is still supported. For example:

  ```text
  {% materialization view, default %}
  {{ return(my_cool_package.materialization_view_default()) }}
  {% endmaterialization %}
  ```

### Quick hits[​](#quick-hits "Direct link to Quick hits")

With these quick hits, you can now:

* Configure a [`delimiter`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/delimiter.md) for a seed file.
* Use packages with the same git repo and unique subdirectory.
* Access the `date_spine` macro directly from dbt-core (moved over from dbt-utils).
* Syntax for `DBT_ENV_SECRET_` has changed to `DBT_ENV_SECRET` and no longer requires the closing underscore.
