You can access Cost Insights in these different dbt platform areas:

* [Project dashboard](#project-dashboard)
* [Catalog on Model page](#model-performance-in-catalog)
* [Job details page](#job-details)

Each view provides different levels of detail to help you understand your warehouse spending and optimization impact. Cost and cost reduction estimates are based on historical runs and reflect actual usage, *not* forecasts of future costs.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

<!-- -->

To view cost data, ensure you have:

* A dbt account with dbt Fusion engine enabled. Contact your account manager to enable Fusion for your account.
* One of the roles listed in [Assign required permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/set-up-cost-insights.md#assign-required-permissions).
* A supported data warehouse: Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks.

For more information, see [Set up Cost Insights](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/set-up-cost-insights.md).

<!-- -->

note

For accounts already using state-aware orchestration before Cost Insights is enabled, at least one full model build must occur within the last 10 days to establish a baseline for cost reduction calculations. If you don't see cost reduction data, try running a full build to establish the baseline.

## Project dashboard[​](#project-dashboard "Direct link to Project dashboard")

The Cost Insights section in your project dashboard gives you a high-level view of warehouse costs and the impact of optimization through state-aware orchestration.

### Access[​](#access "Direct link to Access")

To go to your project dashboard, select your project in the main menu and click **Dashboard**.

### Key metrics[​](#key-metrics "Direct link to Key metrics")

The project dashboard displays the following metrics that summarize the overall cost and optimization impact for your project:

* **Total cost reduction**
* **Total % reduction**
* **Total query run time reduction**
* **Reused assets**

### Filters[​](#filters "Direct link to Filters")

You can customize the cost data you want to view by:

* **Deployment type**: Production or Staging
* **Last**: 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, or 1 year
* **View**: Daily, Weekly, or Monthly

### Visualization tabs[​](#visualization-tabs "Direct link to Visualization tabs")

The project dashboard includes the following tabs that help you analyze cost and optimization trends over time:

* **Cost**: Shows the estimated build cost reduction when using state-aware orchestration.

* **Query run time**: Shows the estimated reduction in build time when using state-aware orchestration.

* **Model builds**: Shows the number of models built versus models reused by state-aware orchestration.

* **Usage**: Shows the estimated warehouse usage consumed and the reduction in usage from state-aware orchestration over the selected timeframe. The **Usage** tab represents generic usage for your warehouse. The specific unit depends on your data warehouse:

  <!-- -->

  * Snowflake: Credits
  * BigQuery: Slot hours or bytes scanned (currently combined into one generic usage number)
  * Databricks: Databricks Units (DBUs)

### Table view[​](#table-view "Direct link to Table view")

Access the table view by clicking **Show table**, which provides detailed optimization data such as models reused, usage reduction, and cost reduction.

<!-- -->

When viewing the table, you can export the data as a CSV file using the **Download** button.

## Model performance in Catalog[​](#model-performance-in-catalog "Direct link to Model performance in Catalog")

<!-- -->

The **Model performance** section in Catalog displays historical trends to help you identify optimization opportunities and understand model resource consumption.

### Access[​](#access-1 "Direct link to Access")

To access model performance data:

1. From the main menu, go to **Catalog**.
2. Click your project from the file tree.
3. Navigate to the model whose cost data you want to view. You can search for it or click **Models** under **Project assets** in the sidebar to view all available models in the project.
4. Go to the the **Performance** tab on the model's details page.

<!-- -->

### Key metrics[​](#key-metrics "Direct link to Key metrics")

The **Model performance** section displays the following metrics that summarize the overall cost and optimization impact for your project:

* **Total cost reduction**
* **Total % reduction**
* **Total query run time deduction**
* **Reused assets** (when state-aware orchestration is enabled)

### Filters[​](#filters "Direct link to Filters")

Use the time period filter to customize the data you want to view: from the last 3 months up to the last 1 week.

For **Cost insights**, **Usage**, and **Query run time** tabs, you can set the view granularity by **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.

### Visualization tabs[​](#visualization-tabs "Direct link to Visualization tabs")

* **Cost insights**: Shows the estimated warehouse costs incurred by this model and cost reduction from state-aware orchestration.

* **Usage**: Shows the estimated warehouse usage consumed by this model over time. The **Usage** tab represents generic usage for your warehouse. The specific unit depends on your data warehouse:

  <!-- -->

  * Snowflake: Credits
  * BigQuery: Slot hours or bytes scanned (currently combined into one generic usage number)
  * Databricks: Databricks Units (DBUs)

* **Query run time**: Shows the estimated query execution time and the reduction in run duration from state-aware orchestration.

* **Build time**: Shows average execution time for the model and how it trends over the selected period.

* **Build count**: Tracks how many times the model was built or reused, including any failures or errors.

* **Test results**: Displays test execution outcomes and pass/fail rates for tests on this model.

* **Consumption queries**: Shows queries running against this model, helping you understand downstream usage patterns.

### Table view[​](#table-view "Direct link to Table view")

For **Cost insights**, **Usage**, and **Query run time** tabs, you can access the table view by clicking **Show table**, which provides detailed optimization data such as models reused, usage reduction, and cost reduction.

<!-- -->

* Each row in the table provides a direct link to the run details if you want to investigate further.

## Job details[​](#job-details "Direct link to Job details")

The **Insights** section on the Job details page provides cost and performance data for individual jobs.
