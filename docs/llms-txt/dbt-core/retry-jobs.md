# Retry your dbt jobs

If your dbt job run completed with a status of **Error**, you can rerun it from start or from the point of failure in dbt.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* You have a [dbt account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup).
* You must be using [dbt version](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud.md) 1.6 or newer.
* dbt can successfully parse the project and generate a [manifest](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json.md)
* The most recent run of the job hasn't completed successfully. The latest status of the run is **Error**.
  <!-- -->
  * The job command that failed in the run must be one that supports the [retry command](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/retry.md).

## Rerun an errored job[​](#rerun-an-errored-job "Direct link to Rerun an errored job")

1. Select **Deploy** from the top navigation bar and choose **Run History.**

2. Choose the job run that has errored.

3. In the **Run Summary** tab on the job’s **Run** page, expand the run step that failed. An <!-- -->❌<!-- --> denotes the failed step.

4. Examine the error message and determine how to fix it. After you have made your changes, save and commit them to your [Git repo](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/git-version-control.md).

5. Return to your job’s **Run** page. In the upper right corner, click **Rerun** and choose **Rerun from start** or **Rerun from failure**.

   If you chose to rerun from the failure point, a **Rerun failed steps** modal opens. The modal lists the run steps that will be invoked: the failed step and any skipped steps. To confirm these run steps, click **Rerun from failure**. The job reruns from the failed command in the previously failed run. A banner at the top of the **Run Summary** tab captures this with the message, "This run resumed execution from last failed step".
