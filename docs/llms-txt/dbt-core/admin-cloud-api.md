# dbt Administrative API [Starter](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

The dbt Administrative API is enabled by default for [Starter, Enterprise, and Enterprise+ plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). It can be used to:

* Download artifacts after a job has completed
* Kick off a job run from an orchestration tool
* Manage your dbt account
* and more

dbt currently supports two versions of the Administrative API: v2 and v3. In general, v3 is the recommended version to use, but we don't yet have all our v2 routes upgraded to v3. We're currently working on this. If you can't find something in our v3 docs, check out the shorter list of v2 endpoints because you might find it there.

Many endpoints of the Administrative API can also be called through the [dbt Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dbt-labs/dbtcloud/latest). The built-in documentation on the Terraform registry contains [a guide on how to get started with the provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dbt-labs/dbtcloud/latest/docs/guides/1_getting_started) as well as [a page showing all the Terraform resources available](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dbt-labs/dbtcloud/latest/docs/guides/99_list_resources) to configure.
