# How do I test and document seeds?

To test and document seeds, use a [properties file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties.md) and nest the configurations under a `seeds:` key

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

seeds/properties.yml

```yml
seeds:
  - name: country_codes
    description: A mapping of two letter country codes to country names
    columns:
      - name: country_code
        data_tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: country_name
        data_tests:
          - unique

```
