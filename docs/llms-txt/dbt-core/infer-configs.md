# Infer configurations

## Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

To connect to Infer from your dbt instance you need to set up a correct profile in your `profiles.yml`.

The format of this should look like this:

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
<profile-name>:
  target: <target-name>
  outputs:
    <target-name>:
      type: infer
      url: "<infer-api-endpoint>"
      username: "<infer-api-username>"
      apikey: "<infer-apikey>"
      data_config:
        [configuration for your underlying data warehouse]  
```
