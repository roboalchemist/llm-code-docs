# Does my operating system have prerequisites?

Your operating system may require pre-installation setup before installing dbt Core with pip. After downloading and installing any dependencies specific to your development environment, you can proceed with the [pip installation of dbt Core](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/install-dbt.md).

### CentOS[​](#centos "Direct link to CentOS")

CentOS requires Python and some other dependencies to successfully install and run dbt Core.
