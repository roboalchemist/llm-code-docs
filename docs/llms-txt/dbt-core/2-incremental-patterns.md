# Incremental patterns for near real-time data

This section covers three core incremental patterns for achieving near real-time data freshness:

1. [Incremental MERGE from append-only tables](#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables)
2. [CDC with Snowflake Streams](#cdc-with-snowflake-streams)
3. [Microbatch for large time-series tables](#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables)

Snowflake-specific pattern

Some patterns on this guide uses Snowflake-specific features. Other warehouses have similar features with different implementations. Refer to the [additional resources](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-handle-real-time-data/3-warehouse-native-features.md#resources-by-warehouse) section for adapter-specific documentation.

## Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables[​](#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables "Direct link to Pattern 1: Incremental MERGE from append-only tables")

This pattern uses the `merge` incremental strategy to upsert (insert + update) new and updated rows into a target table. Most data platforms support the `merge` strategy. See the [supported incremental strategies by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy.md#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for details.

"Append-only tables" refers to a data pattern where source data continuously receives new rows without updates or deletes.

### When to use the merge strategy[​](#when-to-use-the-merge-strategy "Direct link to When to use the merge strategy")

Use this pattern when raw events continuously land into a staging table and you want a near real-time fact table updated every few minutes.

### Example model[​](#example-model "Direct link to Example model")

In this example, assume you have raw events continuously landing into `raw.events` (using Snowpipe, Databricks Auto Loader, Kafka, or a similar ingestion mechanism) and you're looking for a near real‑time fact table `analytics.fct_events` updated every few minutes.

Configure the SQL model with the following settings:

* Use the `incremental` filter to only scan rows newer than the latest timestamp already in the target.
* Use `incremental_strategy='merge'` with `unique_key=event_id` to give you idempotent upserts (inserts + updates).
* Cluster by date using `cluster_by=['event_date']` helps with query pruning during `MERGE` operations (syntax varies by warehouse).
* Run the model every few minutes to achieve a freshness service level agreement (SLA) measured in minutes, depending on ingestion and job scheduling.

The following example uses Snowflake SQL syntax (`::` type casting, `timestamp_ntz`, `cluster_by` config). Make sure you adapt the SQL and clustering syntax for your warehouse.

models/fct\_events.sql

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    incremental_strategy = 'merge',         -- default on Snowflake
    unique_key = 'event_id',
    cluster_by = ['event_date']             -- helps MERGE performance (syntax varies by warehouse)
) }}

with source_events as (

    select
        event_id,
        event_ts::timestamp_ntz       as event_ts,  -- Snowflake syntax for type casting
        to_date(event_ts)             as event_date,
        user_id,
        event_type,
        payload
    from {{ source('raw', 'events') }}

    {% if is_incremental() %} 
      -- Only pull new/changed rows since last successful load
      where event_ts >
            (select max(event_ts) from {{ this }})
    {% endif %}

),

deduped as (

    -- optional: if the raw feed can produce duplicates
    select *
    from (
        select
            *,
            row_number() over (
                partition by event_id
                order by event_ts desc
            ) as _rn
        from source_events
    )
    where _rn = 1

)

select
    event_id,
    event_ts,
    event_date,
    user_id,
    event_type,
    payload
from deduped;
```

To ensure the best results:

* Use clustering keys wisely for better `MERGE` performance.
* Monitor `MERGE` performance as your table grows.
* Consider adding a lookback window (for example, `event_ts > max(event_ts) - interval '1 hour'`) to handle late-arriving data.

## Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams[​](#cdc-with-snowflake-streams "Direct link to Pattern 2: CDC with Snowflake Streams")

This pattern leverages Snowflake's native Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities through [Streams](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro), a Snowflake-specific feature which tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to source tables.

### When to use CDC[​](#when-to-use-cdc "Direct link to When to use CDC")

Use CDC when:

* You have source tables that receive frequent updates (not just appends).
* You need to capture both new records and changes to existing records.
* You want to avoid full table scans on large source tables.

### Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

To use this pattern, set up the stream in your data warehouse and then create a model to consume the stream.

1. Create the stream (one-time, outside dbt):

```sql
create or replace stream RAW.EVENTS_STREAM
on table RAW.EVENTS;
```

2. Create a model consuming the stream:

models/fct\_events\_cdc.sql

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    incremental_strategy = 'merge',
    unique_key = 'event_id',
    cluster_by = ['event_date'],
    snowflake_warehouse = 'TRANSFORM_WH'
) }}

with changes as (

    select
        event_id,
        event_ts::timestamp_ntz        as event_ts,
        to_date(event_ts)              as event_date,
        user_id,
        event_type,
        payload,
        metadata$action                as change_type
    -- points at the STREAM, not the table
    from {{ source('raw', 'events_stream') }}

),

filtered as (

    select *
    from changes
    where change_type in ('INSERT', 'UPDATE')
    -- If you want to physically delete, you could also handle 'DELETE' here

)

select
    event_id,
    event_ts,
    event_date,
    user_id,
    event_type,
    payload
from filtered;
```

### Pattern distinctions[​](#pattern-distinctions "Direct link to Pattern distinctions")

There are some key differences from [pattern 1](#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables):

* Streams only return changed rows, so you don’t need an `is_incremental()` time filter. Each run processes only the changes available at the moment.
* Run the model every few minutes to pull new changes and merge them into `fct_events`.
* This gives you a CDC-style pipeline. Snowflake Streams captures changes, and dbt handles transformations, tests, and lineage.

## Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables[​](#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables "Direct link to Pattern 3: Microbatch for large time-series tables")

For large `fact` tables where backfills or long lookback windows are challenging, use `incremental_strategy='microbatch'` (available in dbt Core v1.9 or higher and Latest release track in dbt platform). Refer to [incremental microbatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-microbatch.md) for more details. Note that Microsoft Fabric doesn't support microbatch yet. See [incremental strategy by adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy.md#supported-incremental-strategies-by-adapter) for more details.

microbatch must have event\_time

Every upstream model feeding this microbatch model must also be configured with `event_time` so dbt can push time-filters upstream. Otherwise, each batch could re-scan full upstream tables.

### When to use microbatch[​](#when-to-use-microbatch "Direct link to When to use microbatch")

* You have massive time-series tables (billions of rows).
* Backfills are slow and risky with traditional incremental approaches.
* You need to reprocess data in manageable chunks.
* Late-arriving data is common.

### Model configuration[​](#model-configuration "Direct link to Model configuration")

Let's say you have a `fact_events` table with a `event_ts` column and you want to process it in hourly chunks. You can configure the model as follows:

models/fct\_events\_microbatch.sql

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized        = 'incremental',
    incremental_strategy= 'microbatch',
    event_time          = 'event_ts',   -- time column in this model
    batch_size          = 'hour',       -- process in hourly chunks
    lookback            = 1,            -- reprocess 1 prior batch to catch late data
    unique_key          = 'event_id',
    cluster_by          = ['event_date'],
    full_refresh        = false
) }}

select
    event_id,
    event_ts::timestamp_ntz   as event_ts,
    to_date(event_ts)         as event_date,
    user_id,
    event_type,
    payload
from {{ ref('stg_events') }};
```

### Key behavior[​](#key-behavior "Direct link to Key behavior")

* Use microbatch for massive fact tables (clickstream, IoT, point-of-sale) with multi-year history.
* No `is_incremental() block` needed — dbt automatically generates the appropriate `WHERE event_ts BETWEEN..` predicates per batch based on `event_time`, `batch_size`, `begin`, `lookback`, and so on.
* Each run processes multiple smaller queries (one per batch), making larger backfills safer and easier to retry.
* The `lookback` parameter automatically handles late-arriving data by reprocessing recent batches.
* Schedule jobs based on your SLA.

## Choosing the right incremental pattern[​](#choosing-the-right-incremental-pattern "Direct link to Choosing the right incremental pattern")

The pattern you select will depend on your use case. Start with [pattern 1](#incremental-merge-from-append-only-tables) (`MERGE`), since it's appropriate for most use cases. Upgrade to [pattern 2](#cdc-with-snowflake-streams) (use your data warehouse's native CDC features) when you need efficient CDC. Reach for [pattern 3](#microbatch-for-large-time-series-tables) (Microbatch) when dealing with massive scale.

Use the following table to help you choose the right pattern:

| Pattern                  | Best for                     | Key benefit                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `merge` from append-only | Most standard use cases      | Simple, widely understood          |
| CDC with Streams         | Tables with frequent updates | Efficient change capture           |
| Microbatch               | Massive time-series tables   | Safe backfills, late-data handling |
