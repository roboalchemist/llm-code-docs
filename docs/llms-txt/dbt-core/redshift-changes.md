# Amazon Redshift adapter behavior changes

The following are the current [behavior change flags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes.md#behavior-change-flags) that are specific to `dbt-redshift`:

## `restrict_direct_pg_catalog_access` flag[​](#restrict_direct_pg_catalog_access-flag "Direct link to restrict_direct_pg_catalog_access-flag")

Originally, the `dbt-redshift` adapter was built on top of the `dbt-postgres` adapter and used Postgres tables for metadata access. When this flag is enabled, the adapter uses the Redshift API (through the Python client) if available, or queries Redshift's `information_schema` tables instead of using the `pg_` tables *for some metadata queries*.

Note that this flag does not apply to all metadata queries emitted by the adapter. For example, a list relations query may continue to query `information_schema` even when the flag is disabled.

While you shouldn't notice any behavior changes due to this change, however, to be cautious dbt Labs is gating it behind a behavior-change flag and encouraging you to test it before it becoming the default.

## `redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements` flag[​](#redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements-flag "Direct link to redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements-flag")

The `redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements` flag is `True` by default.

When `autocommit=True` (the default since `dbt-redshift 1.5`), each statement is automatically committed by the driver. Previously, dbt still sent explicit `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` statements, which were unnecessary and added extra round trips to Redshift.

With the `redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements` flag enabled, dbt skips sending transaction management statements when you enable autocommit, reducing unnecessary round trips and improving performance.

#### Key behaviors[​](#key-behaviors "Direct link to Key behaviors")

When both the flag and autocommit are `True`:

* `begin()` skips sending `BEGIN`
* `commit()` skips sending `COMMIT`
* `rollback_if_open()` skips sending `ROLLBACK`

dbt still maintains its internal `transaction_open` state to preserve compatibility with dbt’s transaction tracking, even when actual statements are skipped.

### Preserving legacy behavior[​](#preserving-legacy-behavior "Direct link to Preserving legacy behavior")

To preserve the legacy behavior of sending `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` statements even when autocommit is enabled, set the flag to `False` in your `dbt_project.yml`:

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
flags:
  redshift_skip_autocommit_transaction_statements: false
```

### Backward compatibility[​](#backward-compatibility "Direct link to Backward compatibility")

* **`autocommit=False`**: Unchanged. Explicit transactions still work as before regardless of this flag.
* **`autocommit=True` with flag (default)**: Skips unnecessary transaction statements for better performance.
* **`autocommit=True` without flag**: Sends `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` (legacy behavior).
