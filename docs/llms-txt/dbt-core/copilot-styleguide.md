# Copilot style guide

This guide provides an overview of the Copilot `dbt-styleguide.md` file, outlining its structure, recommended usage, and best practices for effective implementation in your dbt projects.

The `dbt-styleguide.md` is a template for creating a style guide for dbt projects. It includes:

* SQL style guidelines (for example, using lowercase keywords and trailing commas)
* Model organization and naming conventions
* Model configurations and testing practices
* Recommendations for using pre-commit hooks to enforce style rules

This guide helps ensure consistency and clarity in dbt projects.

## `dbt-styleguide.md` for Copilot[​](#dbt-styleguidemd-for-copilot "Direct link to dbt-styleguidemd-for-copilot")

Using Copilot in the Studio IDE, you can automatically generate a style guide template called `dbt-styleguide.md`. If the style guide is manually added or edited, it must also follow this naming convention. Any other file name cannot be used with Copilot.

Add the `dbt-styleguide.md` file to the root of your project. Copilot will use it as context for the large language model (LLM) when generating [data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests.md), [metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metrics-overview.md), [semantic models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/semantic-models.md), and [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation.md).

Note, by creating a `dbt-styleguide.md` for Copilot, you are overriding dbt's default style guide.

4. The style guide template appears in the Studio IDE. Click **Save**. `dbt-styleguide.md` is added at the root level of your project.

If you haven't previously generated a style guide file, the latest version will be automatically sourced from dbt platform.

## If `dbt-styleguide.md` already exists[​](#if-dbt-styleguidemd-already-exists "Direct link to if-dbt-styleguidemd-already-exists")

If there is an existing `dbt-styleguide.md` file and you attempt to generate a new style guide, a modal appears with the following options:

* **Cancel** — Exit without making changes.
* **Restore** — Revert to the latest version from dbt platform.
* **Edit** — Modify the existing style guide manually.
