# Project recommendations [Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")

Catalog provides recommendations about your project from the `dbt_project_evaluator` [package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_project_evaluator/latest/) using metadata from the [Discovery API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api.md).

* Catalog also offers a global view, showing all the recommendations across the project for easy sorting and summarizing.
* These recommendations provide insight into how you can create a better-documented, better-tested, and better-built dbt project, creating more trust and less confusion.
* For a seamless and consistent experience, recommendations use `dbt_project_evaluator`'s pre-defined settings and don't import customizations applied to your package or project.

## Recommendations page[​](#recommendations-page "Direct link to Recommendations page")

The Recommendations overview page includes two top-level metrics measuring the test and documentation coverage of the models in your project.

* **Model test coverage** — The percent of models in your project (models not from a package or imported via Mesh) with at least one dbt test configured on them.
* **Model documentation coverage** — The percent of models in your project (models not from a package or imported via Mesh) with a description.

## List of rules[​](#list-of-rules "Direct link to List of rules")

The following table lists the rules currently defined in the `dbt_project_evaluator` [package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_project_evaluator/latest/).

## The Recommendations tab[​](#the-recommendations-tab "Direct link to The Recommendations tab")

Models, sources, and exposures each also have a **Recommendations** tab on their resource details page, with the specific recommendations that correspond to that resource:
