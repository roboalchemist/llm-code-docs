Available to Enterprise-tier plans

This feature is available to the dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans. If you're interested in learning more, contact us at <sales@getdbt.com>.

The dbt Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans support a number of pre-built permission sets to help manage access controls within a dbt account. See the docs on [access control](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access.md) for more information on Role-Based access control (RBAC).

## Permission sets[​](#permission-sets "Direct link to Permission sets")

The following permission sets are available for assignment in all dbt Enterprise-tier accounts. They can be granted to dbt groups and then to users. A dbt group can be associated with more than one permission set. Permission assignments with more access take precedence.

Access to dbt features and functionality is split into `account-level` and `project-level` permission sets. Account-level permissions are primarily for account administration (inviting users, configuring SSO, and creating groups). Project-level permissions are for the configuration and maintenance of the projects themselves (configuring environments, accessing IDE, and running jobs). Account permission sets may have access to project features, and project permission sets may have access to account features. Check out the [permissions tables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md#account-permissions) to compare sets and their access.

 Account admin

The Account admin permission set is the highest level of access and control over your dbt account and projects. We recommend limiting the number of users and groups assigned the account admin permission set.

Notable features:

* Account admin is an account-level set.
* Unrestricted access to every feature.
* The default permissions for every user who creates a new dbt account.
* The default permissions assigned to the `Owner` group.

 Admin

The Admin permission set is intended for project administration but with limited account-level access to invite and assign users.

Notable features:

* Admin is a project-level set.
* Unrestricted access to existing projects, but can't create new projects.
* Can invite new members and assign access but can't create groups.
* Can access Catalog.
* The default permissions assigned to the `Member` group.

 Developer

The Developer permission set is intended for users who build and maintain dbt models under development and manage production behavior.

 Fusion admin

This permission set is used exclusively to enable users to interact with the Fusion upgrade workflows. We recommend limiting this permission to users and projects that are Fusion-ready.

By default, all users can access the Fusion upgrade experience and perform upgrades based on their existing permissions. When the Fusion upgrade permissions setting is enabled (when you see a check mark), only users with the fusion admin or account admin permission set can perform upgrades. If the setting is disabled (no check mark), upgrades are not restricted.

When upgrade permissions are enabled:

* **Fusion admin** — Assign to user accounts. This permission cannot be assigned to service tokens.
* **Account admin** — Assign to users or service tokens. This permission allows both users and service tokens to perform upgrades.

License types override group permissions

**User license types always override their assigned group permission sets.** For example, a user with a Read-Only license cannot perform administrative actions, even if they belong to an Account Admin group.

This ensures that license restrictions are always enforced, regardless of group membership.

Permissions:

* **Account-level permissions** — Permissions related to the management of the dbt account. For example, billing and account settings.
* **Project-level permissions** — Permissions related to the projects in dbt. For example, repos and access to the Studio IDE or dbt CLI.

note

Some permissions sets have read-only access to environment settings that can be overriden with more privileged access if the user is assigned to a group with [Environment write access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access.md#environment-write-access) configured.

### Account permissions[​](#account-permissions "Direct link to Account permissions")

Account permission sets enable you to manage the dbt account and manage the account settings (for example, generating service tokens, inviting users, and configuring SSO). They also provide project-level permissions. The **Account Admin** permission set is the highest level of access you can assign.

Key:

* **(W)rite** — Create new or modify existing. Includes `send`, `create`, `delete`, `allocate`, `modify`, and `develop`.
* **(R)ead** — Can view but cannot create or change any fields.
