The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) makes user data more secure and simplifies the admin and end-user lifecycle experience by automating user identities and groups. You can create or disable user identities in your Identity Provider (IdP), and SCIM will automatically make those changes in near real-time downstream in dbt.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To configure SCIM in your dbt environment:

* You must be on an [Enterprise or Enterprise+ plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing).
* You must use Okta or Entra ID as your SSO provider and have it connected in the dbt platform.
* You must have [permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md) to configure the account settings in dbt platform and change application settings in [Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/administrators-admin-comparison.htm).
* If you have IP restrictions enabled, you must add [Okta's IPs](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/ip-address-allow-listing.htm) to your allowlist.

### Supported features[​](#supported-features "Direct link to Supported features")

The currently available supported features for SCIM are:

* User provisioning and de-provisioning
* User profile updates
* Group creation and management
* Importing groups and users

When SCIM is enabled, the following functionality will change:

* Users are not automatically added to default groups
* Manual actions such as inviting users, updating user information and updating group memberships are disabled by default
* SSO group mappings are disabled in favor of SCIM group management

To overwrite these updates to functionality with SCIM enabled, enable manual updates as part of the SCIM configuration (not recommended).

When users are provisioned, the following attributes are supported

* Username
* Family name
* Given name

The following IdPs are supported in the dbt user interface:

* [Set up SCIM with Okta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/scim-okta.md) (includes [license management](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/scim-manage-user-licenses.md))
* [Set up SCIM with Entra ID](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/scim-entra-id.md)

If your IdP isn't on the list, it can be supported using dbt [APIs](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v3#/operations/Retrieve%20SCIM%20configuration).

## Set up dbt[​](#set-up-dbt "Direct link to Set up dbt")

To retrieve the necessary dbt configurations for use in Okta or Entra ID:

1. Navigate to your dbt **Account settings**.

2. Under **Settings**, click **SSO & SCIM**.

3. Scroll to the bottom of your SSO configuration settings and click **Enable SCIM**.
   <!-- -->
   [![SCIM enabled in the configuration settings.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/enable-scim.png?v=2 "SCIM enabled in the configuration settings.")](#)SCIM enabled in the configuration settings.

4. Record the **SCIM base URL** field for use in a later step.

5. Click **Create SCIM token**.

   <!-- -->

   note

   To follow best practices, you should regularly rotate your SCIM tokens. To do so, follow these same instructions you did to create a new one. To avoid service disruptions, remember to replace your token in your IdP before deleting the old token in dbt.

6. In the pop-up window, give the token a name that will make it easily identifiable. Click **Save**.
   <!-- -->
   [![Give your token and identifier.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/name-scim-token.png?v=2 "Give your token and identifier.")](#)Give your token and identifier.

7. Copy the token and record it securely, as *it will not be available again after you close the window*. You must create a new token if you lose the current one.
   <!-- -->
   [![Give your token and identifier.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/copy-scim-token.png?v=2 "Give your token and identifier.")](#)Give your token and identifier.

8. (Optional) Manual updates are turned off by default for all SCIM-managed entities, including the ability to invite new users manually. This ensures SCIM-managed entities stay in sync with the IdP, and we recommend keeping this setting disabled.

   <!-- -->

   * However, if you need to make manual updates (like update group membership for a SCIM-managed group), you can enable this setting by clicking **Allow manual updates** and confirming the **Allow manual updates** pop up.
