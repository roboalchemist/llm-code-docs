# SQL IN

It happens to the best of data people: The `orders` table always needs to filter out `status = employee_order` in order to get the accurate order counts. So you’re data model for the `orders` table looks a little something like this:

```sql
select * from {{ source('backend_db', 'orders') }}
where status != 'employee_order'
```

What happens one day if there’s an additional `status` that needs to be filtered out? Well, that’s where the handy IN operator comes into play.

The IN operator ultimately allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, so you can easily filter your query on multiple options. Using the IN operator is a more refined version of using multiple OR conditions in a WHERE clause.

## How to use SQL IN operator[​](#how-to-use-sql-in-operator "Direct link to How to use SQL IN operator")

In the scenario above if you now needed to filter on an additional new `status` value to remove certain rows, your use of the IN operator would look like this:

```sql
select * from {{ source('backend_db', 'orders') }}
where status not in ('employee_order', 'influencer_order') --list of order statuses to filter out
```

Woah woah woah, what is a `not in`? This is exactly what it sounds like: return all rows where the status is not `employee_order` or `influencer_order`. If you wanted to just use the IN operator, you can specify all other statuses that are appropriate (ex. `where status in ('regular_order', 'temp_order')`).

You can additionally use the IN/NOT IN operator for a subquery, to remove/include rows from a subquery’s result:

```sql
where status in (select …)
```

Compare columns against appropriate data types

The only “gotcha” that really exists in using the IN operator is remembering that the values in your IN list **must** match the data type of the column they’re compared against. This is especially important for boolean columns that could be accidentally cast as strings.

## IN operator syntax in Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, and Redshift[​](#in-operator-syntax-in-snowflake-databricks-bigquery-and-redshift "Direct link to IN operator syntax in Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, and Redshift")

The IN operator, like most of the SQL operators, are not syntactically different across data warehouses. That means the syntax for using the IN/NOT IN operator is the same in Snowflake, Databricks, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift.

## IN operator use cases[​](#in-operator-use-cases "Direct link to IN operator use cases")

Use the IN condition to filter out inappropriate or inaccurate rows from a query or database schema object based on parameters you define and understand. We guarantee there’s an IN somewhere in your dbt project 😀
