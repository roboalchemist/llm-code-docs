# Models object schema

[Models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models.md) are the foundational dbt resource that transform raw data into curated datasets using SQL (or Python). Each model represents a single SELECT statement, typically materialized as a table or view in your warehouse. You can query information about models through the Discovery API.

The [Example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query with the `models` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to view the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

query {
  environment(id: 834) {
    applied {
      models (first: 100) {
        edges {
