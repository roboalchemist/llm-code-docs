# How do I test one model at a time?

Running tests on one model looks very similar to running a model: use the `--select` flag (or `-s` flag), followed by the name of the model:

```shell
dbt test --select customers
```

Check out the [model selection syntax documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md) for full syntax, and [test selection examples](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples.md) in particular.
