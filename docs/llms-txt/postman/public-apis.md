# Publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network

Once you've [prepared your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/), [prepared your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/), [curated them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/), and [prepared your team workspace for team collaboration](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/), you're ready to publish your public APIs.

## Important:
Protect your sensitive data. If Postman detects any API keys, tokens, or similar, it replaces them with placeholders. To learn more, see [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).

## Evaluate the developer experience

Before you make your workspace public, and begin to share and promote your public APIs, walk yourself through the steps you outlined in your [overview collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-overview-collection). Invite others on your team to do the same.

If you haven't already, [create a team workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/#create-your-internal-workspace) and [fork your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/#fork-your-public-collections-from-your-public-workspace). Even if you decide to use one workspace to manage your public APIs, the exercise will walk you through your API consumer's steps.

Gather feedback and iterate to [curate your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/). Continue to iterate until you're satisfied you can get your new users to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible.

## Pin your collections to your workspace overview

To pin your collection to your workspace overview, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click your workspace's name.
2. Click ![Image 1: Pin icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pin-stroke.svg#icon) **Pin Collections** or ![Image 2: Add icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon), and pin your collection.
3. Choose an environment for your collection.

When an API consumer selects your pinned collection, Postman opens it and sets the environment for them.

To learn more, see [Pin collections to workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#pin-collections-to-workspaces).

## Make your workspace public

To make your workspace public, do the following:

1. Open your public workspace.
2. If your workspace's ![Image 3: Overview icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-overview-stroke.svg#icon) **Overview** tab isn't open, from the Postman sidebar, click your workspace's name. Then, click **Settings**.
3. Under **Workspace type**, click **Change**.
4. Click ![Image 4: Published icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-published-stroke.svg#icon) **Public**.
5. If you're prompted to submit a request, optionally add a note and click **Submit Request**.
6. Otherwise, click **Save Changes**.

Your public workspace and its collections are available on the Postman API Network.
