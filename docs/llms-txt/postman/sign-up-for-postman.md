# Sign up for Postman

Before you sign up for a Postman account, download the Postman desktop app or access Postman on the web. To learn more, go to [Get the Postman app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/).

If you're using the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) and not signed in, you're in the [lightweight Postman API Client](/docs/getting-started/basics/using-api-client/), which is a space where you can build and send requests. If you want to sync your work, organize requests into collections, collaborate with others, or use other features, sign up for a free account and [sign in](#sign-in-to-postman) to Postman.

## Sign up for Postman

To create an account, do the following:

1. Click **Create Account** in the upper-right corner of your desktop app, or click **Sign up for free** from the [Postman website](https://go.postman.co/home/).
2. Begin your sign-up using one of the following options:
   - **Email** - Enter your email address and create a username and password, then click **Create Free Account**.
     You'll be asked to verify your account before you can use Postman. Enter the 6-digit verification sent to your email and click **Verify Account**. If you haven't received a verification code, you can click **Resend verification code**.
   - **GitHub** - Click **Sign up with GitHub** to be redirected to the GitHub authorization page, where you can select an email associated with your GitHub account.
   - **Google account** - Click **Sign Up with Google** and follow the instructions.
   - **SSO** - Click **Sign In with SSO** if your organization has a team set up with single sign-on (SSO).
3. Select **Stay signed in** if you want to remain signed in for 30 days. See [Sign in to Postman](#sign-in-to-postman) for more information.
4. Click **Create free account**.
5. Add your name and role and let us how you'd like to use Postman, to help us customize your Postman experience. Click **Continue**.
6. Join your first team or click **Skip**. If you sign up with your company email and your company has a Postman account with team discovery enabled, you'll get a list of [teams you can join](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#find-teams-within-your-organization).
7. Select a plan or click **Continue with Free Plan**.
8. Set up a team. Update your team name and optionally invite others using a share link or email. Then, click **Continue**. If you're a professional domain user, note the following:
   - Your team is discoverable by default. You can allow anyone with the same `@company.com` domain to automatically join your team through [links](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) and [automatically join from team discovery](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) in that team setting page toggle.
   - You can update these settings at any time in [configure team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/).
9. Respond to the Postman usage prompt and click **Let's Go** or click **Skip**. If you type or select a built-in prompt, a tailored test workspace will be created for you.

Your new Postman profile will be visible to collaborators and anyone with access to the resources you share or publish. To learn more about your Postman profile and how to customize it, see [Customize your Postman profile](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-profile/).

You can [sync](/docs/getting-started/basics/syncing/) your work so that you can access it from different machines. You can also learn more about [Postman account settings](/docs/getting-started/account/settings/).

## Sign in to Postman

You can sign in to the Postman desktop app by clicking **Sign In** in the upper-right corner. You can also go to [Postman's website](https://www.postman.com/) and click **Sign In** in the upper-right corner of the page. This enables you to carry out many of your API development and testing tasks in your browser.

When you sign in using the Postman desktop app, the app will open a new screen that directs you to _Sign in from your browser to continue_. Your default browser will automatically open a webpage asking you to sign in to Postman. If your browser doesn't open within a few seconds, click either **open it manually** or **copy the URL**.

You can opt out of the sign-in process by clicking **Skip and take me to Postman Desktop App**.

Sign in to Postman in your browser by entering your account credentials or signing in with Google. If you're signing in to a Postman Enterprise team with single-sign on (SSO) enabled, opt to **Sign in with SSO**. To learn more, see [Sign in to an SSO team](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/).

If this is your first time signing in to Postman with SSO, you might need to [link your account to Postman](/docs/getting-started/account/manage/#link-your-account-to-postman).

Select **Stay signed in** if you want to remain signed in until you are inactive for 30 days before being asked to reauthenticate. Clear this checkbox if you don't want to remain signed in on the computer you're working on. Note that Postman will prompt you to sign in again after 30 minutes.

Your team may have set up a maximum session duration for all team members. In that case, sessions will be revoked based on the team setting.

If you've set up [two-factor authentication](/docs/getting-started/account/settings/#set-up-two-factor-authentication) (2FA), Postman will prompt you to enter the verification code from your authenticator app and click **Verify**.

If you've lost access to your device and can't access your authenticator app, click **Use a recovery code**. If you've lost your recovery codes, [email Postman support](mailto:help@postman.com) from a registered email address for help.

After you sign in, you will be redirected back to the Postman desktop app.

If you're a member of multiple Postman teams with varying authentication methods, you must sign in to those teams separately. To do so, click your avatar in the Postman header, then select the team to proceed.

You must complete the process of signing in within five minutes once you begin the process in the Postman desktop app. If you go beyond this time, you must return to the Postman desktop app and restart the sign-in process.
