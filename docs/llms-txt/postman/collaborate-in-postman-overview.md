# Collaborate in Postman

Postman has a variety of features that enable you to collaborate with your team and API consumers. You can design and implement an API lifecycle, organize your team and work, communicate changes, and share your work internally and with the world. With these features, you can tailor your collaboration strategy to each project's specific goals.

## Understand how teams and workflows function in Postman

You can collaborate on your APIs within [one or more teams](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/), across the entire company, or with partner companies. Implement collaboration workflows across different phases of the API development lifecycle, including prototyping, iterating, building, testing, deploying, and integrating with partners. Learn more about [Postman collaboration concepts](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-concepts/).

## Learn about Postman's collaboration features

Postman enables you to collaborate with your teammates and the Postman community by organizing, sharing, and communicating work to your APIs. Learn about [Postman's collaboration features](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/api-collaboration-features/).

## Organize your projects using workspaces

Workspaces enable you to collaborate with teammates or anyone in the Postman community. When you create a workspace, you can choose an empty workspace or use a workspace template to help you get started. You can also view changelogs for collections, workspaces, and APIs, enabling you to review actions taken on elements in your workspaces. Learn how you can [organize your projects using workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).

## Share your workspaces and elements

You can share your workspaces and elements with specific [team members and users who aren't part of your team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/). You can share with internal team members to your team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/), and share with your API consumers on the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

You can also [start a live session](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/live-sessions/) in an HTTP request to collaborate with your team in real time as you test, develop, and troubleshoot.

Super Admins and Community Managers can use the [Manage public elements dashboard](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/) to control which public workspaces, documentation, and collections are shared with external users.

## Define roles and permissions

You can define the [roles and permissions](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) assigned to team members at the team, workspace, and element levels. You can also define roles and permissions that relate to Partner Workspaces and your Private API Network.

Postman enables you to [organize team members into groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) that reflect your organization. Add users to a group, then assign that group roles and access to the resources they'll be using across Postman. This also enables you to efficiently onboard new team members by adding them to existing groups assigned relevant roles.

You can also [manage access to workspaces and elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) in your team.

## Build APIs using Postman's version control

You can [use Postman's version control](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/) to collaboratively build APIs with your team. This enables you and your team to fork a new instance of an element, make updates to the fork, create a pull request, and merge your changes into the parent element.
