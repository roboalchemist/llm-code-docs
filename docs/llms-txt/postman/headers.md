# Configure headers for API requests in Postman

Some APIs require you to send particular headers with requests to provide metadata about the operation you're performing. You can configure request headers in Postman, and save groups of headers as presets for quick access. Postman also automatically adds headers to your requests as needed depending on your request selections.

## Configure request headers

You can configure headers in the **Headers** tab of your request. Enter any key-value pairs you need and Postman will send them along with your request. As you enter text, Postman prompts you with common options you can use to autocomplete your setup, such as `Content-Type`.

When you're done configuring headers, select **Send** to send the request. Learn more about [creating and sending requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

![Header types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/presets-v11-27-b.jpg)

## Header presets

You can save commonly used headers together in a _header preset_. In the **Headers** tab of your request, select the **Presets** dropdown list and choose **Manage Presets**. Select **Add Header Preset** to add a new preset, and enter a name for the preset. Enter key-value pairs, then select **Add**.

You can select your preset in the **Presets** dropdown list. Selecting the preset will autopopulate the fields in your request headers.

![Header presets](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/header-presets-v11-27-b.jpg)

## Autogenerated headers

Postman will automatically add certain headers to your requests based on your request selections and settings. Select **hidden** at the top of your request's **Headers** tab for information about what Postman will send with your request.

![Hidden headers](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/hidden-headers-button-v11.jpg)

Hover over a header to view details about it. Postman will indicate why the header has been added. The details will also indicate how to deactivate or override a header value if you need to.

![Host header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-host-header-v9.jpg)

You can make changes to a header in the **Authorization** tab, the request **Body**, **Cookies** for the request domain, the **Settings**, and in some cases in the **Headers** tab itself. If you need to go to a different part of the app, Postman will show a link on the right-hand side.

If a header has been added based on your auth setup, [select the **Authorization** tab](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/) to change it. To alter cookie headers, [change the cookie setup](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) for the domain you're sending the request to.

![Token header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/headers-added-v11.jpg)

To deactivate an autogenerated header in the **Headers** tab, clear its checkbox. To override an autogenerated header value, clear the checkbox next to the autogenerated entry. Then add a separate entry for the header, listing its name in the **Key** field and specifying your value in the **Value** field.

If you have more than one entry for the same header, Postman indicates which one will be overridden. Postman prioritizes headers you have either explicitly added in **Headers** or indirectly with selections you made in the other parts of your request such as **Authorization**.

For `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers, Postman will automatically calculate values when you send your request, based on the data in the **Body** tab. However, you can override both values.

## Postman Vault integrations

Postman Vault integrations enable you to link vault secrets with secrets that are stored in an external vault. You can then reference vault secrets in your Postman team, and retrieve the value of external vault secrets using end-to-end encryption when you send HTTP requests.

Postman supports the following Postman Vault integrations:

* [1Password](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/1password/)
* [AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/aws-secrets-manager/)
* [Azure Key Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/azure-key-vault/)
* [HashiCorp Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/hashicorp-vault/)

You can create Postman Vault integrations from the Postman header, then select **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.

![Secret Scanner interface](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-protection-interface-11-1.jpg)

Postman's automatic secret protection policy offers the following options:

* **No policy** - Ignores any secrets detected by the Secret Scanner and stores them in the Postman cloud. Secret Scanner performs no automated actions or notifications. Partner and internal workspaces use this policy by default.
* **Move to vault** - Automatically moves detected secrets to the Postman Vault. Secrets stored in the Postman Vault aren't synced to the Postman cloud, and the original secret value is replaced with a [variable reference](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) to the vault secret. Public workspaces use this policy by default. Users are notified when Postman detects an exposed secret:

    * If the user's vault is unlocked, they'll receive a notification that their secrets were moved to and secured in their Postman Vault. Users can click **Got it** to dismiss the message, or request to override the policy.
    * If the user's vault is locked, they'll receive a notification to unlock their vault. They can review the detected secrets, then click **Unlock Vault** to move them to their vault. Or, users can click **Ignore** to dismiss the notification, but they'll be required to unlock their vault and move the detected secrets to their vault before they can save their secrets.
    * Users can choose to request a policy override for a detected secret if they click **Override policy** in the notification. They must select a justification to submit to the Team Admin, then click **Override** to submit it.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Postman stores exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. By default, all workspaces use the **No policy** option and store detected secrets in the Postman cloud. However, Team Admins can change the **default storage behavior** from **No policy** to **Move to vault**.

Users can't turn off secret policies, but can submit justifications to Team Admins to override any detected secrets.

### View live documentation

Postman displays a live preview of your API's documentation as you edit your component file. To show the documentation preview, click **Live preview** in the right sidebar. Click **Close** to hide the documentation preview.

### Validate a component file

Postman identifies syntax errors as you edit your component file. Syntax errors can include missing fields, malformed field names, wrong data types, wrong nesting, or other issues.

Postman also identifies governance issues for components, but only once they're [referenced in your specification](#reference-a-component-in-a-specification).

## Version and publish a component file

Publish a version of a component file to share the latest changes to your reusable components with your team. Versioning component files is useful for publishing a new version of your reusable components, while still supporting earlier versions. You can't edit versions once they're published.

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

![Set default detection policies for workspace types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-detection-set-default-policy-11-1.jpg)

To reset the policy for workspaces to their default, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Click **Reset Workspaces**.
3. Review the listed changes to each workspace type (**Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal**).
4. Click **Apply to all** to confirm your changes. This resets all workspaces to use the default policy for the displayed workspace types and removes any custom overrides.

### Update secret protection policies

To update a workspace's secret protection policy, do one of the following:

* To update the policy of a single workspace, select a policy from the **Policy** dropdown list next to the workspace.
* To update the policy of multiple workspaces, select the workspaces or select the checkbox next to the **Workspace** column, then select a policy from **Select policy** dropdown list.

By default, only the first 50 workspaces are listed. To select all workspaces or workspaces of the selected type, click **Select all workspaces within team**.

The policy you select is automatically applied to the selected workspaces.

## Reference a component in a specification

Reference reusable components in your OpenAPI specifications using the URL to the component and its version. A component file must have a [published version](#version-and-publish-a-component-file) before you can reference its components in your specification.

1. Click **Team** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.
3. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.
4. The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:
    * The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
    * The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.

Learn more about [the Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/reports/secret-scanner-reports/).

## Sync components between collections and specifications

Consider the following behavior when syncing changes to reusable components between collections and OpenAPI specifications.

* When you [generate a collection from a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/), Postman uses referenced components from your team's component library to populate relevant parts of the collection.
* When you [sync changes](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/#sync-changes-to-a-specification) from the collection back to the specification, Postman preserves the original reference URL if the values are unchanged. If you change values in the collection that originated from a referenced component, syncing those updates causes Postman to replace the reference URL with the updated inline values.

## Run a performance test using the Postman CLI

With performance tests, you can simulate user traffic and observe how your API behaves under load, identifying potential issues that affect performance. You can use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to trigger [performance tests](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/) for specified collections, all within your CI/CD pipeline. Your team can use your tests to automatically catch performance issues during the deployment process. Depending on whether the performance test passes or fails, you can push or roll back your changes.

With the [`postman performance run` command](#run-a-performance-test-command), you can configure a performance test for a collection. Add the command into your CI/CD script to [integrate performance tests into your workflow](#run-a-performance-test-within-your-cicd-pipeline). Postman recommends replacing your collection ID and API key with variables.

The Postman CLI triggers the performance test using the `postman performance run` command. The performance test runs against the specified collection according to your performance test configuration. Then the Postman CLI makes the test results available in the [performance test results](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/) in Postman.

### Run a performance test within your CI/CD pipeline

To run a performance test within your CI/CD pipeline, do the following:

1. Use the command to [install the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-installation/). You can use the following command to install the Postman CLI using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g postman-cli
    ```
2. Use the command to [sign in to Postman](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#sign-in-and-out) with the `--with-api-key` option to authenticate using your [Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key). You can use the following command to sign in and authenticate using your Postman API key:
    ```bash
    postman login --with-api-key ${{ secrets.POSTMAN_API_KEY }}
    ```
3. Use the command to [run a performance test](#run-a-performance-test-command) for a specific collection using its ID. Configure the performance test using its supported options to specify the number of virtual users to simulate, pass or fail conditions, and more. You can use the following command to run a performance test using the default settings:
    ```bash
    postman performance run ${{ vars.COLLECTION_ID }}
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > To get a collection ID in Postman, click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection. Then click **Info** in the right sidebar to view or copy the collection ID.

1. Paste the Postman CLI installation, `login`, and `performance` commands into your CI/CD script. This process depends on your CI tool.
    The following example shows how to add the Postman CLI commands to GitHub Actions:
    ```yaml
    name: Run performance tests using the Postman CLI
    
    on: push
    
    jobs:
      automated-api-tests:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          
          - name: Install Postman CLI
            run: npm install -g postman-cli
          
          - name: Login to Postman CLI
            run: postman login --with-api-key ${{ secrets.POSTMAN_API_KEY }}
          
          - name: Run performance test
            run: postman performance run ${{ vars.COLLECTION_ID }}
    ```

## Connect Postman with Azure API Gateway

Integrate your Azure API Gateway with Postman Collections and streamline your testing workflow. The Azure API Gateway app enables developers to troubleshoot and reproduce issues in deployed environments.

### Import APIs from Azure API Gateway to Postman

Before you get started with creating a collection from an imported API, connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman. You can select an API to troubleshoot or test, and create a collection from the information available in the API gateway. To learn more, see [Connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman](#connect-your-azure-api-gateway-to-postman).

### Create collections in Postman from Azure Gateway APIs

Collections created using the API gateway app contain the latest data from the deployed environment. This lets you keep collaborative workspaces up to date by bringing runtime API information to a collection. To learn more, see [Create a collection from an imported API](#create-a-collection-from-an-imported-api).

### Connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman

Once connected to the Azure API Gateway, any one of the available APIs can be automatically imported, along with the environment and the associated environment variables.

To connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman, do the following:

1. In Postman, select **Team** in the Postman header, then click **Organization Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Organization Settings**, select **Teams**.
3. Click **Create Team**.
4. Name your team. The team will be taggable in the mentions using `@`, for example, `@api-developers`.
5. Click **Add Members**. To be added, members need to be part of the organization.
6. Determine how restricted the Team access should be. All Organization Teams have two settings:
    * **Allow anyone from the Organization to join as a Member, or require Team Manager approval to join** – Turn on if you want to strictly control access to Teams and tightly control the team’s membership. Environments open to collaboration don’t necessarily require this level of control.
    * **Allow anyone on the Team to share content with the larger Organization, or require Team Manager approval to share outside the Team** – Turn on if your Postman Organization belongs to a highly regulated industry, or you have teams working on sensitive content where the sharing of content must be strictly controlled.
7. Populate the team with the members who are responsible for the team’s contents.
8. Select **Internal** for workspace type. You can update the workspace visibility at any time. As a best practice, workspaces need to remain internal until all the work has been completed and approved.
9. Select **Everyone in [TeamName]** to allow all Team Members with access to the workspace, whether invited or shared, to edit the workspace elements. Collaborators will still have to be added to the workspace roles to enable their access. For stricter access, select **Only you and invited people**. If there's a specific need to open the workspaces to all people in the Organization, select **Everyone in [OrgName]**.
10. Click **Create**.

After you create one or more workspaces, you can add workspace details, connect the workspace to a Slack or Teams channel, and post a workspace update announcing the workspace is ready for collaboration.

This lets you keep collaborative workspaces up to date by bringing runtime API information to a collection. To learn more, see [Create a collection from an imported API](#create-a-collection-from-an-imported-api).

### Connect your Slack to Postman

Once connected to the Slack app, you can automatically import any one of the available APIs, along with the environment and the associated environment variables.

To connect your Slack app to Postman, do the following:

1. In Postman, select **Team** in the Postman header, then click **Organization Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Organization Settings**, select **Teams**.
3. Click **Create Team**.
4. Name your team. The team will be taggable in the mentions using `@`, for example, `@api-developers`.
5. Click **Add Members**. To be added, members need to be part of the organization.
6. Determine how restricted the Team access should be. All Organization Teams have two settings:
    * **Allow anyone from the Organization to join as a Member, or require Team Manager approval to join** – Turn on if you want to strictly control access to Teams and tightly control the team’s membership. Environments open to collaboration don’t necessarily require this level of control.
    * **Allow anyone on the Team to share content with the larger Organization, or require Team Manager approval to share outside the Team** – Turn on if your Postman Organization belongs to a highly regulated industry, or you have teams working on sensitive content where the sharing of content must be strictly controlled.
7. Populate the team with the members who are responsible for the team’s contents.
8. Select **Internal** for workspace type. You can update the workspace visibility at any time. As a best practice, workspaces need to remain internal until all the work has been completed and approved.
9. Select **Everyone in [TeamName]** to allow all Team Members with access to the workspace, whether invited or shared, to edit the workspace elements. Collaborators will still have to be added to the workspace roles to enable their access. For stricter access, select **Only you and invited people**. If there's a specific need to open the workspaces to all people in the Organization, select **Everyone in [OrgName]**.
10. Click **Create**.

After you create one or more workspaces, you can add workspace details, connect the workspace to a Slack or Teams channel, and post a workspace update announcing the workspace is ready for collaboration.

## Connect Postman with Teams

Integrate your Teams with Postman Collections and streamline your testing workflow.

### Import APIs from Teams to Postman

Before you get started with creating a collection from an imported API, connect your Teams to Postman. You can select an API to troubleshoot or test, and create a collection from the information available in the API gateway. To learn more, see [Connect your Teams to Postman](#connect-your-teams-to-postman).

### Create collections in Postman from Teams APIs

Collections created using the Teams app contain the latest data from the deployed environment.
