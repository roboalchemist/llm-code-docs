# create-collections

Create collections of API requests in Postman
=============================================

Create a Postman Collection to save and share your favorite requests, to group requests you use for testing an API, or to document your API. You can create a new collection from scratch, or jump-start your collection with a template.

Once created, you can customize your collection by adding a name and description. You can also specify authorization details and add scripts and variables.

## Create a new collection

To create a collection, you must be [signed in to your Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/).

You can create a new collection in the following ways:

* Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then select **+ \u003e Blank collection**.
* Click **New** in the sidebar, then click **Collection**.
* In an empty workspace, click **Create Collection**.
* You can also [create a collection from a template](#create-a-collection-from-a-template).

Once you've created a new collection, you can [add API requests](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/) to it. You can also [name and configure your collection](#configure-a-collection).

![Create new collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/new-collection-v11-6a.jpg)

## Create a collection from a template

Not sure how to get started with your collection? Instead of creating a collection from scratch, you can use a template with predefined content. Postman has templates designed for integration testing, API documentation, conditional workflows, data visualization, and more.

To create a collection from a template, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then select **+ \u003e Collection template**.
2. Select a recommended template. You can also search for a template, or browse templates by role or use case.
3. Review the information about the template, and when ready click **Use template**.

You can also apply a template to an existing, empty collection. In the collection's overview, select a template or click **More templates**. You can't apply a template to a collection that already contains items.

## Configure a collection

To customize and configure your new collection, do any of the following:

* Click the collection name in the workbench to rename your collection. You can also select a collection in the sidebar and press the **Enter** or **Return** key to rename it.
* You can add a [description](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) for your collection in the **Overview** tab. The description also appears in the collection's documentation.
* Click **Authorization** to configure [authorization details](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/) for all requests in the collection.
* Select **Scripts \u003e Pre-request** to add a [pre-request script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) for your collection. The script will run before each request in the collection is sent.
* Select **Scripts \u003e Post-response** to add a [post-response script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) for your collection. The script will run after each request in the collection is sent.
* Click **Variables** to define [collection variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). Collection variables are reusable values you can use across all requests and documentation in a collection.

Double-click a collection in the sidebar to persist its tab as you navigate the Postman app.

Turn on autosave to automatically save your changes to requests. Learn more about [autosave](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#application).

## Postman Vault integrations

Postman's Local Secret Protection is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

With the Secret Scanner's Local Secret Protection, [Team Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can configure where Postman stores the team's exposed secrets in the workspaces or types of workspaces you've defined.

When [enabled](#enable-local-secret-protection), Postman scans secrets in real time and takes action, storing exposed secrets, like API keys, JWT tokens, or auth tokens, in the [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). The Postman Vault stores your exposed secrets securely on your device. The original secret value is replaced with a vault secret reference. This prevents your team's secrets from syncing to the Postman cloud and gives you greater control over your team's security posture and compliance requirements.

Postman's Local Secret Protection actively scans for secrets in the following Postman elements when changes are made:

* HTTP collections
* Environments variable values
* Global variable values

Local Secret Protection requires Postman version 11.71.3 or later.

## Enable Local Secret Protection

To enable Local Secret Protection in Postman, do the following:

1. Click **Team \u003e Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Local Protection** tab.
3. Turn on **Local secret protection**.

Once enabled, you can configure how Postman stores exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. By default, all workspaces use the **No policy** option and store detected secrets in the Postman cloud. However, Team Admins can change the [default storage behavior](#set-default-protection-policies-for-new-workspaces).

Users can't turn off secret policies, but can submit justifications to Team Admins to override any detected secrets.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Local Secret Protection manages exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. Define a policy for specific types of workspaces, and all new workspaces automatically inherit the policy you choose.

This only applies to workspaces created after you set a policy. To apply the policy to existing workspaces, [update their policy](#update-secret-protection-policies).

To set default policies by workspace types, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

![Set default detection policies for workspace types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-detection-set-default-policy-11-1.jpg)

To reset the policy for workspaces to their default, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Click **Reset Workspaces**.
3. Review the listed changes to each workspace type (**Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal**).
4. Click **Apply to all** to confirm your changes. This resets all workspaces to use the default policy for the displayed workspace types and removes any custom overrides.

### Update secret protection policies

To update a workspace's secret protection policy, do one of the following:

* To update the policy of a single workspace, select a policy from the **Policy** dropdown list next to the workspace.
* To update the policy of multiple workspaces, select the workspaces or select the checkbox next to the **Workspace** column, then select a policy from **Select policy** dropdown list.

By default, only the first 50 workspaces are listed. To select all workspaces or workspaces of the selected type, click **Select all workspaces within team**.

The policy you select is automatically applied to the selected workspaces.

## View secret scan metrics

The **Local Protection** report in the Secret Scanner's **Reports** dashboard enables your Team Admins to view Local Secret Protection metrics. This includes automatic resolutions and user-requested overrides.

To access the report, do the following:

1. Click **Team \u003e Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.

The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:

* The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
* The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.

However, Team Admins can change the [default storage behavior](#set-default-protection-policies-for-new-workspaces).

Users can't turn off secret policies, but can submit justifications to Team Admins to override any detected secrets.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Local Secret Protection manages exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. Define a policy for specific types of workspaces, and all new workspaces automatically inherit the policy you choose.

This only applies to workspaces created after you set a policy. To apply the policy to existing workspaces, [update their policy](#update-secret-protection-policies).

To set default policies by workspace types, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

To reset the policy for workspaces to their default, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Click **Reset Workspaces**.
3. Review the listed changes to each workspace type (**Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal**).
4. Click **Apply to all** to confirm your changes. This resets all workspaces to use the default policy for the displayed workspace types and removes any custom overrides.

### Update secret protection policies

To update a workspace's secret protection policy, do one of the following:

* To update the policy of a single workspace, select a policy from the **Policy** dropdown list next to the workspace.
* To update the policy of multiple workspaces, select the workspaces or select the checkbox next to the **Workspace** column, then select a policy from **Select policy** dropdown list.

By default, only the first 50 workspaces are listed. To select all workspaces or workspaces of the selected type, click **Select all workspaces within team**.

The policy you select is automatically applied to the selected workspaces.

## View secret scan metrics

The **Local Protection** report in the Secret Scanner's **Reports** dashboard enables your Team Admins to view Local Secret Protection metrics. This includes automatic resolutions and user-requested overrides.

To access the report, do the following:

1. Click **Team \u003e Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.

The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:

* The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
* The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.
