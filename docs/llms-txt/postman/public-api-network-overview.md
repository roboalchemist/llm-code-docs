Explore and Publish to the Postman API Network
=============================================

The *Postman API Network* enables API publishers to share their public workspaces, collections, APIs, and Flows with their API's consumers. Publishers can help their API's consumers to discover and consume their APIs directly in Postman. The Postman API Network enables API consumers to discover new and popular public workspaces and elements to use in their own workspaces.

As an API consumer, you can get started by exploring and using public workspaces and elements on the Postman API Network. To learn more, see [Explore APIs on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/explore/overview/).

As an API publisher, you can get started by sharing your public workspaces to the Postman API Network. Learn about [best practices and tips for sharing public workspaces](#become-an-api-publisher-and-showcase-your-public-apis) to the Postman API Network.

## Benefits of the Postman API Network

The Postman API Network benefits both API consumers and publishers in the following ways:

* **Consumers** - The Postman API Network enables you to search for, discover, and identify public workspaces and elements you'd like to use in your organization. You can fork collections from a variety of publishers, and build on their APIs in your own workspace. The Postman API Network also gives you access to the latest API workflows directly from publishers.
* **Publishers** - The Postman API Network enables you to share your workspaces and elements with your API's consumers, and collect feedback from them through metrics and comments. Sharing APIs on the Public API Network increases your API's discovery in organic and Postman search results. Customize your public team profile to promote your workspaces and social media all in one place. You can improve your API's onboarding experience with detailed documentation, organized workspace resources, and more.

## Become an API Publisher and Showcase Your Public APIs

To succeed as an API publisher, focus on API consumer success. This starts with getting your API consumers to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. To learn more, see the following:

* **Prepare your public APIs** - Before you publish your API to the Postman API Network, spend time [preparing them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/overview/) by creating and [curating](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/) your publisher team, workspace, and collections.
* **Publish your public APIs** - Once you've prepared your public APIs for your API consumers, you're ready to [publish them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/) by making your workspace public and sharing and promoting your APIs on the Postman API Network.
* **Maintain your public APIs** - Once you've published your APIs to the Postman API Network, continue to [maintain them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/) and give your API consumers access to your API's latest features and documentation.

## Benefits of the Postman API Network

The Postman API Network benefits both API consumers and publishers in the following ways:

* **Consumers** - The Postman API Network enables you to search for, discover, and identify public workspaces and elements you'd like to use in your organization. You can fork collections from a variety of publishers, and build on their APIs in your own workspace. The Postman API Network also gives you access to the latest API workflows directly from publishers.
* **Publishers** - The Postman API Network enables you to share your workspaces and elements with your API's consumers, and collect feedback from them through metrics and comments. Sharing APIs on the Public API Network increases your API's discovery in organic and Postman search results. Customize your public team profile to promote your workspaces and social media all in one place. You can improve your API's onboarding experience with detailed documentation, organized workspace resources, and more.

## Become an API Publisher and Showcase Your Public APIs

To succeed as an API publisher, focus on API consumer success. This starts with getting your API consumers to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. To learn more, see the following:

* **Prepare your public APIs** - Before you publish your API to the Postman API Network, spend time [preparing them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/overview/) by creating and [curating](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/) your publisher team, workspace, and collections.
* **Publish your public APIs** - Once you've prepared your public APIs for your API consumers, you're ready to [publish them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/) by making your workspace public and sharing and promoting your APIs on the Postman API Network.
* **Maintain your public APIs** - Once you've published your APIs to the Postman API Network, continue to [maintain them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/) and give your API consumers access to your API's latest features and documentation.
