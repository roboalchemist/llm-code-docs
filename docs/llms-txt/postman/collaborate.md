# Collaborate with your team on your collection

Once you [connect your GitHub repository and primary branch to your collection](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/collections/connect/#connect-a-github-repository-and-branch-to-your-collection), you can fork your collection and collaborate with your team on it.

## Fork a collection connected to your GitHub repository and branch

Before you get started, create your feature branch.

To fork a collection connected to your GitHub repository and branch, do the following:

1. Open your primary collection.
2. Next to your collection, click ![Image 1: Options icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon) **View more actions**. Then, click **Fork**.
3. Select a workspace.
4. Confirm your fork is linked to your branch. Then, select a branch.
5. Click **Fork Collection**.

Postman creates a collection file in the connected repository and branch. The collection's file name is the collection ID. Each time you save your collection in Postman, your changes are committed to the connected GitHub repository and branch.

## Collaborate on your collection

With GitHub and Postman, you start collaborating by [forking your primary collection](#fork-a-collection-connected-to-your-github-repository-and-branch) and making changes in Postman. Your teammates can join you and contribute to your changes. When you're ready for your team to review your changes, you create a pull request and merge it in GitHub.

To collaborate on your collection's next release, do the following:

1. Open your forked collection and make changes to it in Postman.
2. When you're ready for your team to review your changes, create a pull request in GitHub and ask your team to review it.
3. When you're ready to merge your changes with your primary collection, merge your pull request in GitHub.
4. (Optional) Delete your forked collection.

When you merge your pull request in GitHub, Postman updates your primary collection in Postman with the updates from your forked collection.
