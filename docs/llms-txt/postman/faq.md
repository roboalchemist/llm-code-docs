Starting in May 2025, you can create _team-to-team Partner Workspaces_. This update enhances security and authentication for Postman API partnerships and enables access to a Partner Workspace from one’s own team. In addition to supporting SSO login for partners, Partner Managers can verify which partners use SSO from a new [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page in **Team Settings**.

Postman is automatically migrating all pre-existing Partner Workspaces to the newer team-to-team model so that you get all the latest features and security enhancements.

## FAQ about migration to team-to-team partnerships

### What happens to the legacy Partner Workspaces created before May 2025?

We are migrating these workspaces automatically to the newer team-to-team model. Once your Partner Workspaces are upgraded, both Publishers and Partners in each workspace will receive an email. No action is required from you.

### Who will receive these migration emails?

All impacted Partner Managers, Team Admins, and Workspace Admins will receive an email stating “Your Partner Workspaces have been migrated”. All impacted Partners will receive an email titled “Your Partner Workspace with [Publisher Name] has been upgraded”.

### When are you completing the migration?

If your team is on the Professional plan, we will migrate your workspaces mid-December. All Enterprise teams will be upgraded after the holidays in January.

### I am a Partner and I can’t access my Partner Workspace. What should I do?

You should have received an email with a link to your Partner Workspace. The email subject will be “Your Partner Workspace with [Publisher Name] is now upgraded”. Click **Go to workspace** in the email to navigate directly to the Partner Workspace. Alternatively, you can navigate to [**Workspaces > View All Workspaces > External Workspaces**](https://www.postman.com/workspaces?tab=shared_partner) to see your Partner Workspace.

### I host a Partner Workspace and my Partner informed me that they can't access my Partner Workspace anymore

## FAQ about team-to-team partnerships

### How can I create a Partnership using Postman?

Users who want to create new team-to-team Partner Workspaces should do one of the following:

* If using the Postman desktop app, update to the [latest version](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
* Use the Postman web app, which always has the latest version.

Partners also need to access the Partner Workspace using a web browser or the latest version of the Postman app.

### How does this feature affect my team?

All new Partner Workspaces you create are team-to-team Partner Workspaces. Your existing Partner Workspaces aren't affected, and you can continue to use them and invite new Partners. Postman can help you migrate existing Partner Workspaces, but this isn't required. If you partner with developers from another Postman team, those partnerships will become more secure and seamless if you migrate your workspaces.

Partner management has been relocated in Team settings from the Members page to a new [Partnerships](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page. When access to a Partner Workspace is requested, Partner Managers and Admins receive one email per team, while Partners receive one email per workspace containing a direct link to navigate to their workspace.

Partners can now access workspaces directly from their team without switching to a partner-specific team.

### Are there any pricing changes?

There are no changes to pricing. Partner Viewers are free, and Partner Editor add-ons are charged based on the [Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#partner-editor).

### Do team-to-team Partner Workspaces support both single-partner and multi-partner configurations?

You can use a team-to-team Partner Workspace as a single or multi-partner workspace. Workspace Admins can go to the **Workspace Settings** page and turn on multi-partner mode, which prevents partners from seeing each other in the workspace. However, the Publisher team members can see all partners in the workspace.

### How does this feature make partner collaboration more secure?

In the new [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page under **Team > Team Settings**, Postman gives you visibility into SSO-enabled Partner access. SSO-enabled Partners log in to their own companyâs Postman team using SSO authentication, ensuring secure collaboration. If at any point, this Partner leaves their organization and their Postman team, they lose access to the Partner Workspace. Therefore, access to the Partner Workspace is tied to their Postman team, not the individual.
