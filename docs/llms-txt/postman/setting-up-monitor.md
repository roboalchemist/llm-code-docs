# Set up a monitor in Postman

Create a new monitor to continuously check your API's health, run test suites, or validate critical workflows. When creating a monitor, you select a collection with the requests you want to run and set a schedule for how often Postman runs the collection.

## Create a monitor

You can create a new monitor from the sidebar or select a collection to monitor. To create a new monitor from the sidebar, do the following:

1. Click **Monitors** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create new monitor**.
3. [Configure](#configure-a-monitor) your new monitor.

To create a monitor from a collection, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create new collection**.
3. In the **Create a new collection from API gateway** popup window, enter the following information:
   - Select an API from the gateway.
   - Select the stage on which the API is deployed.
   - Create an environment (optional). This creates a new environment on Postman for the API variables from the gateway.

4. Click **Create collection**.

Postman adds a new collection file to your team's component library in the OpenAPI specification format you chose. [Add your own components to the file](#edit-a-component-file) so your team can reuse them in their specifications.

## Edit a component file

Add reusable components to new and existing component files. Define reusable components you'd like to standardize in your team's specifications, making the component file the single source of truth. You can edit only the draft version of a component file.

1. Click **Docs** in the sidebar, then open a specification.
2. Click **Components** in the lower right of the specification.
3. Click **Open Component Library**.
4. Click a component file in the left sidebar.
5. Choose a published version of the component file using the version dropdown list.
6. In the left sidebar, click **Copy component link** next to a component. This copies the URL to the version of the component you select in the dropdown list.
7. Add the URL to a reference (`$ref`) in your specification.

## View live documentation

Postman displays a live preview of your API's documentation if you're editing an OpenAPI 3.0 or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification.

To view the live documentation, do the following:

1. Under **Workspace description**, add a description.
2. Under **About**, add a summary.
3. Under **Tags**, add tags.

Your teams can continue to edit workspace details as their workspaces, collections, and APIs evolve.

## Announce your team and workspace setup

To post a workspace update, do the following:

1. From the workspace, select **Updates**.
2. Click **Post an Update**.
3. Enter a title and a description of your update.
4. Select **Announcement** from the dropdown list.
5. (Optional) Add a summary describing the change.
6. If you've integrated Postman with Slack or Teams, you can post a team workspace update to a channel on one or both of those apps. Click **Post Update**.

If a social channel is already subscribed to workspace updates, the checkbox next to **Share on Slack (or Teams)** on the bottom right of the post will be checked. If not, click **![Slack icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon)** ![Teams icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon) **Connect** in the workspace overview to subscribe to a channel. Ensure the box is checked to send notifications when someone posts a workspace update.

## Enable Local Secret Protection

Postman's Local Secret Protection is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

With the Secret Scanner's Local Secret Protection, [Team Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can configure where Postman stores the team's exposed secrets in the workspaces or types of workspaces you've defined.

When [enabled](#enable-local-secret-protection), Postman scans secrets in real time and takes action, storing exposed secrets, like API keys, JWT tokens, or auth tokens, in the [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). The Postman Vault stores your exposed secrets securely on your device. The original secret value is replaced with a vault secret reference. This prevents your team's secrets from syncing to the Postman cloud and gives you greater control over your team's security posture and compliance requirements.

Postman's Local Secret Protection actively scans for secrets in the following Postman elements when changes are made:

* HTTP collections
* Environments variable values
* Global variable values

### Local Secret Protection requires Postman version 11.71.3 or later.

## Enable Local Secret Protection

To enable Local Secret Protection in Postman, do the following:

1. Click **Team** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Local Protection** tab.
3. Turn on **Local secret protection**.

Once enabled, you can configure how Postman stores exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. By default, all workspaces use the **No policy** option and store detected secrets in the Postman cloud. However, Team Admins can change the [default storage behavior](#set-default-protection-policies-for-new-workspaces).

Users can't turn off secret policies, but can submit justifications to Team Admins to override any detected secrets.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Local Secret Protection manages exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. Define a policy for specific types of workspaces, and all new workspaces automatically inherit the policy you choose.

You can also use [Groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to assign Team membership, enabling control through an [Identity Provider (IdP) and SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).

To set default policies by workspace types, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

![Set default detection policies for workspace types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-detection-set-default-policy-11-1.jpg)

To reset the policy for workspaces to their default, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Click **Reset Workspaces**.
3. Review the listed changes to each workspace type (**Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal**).
4. Click **Apply to all** to confirm your changes. This resets all workspaces to use the default policy for the displayed workspace types and removes any custom overrides.

### Update secret protection policies

To update a workspace's secret protection policy, do one of the following:

* To update the policy of a single workspace, select a policy from the **Policy** dropdown list next to the workspace.
* To update the policy of multiple workspaces, select the workspaces or select the checkbox next to the **Workspace** column, then select a policy from **Select policy** dropdown list.

By default, only the first 50 workspaces are listed. To select all workspaces or workspaces of the selected type, click **Select all workspaces within team**.

The policy you select is automatically applied to the selected workspaces.

## View secret scan metrics

The **Local Protection** report in the Secret Scanner's **Reports** dashboard enables your Team Admins to view Local Secret Protection metrics. This includes automatic resolutions and user-requested overrides.

To access the report, do the following:

1. Click **Team** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.

The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:

* The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
* The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.

Learn more about [the Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/reports/secret-scanner-reports/).

## Create Organization teams

To create an Organization Team, do the following:

1. Access [**Organization Settings**](/docs/administration/organization/settings/), then select [Teams](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/teams).
2. Click **Create Team**.
3. Name your team. The team will be taggable in the mentions using `@`, for example, `@api-developers`.
4. Click **Add Members**. To be added, members need to be part of the organization.

### Notes:

* If no Team Manager is assigned, the Organization Manager can continue to manage the Team membership.
* You can use [Groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to assign Team membership, enabling control through an [Identity Provider (IdP) and SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).

![The Local Secret Protection interface](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-protection-interface-11-1.jpg)

Postman's automatic secret protection policy offers the following options:

* **No policy** - Ignores any secrets detected by the Secret Scanner and stores them in the Postman cloud. Secret Scanner performs no automated actions or notifications. Partner and internal workspaces use this policy by default.
* **Move to vault** - Automatically moves detected secrets to the Postman Vault. Secrets stored in the Postman Vault aren't synced to the Postman cloud, and the original secret value is replaced with a [variable reference](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) to the vault secret. Public workspaces use this policy by default. Users are notified when Postman detects an exposed secret:

  * If the user's vault is unlocked, they'll receive a notification that their secrets were moved to and secured in their Postman Vault. Users can click **Got it** to dismiss the message, or request to override the policy.
  * If the user's vault is locked, they'll receive a notification to unlock their vault. They can review the detected secrets, then click **Unlock Vault** to move them to their vault. Or, users can click **Ignore** to dismiss the notification, but they'll be required to unlock their vault and move the detected secrets to their vault before they can save their secrets.

  Users can choose to request a policy override for a detected secret if they click **Override policy** in the notification. They must select a justification to submit to the Team Admin, then click **Override** to submit it.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Local Secret Protection manages exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. Define a policy for specific types of workspaces, and all new workspaces automatically inherit the policy you choose.

You can also use [Groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to assign Team membership, enabling control through an [Identity Provider (IdP) and SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).

To set default policies by workspace types, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

![Set default detection policies for workspace types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/local-secret-detection-set-default-policy-11-1.jpg)

Learn more about [the Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/reports/secret-scanner-reports/).

## Create Organization workspaces

To create workspaces for an Organization Team, do the following:

1. If you're not continuing from the previous step, from the [Home](https://go.postman.co/home) page, click [Teams](https://go.postman.co/teams) and locate the team you for which you want to create workspaces.
2. Click **Create Workspace**.
3. Select a blank workspace or a workspace template. Click **Next**.
4. Name the workspace.
5. Select the team for which to create a workspace. Otherwise, your team will be prepopulated.
6. Select **Internal** for workspace type. You can update the workspace visibility at any time. As a best practice, workspaces need to remain internal until all the work has been completed and approved.
7. Select **Everyone in [TeamName]** to allow all Team Members with access to the workspace, whether invited or shared, to edit the workspace elements. Collaborators will still have to be added to the workspace roles to enable their access. For stricter access, select **Only you and invited people**. If there's a specific need to open the workspaces to all people in the Organization, select **Everyone in [OrgName]**.
8. Click **Create**.

After you create one or more workspaces, you can add workspace details, connect the workspace to a Slack or Teams channel, and post a workspace update announcing the workspace is ready for collaboration.

## Edit workspace details

Postman recommends adding a useful workspace description and other details to help Organization Teams start collaborating.

To identify workspaces further, do the following:

1. Under **Workspace description**, add a description.
2. Under **About**, add a summary.
3. Under **Tags**, add tags.

Your teams can continue to edit workspace details as their workspaces, collections, and APIs evolve.

To learn more, see [Edit workspace details](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#edit-workspace-details).

## Announce your team and workspace setup

To post a workspace update, do the following:

1. From the workspace, select **Updates**.
2. Click **Post an Update**.
3. Enter a title and a description of your update.
4. Select **Announcement** from the dropdown list.
5. (Optional) Add a summary describing the change.
6. If you've integrated Postman with Slack or Teams, you can post a team workspace update to a channel on one or both of those apps. Click **Post Update**.

If a social channel is already subscribed to workspace updates, the checkbox next to **Share on Slack (or Teams)** on the bottom right of the post will be checked. If not, click ![Slack icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon) ![Teams icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon) **Connect** in the workspace overview to subscribe to a channel. Ensure the box is checked to send notifications when someone posts a workspace update.

## Sync components between collections and specifications

Consider the following behavior when syncing changes to reusable components between collections and OpenAPI specifications.

* When you [generate a collection from a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/), Postman uses referenced components from your team's component library to populate relevant parts of the collection.
* When you [sync changes](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/#sync-changes-to-a-specification) from the collection back to the specification, Postman preserves the original reference URL if the values are unchanged. If you change values in the collection that originated from a referenced component, syncing those updates causes Postman to replace the reference URL with the updated inline values.
