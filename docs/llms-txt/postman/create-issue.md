Create a Jira issue from Postman
===============================

Once you [connect your Jira account to your Postman account](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/jira/connect/), you can create a new Jira issue from an HTTP collection, collection run, or response in Postman. You can also link to an existing issue.

With Jira and Postman, you can see the status of all open issues, track your project's status, and assess your API's performance, all from Postman.

## Create a Jira issue from a collection, collection run, or response

If there's an issue with your HTTP collection, [collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), or one of your HTTP responses, you can create a new Jira issue from Postman.

To create a Jira issue from a collection, collection run, or response, do the following:

1. Open an HTTP collection or request. Then, open the collection's known issues, run the collection, or send the request:
   
   - To open the collection's known issues, under **Known issues**, click the number of issues.
   - To run the collection, click ![Image 1: Run icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon) **Run**, set up the run, and run it. To learn more, see [Test your API using the Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).
   - To send the request, click **Send**.
