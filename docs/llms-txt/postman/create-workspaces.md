Create a workspace in Postman
============================

When you first sign in to Postman, an [internal workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/) is automatically created for you. You can create new workspaces using a blank workspace or use a template suitable for the work you and your team are doing.

## Create a new workspace

To create a new workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the header, then click **Create Workspace**.

2. You can select a [workspace template](#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) like the API development template, the API testing template, and others to help you set up a new workspace. Select a workspace template to populate the workspace with helpful information and sample collections and environments, or select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace. Then click **Next**.

    ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) If your [team is restricting creation of internal workspaces with team access](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/), users who don't have permission can raise a request to create an internal workspace with team access, which goes for approval to [users who have access to approve such requests](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
    
6. Select who has access to your workspace: everyone in your organization, your team, or only you and the people you invite. If you choose to create a public workspace, and you don't have an admin role, you'll be prompted to add a note for the approval of this request.
    
7. Select **Create** and Postman will open your new workspace. You can add elements to the workspace. Select **Invite** in the Postman header to add other users to the workspace.
    
    To create a new workspace, you can also click **New** in the sidebar, then select **Workspace** and follow the same steps.

    You can also create a new workspace in the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard). Select **Create Workspace** and follow the same steps.

## Apply a template to a workspace

If you didn't use a template to create a workspace, you can apply it to an existing workspace. Workspace templates are available for a variety of common use cases, including API demos, engineering onboarding, and API testing.

When you apply a workspace template, it populates the workspace description with an introduction and information to help you get started. Each workspace template also includes sample collections and environments that you can use and change as needed. To use a template, [create a new workspace](#create-a-new-workspace) or open a newly created workspace.

To use a template in a newly created blank workspace, do the following:

1. In the workspace overview, select **Explore workspace templates**.
    
2. Select a template from the list in the sidebar, then select **Apply Template**.
    
You can also enhance your workspace with other templates. Go to **Collections** in the sidebar, then select
