Create and send API requests in Postman
---------------------------------------

You can use the Postman API client to connect to APIs you're building, testing, or integrating with. Build and send API requests with parameters, body data, and headers. Save your requests in collections so you can collaborate on them with your team or use them in automated testing.

## Build API requests in Postman

Use Postman to [create and send API requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/) using HTTP or other common protocols such GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSocket. You can [send parameters and body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) with your requests, and [send request headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/), as required by your API. You can also [configure custom settings for each request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-settings/).

## Upload test data to your team

Postman enables you to share your test data with others on your Postman team. You can [upload data files to your team](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/), and anyone on your team can use the uploaded files as form data or raw body data when sending requests in Postman.

## Organize requests with Postman Collections

You can [save and organize your API requests in collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) so you can use them over and over. Use collections to collaborate with your team, generate API tests and documentation, and automate request sending.

## Generate code snippets from requests

Postman can help you integrate your front-end application with your API. Choose a supported language–like Postman CLI, C#, JavaScript, and NodeJS–and [generate a code snippet from a request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/). You can use the snippet in your app to make calls to your API.

## Use vault secrets

You can reference vault secrets stored in your local vault or a cloud vault in your HTTP collections and requests from the **URL builder**, the **Params** tab, the **Authorization** tab, the **Headers** tab, and the **Body** tab. You can use the Collection Runner to [manually run collections](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) that reference vault secrets. Scheduled collection runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support vault secrets.

## Postman Vault integrations

Integrate your Azure API Gateway with Postman Collections and streamline your testing workflow. The Azure API Gateway app enables developers to troubleshoot and reproduce issues in deployed environments.

## Import APIs from Azure API Gateway to Postman

Before you get started with creating a collection from an imported API, connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman. You can select an API to troubleshoot or test, and create a collection from the information available in the API gateway. To learn more, see [Connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman](#connect-your-azure-api-gateway-to-postman).

## Create collections in Postman from Azure Gateway APIs

Collections created using the API gateway app contain the latest data from the deployed environment. This lets you keep collaborative workspaces up to date by bringing runtime API information to a collection. To learn more, see [Create a collection from an imported API](#create-a-collection-from-an-imported-api).

## Connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman

Once connected to the Azure API Gateway, any one of the available APIs can be automatically imported, along with the environment and the associated environment variables.

To connect your Azure API Gateway to Postman, do the following:

1. In Postman, select **Team > Team Settings**.
2. Click **Installed apps**.
3. Select the Azure Gateway app and click **Install**. A popup window displays, click **Allow**.
4. Enter the following information to authorize installation of the app:
    * Azure Tenant ID
    * Azure Client ID
    * Azure Client Secret
    * Azure Subscription ID
5. Click **Next**.
6. Select the checkboxes for the following scopes, based on the HubSpot events you want the flow to access:
    * `chat:write`
    * `channels:read`
    * `groups:read`
    * `channels:join`
    * `im:read`
    * `incoming-webhook`
    * `mpim:read`
7. Click **Create app**.
8. After your app is created, select the app and navigate to **Auth**.
9. Select **Show token** to reveal your app's access token. Select **Copy**, and then save it as a variable in your Postman environment named `Azure_Access-Token`.

## Create a collection from the Azure API Gateway app

You can select an API to troubleshoot or test, and create a collection from the information available in the API gateway. Collections created using the API gateway app contain the latest data from the deployed environment. This lets you keep collaborative workspaces up to date by bringing runtime API information to a collection.

To create a collection from an imported API, do the following:

1. After setting up the connection, you can create a new collection.
2. Click **Collections**, then select **Create from Azure**.
3. In the **Create a new collection from API gateway** popup window, enter the following information:
    * Select an API from the gateway.
    * Select the stage on which the API is deployed.
    * Create an environment (optional). This creates a new environment on Postman for the API variables from the gateway.
4. Click **Create collection**.

After you create one or more workspaces, you can add workspace details, connect the workspace to a Slack or Teams channel, and post a workspace update announcing the workspace is ready for collaboration.

## Edit workspace details

Postman recommends adding a useful workspace description and other details to help Organization Teams start collaborating.

To identify workspaces further, do the following:

1. Under **Workspace description**, add a description.
2. Under **About**, add a summary.
3. Under **Tags**, add tags.

Your teams can continue to edit workspace details as their workspaces, collections, and APIs evolve.

To learn more, see [Edit workspace details](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#edit-workspace-details).

## View secret scan metrics

The **Local Protection** report in the Secret Scanner's **Reports** dashboard enables your Team Admins to view Local Secret Protection metrics. This includes automatic resolutions and user-requested overrides.

To access the report, do the following:

1. Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.
3. The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:

* The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
* The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.

Learn more about [the Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/reports/secret-scanner-reports/).

* To update the policy of a single workspace, select a policy from the **Policy** dropdown list next to the workspace.
* To update the policy of multiple workspaces, select the workspaces or select the checkbox next to the **Workspace** column, then select a policy from **Select policy** dropdown list.

By default, only the first 50 workspaces are listed. To select all workspaces or workspaces of the selected type, click **Select all workspaces within team**.

The policy you select is automatically applied to the selected workspaces.

## View secret scan metrics

The **Local Protection** report in the Secret Scanner's **Reports** dashboard enables your Team Admins to view Local Secret Protection metrics. This includes automatic resolutions and user-requested overrides.

To access the report, do the following:

1. Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Reports** tab.
3. The report provides metrics about the Secret Scanner's real-time secret management in a given period of time, such as:

* The total number of detected secrets automatically moved to the Postman Vault.
* The total number of user Secret Scanner policy overrides. Team Admins can click the number of overrides in the **Secrets Count** column to view details about override justifications created by users.

## Enable Local Secret Protection

To enable Local Secret Protection in Postman, do the following:

1. Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar.
2. In **Secret Scanner**, select the **Local Protection** tab.
3. Turn on **Local secret protection**.

Once enabled, you can configure how Postman stores exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. By default, all workspaces use the **No policy** option and store detected secrets in the Postman cloud. However, Team Admins can change the [default storage behavior](#set-default-protection-policies-for-new-workspaces).

Users can't turn off secret policies, but can submit justifications to Team Admins to override any detected secrets.

### Set default protection policies for new workspaces

You can customize how Local Secret Protection manages exposed secrets in your team's workspaces. Define a policy for specific types of workspaces, and all new workspaces automatically inherit the policy you choose.

This only applies to workspaces created after you set a policy. To apply the policy to existing workspaces, [update their policy](#update-secret-protection-policies).

To set default policies by workspace types, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Select **No policy** or the **Move to vault** policy for the **Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal** workspace types.
3. Click **Save**.

To reset the policy for workspaces to their default, do the following:

1. Click **Set default policies**.
2. Click **Reset Workspaces**.
3. Review the listed changes to each workspace type (**Public**, **Partner**, and **Internal**).
4. Click **Apply to all** to confirm your changes. This resets all workspaces to use the default policy for the displayed workspace types and removes any custom overrides.
