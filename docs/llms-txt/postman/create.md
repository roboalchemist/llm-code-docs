Create an AI request block for your flow
=======================================

You use [**AI Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-request/) blocks to interact with AI models, which can help you evaluate different models, add AI to your workflows, prototype AI agents, and much more. You can add **AI Request** blocks to [flow modules](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) and [actions](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/).

## Create a new flow module

You can use an existing flow module or create a new one. If you choose to use an existing flow module, skip to [Add a new AI request block](#add-a-new-ai-request-block).

To create a new flow module, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
1. In the upper left corner, click **New** \> ![Image 1: Flow icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon) **Flow**.
1. In the sidebar, hover over your new flow module and click ![Image 2: Options icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon) **View more actions**, then select **Rename** from the dropdown list.
1. Rename your new flow module.
