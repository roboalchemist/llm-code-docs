# Postman documentation overview

Welcome to the Postman Docs! This is the place to find official information on how to use Postman in your API projects.

If you're learning to carry out a specific task or workflow in Postman, check out the following topics to find resources:

## Get started

To get started using Postman, check out the [Get started](/docs/getting-started/overview/) section.

## Send requests

You can send requests in Postman to connect to APIs you are working with. To learn more about how to send requests, see [Send API requests and get response data in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/requests/) and learn how to [send your first request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/).

## Write scripts

Postman has a powerful runtime based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that enables you to add dynamic behavior to requests and collections. You can write scripts that run before or after requests to perform API tests, build requests that can contain dynamic parameters, pass data between requests, and more. To learn more about scripts, see [Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).

## Use collections

Postman Collections are groups of saved requests. You can use collections to organize and group your requests. They can then be run together. You can run collections manually, on a schedule, from a CI/CD pipeline, or from a webhook. To learn more about collections, see [Organize and automate API requests in Postman Collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

## Use Postman Flows

Postman Flows is a visual tool for creating API workflows. You can use flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.

To learn more about Postman Flows, see [Build API applications visually using Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/).

## Use the Postman CLI

The Postman CLI is a secure command-line companion for Postman. You can use the Postman CLI to run a collection, send run results to Postman, check API definitions against configured API Governance and API Security rules, and more.

To learn more about the Postman CLI, see [Explore Postman's command-line companion](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

<InterlinkCTA platform="community" datatype="join" />

## Collaborate in Postman

Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance [collaboration](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-collaboration/) within your team. You can create internal workspaces, where team members can share their work and collaborate on API projects. Users can also discuss their work directly in Postman by commenting on collections and APIs, including on specific requests, versions, and inline on API definitions and scripts.

To learn more about collaboration in Postman, see [Collaborate in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/).

## Design and develop your API

Postman supports [API-first development](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) with Spec Hub, types in collections, and the API Builder. Use [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) or the [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) to design your API's structure in an API specification or definition, respectively. Either can act as the single source of truth for your API project. You can also use [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/) to design your API with the Postman Collection format.

To learn more about API-first development, see [Design and build your APIs in Postman](/docs/design-apis/overview/).

## Document your API

[Documentation](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-documentation/) is an important part of any collection or API. Good documentation helps the people who use your collection understand what it does and how each request works. And comprehensive API documentation lets your consumers know what endpoints are available and how to interact with them.

Once you've generated documentation for your collection or API, users can view the documentation in Postman. By default your documentation is private, so you must share a collection or API with others before they can access it. If you're creating a public API, you can publish your documentation to make it publicly available to anyone with a web browser.

To learn more about documenting your API, see [Document your APIs in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/).

## Monitor your API

Postman Monitors give you continuous visibility into the health and performance of your APIs. [Monitors](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-monitoring/) enable you to run API test scripts, chain together multiple requests, and validate critical API flows. A monitor runs a series of requests from the Postman cloud on a schedule you set. To learn more about using monitors, see [Monitor health and performance of your APIs in Postman](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/).

## API Governance and API Security

[API governance](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-governance/) is the practice of defining and applying development rules that promote consistent API behaviors across your organization's API landscape. A robust [API security](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-security/) posture means that your organization has development rules that promote security-first API behaviors. The Postman API Governance and Postman API Security features can identify inconsistencies or weaknesses in your APIs, then recommend possible fixes or improvements.

To learn more about Postman's API Governance and API Security features, see [API Governance and API Security in Postman](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/).

## Administration

Postman provides a variety of options to customize your team's experience, from the initial setup to ongoing team and plan management. As an Admin, you can streamline the onboarding process for your team, manage access control, and keep your team up to date with the latest version of Postman.

To learn more about administering your Postman team, see the [Team management overview](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/overview/).

## Use reports

Postman generates reports that enable you to visualize data for how your team uses Postman. These reports give you insights into the state of your APIs, including tests, documentation, and monitoring coverage. They also enable you to track performance and SLA adherence.

To learn more about how to use reports, see [View reports on usage, security, and billing in Postman](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

## Developer resources

If you're integrating Postman with your CI/CD workflow or are developing with Postman APIs or libraries, check out [Postman developer resources](/docs/developer/resources-intro/).

## Integrations

You can connect Postman to your API workflows with integrations for popular third-party solutions. Use integrations to automatically share data between Postman and the other tools you rely on for API development. For more information, see [Integrate Postman with third-party solutions](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/).

# Your first steps with Postman

Follow this quick guide to get started using Postman. You'll learn how to install the Postman app, send an API request, write your first test, and save requests in a collection. You'll also learn about working with your team in Postman and discovering APIs on the Postman API Network.

When you're ready to begin, go to the [Download](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) topic, then go through each topic in this section in order. You can use the arrows at the bottom of each page to move between topics.


# Get the Postman app

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Download the Postman app for macOS, Windows, or Linux.](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)**
</Info>

Postman is the API platform for using, building, and testing APIs. You can use the Postman desktop app to power every part of your API lifecycle:

* Send requests with the Postman API client, including HTTP, GraphQL, and gRPC requests.
* Design, build, and document APIs.

- Build AI agents that interact with LLMs and APIs.

* Test and monitor your API's functionality and performance.
* Organize your work and collaborate with your team on API development.
* Discover new APIs and build visual API-driven applications.

Postman is available as a desktop and web app.

* To download the Postman desktop app, visit the [Download Postman page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and click the button for your operating system. Postman is available as a native desktop app for macOS (Intel or Apple silicon), Windows (Intel 64-bit or ARM 64-bit), and Linux (64-bit).
* To get started in your browser, go to the [web app](https://go.postman.co/home/).

<Note title="Note">
  Some features aren't supported when using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#web-limitations), so use the Postman desktop app for the full Postman experience.
</Note>

If you need more help with your install, go to [Install and update Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).


# Send your first API request

Postman's API client enables you to create and send API [requests](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/#requests), including HTTP, GraphQL, and gRPC requests. Using Postman, you can send a request to an endpoint, retrieve data from a data source, or test an API's functionality. You don't need to enter commands in a terminal or write any code. When you create a new request and click **Send**, the API response returns directly in Postman.

## Send an API request

Make sure you've [downloaded and installed the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/). When you're ready, open the Postman desktop app and send your first API request.

1. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add** in the workbench to open a new [tab](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#tabs).
2. Enter "postman-echo.com/get" for the request URL.
3. Click **Send**.

Postman displays the response data sent from the server in the lower pane.

<img alt="Sending a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/send-first-request-v11-71-7.jpg" />

## How it works

In this example, Postman acts as the client application and communicates with an API server. Here's what happened when you clicked **Send**:

1. Postman sent a GET request to the [Postman Echo API](/docs/developer/echo-api/) server located at `postman-echo.com`.
2. The API server received the request, processed it, and returned a response to Postman.
3. Postman received the response and displayed it in the **Response** pane.

You used Postman to send an API request and got a response from the API server.

## Next steps

You've sent your first API request, and you're ready to do more with Postman!

* Send more requests to the Postman Echo API, a handy tool you can use to test API requests in Postman. To learn more about using the Echo API, see the [Postman Echo API documentation](/docs/developer/echo-api/).
* When you're ready to learn more about building and sending requests in Postman, see [Create and send API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/).

<InterlinkCTA platform="community" datatype="ask-request" />


# Write your first test

*API tests* are a way to ensure that your API is behaving as you expect it to. For example, you might write a test to validate your API's error handling by sending a request with incomplete data or wrong parameters. You can write tests for your Postman API requests in JavaScript and add them to individual [requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/), [collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/), and folders in a collection. Postman includes code snippets you can add and then change to suit your test logic.

To write a test, do the following:

1. Go to the request you made in [Send your first API request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/).

2. In the request, click the **Scripts** tab, then click **Post-response**.

3. Click <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snippets** at the lower right of the code editor, then select **Status code: Code is 200**. This will enter the following test code:

   ```javascript
   pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
       pm.response.to.have.status(200);
   });
   ```

4. Click **Send**.

After the request runs, the test will run. In the response section, click **Test Results** to review the results of your test.

To learn more about writing tests, go to [Write scripts to test API response data in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/).

# Create your first collection

To create a new [collection](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/#collections), in this example, you'll start by creating a new request first. You can create a new request from the sidebar in Postman.

To create a collection and save a request in the new collection, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, [install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) and [sign in to Postman](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/).

2. Click **New > HTTP**.

   <img alt="Create new request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-http-v11-59.jpg" width="280" />

3. Enter a request in the request builder and click **Save**.

4. Click **New Collection**. Name the request and collection.

   <img alt="Save request to collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/save-request-to-collection-v11-59.jpg" />

5. Click **Save** to add the request to the collection.

After you save the request, your new collection and the request are listed under **Collections** in the sidebar.

<img alt="Saved first request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/first-request-saved-v11-59.jpg" width="280" />

Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests in a collection for easier access.

## Next steps

* To learn more about collections, visit the [Collections overview](/docs/collections/collections-overview/).
* To create, edit, delete, and work with your collections, visit [Create and manage request collections in Postman](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/).
* For details on how to run your collection, visit the [Collection Runner overview](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/).


# Discover public APIs on the Postman API Network

The [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/) is the world's largest network of public APIs. Developers can use the API Network to explore APIs, contribute to them, and publish their own. Many of the companies you know and love publish their APIs to a public workspace on the Postman API Network.

As an API consumer, you can discover new and popular workspaces, collections, requests, APIs, flows, and teams. If you're an API publisher, you can conveniently access your publisher tools.

# Take your next steps in Postman

In summary, you've sent a request, written a test, and saved requests to collections. Check out some other things you can do in Postman:

* You can [run collections](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/) manually, or schedule collection runs to run at specific times in the cloud. You can also automate collection runs in your CI/CD pipeline with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
* [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/) is a visual tool for building API-driven applications for the API-first world. You can use flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.
* Speaking of API-first, Postman supports API-first development with [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) or the [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) to design your API in Postman. Your API specification can then act as the single source of truth for your API project. You can also use [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/) to design your APIs using collections.
* Documentation is an important part of any collection or API. You can [add documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) so users can understand what your collection or API does and how each request works. By default your documentation is private, but if you're creating a public API, you can publish your documentation to make it publicly available to anyone on the internet.
* [Add your API to the Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/) to share your APIs with 20M+ users in the world's largest public API network. Your API is searchable in the Postman app when it's available on the Postman API Network.


# Postman basics overview

This section covers the basic features of Postman that help you send API requests, share your work with others, and use Postman in your API development workflows. You'll also get a tour of the Postman user interface to launch you on your API-first journey.

## Find your way around Postman

Postman has a variety of tools you can use to work with APIs and collaborate with your team. [Learn how to navigate Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/), so you can always find the features you're looking for.

Need more help? Postbot is your AI assistant for API workflows. [You can ask Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/) to add tests to requests, visualize responses, write documentation, and more.

## Discover Postman elements

Learn how Postman enables you to streamline your API development. [About Postman elements](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/) explains the meaning and usage of collections, requests, documentation, environments, flows, API Builder, Spec Hub, mock servers, and monitors.

## Send API requests from Postman

[The Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#select-a-postman-agent-for-requests) enables you to send API requests from a browser using the Postman web app. You can manually select an agent, or Postman can select the best agent for you.

If you're not signed in to a Postman account, you can still send multi-protocol requests using the [lightweight API client](/docs/getting-started/basics/using-api-client/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For the best experience sending API requests, [download the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) and [sign in to your Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/#sign-in-to-postman).
</Info>

## Save your work in Postman

When you're signed in to your Postman account, all of your work is [automatically synced to the Postman cloud](/docs/getting-started/basics/syncing/). That means you can access all of your collections, requests, and other data anywhere you're signed in to Postman.

You must also turn on **Save Responses** to [share an HTTP request and its response](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-a-request-with-its-response) from your request's history with collaborators. If this is turned off when you send a request, you won't be able to view or share the response from your request's history.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't use the **Save Responses** option with requests from [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).
</Info>

## Workbench

Whether you're working with a collection, an API, or another element type, the Postman workbench is where you do the majority of your work. [Tabs](#tabs) enable you to organize your work, while the [right sidebar](#right-sidebar) gives you access to element-specific tools like comments. The [environment selector and variables pane](#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) enable you to manage variables.

### Tabs

Tabs allow you to organize and work between requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This section describes how tabs work in the Postman desktop app. By default, tabs in the Postman web app work this way as well. You can choose to use browser tabs instead, which enables you to use a different tab for each open Postman element. For more information, see [Browser tabs in the Postman web app](#browser-tabs-in-the-postman-web-app).
</Info>

#### Opening a new tab

To open a new tab, click **+** in the workbench.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also press **⌘+T** or **Ctrl+T** to open a new tab.
</Info>

<img alt="Open a new tab" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/open-new-tab-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

If you open a request and don't edit or send it, then open another request, the second tab replaces the first tab. When the tab is in preview mode, it displays in italics.

You can set whether Postman opens requests and other sidebar items in new tabs. Click the settings icon <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the header and click **Settings**. Under **User interface**, click the **Always open sidebar item in new tab** toggle to turn this option on or off.

#### Saving or discarding changes

If a tab has unsaved changes, Postman displays a dot next to the tab name. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save** to save the changes. To close the tab and discard changes, click the close icon <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> then click **Don't save**.

#### Renaming and linking elements

To rename an element, click the element's name and enter a new name.

<img alt="Rename elements" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/rename-element-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also click a collection or its elements (folders, requests, and examples) in the sidebar and press the **Enter** or **Return** key to rename it.
</Info>

To copy a link to an element, hover over the element's name in the workbench to display the link icon <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />. Click the link icon to copy the element's URL to your clipboard.

<img alt="Copy link to elements" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/copy-link-to-element-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

If the element is in a workspace that no one can access, a popup window displays when you click the link icon. The popup window enables you to invite people to your workspace before sharing the link. To invite people to your workspace, click **Invite People**. To learn more about inviting people to collaborate in a workspace, see [Share workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces).

<img alt="Invite people before sharing link to element" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/copy-link-to-element-invite-v10-21-11.jpg" />

#### Viewing conflicts

If you are making changes to the same request in two different tabs, before you can save the changes, the tab alerts you to a conflict. Clicking the tab displays a message that the request was modified since the last time you opened the tab. By clicking **Save**, you can either override the previous change or save the request as a new one.

<img alt="Tab displaying a conflict" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/tab-conflict-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

#### Managing tabs

You can have many tabs open at the same time. To rearrange your open tabs, click and drag them in the desired order.

You can double-click an element's tab to persist it as you navigate the Postman app. You can also double-click a collection or its elements in the sidebar to persist their tabs.

To manage your open tabs, right-click the open tab to activate a menu with action options:

* **Duplicate Tab** - *(Available on the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/))* Duplicates the current tab. This doesn't create a copy of the request, so when you duplicate a tab any edits you make are reflected in the original request.
* **Close Tab** - Closes the current tab. If the tab has unsaved changes, Postman asks if you want to save before closing.
* **Force Close Tab** - Closes the current tab without saving any changes.
* **Close Other Tabs** - Closes all tabs except the one you're working in.
* **Close All Tabs** - Closes all tabs. If any tabs contain unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* **Force Close All Tabs** - Closes all tabs without saving any changes.

<img alt="Manage tabs using the actions menu" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-tabs-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Closing unsaved tabs.** You can set whether Postman asks you to save when you close a tab that has changes. Click the settings icon <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the header and click **Settings**. Under **General > Request**, click the **Always ask when closing unsaved tabs** toggle to turn this option on or off.
</Info>

If you have a lot of tabs open, they might overflow the area of the tab bar. To go to tabs that are outside the viewable area, click the arrows next to the tab bar.

<img alt="Scroll to view tabs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/tab-navigation-scroll.jpg" />

#### Tab search

To search open tabs or access recently closed tabs, click the tab search dropdown list.

<img alt="Search tabs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/tab-search-v10-21-11.jpg" width="280px" />

#### Browser tabs in the Postman web app

By default, the Postman web app uses in-app tabs like the Postman desktop app does. You can optionally choose to use browser tabs instead. With this setting turned on, there is only one collection overview or request in the main work area at a time, and you can open more Postman elements in new browser tabs. This enables you to work across workspaces or to use different environments in the same workspace.

If you've saved changes to a request, when you click a new element Postman will open it in the main work area. If the request has unsaved changes, Postman prompts you to save or discard your changes.

To open a workspace, environment, or request in a new browser tab, press and hold **⌘+Shift** or **Ctrl+Shift** and click the element you want to open.

To open an in-app link in a new browser tab, press and hold **⌘** or **Ctrl** and click the link you want to open.

To turn this behavior on or off in the Postman web app, click the settings icon <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the header, then click **Remove tabs** in the **User interface** section.

### Right sidebar

The right sidebar gives you access to more tools, including comments, code snippets, and request information, based on which kind of Postman element you choose.

# About Postman elements

As a comprehensive API development platform, Postman helps you organize and document your work and complete different phases of the [API development lifecycle](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-lifecycle/). Learn more about integral parts of Postman like collections and environments.

## Collections

A [*collection*](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) is a set of requests sent to API endpoints. A collection can also include saved responses from those requests, along with each endpoint's authorization type, parameters, headers, request bodies, tests, and settings.

Collections enable you to organize your requests using folders and subfolders according to the requirements of your API project. For example, you can group your API actions into tasks.

You can design your APIs using an HTTP collection with types. Define types, such as data type and possible values, that describe your API's request parameters, headers, and body data. Adding details to your collection can help others better understand your API and send valid API requests. You can also generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification in Spec Hub from a collection and keep them in sync. To learn more, see [Design your APIs with Postman Collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To try a quick example, see [Create your first collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/).
</Info>

## Requests

A *request* is a way for one application to access the capabilities of another application over the internet by way of an API server. A client application (like a mobile app) sends a request to the server, and after the request is processed the server returns a response to the client.

In Postman, you can make [requests](/docs/sending-requests/requests/) using HTTP protocol, MQTT protocol, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and Socket.IO. An *API endpoint* is a URL that acts as the point of contact between an API client and an API server. API clients send requests to API endpoints to access the API's functionality and data.

The request *method* indicates the action you want the API to perform. The most common methods include:

* GET retrieves data from an API.
* POST sends new data to an API.
* PATCH and PUT update existing data.
* DELETE removes existing data.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To try a quick example, see [Send your first API request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/).
</Info>

To learn more about requests, see [Send a request with the Postman API client](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

## Documentation

*API documentation* is a set of human-readable instructions for using and integrating with an API. Documentation includes information about an API's endpoints, methods, resources, authentication protocols, parameters, and headers. It also includes examples of common requests and responses.

Postman automatically generates [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) for your collection. To access it, click the collection's **Overview** tab and click **View complete documentation**. You can improve your documentation by adding descriptions for your collection, folders, and requests.

## Environments

An *environment* is a set of [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) that you can reuse in your requests and share with your team. You can reference them in request authentication, query and path parameters, request bodies, and scripts. Variables help you work efficiently, collaborate with teammates, and set up dynamic workflows.

You can [use environment variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) to call the same request against different servers, such as local, stage, or production. Each environment has its own set of variable values. When you change environments, selecting the correct environment points your request at the correct host (server) with the proper authentication and its defined variables. Global variables are useful in cases where you need to use the same variable across several collections.

Environments can also help you to collaborate on Postman data if you're working as part of a team. You can use environments to share variables and manage the visibility of sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, or tokens. Learn more about [working with environments as a team in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/).

To learn more about how variables are used in Postman in general, see [Reuse data with variables and environments in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/).

## Flows

*Postman Flows* is a visual, low-code tool designed to streamline API workflows, making it easier for you to create, manage, and collaborate on API projects. Postman Flows provides an infinite canvas where you can functionally represent your APIs as blocks that can be connected to simulate data flow. The blocks are a set of visual abstractions. To form and visualize an application, you drag blocks, build an application, and run your workflow.

To learn more, see [Build API applications visually using Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/).

## Spec Hub

[Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) enables you to [design your API](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) in an OpenAPI 3.0 or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification. You can generate a collection from your API specification. If the collection was generated from an OpenAPI 3.0 specification, you can keep the collection and specification in sync with your latest changes.

## API Builder

Postman supports [API-first development](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) with the API Builder. You can use the [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) to design your API in Postman and then take your API through the complete development lifecycle by developing, testing, deploying, and observing it. Your [API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/) can then act as the single source of truth for your API project.

When you create a new API in the Postman API Builder, you can start your API development by [connecting to a repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/) or clicking **continue without a repository**.

## Mock servers

A *mock server* enables you to simulate your API without having to configure a real API server. You can use any HTTP collection to set up a mock server. When you send a request to the mock server, Postman returns a real-world response using data from your collection.

To learn more about how to get started with mock servers in Postman, see [Simulate your API in Postman with a mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/overview/).

## Monitors

*Postman Monitors* enable you to [continuously check the health and performance of your APIs](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-observability/). You can create monitors that run requests in selected collections. Requests can run API test scripts, chain together multiple requests, and more. You can also schedule how often Postman runs monitored collections.

You'll be alerted to any test failures once the monitor is running, so you can identify and address issues before your API's consumers are affected.

To learn more about monitors, see [Monitor health and performance of your APIs in Postman](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/).


# About the Postman Agent

The Postman Agent enables you to send API requests when you're using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app). The Postman Agent is required to bypass the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations of web browsers. Postman has four agents you can select from.

You can use the Desktop Agent to send all types of API requests from the Postman web app without CORS limitations. You can also use the Cloud Agent, the Browser Agent, or the Interceptor Agent to send HTTP requests. The Postman web app can automatically select the best agent for your requests, or you can manually select an agent depending on your needs.

<Tip title="Tip">
  **Postman recommends installing the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).** The Postman desktop app offers the full Postman experience, with no limitations when sending requests. You don't need to select an agent when using the Postman desktop app.
</Tip>

## Postman Desktop Agent

The Desktop Agent is an application that runs locally on your computer. It enables API requests to originate in your web browser but get routed through your local machine and network. This enables the Postman web app to bypass the CORS limitations of browsers.

When you [select the Desktop Agent](#select-a-postman-agent-for-requests), you'll be prompted to download the agent if it's not already installed. Click **Download Desktop Agent** to download the agent, or download it from [the Postman Agent page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/postman-agent/). Run the downloaded file to install the agent.

<Tip title="Tip">
  Postman recommends you [use the latest version](#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.
</Tip>

You can use the Desktop Agent to send all types of API requests supported by Postman, including HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.IO, gRPC, MQTT, and GraphQL requests.

<Note title="Note">
  The Postman Desktop Agent doesn't support the Safari web browser. Use a different web browser or agent instead.
</Note>

### Update the Postman Desktop Agent

Postman recommends using the latest version of the Desktop Agent to receive the latest changes and improvements in the Postman web app. Download and install the latest version from the Postman web app or your computer's menu bar.

You'll receive an in-app notification in the Postman web app when a new version of the Desktop Agent is available to download. In the notification, click **Update and Restart** to download the latest version and restart the Desktop Agent.

You can also click <img alt="Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Postman Agent** in your computer's menu bar, and then click **Check for Updates** to download the latest version, if available. Click <img alt="Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Postman Agent > Install update & restart** to restart the Desktop Agent.

## Postman Cloud Agent

The Cloud Agent enables API requests to originate in your web browser but get routed through Postman's secure cloud servers. This enables the Postman web app to bypass the CORS limitations of browsers.

You can use the Cloud Agent to send HTTP requests. You can't use the Cloud Agent to send WebSocket, Socket.IO, gRPC, MQTT, or GraphQL requests. Because the Cloud Agent uses Postman's cloud servers, it can't access private or local resources on your network when sending requests.

<Note title="Note">
  Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of requests that can be sent using the Cloud Agent each month. Learn more about [resource usage in Postman](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#cloud-agent-usage).
</Note>

## Postman Interceptor Agent

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **The Postman Interceptor Agent is available with [Postman Free plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) while we gather feedback.** You can [create a free account](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) to try this feature out and [let us know what you think](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues).
</Info>

[Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/) is a browser extension you can use to capture and inspect API traffic in Postman. You can also use Interceptor to send HTTP requests from the Postman web app and avoid the CORS limitations of web browsers. Using the Interceptor Agent is a good option if you want to use Safari, or if you can't install applications (like the Desktop Agent app) on your system.

When you [select the Interceptor Agent](#select-a-postman-agent-for-requests), you'll be prompted to install the agent if it's not already installed. Click **Install Interceptor Agent** to install the agent in your web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge), or refer to the [Postman Interceptor installation instructions](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/#install-interceptor).

You can use the Interceptor Agent to send HTTP requests. You can't use the Interceptor Agent to send WebSocket, Socket.IO, gRPC, MQTT, or GraphQL requests.

The Interceptor Agent doesn't support using [CA, self-signed, or client certificates](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/). If you select the Interceptor Agent, the following [request settings](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-settings/) aren't available:

* Enable SSL certificate verification
* Use server cipher suite during handshake
* Protocols disabled during handshake
* Cipher suite selection

## Postman Browser Agent

You can use the Browser Agent to send HTTP requests. You can't use the Browser Agent to send WebSocket, Socket.IO, gRPC, MQTT, or GraphQL requests. You may experience the CORS limitations of browsers when using the Browser Agent.

## Compare Postman Agents

To have Postman automatically select the best agent for sending requests, turn on **Auto-select**. Or use the following table to help you choose the best agent for your needs:

# About Native Git

Native Git support enables you to locally work on your API project files in Postman. You can load a repo folder containing your API code using the source files stored in your Git-based version control system. Then you can design and develop your APIs directly in Postman using the Postman Collection format you’re familiar with. Leverage Native Git to help keep your collection and project files in sync, then commit your local changes to your version control system’s remote repository.

With Native Git support, you can keep the code and collections in sync by making changes to the collection in the Postman app. Those changes will be reflected in your local files. You can edit the collection directly in your IDE or open the file and edit in Postman. You can also make changes to your local files with Agent Mode or the LLM in your IDE, and keep them in sync with the files in Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Native Git is available in the Postman desktop app on Free plans.&#x20;
</Info>

## Native Git benefits

With Native Git, a developer can work on a feature, like adding a new endpoint or changing the implementation. They can make changes to the code and collections as part of the same development branch. This enables them to develop on features in branches while the rest of the team works on the latest or their own branch.

When their feature is ready, the PRs can contain code and collection changes together. They can be version controlled together.

With the Postman CLI, you can run tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline before merging changes. This is different from monitoring - monitoring is usually post-deployment and can only run one version of tests. Collections stored in a branch can have tests specific to the branch code.

## Connect your Git project to your workspace

To connect your Git project to your workspace, do the following:

1. Open your workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).&#x20;
2. From the Postman sidebar, click <img alt="Folder icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-folder-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Files**.
3. Click **Open Folder**.
4. Open the Git project you want to connect to your workspace. Postman displays your Git project's local files.
5. Click **Connect**. Postman connects your local Git project to your workspace and displays the checked-out branch in the bottom left.

   <img alt="Native Git repo" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/native-git-repo-20251209.jpg" width="280px" />
6. Choose how you’d like to get started:

   * **Setup from Workspace** - Click **Choose Items to Pull** to pull Postman resources from your workspace in the Postman Cloud into your local filesystem. Select any collections, environments, or API specifications you’d like to pull and then click **Pull Selected**.
   * **Create with Agent Mode** - Click **Use Agent Mode** to create a collection in your local filesystem based on your source code. Postman autogenerates a helpful prompt and creates a collection with APIs based on the files in your source code.

1) Commit changes to your remote repository.

You can only connect one folder in your filesystem to a workspace at a time. To open your files in a different workspace, you must disconnect from the workspace your file are connected to. Select **File viewer options > Disconnect from Workspace**.

When you connect to a workspace, Postman automatically adds two directories: `.postman` (hidden) and `postman`. The visible `postman` directory includes subfolders for your collections and environments.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can sync and push local elements to workspaces in the cloud with [the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/). To learn more, see [Sync local elements with workspaces](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#sync-local-elements-with-workspaces).

# Sync your changes across devices

Postman automatically syncs changes across all devices that are linked to your account, including edits, updates, additions, or deletions. As long as you're signed in to Postman, and have an internet connection, your data will sync.

* When you *sign out*, Postman removes your synced data from your local storage.
* When you *sign back in*, Postman restores your data from the cloud.
* When you *reload*, Postman automatically retrieves the most recent version of your data.

You can have up to three devices signed in to your Postman account simultaneously.

## Understanding sync states

Postman indicates the sync state of your workspace with the sync icon in the footer. Hover over the sync icon to see more information about your connection and sync status.

<img alt="Understanding sync states" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/syncing-understanding-sync-states-v9.19.jpg" width="280px" />

* **Offline** means that you aren't connected to the Postman servers. This may mean that your computer isn't connected to the internet.
* **Online** means that you're connected to the Postman servers and your work is either in the process of syncing or is already synced.
* **Error** means there was a syncing error while connecting to Postman. Hover over the sync state icon to see detailed information on the error.

<Note title="Note">
  You may experience sync conflicts between Postman and its servers when you work as part of a team. When this happens and you save an element, Postman will give you the option to either save and overwrite it or cancel the save action. For requests, you'll also have the option to save your version as a new request.
</Note>

## Turn off sync

Some organizations have security guidelines that prevent team members from syncing data to the Postman cloud. In this situation, you can use the [lightweight Postman API Client](/docs/getting-started/basics/using-api-client/). All of your work in the lightweight API Client is stored locally and isn't synced online with Postman.

You can delete data that's already synced to Postman by [deleting your account](/docs/getting-started/account/manage/#delete-your-account). Note that you must [leave all Postman teams](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#leave-a-team) that you're a member of prior to deleting your account.

# Postman installation overview

Postman provides several installation options and enables you to customize your user experience. With a free Postman account, you can securely access your APIs from different machines and collaborate with others on API design. To scale up your API lifecycle, take advantage of paid Postman plans. You can also set up a proxy server as another security barrier.

To learn how to sign up, sign in, and manage your Postman account settings, see [About Postman accounts](/docs/getting-started/account/overview/).

## Manage your Postman installation

You can [install Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) on a number of operating systems including [Windows](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#install-postman-on-windows), [macOS](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#install-postman-on-mac), and [Linux](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#install-postman-on-linux) or use the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app). If you use the Postman web app, for best experience download and install the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent) to take advantage of additional features.

The [Postman Visual Studio Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) enables you to test and collaborate on your APIs directly in the application you use to develop them.

To learn more about updating and troubleshooting your Postman installation, see [Install and update Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) and [Update the Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent).

## System requirements

For a list of Postman's system requirements, see [Postman system requirements](/docs/getting-started/installation/system-requirements/).

## Manage your Postman settings

Postman enables you to customize your user experience by adjusting your Postman theme, shortcuts, add-ons, and other options in the Postman **Settings**. To learn more, see [Customize Postman settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/).

## Manage your Postman profile

  If you're using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Note>

### Install the Postman Desktop Agent

If you're using the Postman web app, Postman recommends downloading and installing the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent), an application that runs locally on your desktop. The Desktop Agent overcomes the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations of browsers and acts as your agent for making API requests from the Postman web app.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends you [use the latest version](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.
</Info>

### Web limitations

The following features require the Postman desktop app and aren't available when using the Postman web app:

* **Find and replace** - The Postman desktop app supports [finding and replacing values in a workspace](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#footer), but this feature isn't available in the Postman web app.
* **Proxy configuration** - The Postman desktop app enables you to [use your system's configured proxy](/docs/getting-started/installation/proxy/) to send API requests or access the internet. In the Postman web app, you can configure a proxy for sending requests but not for connecting to online services.
* **Request and cookie capture** - [Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/) and [the Postman proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-with-proxy/) enable you to capture traffic and syncs cookies from your browser or client apps to the Postman desktop app. It's not possible to use Interceptor or the Postman proxy with the Postman web app.
* **Collection run export** - You can [export the results of a collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/#export-collection-runs) to a JSON file using the Postman desktop app. This feature isn't available in the Postman web app.
* **Performance testing** - You can use the Postman desktop app to [simulate user traffic](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/), so you can observe how your API behaves under load. Performance testing isn't available for the Postman web app.
* **On-premises Git integration** - You must use the Postman desktop app to [connect your API in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-on-prem-git-repo/) to GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server repositories.
* **Postman Vault** - You can use the Postman desktop app to send requests with vault secrets that are stored in your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). If you're using the Postman web app, [use the Desktop or Browser Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#select-a-postman-agent-for-requests) to send requests with vault secrets, depending on which is best suited for your request.
* **Lightweight Postman API Client** - You can use the [lightweight API Client](/docs/getting-started/basics/using-api-client/) to send requests from the Postman desktop app when you aren't signed in to Postman.

## Install the Postman CLI

The Postman CLI is a secure command-line companion for Postman. Run, test, and validate your APIs from the command line to keep quality checks fast and seamless in your workflow.

To learn more about how to install and use the Postman CLI, see [Install the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-installation/).

## Use the Postman VS Code extension

You can use the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) to test and collaborate on your APIs in the same application you're using to develop. With the VS Code extension, you can send API requests, manage collections and environments, troubleshoot requests, and more, directly from VS Code. Learn how to [install the VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/install/).

## Update Postman

To check whether your Postman app is up to date, click <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then click the **Update** tab.

<img alt="Check for updates" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/settings-check-for-updates-desktop-v11.jpg" />

If it's not already up to date, Postman might be waiting for a restart because it has automatically downloaded an update. When you restart Postman, it will install the update (Postman v9.13 and later downloads updates automatically).

* When the **Update** tab says Postman is up to date, you can still check for newer updates. This can happen if Postman went offline after its last update. In this case, click **Check for Updates**.

* When Postman is waiting to install an automatically downloaded update, click **Restart to Install Update**.

## Use Postman behind a firewall

Postman's infrastructure runs on Amazon's AWS platform. If you're operating behind a network firewall, you'll need to allowlist certain domains. There is no fixed IP range to allowlist for Postman. If allowlisting the domains specified in this section is insufficient, refer to the [current AWS IP ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) and allowlist the broad range provided.

To enable users to sign in to Postman with a password, allowlist the `challenges.cloudflare.com` domain.

For the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/), allowlist the following domains:

* `wss://bifrost-extension-global.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-extension-https-global.gw.postman.com`

By default, WebSocket connections use the same ports as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443). Allowlist the following domains for all versions of Postman to make WebSocket connections:

* `*.getpostman.com`
* `*.postman.co`
* `*.pstmn.io`
* `*.postman.com`

<Note title="Note">
  If you're running Postman v10 or later, you must allowlist a further set of domains in addition to the domains listed so far.
</Note>

For the Postman web app v10 and later to make WebSocket connections, allowlist the following domains:

* `https://bifrost-web-polling-v4.gw.postman.co`
* `https://bifrost-web-premium.gw.postman.co`
* `https://bifrost-web-premium.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-web-public-v10.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-web-public-v4.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-web-v10.gw.postman.co`
* `https://bifrost-web-v10.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-web-v4.gw.postman.co`
* `https://bifrost-web-v4.gw.postman.com`

For the Postman desktop app v10 and later to make WebSocket connections, allowlist the following domains:

* `https://bifrost-desktop-polling-v4.getpostman.com`
* `https://bifrost-premium-v10-global.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-premium-v4-global.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-v10-global.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-v4-global.gw.postman.com`

For the Postman desktop app v10 and later to make HTTP connections, allowlist the following domains:

* `https://bifrost-https-v10.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-https-v4.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-premium-https-v10.gw.postman.com`
* `https://bifrost-premium-https-v4.gw.postman.com`

## Troubleshoot your Postman installation

If you encounter any issues installing and running Postman, see the following tips. If these tips don't help, refer to the installation posts on the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/tag/installation/) and create a new post if your issue isn't already covered. You can also contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) for help.

### Update Failed error

If you get an **Update Failed** notification in Postman, you can [use the DevTools console](/docs/introduction/troubleshooting-inapp/#accessing-the-devtools-console) to investigate. To open the DevTools console, click **View > Developer > Show DevTools (Current View)**.

![Failed update notification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/update-error-dialog.jpg)

Here are some common error messages:

* `Cannot update while running on a read-only volume`
  * This means that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example `/Applications` on macOS or `home` on Linux.

* `EACCES: permission denied, open '/opt/Postman/Postman-1620288011421.tar.gz`
  * This means that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example `home` on Linux.

* `Code signature at URL file:///... did not pass validation: code object is not signed at all`
  * This means that multiple updates are running at the same time. This can happen if you open the app when one update is about to install itself but another update hasn't finished yet. To resolve the problem, quit and reopen the app.

### Update not available

If you used the Ubuntu Software Center or Snap store to install Postman on Linux, you might not have the **Check for Updates** option in **Settings > Update**. This is because the updates are handled by the store, which automatically updates Postman on a regular cadence.

### Helper tool dialog

If you're using Postman for macOS, you may receive the "An update is ready to install. Postman is trying to add a new helper tool." dialog:

<img alt="Helper tool dialog popup" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/helper-tool-dialog.png" width="280px" />

This message indicates that the `~/Applications/Postman.app` file is owned by the `root` user instead of your user account. This can interfere with the auto-update process.

To resolve the issue, do the following:

1. Ensure that you grant Full Disk Access to your terminal app. You can check this by going to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access**.

2. Turn on Full Disk Access for your terminal app and quit Postman.

3. Change ownership to your user account using the following command:

   ```sh
   sudo chown -R "$USER":staff /Applications/Postman.app
   ```

4. Restart Postman.


# Customize Postman settings

Postman automatically chooses default values for some settings so you can get right to work. Make changes to settings at any time based on your use case or to customize your Postman experience.

To change settings in Postman, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and then click **Settings**. In the Postman desktop app, you can also click **⌘+Comma (,)** or **Ctrl+Comma (,)**.

## General

Use the settings on the **General** tab to configure how Postman sends requests or to customize the Postman user interface.

![General settings](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/settings-detail-v11.74.png)

### Request

* **HTTP Version** - Select the HTTP version to use when you send requests. This enables you to test and debug requests by HTTP version. You can also specify the HTTP version for an individual request. Learn more about [specifying an HTTP version](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-by-http-version).
* **Request Timeout** - Enter how long (in milliseconds) Postman will wait for a response before timing out. If you enter **0**, Postman will wait for a response forever.
* **Max response size** - Enter the largest response size (in megabytes) that Postman will download. For responses that exceed this limit, Postman asks if you want to increase the size limit or download the response. If you enter **0**, Postman downloads responses of any size. Rendering large responses may affect Postman's performance.
* **SSL certificate verification** - Turn this off to prevent Postman from checking the validity of SSL certificates when making requests.
* **SSL/TLS key log** - Turn this on to enable SSL/TLS session key logging for debugging encrypted connections. You can export a SSLKEYLOGFILE and use it to decrypt secure traffic locally for inspection with tools like Wireshark.
* **Disable cookies** - Turn this off to stop using the [Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/).
* **Request validation** - When this is turned on, Postman automatically validates requests in collections linked to an API. Postman compares requests to the API definition and alerts you to any inconsistencies. Learn more about [validating requests and responses](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/).

- **Response format detection** - By default, Postman automatically detects the correct media type for the response body based on the `Content-Type` header. Select **JSON** to always use JSON rendering for the response body.

### Working directory

When you send a form-data or binary file with a request body, Postman saves a path to the test file as part of the collection. The file path is relative to your working directory. On macOS and Linux, you can find the default working directory at `~/Postman/files`. On Windows, you can find the default working directory at `%userprofile%\Postman\files` (File Explorer and Command Prompt) or `~/Postman/files` (PowerShell). To use a different working directory, click **Choose** and then select the directory you want to use.

Storing files in your working directory ensures that requests in shared collections always work. As long as you and your teammates use the same files and working directory location, shared requests will run across everyone's systems. Learn more about [sending body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/).

![Working directory settings](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/working-directory-web-v11.74.png)

**To make collaboration easier, upload test data files to your Postman team.** You can used files uploaded to your team as form data or binary data when sending a request. If you share the request in a workspace, other team members can send the shared request without needing to copy the files to their local working directory. Learn more about [uploading files for shared requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/).

**You can't change the working directory in the Postman web app.** When you send a file with a request, the Postman web app creates a new folder with a random name in the `~/Postman/files` directory. Postman stores a copy of the file in the new folder so you can use it when sending requests. To automatically sync files from the Postman web app with your local working directory, make sure you are using the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you choose a different working directory than `~/Postman/files` for the Postman desktop app, you will still be able to work between the Postman desktop app and the Postman web app by taking the following steps:

  * To access a file from the Postman desktop app using the web app, copy it from the desktop app's working directory into `~/Postman/files` so the web app has access to it.
  * To access a file from the Postman web app using the desktop app, find the file in `~/Postman/files`. When you add a file to a request using the web app, it creates a folder with a random name in `~/Postman/files`. Copy this folder into your desktop app's working directory so the desktop app has access to it.
  * If you're sharing a request with others, each team member must have the files present in the correct working directory. If one team member adds a file to a request using the Postman web app, they need to share the folder and file that's created with everyone who wants to use the request, and this folder must be copied to each team member's working directory.
  * Instead of copying files to your local system, you can upload test data files to your Postman team to make collaboration easier. All team members can use the uploaded files to send requests without needing to place the files in their working directory. Learn more about [uploading files for shared requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/).
</Info>

**The working directory is also used by Newman.** Store files you want to use with Newman in the working directory path saved in the collection. Learn more about [file uploads in Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-file-uploads/).

**Use caution with files located outside your working directory.** To use files located outside your working directory when sending requests, turn on **Read files outside working directory**. This option gives third-party collections the ability to read any file on your system. Use caution, and make sure you trust all third-party collections you are using before enabling this option.

### Headers

* **Send no-cache header** - (Recommended) Turn this on to send a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header with each request. The `no-cache` directive forces the server to revalidate each request and ensures you get an up-to-date (not stale) response.
* **Send Postman Token header** - (Recommended) Turn this on to send a random Postman token with an XMLHttpRequest. Sending a random token ensures the receiving server handles one request at a time, even when the requests send with the same parameters. The token can also aid debugging and help you distinguish between requests on the server side.
* **Retain headers when clicking on links** - When you click a link in a response, Postman creates a new `GET` request with the link URL. Turn this on to keep the headers from the earlier request in the new request. Retaining headers is useful if you mainly access protected resources.
* **Automatically follow redirects** - Turn this off to prevent requests that return a 3xx series response from automatically redirecting.

### User interface

* **Remove tabs** - *(Postman web app)* Use tabs in your browser to navigate Postman instead of in-app tabs. For more information, see [Browser tabs in the Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#browser-tabs-in-the-postman-web-app).
* **Always open sidebar item in new tab** - By default, when you click a sidebar item, Postman opens it in the preview tab. Turn this on to always open sidebar items in a new tab.
* **Always ask when closing unsaved tabs** - By default, Postman asks if you want to save any unsaved changes when closing a tab. Turn this off to always discard unsaved changes when closing a tab.
* **Show icons with tab names** - Turn this off to hide the icons that appear next to tab names.
* **Two-pane view** - By default, Postman displays responses below requests. Turn this on to display the response and request panes side by side.

- **Variable autocomplete** - Turn this on to enable autocomplete when typing variable names.
- **Default documentation editor** - Select the default editor you want to use for [editing documentation descriptions](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) in Postman (**Postman editor** or **Markdown editor**).

### Editor settings

**Editor** settings affect code-related text such as request and response bodies, pre-request scripts, and tests. To revert to default text settings, click **Reset**.

* **Font family** - Enter one or more font family names separated by commas. Postman uses the first available font family to display code text.
* **Font size** - Enter the font size in pixels to use for code text.
* **Indentation count** - Enter the number of indentation characters to use for each code level.
* **Indentation type** - Select the indentation character type to use (**Space** or **Tab**).
* **Auto close brackets** - Turn this on to automatically add a closing bracket when you enter an opening bracket.
* **Auto close quotes** - Turn this on to automatically add a closing quotation mark when you enter an opening quotation mark.

# Configure Postman to use a proxy server

A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client application (like Postman) and the destination server that the client is communicating with (like an API). The proxy server acts as a security barrier, making requests on your behalf to websites and other internet resources, and preventing others from accessing your internal network.

<img alt="Standard web proxy" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/proxy-standard-flow.jpg" />

By default, the Postman desktop app uses your system's configured proxy to send API requests or access the internet. If needed, you can enter authentication details for the [default proxy](#configuring-the-default-proxy) in the Postman desktop app. You can also configure Postman to use the [system proxy](#using-the-system-proxy-for-requests) or a [custom proxy](#using-a-custom-proxy-for-requests) when sending requests. If you haven't already, [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to get started.

<Note title="Note">
  The steps below show how to configure Postman to use a proxy server when sending requests or accessing online resources. If you want to configure Postman's built-in proxy to capture API requests, see [Capturing request data overview](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-overview/).
</Note>

## Configuring the default proxy

If you've configured a proxy for your local system, the Postman desktop app uses this proxy by default to send API requests or access any online resources. Learn more about [adding a proxy to your operating system](#i-cant-send-a-request-and-my-network-requires-a-proxy).

<Note title="Note">
  You can't configure the default proxy in the Postman web app. Instead, use the [system proxy](#using-the-system-proxy-for-requests) or a [custom proxy](#using-a-custom-proxy-for-requests) for sending requests.
</Note>

If the proxy server configured for your system requires basic authentication, add the credentials to the Postman desktop app.

To configure the default proxy, do the following:

1. In the Postman desktop app, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and click **Settings**.
2. Click the **Proxy** tab.
3. Under **Default proxy configuration**, select the checkbox next to **This proxy requires authentication**.
4. Enter the **Username** and **Password** required by the proxy server.
5. Click **Save and Restart Postman**.

<img alt="Default proxy" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/proxy-default-v11-48.jpg" />

## Using the system proxy for requests

If you've configured an HTTP or SOCKS proxy for your local system, Postman can use this proxy to send API requests. Learn more about [adding a proxy to your operating system](#i-cant-send-a-request-and-my-network-requires-a-proxy).

<Note title="Note">
  Postman only supports sending HTTP and HTTPS requests through a SOCKS proxy.
</Note>

To configure Postman to use the system proxy, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and click **Settings**.
2. Click the **Proxy** tab.
3. Under **Proxy configurations for sending requests**, turn on the toggle next to **Use system proxy**.
4. (Optional) Turn on the toggle if you want Postman to use the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables configured for your operating system.

<Note title="Note">
  Make sure the **Use custom proxy configuration** toggle isn't turned on. If both the system proxy and custom proxy options are enabled, Postman will use the custom proxy.
</Note>

<img alt="System proxy" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/proxy-system-v11-48.jpg" />

## Using a custom proxy for requests

Configure a custom proxy to send API requests using a proxy server other than your system proxy. You can send HTTP requests, HTTPS requests, or both types of requests through the custom proxy. You can also configure an HTTP or SOCKS proxy server for sending requests.

To configure Postman to use a custom proxy, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and click **Settings**.
2. Click the **Proxy** tab.
3. Under **Proxy configurations for sending requests**, turn on the toggle next to **Use custom proxy configuration**.
4. Enter information about the custom proxy:

   * **Use proxy for** - Select the type of requests you want to send through the proxy server. Both **HTTP** and **HTTPS** are selected by default.

   * **Proxy server** - Select the HTTP or SOCKS protocol for the proxy server from the dropdown list. Postman supports HTTP, SOCKS5, SOCKS5H, SOCKS4, and SOCKS4A protocols. Then enter the hostname or IP address of the proxy server and the port number. (Don't include the protocol before the hostname or IP address.)

     <Info class="iconless-callout">
       Postman only supports sending HTTP and HTTPS requests through a SOCKS proxy.
     </Info>

   * **Proxy auth** - Turn on this toggle if the proxy server requires basic authentication. Enter the **Username** and **Password** for the proxy server.

   * **Proxy bypass** - Enter a comma-separated list of hosts. Requests sent to these hosts won't use the custom proxy.

<img alt="Custom proxy" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/proxy-custom-v11-56.jpg" />

## Troubleshooting proxy configurations

If you're having problems sending requests from Postman, see the topics below for help resolving the issue.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more help with configuration and request issues, see [Troubleshooting requests](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/).
</Info>

### I can't send a request and my network requires a proxy

Enable the [system proxy option](#using-the-system-proxy-for-requests) in Postman and make sure the proxy is configured for your operating system.

* **Windows** - Open **Settings**, click **Network & Internet**, and click **Proxy**. Under **Manual proxy setup**, turn on the toggle. Enter the proxy address and port, and then click **Save**.

* **macOS** - Open **System Preferences** and click **Network**. Click your active network connection, click **Advanced**, and click the **Proxies** tab. Click **Web Proxy (HTTP)** or **SOCKS proxy** and enter the proxy address and port. You can also enter the username and password if needed. Click **OK** and then click **Apply**.

* **Linux** - (These steps may vary depending on your Linux distribution.) Open **Settings**, click **Network**, and turn on the **Network Proxy** option. Click **Automatic** or **Manual**, and then enter the configuration settings for your proxy.

### I can't send a request and my network doesn't require a proxy

In Postman, make sure both the system proxy and custom proxy are turned off.

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and click **Settings**.
2. Click the **Proxy** tab.
3. Clear the **Use system proxy** and **Use custom proxy configuration** checkboxes.

If you still can't send requests, the problem might be due to environment variables configured for your operating system. If there are environment variables, Postman will use the system proxy and ignore the proxy settings in Postman. Do one of the following:

* Remove the environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` from your shell profile or operating system configuration.
* Create a file using the code for your operating system. Run the file to open the Postman desktop app without any of the proxy environment variables set.

  * **Windows** - Create a `postman.bat` file with the following code:

    ```shell
    set HTTP_PROXY=''
    set HTTPS_PROXY=''
    set http_proxy=''
    set https_proxy=''
    start C:\path\to\Postman.exe
    ```

  * **macOS or Linux** - Create a `postman.sh` file with the following code:

    ```shell
    http_proxy=''
    https_proxy=''
    HTTP_PROXY=''
    HTTPS_PROXY=''
    /path/to/postman
    ```

### The proxy on my system requires basic authentication

Make sure to [configure basic authentication](#configuring-the-default-proxy) for the default proxy in the Postman desktop app.

You can also start Postman with the appropriate environment variables. Create a file using the code for your operating system. Run the file to open the Postman desktop app using your proxy configuration.

* **Windows** - Create a `postman.bat` file with the following code:

  ```shell
  set HTTP_PROXY=http://USER:PASS@host:port
  set HTTPS_PROXY=https://USER:PASS@host:port
  start C:\path\to\Postman.exe
  ```

* **macOS or Linux** - Create a `postman.sh` file with the following code:

  ```shell
  HTTP_PROXY=http://USER:PASS@host:port
  HTTPS_PROXY=https://USER:PASS@host:port /path/to/postman
  ```

### Convert Postman collections from v1 to v2

Postman no longer supports the collection v1 format and will return an error if you import a collection in this format. You can convert your collection's format from v1 to v2 to import it into Postman.

To convert your collection's format from v1 to v2, do the following:

1. In your terminal, enter the following command to install the Postman Collection Transformer.

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g postman-collection-transformer
   ```

2. Convert an individual Postman Collection from v1 to v2 by entering this command:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -i <path to the input Postman Collection file> -o <path to the downloaded Postman file> -j 1.0.0 -p 2.0.0 -P
   ```

The resulting collection is written to your target file path in v2 format.

You can retrieve a list of `convert` options by running the command with the `-h` option:

```bash
postman-collection-transformer convert -h
```

<Note title="Note">
  Go to the [Postman Collection Transformer](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection-transformer) for more information about collection conversion.

# Send API requests and get response data in Postman

Whether you're building or testing your own API, or integrating with a third-party API, you can send requests in Postman to connect to APIs you're working with. Your requests can retrieve, add, or delete data, and can send parameters and authorization details.

For example, if you're building a client application (such as a mobile or web app) for a store, you might send one request to retrieve the list of available products, another request to create a new order (including the selected product details), and yet another request to log a customer in to their account.

When you send a request, Postman displays the response received from the API server in a way that lets you examine, visualize, and troubleshoot it.

<img alt="Request builder with a successful response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-request-builder-v11-35-4.jpg" />

## Get started sending requests

If you've never sent a request before, check out [sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/) before you continue.

View the following topics to get started sending API requests in Postman:

# Create and send API requests in Postman

You can use the Postman API client to connect to APIs you're building, testing, or integrating with. Build and send API requests with parameters, body data, and headers. Save your requests in collections so you can collaborate on them with your team or use them in automated testing.

## Build API requests in Postman

Use Postman to [create and send API requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/) using HTTP or other common protocols such GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSocket. You can [send parameters and body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) with your requests, and [send request headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/), as required by your API. You can also [configure custom settings for each request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-settings/).

## Upload test data to your team

Postman enables you to share your test data with others on your Postman team. You can [upload data files to your team](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/), and anyone on your team can use the uploaded files as form data or raw body data when sending requests in Postman.

## Organize requests with Postman Collections

You can [save and organize your API requests in collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) so you can use them over and over. Use collections to collaborate with your team, generate API tests and documentation, and automate request sending.

## Generate code snippets from requests

Postman can help you integrate your front-end application with your API. Choose a supported language—like Postman CLI, C#, JavaScript, and NodeJS—and [generate a code snippet from a request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/). You can use the snippet in your app to make calls to your API.


# Send a request with the Postman API client

Postman supports sending requests using HTTP, [GraphQL](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-overview/), [gRPC](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-client-overview/), [WebSocket](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/websocket-overview/), [MQTT](/docs/sending-requests/mqtt-client/mqtt-client-overview/), and [SOAP](/docs/sending-requests/soap/making-soap-requests/) protocols. Postman also supports AI-driven development with [AI requests in collections](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/overview/) and [AI Request blocks in Postman Flows](/docs/postman-ai/ai-request-blocks/overview/). You can also use Postman as your Model Context Protocol (MCP) client and [send requests to MCP servers](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/overview/).

Start a new request by specifying the request type, then fill the details and test the request by clicking **Send**. After you save the request, you can share it with your team. You can also refer to [requests from publicly maintained workspaces](#leverage-public-api-examples) for the APIs you're testing and integrating with.

<Info>
  This topic primarily covers creating and sharing HTTP requests. For more detail about sending requests using other protocols, follow the respective links above.
</Info>

## Create a new request

Your requests can include multiple details determining the data Postman sends to the API you're working with. Depending on the type of request, enter a URL and select a method (HTTP, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, Socket.IO, or MQTT request) or select a model (AI request) or enter a command (MCP request), then specify other details.

You can create a new request from a workspace by clicking **New** and selecting the request type.

<img alt="Create new request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-http-v11-1.jpg" />

Alternatively, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add** next to an open tab.

You can switch your request type by clicking the request icon next to the request name.

<img alt="Switch request type" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/switch-request-type-v11.51.png" width="280px" />

To open an HTTP request quickly, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add request** from a collection in the sidebar.

<img alt="Add a request from a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/add-request-from-collection-v11.51.png" />

Click **Save** to save your request. You can give your request a name and description, and choose or create a [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) to save it in.

You can also specify values such as authorization, parameters and body data, and headers.

To test sending a request in Postman, set the URL to the [Postman Echo](/docs/developer/echo-api/) `https://postman-echo.com/get` endpoint, select the GET method, then click **Send**.

<img alt="New Request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/empty-request-v11-2.jpg" />

<Info>
  You can turn on autosave to automatically save your changes to requests. Learn more about 

  [autosave](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#application)

  .
</Info>

### Specify request URLs

Most requests you send in Postman require a URL that represents the API endpoint you're working with. Each operation you can perform using an API is typically associated with an endpoint. Each endpoint in an API is available at a specific URL. This is what you enter into Postman to access the API.

* If you're building an API, the URL is typically the base location plus path. For example, in the `https://postman-echo.com/get` request, `https://postman-echo.com` is the base URL, and `/get` is the endpoint path.
* If you’re using a public API, your API provider supplies the URLs you need, often located in their developer documentation.

As you start typing in the URL box, Postman displays a dropdown list of requests you've used before in your current workspace. The dropdown list also includes requests used in collections in your current workspace. Choose a request from the list of suggestions to autofill your request with details, such as parameters and authorizations.

If you're using a public API from a [verified team](/docs/postman-api-network/explore/consume/#choose-public-elements), suggestions display in the URL box after you enter the base URL, such as `https://api.getpostman.com`. You can click a suggested endpoint to autofill your request with a template of what you need to get started, such as parameters and authorization. Your request may autofill with an empty variable if the API publisher didn't define a value for the variable. Learn how to [set a value for an empty variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope).

![Auto-suggest public API endpoints](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/auto-suggest-public-api-v11-43.jpg)

<Info>
  Postman automatically adds 

  `http://`

   to the start of your URL if you don't specify a protocol.
</Info>

You can optionally enter *query* parameters in the URL box or enter them in the **Params** tab. If your request uses *path* parameters, you can enter them in the URL box. Learn more about [sending parameters and body data with API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/).

<Info>
  You can use 

  [next generation URL encoding](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-settings/#encode-your-request-urls)

   in your requests.
</Info>

### Select request methods

By default, Postman selects the GET method for new request. GET methods typically retrieve data from an API. You can use a variety of other methods to send data to your APIs, including:

* **POST** - Add new data.
* **PUT** - Replace existing data.
* **PATCH** - Update existing data fields.
* **DELETE** - Delete existing data.

For example, if you're working with an API for a to-do list application, you might use a GET method to get the current list of tasks. You can then use a POST method to create a new task or use a PUT or PATCH method to edit an existing task.

Postman supports a number of extra request methods by default, and you can use custom methods. Click the method dropdown list, edit the method name text, and save your new method. To delete a method, hover over it in the list and click the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" />.

The same location (sometimes called *route*) can provide more than one endpoint by accepting different methods. For example, an API might have a POST `/customer` endpoint for adding a new customer, and a GET `/customer` endpoint for retrieving an existing customer.

## Send a request

After you specify the request protocol, method, and URL, add any other details required by the API you're sending the request to:

* Specify any [parameters and body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) or request [headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/) you need to send with the request.
* Set up any required [authentication and authorization](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/).
* You can also [use cookies with your requests](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) by clicking **Cookies** (under **Send**).

After you enter all the request details, click **Send** to send the request to the API server. You can view the response from the server in the response pane. There you can use several tools to help you understand the response, like [search specific phrases](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/#search) or [filter relevant information](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/#filter) with JSONPath and XPath. Learn more about [API response structure in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/).

You can view requests you've sent in **History** in the sidebar and send them again. You can also save and organize requests in a [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/).

<img alt="Send a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/send-first-request-v11-35-4.jpg" />

## Reuse your requests

To avoid duplication of work, you can construct collections with reusable requests from other collections in the workspace.

To reuse a request, do the following:

1. From the request, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the request, then select **Copy**.
2. In the new collection, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the request, then select **Paste > Paste** or **Paste > Paste linked copy**.

<Note>
  You can also use 

  **⌘+Drag**

   or 

  **Ctrl+Drag**

   to reuse a request as a copy.
</Note>

To maintain the API blueprint and permissions from the source, a linked copy isn't editable, but you can fill it with different environments/variables during runtime execution.

## Share your requests

To share requests with collaborators, do the following:

1. From the request, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the request, then select **Share**.
2. Add users and configure their access.
3. (Optional) Select an environment to include with the request.
4. Click **Invite**.

   <img alt="Share request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/share-request-v11.75.png" />

You can also copy a link to the request and share it. Learn more about [sharing your work in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/).

## Leverage public API examples

To help you get started faster, as you create requests, Postman searches the [Postman API Network](http://postman.com/explore) in the background for related content from popular collections and from collections owned by verified teams. If you're testing and integrating with public APIs and their relevant content is found, it shows up in the **Related requests** tab in the right sidebar.

For example, suppose you're testing an integration with Notion. Notion is a verified team, so you know you can trust their content.

1. Enter `api.notion.com/search` in the URL box. A dot appears next to <img alt="Request icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-request-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Related requests**.

   <img alt="Trigger related requests" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/related-requests-trigger-v11-14.jpg" />

2. Click <img alt="Related requests icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icon-related-request.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> **Related requests**. A pane opens displaying Notion's example search-related requests with links to the API collections.

   <img alt="Open related requests" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/related-requests-open-v11-14.jpg" />

You can view related documentation and example responses in place without navigating to a different page or window. You can also fork a collection and use it in your own workspace to test and reuse requests.


# Send parameters and body data with API requests in Postman

The Postman API client enables you to send data along with your HTTP requests. You can add query and path parameters to a request and specify their values. You can also add body data to a request in various formats, including form data, URL-encoded, raw, and binary.

## Send request parameters

You can specify path and query parameters for a request using the URL box or the **Params** tab.

* Query parameters are appended to the end of the request URL, following `?` and listed in key-value pairs, separated by `&` as follows: `?id=1&type=new`
* Path parameters form part of the request URL, and are referenced using placeholders preceded by `:` as in the following example: `/customer/:id`

To specify a query parameter, add it directly to the URL or select the **Params** tab and enter the name and value. When you enter your query parameters in either the URL or the **Params** tab, these values will update everywhere they're used in Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Parameters aren't automatically URL-encoded. Right-click selected text, and choose **EncodeURIComponent** to manually encode a parameter value.
</Info>

To specify a path parameter, enter the parameter name into the URL box, after a colon, for example `:id`. When you enter a path parameter, Postman will populate it in the **Params** tab, where you can also edit it.

You can add descriptions to your parameters and they'll appear for anyone sharing the request (for example in your workspace) or viewing your API documentation.

When you're done entering parameters, select **Send** to send the request. Learn more about [creating and sending requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

![Path parameter](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/path-param-v11-2.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the **Bulk Edit** option if you prefer to enter your parameters in plain text instead of using the request builder.
</Info>

## Send body data with requests

You need to send body data with requests whenever you want to add or update structured data. For example, if you're sending a request to add a new customer to a database, you might include the customer details in JSON. Typically you use body data with `PUT`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests.

The **Body** tab enables you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send different types of body data to suit your API.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're sending body data, make sure you have the correct [headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/) selected to indicate the content type your API may need to process the received data.

  * For `form-data` and `urlencoded` body types, Postman will automatically attach the correct `Content-Type` header.
  * If you use raw mode for your body data, Postman will set a header based on the type you select (such as text or json).
  * If you manually select a `Content-Type` header, that value will take precedence over what Postman sets.
  * Postman doesn't set any header type for the binary body type.
</Info>

By default, Postman will select **None** for body data. Leave it selected if you don't need to send a body with your request. Otherwise, choose the data type you need for your request body: [form data](#form-data), [URL-encoded](#url-encoded), [raw](#raw-data), [binary](#binary-data), or [GraphQL](#graphql).

When you're done entering body data, select **Send** to send the request. Learn more about [creating and sending requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

### Form data

Website forms often send data to APIs as `multipart/form-data`. You can replicate this in Postman using the `form-data` option in the **Body** tab of your request. Form data enables you to send key-value pairs and specify the content type.

You can also attach a file using form data and send it with your request. Select **File** in the dropdown list next to a key name, then select the file you want to send. You can select a file from your local system, and Postman saves the file path in the request. The saved file path is relative to your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory).

You can also upload a file with test data to your Postman team. This is useful if you want to share the request with others on your team or use the request in a monitor or scheduled collection run. Learn more about [uploading files for shared requests and cloud runs](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/).

![Add form data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/request-form-data-v11-2.jpg)

### URL-encoded

URL-encoded data uses the same encoding as URL parameters. If your API requires url-encoded data, select `x-www-form-urlencoded` in the **Body** tab of your request. Enter your key-value pairs to send with the request and Postman will encode them before sending.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  There is sometimes confusion between form data and URL-encoded. If you are unsure which one you need, check with your API provider.
</Info>

### Raw data

You can use raw body data to send anything you can enter as text. In the **Body** tab of your request, select the **raw** option and use the dropdown list to indicate the format of your data (**Text**, **JavaScript**, **JSON**, **HTML**, or **XML**). Postman will enable syntax-highlighting and appending the relevant headers to your request.

<img alt="Body JSON" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/body-raw-data-v11-2.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can [set a content type header manually](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/) if you need to override the one Postman sends automatically.
</Info>

You can use [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) in your body data, and Postman populates their values when sending your request. You can use [vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) in your body data with the `{{vault:secret-name}}` syntax.

In your body data, you can also use [variables without a scope](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope) and [vault secrets without adding them to your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#set-a-value-for-a-vault-secret-that-doesnt-exist). These enable you to try out a value to make sure it works as expected. If you'd like, you can [add the variable to a scope](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#adding-variables-to-a-scope) or [add the vault secret to your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#add-a-vault-secret-reference-to-your-postman-vault).

For JSON raw body data, you can add comments, and they will be stripped out when the request is sent. Single-line comments delimited with `//` and multi-line comments delimited with `/* */` will be removed in the request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To beautify your XML or JSON, select the text in the editor and then select **⌘+Option+B** or **Ctrl+Alt+B**.
</Info>

### Binary data

You can use binary data to send information you can't enter manually in the Postman editor with your request body, such as image, audio, and video files. (You can also send text files.)

In the **Body** tab of your request, select the **binary** option, then select the file you want to send with the request. You can select a file from your local system, and Postman saves the file path in the request. The saved file path is relative to your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory).

You can also upload a file with test data to your Postman team. This is useful if you want to share the request with others on your team or use the request in a monitor or scheduled collection run. Learn more about [uploading files for shared requests and cloud runs](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/).

![Add binary data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/request-binary-data-v11-2.jpg)

### GraphQL

You can send GraphQL queries with your Postman requests by selecting the **GraphQL** option in the **Body** tab of your request. Enter your code in the **Query** pane and any variables in the **GraphQL Variables** pane.

Check out [GraphQL in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-overview/) for more information on GraphQL, including how to enable **Autocomplete** powered by Postman API schemas.


# Configure headers for API requests in Postman

Some APIs require you to send particular headers with requests to provide metadata about the operation you're performing. You can configure request headers in Postman, and save groups of headers as presets for quick access. Postman also automatically adds headers to your requests as needed depending on your request selections.

## Configure request headers

You can configure headers in the **Headers** tab of your request. Enter any key-value pairs you need and Postman will send them along with your request. As you enter text, Postman prompts you with common options you can use to autocomplete your setup, such as `Content-Type`.

When you're done configuring headers, select **Send** to send the request. Learn more about [creating and sending requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

![Header types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/presets-v11-2.jpg)

## Header presets

You can save commonly used headers together in a *header preset*. In the **Headers** tab of your request, select the **Presets** dropdown list and choose **Manage Presets**. Select **Add Header Preset** to add a new preset, and enter a name for the preset. Enter key-value pairs, then select **Add**.

You can select your preset in the **Presets** dropdown list. Selecting the preset will autopopulate the fields in your request headers.

![Header presets](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/header-presets-v11-2.jpg)

## Autogenerated headers

Postman will automatically add certain headers to your requests based on your request selections and settings. Select **hidden** at the top of your request's **Headers** tab for information about what Postman will send with your request.

<img alt="Hidden headers" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/hidden-headers-button-v11.jpg" />

Hover over a header to view details about it. Postman will indicate why the header has been added. The details will also indicate how to deactivate or override a header value if you need to.

<img alt="Host header" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-host-header-v9.jpg" />

You can make changes to a header in the **Authorization** tab, the request **Body**, **Cookies** for the request domain, the **Settings**, and in some cases in the **Headers** tab itself. If you need to go to a different part of the app, Postman will show a link on the right-hand side.

If a header has been added based on your auth setup, [select the **Authorization** tab](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/) to change it. To alter cookie headers, [change the cookie setup](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) for the domain you're sending the request to.

![Token header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/headers-added-v11.jpg)

To deactivate an autogenerated header in the **Headers** tab, clear its checkbox. To override an autogenerated header value, clear the checkbox next to the autogenerated entry. Then add a separate entry for the header, listing its name in the **Key** field and specifying your value in the **Value** field.

If you have more than one entry for the same header, Postman indicates which one will be overridden. Postman prioritizes headers you have either explicitly added in **Headers** or indirectly with selections you made in the other parts of your request such as **Authorization**.

For `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers, Postman will automatically calculate values when you send your request, based on the data in the **Body** tab. However, you can override both values.


# Upload files for shared requests and cloud runs

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Test data storage is available with [Postman Free, Basic, and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To learn more about availability with Enterprise plans, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/).
</Info>

Test data is made up of the data files you use to test various scenarios for your API. Postman provides test data storage, so you can upload data files to your Postman team. Anyone on your team can then use the files when sending API requests.

## About test data storage

You can attach a file with test data to a request as [form data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#form-data) or [binary data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#binary-data). Postman will save the file path relative to your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory) and use the file when sending the request. However, if you share the request in a [workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/), the local file isn't shared. This means other team members won't be able to send the request unless they put a copy of the same file in their own local working directory. Also, a local file won't be available when sending a request from a [monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) or a [scheduled collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/), which run in the Postman cloud and not locally.

To enable sharing requests that use test data files, you can upload the files to your Postman team. Uploaded files are available to all members of your team and can be used to send requests that are shared in a workspace. Uploaded files are also available to requests sent from monitors and scheduled collection runs, and can be used from [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/) and the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) (but not [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)).

## Upload a file to your Postman team

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You must have [Editor access](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) to upload a file for a request in the collection. Files can't be uploaded from scripts.

   ![Upload a test data file](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/test-data-upload-file-v11.jpg)

After uploading the file, other team members can send the request without needing to place a copy of the file in their local working directory. Instead, the request will use the uploaded file. Also, the uploaded file is used if the request is sent from a monitor or a scheduled collection run.

Uploaded files can be used in any requests you or other members of your team create (except in public workspaces). Uploaded files can also be accessed by Postman Flows and the Postman CLI when automating runs. If you fork a collection that uses test data files, you may need to upload any files that haven't been uploaded to your team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited amount of storage space you can use for uploaded test data files. Your plan also gives you a limited number of retrievals of uploaded files. Learn more about [test data usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#test-data-usage).

# Select custom settings for API requests in Postman

You can configure a variety of settings for your API requests in Postman. These settings enable you to customize Postman's behavior when sending a request. For example, you can turn on SSL certificate validation or turn off URL encoding for a request.

## Configure custom request settings

To configure custom settings, select the **Settings** tab of your request. Each setting provides a description of its effect when sending the request.

When you're done configuring settings, click **Send** to send the request. Learn more about [creating and sending requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

## Encode your request URLs

Postman parses and encodes your request's URL to help ensure a successful API call. Postman encodes the characters in the URL and maps them to a representation that your API is expected to accept. The Postman URL processor increases the chances that your request will be handled correctly by many different server types.

The processor encodes characters depending on where they occur in the URL:

| URL component | Characters to encode                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path          | `"` `<` `>` `` ` `` `#` `?` `{` `}` `SPACE`                                     |
| Query         | `"` `#` `&` `'` `<` `=` `>` `SPACE`                                             |
| Userinfo      | `"` `<` `>` `` ` `` `#` `?` `{` `}` `/` `:` `;` `=` `@` `[` `\` `]` `^` `SPACE` |

The processor is turned on by default in Postman, but you can turn off encoding if you're working with an unusual server implementation. To change this setting in your request, select the **Settings** tab, then turn off **Encode URL automatically**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To selectively encode parts of your URL, highlight the text and right-click, then select **EncodeURIComponent**.
</Info>


# Group API requests with Postman Collections

*Postman Collections* enable you to group together your API requests and examples. You can use collections to keep your workspace organized, collaborate with teammates, and generate API documentation and API tests. You can also use collections to automate request runs as part of your API testing efforts.

Select **Collections** in the sidebar to view a list of collections in your current workspace.

![Collections selected in the sidebar](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/search-collections-v11.png)

* To learn more about collections, go to [Organize and automate API requests in Postman Collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/).
* To create and work with collections, go to [Create and manage request collections in Postman](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/).
* To learn how to use the Collection Runner, visit [Test your API functionality](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/).


# Generate code snippets from API requests

Postman can convert an API request into a code snippet. You can then use the generated code snippet in your front-end application to make calls to an API. Postman can generate code snippets for a variety of programming languages and client libraries, including Postman CLI, C#, JavaScript, and NodeJS.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This guide has information about generating code snippets from API requests. For information about generating server-side boilerplate code from an API specification, see [Generate server-side code in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/generating-server-code/).
</Info>

## Generate code snippets in Postman

1. Open the request you want to use for a code snippet, then select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Code** in the right sidebar.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/generate-code-right-sidebar-v11.jpg" width="280px" alt="Open code snippets" />

2. Select a [language or framework](#supported-languages-and-client-libraries) from the dropdown list.

3. Select <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy snippet** to copy the code snippet to your clipboard.

# API authentication and authorization in Postman

Postman enables you to send auth details with your API requests. APIs use authentication and authorization to ensure that client requests access data securely. Authentication involves verifying the identity of the request sender, while authorization confirms that the sender has permission to carry out the endpoint's operation.

If you're building an API, you can choose from a variety of auth models. If you're integrating with a third-party API, the required authorization will be specified by the API provider.

## Authentication in Postman

Some APIs require establishing a client's identity with a digital certificate. You can add your certificate authority (CA) or client certificates to Postman so you can access APIs that require authentication. To learn more, see [Add and manage CA and client certificates in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/).

## Request authorization in Postman

You can pass auth details along with any request you send in Postman. Auth data can be included in the header, body, or in the request's parameters. If you enter your auth details in the request's **Authorization** tab, Postman automatically populates the relevant parts of the request for your selected auth type. You can use variables and collections to store authorization details, enabling you to reuse the same information in multiple places.

See the following topics to learn more about request authorization in Postman:

* Use the **Authorization** tab of a request or collection to select an auth type and complete relevant details. To learn more, go to [Add API authorization details to requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/). For more details on the authorizations type you can use, see [Authorization types supported by Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/).
* When you create a request to a public API with Guided Auth set up, Postman gives you the option to automatically set up authorization. To learn more, see [Set up authorization for public APIs using Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/).
* Some APIs enable you to send authentication details as query parameters. Also, Postman may automatically add headers to your request based on your auth setup. To learn more, see [Send parameters and body data with API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) or [Configure headers for API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/).
* If you have session cookies in your browser, you can sync them to Postman using Postman Interceptor. To learn more, see [Capture traffic from a web browser using Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/) and [Create and capture cookies using Postman's cookie manager](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/).
* If you're having issues getting a request to authenticate and run, review the tips in [Debug API requests using the Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/). If you still have auth problems, check out topics with the [authentication tag](https://community.postman.com/tags/authentication) on the Postman Community forum.


# Add and manage CA and client certificates in Postman

You can add and manage certificates in Postman to enable authentication when sending requests. Certificates added to Postman are stored locally and aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

To connect to an API that uses Mutual TLS (mTLS), you need to add a client certificate to Postman. Mutual TLS is an authentication method that requires both the client and the server to confirm their identity with a certificate. Once the identity of both parties is confirmed, an encrypted connection is established.

You can also add a custom CA certificate to Postman. If an endpoint uses a certificate that's registered with an internal certificate registry, requests sent from Postman will fail with the "SSL Error: Self signed certificate" error message. Adding a custom CA certificate will enable you to send requests to the endpoint without needing to [turn off SSL verification](#troubleshoot-certificate-errors).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using the Postman web app to add and manage certificates, you must use the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent). Postman recommends you [use the latest version](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.
</Info>

## Manage certificates

In the [Postman settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/), you can view installed certificates, add a new certificate, or remove a certificate.

To access settings for certificates, do the following:

1. In the header, select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings**.

2. Select the **Certificates** tab.

   ![Certificates tab](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/certificates-settings-tab-v11-48.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) to manage CA and client certificates.
</Info>

## Add a CA certificate

To avoid "Self signed certificate" errors when sending requests, add your custom CA certificate to Postman.

1. Turn on the **CA certificates** toggle.
2. Select the **PEM file** for your CA certificate. (The PEM file can contain multiple CA certificates.)

   ![Add a CA certificate](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/certificates-add-ca-cert-v11-48.jpg)

## Add a client certificate

To send requests to an API that uses mutual TLS authentication, add your client certificate to Postman.

1. Select **Add Certificate**.

2. Enter the **Host** domain for the certificate (don't include the protocol). For example, enter "postman-echo.com" to send requests to the [Postman Echo API](https://www.postman.com/postman/published-postman-templates/documentation/ae2ja6x/postman-echo).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     The **Host** field supports pattern matching. If you enter "\*.example.com", the same client certificate will be used for all example.com subdomains.
   </Info>

3. (Optional) Enter a custom port number to associate with the domain. If you don't specify a port, Postman uses the default HTTPS port (443).

4. Select the **CRT file** and the **Key file** for your certificate, or select the **PFX file** for your certificate.

5. If you used a **Passphrase** when generating the client certificate, enter it in the box. Otherwise, leave the box blank.

6. Select **Add**.

   ![Add a client certificate](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/certificates-add-client-cert-v11-48.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Each client certificate is specific to a domain. To send requests to more domains, add the appropriate certificate for each domain. Don't add more than one certificate for the same domain. If you add more than one certificate for a domain, Postman will use the last certificate added.
</Info>

### Edit a certificate

You can't edit a certificate after adding it. To make changes, first [remove the certificate](#remove-a-certificate), then generate a new certificate and add it to Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates have a lifetime of 90 days. Let's Encrypt recommends using an [ACME client](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/) to automatically renew your certificate every 60 days.
</Info>

### Remove a certificate

Remove a certificate if you no longer need it to send requests from Postman.

* To remove a CA certificate, select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Remove** next to the certificate.
* To remove a client certificate, select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** next to the certificate.

## Use a certificate

After adding a client certificate, you don't have to perform any extra steps to use the certificate in Postman. When you make an HTTPS request to a specified domain, Postman automatically sends the client certificate with the request. The certificate is sent using OpenSSL handling, and Postman doesn't change the certificate.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman won't send the certificate if you make an HTTP request.
</Info>

### Confirm a certificate was sent

You can confirm that a certificate was sent using the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/). Open the Postman Console by selecting **Console** in the Postman footer, then send a request.

In the example below, Postman sent the certificate because the request used HTTPS. You can expand the request to view details about the certificate that was sent with the request.

![Certificate details in the Console](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/certificates-console-details-v11-30.png)

### View certificate details

You can view more certificate details in the response pane.

# Add API authorization details to requests in Postman

With a request open in Postman, use the **Authorization** tab to select an auth type, then complete the relevant details for your selected type. The correct data values are determined by your API at the server side. If you're using a third-party API, refer to the provider's documentation for any required auth details.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use Guided Auth to set up authentication credentials for supported public APIs. For more information, see [Set up authorization for public APIs using Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/).
</Info>

## Select an authorization type

When you select an auth type from the **Auth Type** dropdown list, Postman indicates which parts of the request your details are included in. For example, the header, body, URL, or query parameters. Postman then adds your auth details to the relevant parts of the request when you select or enter them. This enables you to preview how Postman will send your data before you run the request.

For more details on setting up each type of authorization, see [Authorization types supported by Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/).

![Authorization tab](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/authorization-tab-v11-2.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use these auth types in Postman, in [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/), and in the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
</Info>

## View authorization details

After you select and set up an authorization type, your data appears in the relevant parts of the request. For example, in the **Headers** tab. To view headers that were added automatically, select **hidden**.

<img alt="Hidden headers" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/hidden-headers-button-v11.jpg" />

Hover over a header to get information about where it was added. To change an auth header, return to the **Authorization** tab and update your configuration.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't override headers added by your **Authorization** selections in the **Headers** tab. If you need auth headers that are different from those generated by Postman, change your setup in **Authorization**. You can also remove your auth setup and manually add the headers.
</Info>

Your request auth can use environment, collection, and global [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). Postman doesn't save header data or query parameters to avoid exposing sensitive data, such as API keys.

It's recommended that you use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data as vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud. If you want to share sensitive data with collaborators, you can store it in an environment as a [variable set as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).

You can inspect a raw dump of the entire request including auth data in the Postman Console after you send it.

## Inherit authorization

You can specify auth details in a parent [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) or folder, and reuse the parent's auth details throughout its grouped requests.

When you select **Inherit auth from parent** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list, requests grouped inside a collection or folder inherit the auth details from the parent. This means the grouped requests will use the same auth you specified at the collection or folder level. In each grouped request's **Authorization** tab, you can view the auth details for the parent collection or folder. You can also select **Edit Auth** to open the parent collection or folder to edit its auth details.

To change the auth for an individual request, select a different auth type in the request's **Authorization** tab.


# Set up authorization for public APIs using Guided Auth

An increasing number of public APIs offer Guided Auth in Postman, including Stripe, Open AI, Notion, and Spotify. When you create an HTTP request to an API that supports Guided Auth, Postman automatically recognizes if the API requires authentication. You can then follow steps by API publishers to set up authentication credentials for the public API and store them in your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) as vault secrets.

Once you store your credentials in your Postman Vault, you can then reuse them throughout your local instance of Postman to authenticate with the public API. Only you can access and use values associated with your encrypted vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

## Set up authorization

To get started, do the following:

1. Select the **Authorization** tab of an HTTP request to a public API that uses Guided Auth.

2. Select the **Auth Type** dropdown list, then select one of the authentication options under **Recommended setup**. This enables you to learn which authentication credentials you'll need and where to find them.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/guided-setup-add-credentials-fullscreen-v11-16.jpg" width="280px" alt="Store auth in Postman Vault" />

   Guided Auth supports public APIs that require bearer, basic, API key, or OAuth 2.0 authentication credentials:

   * For APIs that require authentication credentials like tokens or API keys, follow the instructions to get your credentials. Then enter them in the field under **Auth credentials**.
   * For APIs that support OAuth 2.0, select **Authorize** to get your credentials and automatically enter the access token in the field under **Auth credentials**.

3. Click **Store Auth in Vault** to add your credentials to your Postman Vault.

Learn more about [using Guided Auth to add credentials as vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/) in your Postman Vault.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're an API publisher, you can set up Guided Auth for your public APIs in your team dashboard. For more information, see [Set up Guided Auth for public APIs](/docs/publishing-your-api/setting-up-authentication-for-public-apis/).
</Info>


# Authorization types supported by Postman

Postman supports several types of authorization. Select a type from the **Auth Type** dropdown list on the **Authorization** tab of a request. You can choose an authorization type on requests, collections, or folders.

## No auth

Postman won't send authorization details with a request unless you specify an auth type. If your request doesn't require authorization, select the **Authorization** tab, then select **No Auth** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

## API key

With API key auth, you send a key-value pair to the API either in the request headers or query parameters. In the request **Authorization** tab, select **API Key** from the **Auth Type** list. Enter your key name and value, and select either **Header** or **Query Params** from the **Add to** dropdown list. You can store your values in [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/) for extra security.

Postman appends the relevant information to your request **Headers** or the URL query string.

## Bearer token

Bearer tokens enable requests to authenticate using an access key, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT). The token is a cryptic string, included in the request header. In the request **Authorization** tab, select **Bearer Token** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list. In the **Token** field, enter your bearer token value. For added security, store it in a variable and reference the variable by name.

Postman appends the token value to the text `Bearer` in the required format to the request Authorization header as follows:

```shell
Bearer <Your API key>
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you need a custom prefix, use an [API Key](#api-key) with a key named `Authorization`.
</Info>

## JWT bearer

JWT, which stands for JSON Web Token, is an open standard for securely sharing JSON data between parties. The data is encoded and digitally signed, which ensures its authenticity. JWT is widely used in API authentication and authorization workflows, as well as for data transfer between clients and servers.

Postman supports generating JWT bearer tokens to authorize requests. You can enter a payload in an editor, and JWT tokens are generated and added to the request. In the request **Authorization** tab, select **JWT Bearer** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

* **Add JWT token to** - Select **Request Header** or **Query Param** to specify how the JWT token will be added to your request.

* **Algorithm** - Select a signing algorithm to use for the JWT token. Supported algorithms include:

  * **HS** - HMAC with SHA
  * **RS** - RSA (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5) with SHA
  * **ES** - ECDSA with SHA
  * **PS** - RSA (RSASSA-PSS) with SHA

* **Secret** - The secret that's used with the HMAC-SHA algorithm.

* **Secret Base64 encoded** - Select if the secret is encoded in the base-64 format.

* **Private key** - The private key for signing the token for RS, ES, and PS algorithms. Select **Select file** to upload a private key in PKCS #8 format.

* **Payload** - Enter the payload data for your JWT token, in JSON format.

In the **Advanced configuration** section, you can also configure the following items. If you don't configure them, they're generated automatically.

* **Request header prefix** - An optional prefix to use at the start of headers. This header prefix is part of the request and not a part of JWT.
* **JWT headers** - Any custom headers you also want to send in the JWT token. Headers pertaining to the selected algorithm are automatically added.

## Basic auth

Basic authentication involves sending a verified username and password with your request. In the request **Authorization** tab, select **Basic Auth** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

Enter your API username and password in the **Username** and **Password** fields. For extra security, store these in [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/).

In the request **Headers**, the Authorization header passes the API a Base64 encoded string representing your username and password values, appended to the text `Basic` as follows:

```shell
Basic <Base64 encoded username and password>
```


# Authenticate with Digest access authentication in Postman

With Digest auth, the client sends a first request to the API, and the server responds back with details. Response details include a number that can be used only once (a *nonce*), a realm value, and a `401 Unauthorized` response. You then send back an encrypted array of data, including a username and password combined with the data received from the server in the first request. The server uses the passed data to generate an encrypted string and compares it against what you sent to authenticate your request.

In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **Digest Auth** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list. Postman displays fields for both stages of the authentication request. It automatically updates the fields for the second request in the **Advanced configuration** section using data returned from the server by the first request. To enable Postman to automate the flow, enter **Username** and **Password** values (or [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/)) and these are sent with the second request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you don't want Postman to automatically extract the data, select **Yes, disable retrying the request**. If you select this, you'll need to complete the advanced fields and run each request manually.
</Info>

Setting the fields in the **Advanced configuration** section is optional. Postman generates default values in these fields automatically when your first request runs.

* **Realm** - A string specified by the server in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header.
* **Nonce** - A unique string specified by the server in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header.
* **Algorithm** - A string that indicates a pair of algorithms used to produce the digest and a checksum. Postman supports `MD5` and `SHA` algorithms.

- **qop** - The quality of protection applied to the message. The value must be one of the options specified by the server in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header.

* **Nonce Count** - The hexadecimal count of the number of requests (including the current request) that the client has sent with the nonce value in this request.
* **Client Nonce** - An opaque quoted string value provided by the client. This is used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, to provide mutual authentication, and to provide some message integrity protection.
* **Opaque** - A string of data specified by the server in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header, which is used unchanged with URIs in the same protection space.


# Authenticate with OAuth 1.0 authentication in Postman

OAuth 1.0 enables client applications to access data provided by a third-party API. For example, as a user of a service, you can grant another application access to your data with that service without exposing details like your username and password. Accessing user data with OAuth 1.0 involves a few requests back and forth between client application, user, and service provider.

## OAuth 1.0 overview

OAuth 1.0 is sometimes referred to as "two-legged" (auth only between client and server) or "three-legged" (where a client requests data for a user of a third-party service). An example OAuth 1.0 flow could run as follows:

* To request user data with a third-party service, a consumer (client application) requests an access token using credentials such as a key and secret.
* The service provider issues an initial token (that doesn't provide access to user data) and the consumer requests authorization from the user.
* When the user grants auth, the consumer makes a request to exchange the temporary token for an access token, passing verification from the user auth.
* The service provider returns the access token and the consumer can then make requests to the service provider to access the user's data.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman supports [OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/).
</Info>

## Use OAuth 1.0

To use OAuth 1.0, do the following:

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **OAuth 1.0** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

2. Select the **Add authorization to** dropdown list to specify if you want to [pass the auth details](#add-authorization-data) in the request headers, or body and URL.

3. Select a **Signature Method** from the dropdown list that your API uses to authenticate requests. Then enter specific details depending on whether you select an HMAC, PLAINTEXT, or RSA signature method. Learn about the details required for an [HMAC or PLAINTEXT signature](#use-an-hmac-or-plaintext-signature), and an [RSA signature](#use-an-rsa-signature).

4. You can optionally [set advanced details](#advanced-configuration), but Postman will try to generate values for them if necessary.

## Add authorization data

From the **Add authorization to** dropdown list, select whether you want to pass the auth details in the request headers or body. You can open the **Headers** or **Body** tab if you want to check how the details will be included with the request.

If you send the OAuth 1.0 data in the headers, an Authorization header sending your key and secret values is appended to the string `OAuth` together with additional comma-separated required details. Postman will append the OAuth 1.0 information to the request **Headers** when you have completed all required fields in your **Authorization** setup.

If you send the OAuth 1.0 data in the body and URL, the data is added either in the request **Body** or **Parameters** depending on the request method.

If the request method is `POST` or `PUT`, and if the request body type is `x-www-form-urlencoded`, Postman will add the authorization parameters to the request body. Otherwise, for example in a `GET` request, your key and secret data will be passed in the URL query parameters.

## Use an HMAC or PLAINTEXT signature

To use an HMAC or PLAINTEXT signature method, enter the following details:

* **Consumer Key** - A value used to identify a consumer with the service provider.
* **Consumer Secret** - A value used by the consumer to establish ownership of the key.
* **Access Token** - A value representing the consumer's permission to access the user's data.
* **Token Secret** - A value used by the consumer to establish ownership of a given token.

## Use an RSA signature

To use an RSA signature method, enter the following details:

* **Consumer Key** - A value used to identify a consumer with the service provider.
* **Access Token** - A value representing the consumer's permission to access the user's data.
* **Private Key** - A private key to generate the auth signature.

## Advanced configuration

The advanced parameters are as follows:

* **Callback URL** - URL service provider will redirect to following user authorization. (Required if your server uses OAuth 1.0 Revision A.)
* **Verifier** - Verification code from service provider after getting user auth.
* **Time Stamp** - The timestamp the server uses to prevent replay attacks outside the time window.
* **Nonce** - A random string generated by the client.
* **Version** - The version of the OAuth authentication protocol (1.0).
* **Realm** - A string specified by the server in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header.
* **Include body hash** - Hash for integrity check with request bodies *other than* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. (Deactivated when you're using callback URL / verifier.)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your server implementation of OAuth 1.0 requires it, select **Add empty parameters to signature**.

  You can also select the checkbox to **Encode the parameters in the authorization header** for your request.
</Info>


# Authenticate with OAuth 2.0 authentication in Postman

With OAuth 2.0, you first retrieve an access token for the API, then use that token to authenticate future requests. Access tokens are typically short-lived, but the authorization server can also provide a long-lived refresh token. A client application can use the refresh token to automatically [refresh the access token](#refreshing-an-oauth-20-token).

## OAuth 2.0 overview

Accessing data with OAuth 2.0 varies greatly between API service providers, but typically involves a few requests back and forth between client application, user, and API. An example OAuth 2.0 flow could run as follows:

* A client application makes a request for the user to authorize access to their data.
* If the user grants access, the application then requests an access token from the service provider, passing the access grant from the user and authentication details to identify the client.
* The service provider validates these details and returns a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token.
* The client uses the access token to request the user data with the service provider.
* When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to automatically request a new access token.

Scheduled runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support OAuth 2.0 authentication. To use an OAuth 2.0 token with these Postman features, note the following details:

* You must [sync the token](#sharing-an-oauth-20-access-token) in the Postman app to use it with these features.
* These features don't support automatic token refresh, so you may experience an issue when the token expires. To continue using these Postman features after the token expires, [manually refresh the token](#refreshing-an-oauth-20-token) and then [re-sync the token](#sharing-an-oauth-20-access-token) in the Postman app.

## Using OAuth 2.0

To use OAuth 2.0, do the following:

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a collection or request, select **OAuth 2.0** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list. Specify if you want to pass the auth details in the request URL or headers.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     By default, Postman will append the access token to `Bearer` in the Authorization header for your request, but if your server implementation requires a different prefix, you can specify it in the **Header Prefix** field.
   </Info>

2. To request an access token, fill out the fields in the **Configure New Token** section, and select **Get New Access Token**. To use the token with your request or collection, select **Proceed** and then select **Use token**. The details you used to generate the token are saved with your request or collection. You can also [share the token](#sharing-an-oauth-20-access-token) so that others with access to the collection can use the token.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Once you have a token value generated and added, it will appear in the request **Headers**.
   </Info>

3. Enter the details for your client application, and any auth details from the service provider. This allows you to replicate your application auth flow inside Postman to test authenticated requests.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can share token credentials with your team. Turn on the **Share Token** toggle and then select **Sync Token**. By default, Postman won't sync your token in case you don't want to share it.
   </Info>

4. Postman will prompt you to supply specific details depending on the OAuth 2.0 **Grant Type**, which can be an [authorization code](#specifying-an-authorization-code), [PKCE](#specifying-an-authorization-code-with-pkce), [implicit](#using-implicit-grant-type), [password credentials](#using-password-credentials), or [client credentials](#using-client-credentials).

## Specifying an authorization code

Authorization code grant type requires the user to authenticate with the provider—an authorization code is then sent back to the client app, extracted, and exchanged with the provider for an access token to authenticate later requests.

To use authorization code grant type, enter a **Callback URL** for your client application (which needs to be registered with the API provider), together with various details provided by the API service including **Auth URL**, **Access Token URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you are using the Postman desktop app, you can enter your auth details in your web browser instead of in Postman by selecting **Authorize using browser**.
</Info>

## Specifying an authorization code with PKCE

You can use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) with OAuth 2.0. When you select **Authorization Code (With PKCE)**, two more fields will become available for **Code Challenge Method** and **Code Verifier**. You can opt to use `SHA-256` or `Plain` algorithms to generate the code challenge. The verifier is an optional 43-128 character string to connect the authorization request to the token request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Authorization code (With PKCE)** grant type coupled with **Authorize using browser** is recommended to prevent auth code interception attacks.
</Info>

## Using implicit grant type

Implicit grant type returns an access token to the client without requiring the extra auth code step (and is therefore less secure).

To use implicit grant type with your requests in Postman, enter a **Callback URL** you have registered with the API provider, the provider **Auth URL**, and a **Client ID** for the app you have registered.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you are using the Postman desktop app, you can enter your auth details in your web browser instead of in Postman by selecting **Authorize using browser**.
</Info>

## Using password credentials

OAuth 2.0 Password grant type involves sending username and password directly from the client and is therefore not recommended if you're dealing with third-party data.

To use password grant type, enter your API provider's **Access Token URL**, together with the **Username** and **Password**. In some cases you will also need to provide a client ID and secret.

## Using client credentials

Client credentials grant type is typically not used to access user data but instead for data associated with the client application.

Enter the provider's **Access Token URL**, together with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your registered application.

## Requesting an OAuth 2.0 token

The full list of parameters to request a new access token is as follows, depending on your grant type.

Under **Configure New Token**, enter details about the token:

* **Token Name** - The name you want to use for the token.

* **Grant type** - A dropdown list of options. This will depend on the API service provider requirements.

* **Callback URL** - The client application callback URL to redirect to after auth. This must be registered with the API provider. If not provided, Postman will use a default empty URL and try to extract the code or access token from it. If this doesn't work for your API, you can use the following URL: `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback`

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    If you are using the Postman desktop app, you can enter your auth details in your web browser instead of in Postman by selecting **Authorize using browser**. When using the **Authorization Code** or **Implicit** grant type, select this checkbox to set the **Callback URL** to return to Postman. If you opt to authorize using your browser, make sure pop-ups are deactivated for the callback URL, otherwise the option won't work.
  </Info>

* **Auth URL** - The endpoint for the API provider authorization server, to retrieve the auth code.

* **Access Token URL** - The provider's authentication server, to exchange an authorization code for an access token.

* **Client ID** - The ID for your client application registered with the API provider.

* **Client Secret** - The client secret given to you by the API provider.

* **Scope** - The scope of access you are requesting, which may include multiple space-separated values.

* **State** - An opaque value to prevent cross-site request forgery.

* **Client Authentication** - Send a Basic Auth request in the header, or client credentials in the request body. After upgrading to a new version, change the value here to avoid problems with client authentication.

To customize the token, select **Advanced Options**:

* **Refresh Token URL** - The endpoint for the refresh server, to exchange the refresh token for an access token. If empty, the refresh token URL will be the same as the access token URL.
* **Auth Request**, **Token Request**, and **Refresh Request** - Define any custom parameters you want to send with auth requests, token requests, or refresh requests. For each key-value pair you define, select an option to send the parameter in the request body, request URL, or request headers. Keep in mind the following considerations:

  * If you add multiple keys with same key name, they will be sent with the request as an array.
  * If you added resource or audience URIs in an earlier version of Postman, you can import them as custom parameters. Select the **Audience and Resource** tab to review the resources and audiences, then select **Move Audience and Resource**. For all grant types except implicit, the parameters are added to the token request. For implicit grant types, the parameters are added to the auth request.

When the configuration is complete, select **Get New Access Token**. The configuration information is saved along with the access token and will be used every time the token is refreshed.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you use **Authorization Code** or **Implicit** grant type, you will be prompted to supply your credentials to retrieve an access token to use in later requests. By default, Postman will display a pop-up window when you select **Request Token**. If you are using the Postman desktop app, you can instead choose to authenticate using your system's default web browser. Select **Authorize using browser** to set the **Callback URL** to return to Postman after you complete auth in the browser, so that your requests can use the token returned on successful authentication.
</Info>

A token from the API includes its details, together with the expiration, and optionally a refresh token you can use to retrieve a new access token when your current one expires. Select **Proceed** and then select **Use Token** to use the returned token.

Any successfully retrieved tokens will be listed in the request **Available Tokens** dropdown list. Select one to send with your request. Select **Manage Tokens** in the dropdown list to view more details or delete your tokens.

If authentication fails or times out, Postman will display an error message. You can check the error details in the Postman Console, **Retry** to try authentication again, or edit your auth details before continuing.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Deleting a token in Postman doesn't revoke access. Only the server that issues the token can revoke it.
</Info>

### Refreshing an OAuth 2.0 token

Before an OAuth 2.0 token generated in Postman expires, Postman automatically refreshes it in the background before you send a request that uses it. The refreshed access token is updated in any requests that it's used in. If you added any custom parameters when [generating the token](#requesting-an-oauth-20-token), those parameters will also be used for the refreshed token.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Scheduled runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support automatic token refresh, so you may experience an issue when the token expires. To continue using these Postman features after the token expires, manually refresh the token and then [re-sync the token](#sharing-an-oauth-20-access-token) in the Postman app.
</Info>

Auto-refreshing is the default behavior. To turn this feature off or on, select **Auto-refresh access token**. To manually refresh a token, select **Refresh**. The token's expiration time displays if the token expires within the next day.

Auto-refresh is available when a refresh token is present. If no refresh token is present, the **Auto-refresh access token** toggle and the manual **Refresh** option aren't available. To check if a refresh token is present, select **Manage Tokens** in the **Token** dropdown list. If a refresh token is not present, check with the authorization service. Postman can't refresh the access tokens without the refresh token.

<img alt="Auto-refresh an OAuth 2.0 access token" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/authorization-oauth2-auto-refresh-v10.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use auto-refresh when manually sending the request.
</Info>

## Sharing an OAuth 2.0 access token

To enable other Postman users to view and use an OAuth 2.0 access token, turn on the toggle next to **Share Token** then select **Sync Token**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your OAuth 2.0 token must be synced to use it with scheduled runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, or Newman. If you [manually refresh the token](#refreshing-an-oauth-20-token), you must also re-sync the token.
</Info>

To revoke other users' access to a synced token, do the following:

1. Turn of the toggle next to **Share Token**.
2. Select **Remove Synced Token**.

After you revoke access, other users with access to the request won't be able to see or use the token.

## Changing the OAuth 2.0 token type

Postman supports using access tokens or ID tokens for OAuth 2.0 authorization. An *access token* enables an OAuth client to make calls to an API. An *ID token* has information about the authenticated user. This information can be used by an OAuth client to customize their experience.

If an ID token is present, you can select the token type (**Access token** or **ID token**) in the **Use Token Type** dropdown list. If no ID token is present, this dropdown list isn't available. To check if an ID token is present, select **Manage Tokens** in the **Token** dropdown list.

# Authenticate with Hawk access authentication in Postman

Hawk authentication enables you to authorize requests using partial cryptographic verification.

To use Hawk authentication, do the following:

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **Hawk Authentication** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

2. Enter your details in the **Hawk Auth ID**, **Hawk Auth Key**, and **Algorithm** fields. You can optionally set advanced details, but Postman will try to generate values for them if necessary.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When the required details are complete in the **Authorization** tab for your request, Postman will add them to the **Headers** tab.
</Info>

The Hawk Authentication parameters are as follows:

* **Hawk Auth ID** - Your API authentication ID value.
* **Hawk Auth Key** - Your API authentication key value.
* **Algorithm** - The hash algorithm used to create the message authentication code (MAC).
* Advanced parameters:
  * **User** - The username.
  * **Nonce** - A random string generated by the client.
  * **ext** - Any application-specific information to be sent with the request.
  * **app** - The binding between credentials and the application to prevent an attacker using credentials issued to someone else.
  * **dlg** - The ID of the application the credentials were issued to.
  * **Timestamp** - Timestamp the server uses to prevent replay attacks outside the time window.


# Authenticate with AWS Signature authentication workflow in Postman

AWS Signature is the authorization workflow for Amazon Web Services requests. AWS uses a custom HTTP scheme based on a keyed-HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) for authentication.

The official AWS Signature documentation provides more detail:

* [Signing and Authenticating REST Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html/)
* [Invoke REST APIs in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-call-api.html/)

To use AWS Signature, do the following:

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **AWS Signature** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.

2. Select the location where Postman will append your AWS auth details using the **Add authorization data to** dropdown list. Select **Request Headers** or **Request URL**.

   * If you select **Request Headers**, Postman adds `Authorization` and `X-Amz-` prefixed fields in the **Headers** tab.
   * If you select **Request URL**, Postman adds the auth details in **Params** with keys prefixed `X-Amz-`.

3. Enter your **AccessKey** and **SecretKey** values. For extra security, use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data as vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud. If you want to share sensitive data with collaborators, you can store it in an environment as a [variable set as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).

4. You can optionally set advanced fields in the **Advanced configuration** section, but Postman generates these automatically if necessary.

The AWS Signature parameters are as follows:

* **AWS Region** - The region receiving the request (defaults to `us-east-1`).
* **Service Name** - The service receiving the request.
* **Session Token** - Required only when using temporary security credentials.


# Authenticate with Windows NTLM authentication in Postman

Windows NTLM is the authorization flow for the Windows operating system and for standalone systems. NTLM is a challenge-response style authentication protocol.

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **Akamai EdgeGrid** from the **Auth Type** dropdown list.
2. Enter your **Access Token**, **Client Token**, and **Client Secret**, using variables for extra security. You will receive these details when you register a client application with Akamai.
3. Enter any information you need in the **Advanced configuration** section. Setting the fields in this section is optional. Postman generates default values in these fields automatically when your request runs.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When the required details are complete in the **Authorization** tab for your request, Postman will add them to the **Headers**.
</Info>

For information on obtaining your credentials, see [Akamai's developer documentation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials/).


# Authenticate with Atlassian S2S in Postman

Atlassian S2S Authentication Protocol (ASAP) is a [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) (JWT) bearer token that an API server can use to authenticate requests from the client.

To use ASAP, do the following:

1. In the **Authorization** tab for a request, select **ASAP (Atlassian)** from the **Type** dropdown list.
2. Enter your details in the fields. You can set optional settings, but Postman will try to generate values for them if necessary.

Enter the following ASAP parameters:

* **Algorithm** - Select an asymmetric key algorithm to use to sign the JWT token. The algorithm is a header parameter. Supported algorithms include:

  * **RS** - RSA (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5) with SHA
  * **PS** - RSA (RSASSA-PSS) with SHA
  * **ES** - ECDSA with SHA

* **Issuer** - A claim that identifies the service that issued the JWT token, and signed the header and payload with its private key.

* **Audience** - A claim that identifies the intended recipient of the JWT token.

* **Key ID** - The identifier for the issuer's public key. This is used to verify the JWT token's signature. The key ID is a header parameter.

* **Private key** - The issuer's private key that signed the JWT token. Select **Select File** to upload a private key in PKCS #8 or Base64 DER format, or paste your key in the text area.

* Optional parameters:

  * **Subject** - A claim that identifies the user the JWT token is issued to. If the subject isn't specified, the default value is the issuer.

  * **Additional claims** - Additional claims you'd like to include in your payload, in JSON format. You can [learn more about JWT claims](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4).

    <Info class="iconless-callout">
      If you add claims already defined in this configuration, the values defined in each key-value pair will have higher priority. For example, if you specify an issuer in the **Issuer** field and also specify an issuer (`iss`) in a key-value pair, the value in the key-value pair will have higher priority.
    </Info>

  * **Expiry** - A claim that identifies when the JWT token expires, in seconds. The default expiration timestamp is `3600` seconds, which is equal to one hour.

For more information about ASAP, see [Atlassian S2S Authentication Protocol](https://s2sauth.bitbucket.io/).


# Work with API response data and cookies in Postman

An *API response* is the data returned by an API server after it receives a request from a client. You can use Postman to inspect response data, create visualizations, and troubleshoot problems. You can also save responses as examples for reference, and view and manage any associated cookies.

## View and save responses

When you send an API request, Postman displays the response from the API server. You can [view the response details](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/) in the response viewer, including the response code, response body, and headers. You can also [use the Postman Visualizer](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/visualizer/) to create rich graphic visualizations of the response data.

## Save examples

An example is a request and related response that demonstrates how an API endpoint can be used. You can [create an example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) by saving a response or creating it from scratch. Examples are included in your API documentation, and you can also use them to set up a mock server.

## Manage cookies

Websites use cookies to save a user's session information and personalize page content for that user. You can [use Postman's cookie manager](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) to view cookies for different domains and send cookies with API requests. You can create cookies from scratch, or [capture cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-overview/) using the Postman proxy or Postman Interceptor.

## Debug requests

Postman provides tools to help you [debug your API requests](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/) and correct any problems. As you create your request, Postman highlights any invalid characters. After you send your request, you can check the Postman Console to view and troubleshoot any errors.


# API response structure in Postman

The Postman response viewer helps you visualize and check the correctness of API responses. An API response consists of the response body, headers, cookies, and the HTTP status code. You can view details about the response, including test results, network information, response size, response time, and security warnings. You can also save responses as examples or files.

## Response body

The Postman **Body** tab gives you several tools to help you understand the response, including a data type selector, preview, search, filter, and Postbot-powered visualization.

### Data type selector

When you send a request, Postman automatically displays the data type of your response. For example, JSON responses are automatically shown in the JSON mode. Syntax is highlighted depending on the data type. You can select a different type: **JSON**, **XML**, **HTML**, **Raw**, **Base64**, or **Hex**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your response contains a link, it's highlighted. Selecting it loads a `GET` request.
</Info>

<img alt="Select data type" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/data-type-selector-v11.23.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Force JSON formatting**. You can choose to have Postman auto-select your response data type or force JSON formatting. To update your selection, go to <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the Postman header, then select **Settings**. Under **General > Request > Response format detection**, select **JSON**.
</Info>

### Preview

The <img alt="Play AI icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-playAI-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Preview** tab provides a friendlier view into the data that's being sent and helps you understand any errors that occur. It supports many file formats, including **audio**, **video**, **script**, **image**, **plain**, and **embed**. JSON and XML data types display as tables.

<img alt="Response preview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-pane-preview-v11.23b.jpg" />

### Search

You can use search phrases to find content of interest in your response. Click <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-search-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Search** in the response pane. You can also place your cursor in the response and press **⌘+F** or **Ctrl+F**.

<img alt="Response search" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-pane-search-v11-35-4.jpg" />

### Filter

To improve readability, you can filter your responses to show only relevant information. Use [JSONPath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9535/) to filter JSON responses. Use [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xpath20-20101214/) to filter XML and HTML responses.

With **JSON**, **XML**, or **HTML** selected in the data type selector, select <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Filter** in the response pane. Then enter a JSONPath expression to filter JSON or an XPath expression to filter XML or HTML. For JSONPath expressions, Postman suggests autocomplete options based on keys in the response. The response automatically displays the results of your expression.

If you enter an expression that doesn't return results, Postman will flag it with a yellow underline. If you enter an expression that isn't valid, Postman will flag it with a red underline. Hover over the expression to view a tooltip about the issue.

The expression persists in the response unless you close the request or clear the expression. A green dot on <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> indicates that the response is being filtered with an expression. Select <img alt="Clear icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-clear-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to clear the expression and display the full response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you enter an XPath expression, you can use it with both the  **XML** and **HTML** data types.
</Info>

<img alt="Response filter" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-pane-filter-v11-35-4.jpg" />

### Visualization

The <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** tab renders the data in the API response according to visualization code that you add to the **Scripts > Post-response** tab. You can also use Postbot to generate visualizations for you. For details on how to add, use, and debug visualization code, see [Visualize request responses using Postman Visualizer](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/visualizer/).

<img alt="Response visualization" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-pane-visualization-v11.23.jpg" />

## Server-sent events

Server-sent events (SSE) is a standard server-push technology for real-time communication between a client and a server over HTTP/S. SSE supports efficient and low-latency data transmission, making it a popular choice for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat apps and live sports updates.

You can test, debug, and document your SSE-based APIs along with your other APIs in Postman.

Consume server-sent events by creating a new HTTP request. Postman establishes the SSE connection and then streams and displays the events. You can drill into, search through, and clear the SSE messages in the response section. You can also save the response.

To try SSE communication, use the following Postman Echo service endpoint: `https://postman-echo.com/server-events/:numberOfEvents`.

![SSE endpoint test](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/sse-endpoint-test-v11.jpg)

## Cookies

You can select **Cookies** to inspect cookies sent by the server. A cookie's entry includes its name, value, the associated domain and path, and other information about the cookie.

To learn more about working with cookies in Postman, see [Create and capture cookies using Postman's cookie manager](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/).

## Headers

Headers are displayed as key-value pairs under the **Headers** tab. Hover over the information icon <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the header name to get a description of the header according to the HTTP specification.

## Test results

If the API request you are viewing had any tests, the results are displayed in the **Test Results** tab.

To learn more about running tests against API requests in Postman, see [Write scripts to test API response data in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/).

## Network information

Postman displays network information when your API returns a response. Hover over the network icon <img alt="Connection secure icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-connectionSecure-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to get the local and remote IP addresses for the request you sent.

When you make an `https` request, the network icon includes a padlock. When you hover over the icon, the network information will show more information including the [HTTP version](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-by-http-version) and [certificate verification](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/) details.

<img alt="Hover over the network icon for network information" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/https-network-info-response-v11.23.jpg" />

### SSL verification errors

If SSL verification is enabled and verification fails, the response area displays an error message. Select the link to open the Console and view more information about the error.

<img alt="Verification error" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-error-disable-ssl-v11.23.jpg" />

If needed, you can turn off SSL verification for the request or turn it off globally in Postman:

* To turn off SSL verification for a request, select **Disable SSL Verification** in the response error message.
* To turn off SSL verification globally, select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and under **Settings > Request** turn off **SSL certificate verification**.

If you have **SSL verification** turned off and your request returns a certificate verification error, you can hover over the network information for details about the error.

<img alt="Certificate error" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/network-ssl-error-v11.23b.jpg" width="280px" />

For requests that are successful and return data but with a certificate verification failure, the [Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/) displays a warning.

## Response code

Postman displays the response code returned by the API. Hover over the response code to get a short description of the code and what it means.

<img alt="Hover over the response code to get a description" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-code-v11.23.jpg" />

Some API responses also contain custom messages that can help you understand response codes. For example, if you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response, the message might tell you to check the token you used in the request. If custom messages are returned, they're displayed in the **Body** of the response.

## Response time

Postman automatically calculates the time in milliseconds it took for the response to arrive from the server. This information can be useful for some preliminary performance testing. Hover over the response time for a graph with information on how long each event in the process took.

<img alt="Hover over the response code for a description" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-time-v11.23.jpg" />

## Response size

Postman displays the size of the response. Hover over the response size to get a breakdown by body and header sizes.

## Saving responses

If a request has been saved in a collection, you can save responses for that request. Once the response has been returned, you can:

* Select <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save Response** to save the response as an [example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) that you can access later.
* Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Save response to file** to save the response as a JSON file.
* Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Clear response** to remove any data in the response viewer. Note that for event-based requests, this is available after the stream is closed.

<img alt="Save an API response as an example or file" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/save-response-v11.23.jpg" />

## Security warnings

Postman applies security rules configured for your [API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) when you send requests to any API using either the Postman web app or the Postman desktop app. A security warning indicates that there are potential security risks the API might be vulnerable to, but they don't mean the API is broken.

To view the specific security warnings that Postman applies to all requests, see [Security warnings](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/security-warnings/).

If it finds any potential security risks, Postman adds the number of warnings to the **Security** tab in the response.

<img alt="Security tab showing one warning" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-response-security-tab-v11.23.jpg" />

To view the list of security warnings and to get more information about specific warnings, do the following:

1. Select **Security** to view the warnings.
2. For more details, select a warning to expand it.
3. Select **Possible fix** to learn about possible ways to fix the underlying problem.

<img alt="Select Possible fix in a security warning" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-response-security-tab-possible-fix-v11.23.jpg" />

### Hide security warnings

To turn a warning off for the current API response, do the following:

1. Select **Hide warning**.
2. Choose a reason for hiding it, then select **Hide**.

This will turn the warning off for all members of your team for this response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To turn a warning off globally for your team, you can [configure your API Security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) (available for [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).

# Visualize request responses using Postman Visualizer

The *Postman Visualizer* provides a programmable way to visually represent your request [responses](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/). You can also use Postman's AI assistant Postbot to automate your visualization. If you add a visualization script to the **Scripts** tab of your request, the result renders in the <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** tab for the response body. If you don't create a Visualizer script, use Postbot to generate a visualization.

![Response visualization](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/response-pane-visualization-v11.24.png)

The Visualizer enables you to present your response data in ways that help to make sense of it. You can use this to model and highlight the information that's relevant to your project, instead of having to read through raw response data. When you [share a Postman Collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/), other people on your team can also understand your visualizations within the context of each request.

## Visualize response data

To visualize your response data, add code to the **Pre-request** or **Post-response** [script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) for the request. The `pm.visualizer.set()` method applies your Visualizer code to the data and presents it in the <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** tab when the request runs.

### Add Visualizer code

The `pm.visualizer.set()` method accepts a [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template string as its first parameter. The second parameter is the data you want to use the template to display. Read on to learn how you can build a Handlebars template and pass data to it.

To see an example of the Visualizer in action, click **Run in Postman** and fork the collection in Postman:

<center>
  [<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Run in Postman" role="img" />](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/7865888-07101503-1e33-4f29-b845-d94e726751c8?action=collection%2Ffork\&source=rip_markdown\&collection-url=entityId%3D7865888-07101503-1e33-4f29-b845-d94e726751c8%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D34f3a42c-18a7-4ad6-83fb-2c05767d63a7)
</center>

In the first request, the example endpoint responds with a list of names and email addresses with the following JSON response body structure:

```js
[
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
    },
    {
        "name": "Jack",
        "email": "jack@example.com"
    },
    // ... and so on
]
```

The Visualizer code creates a Handlebars template to render a table displaying the names and email addresses by looping over an array. Handlebars can do this with the `{{#each}}` tag. The following runs as a **Post-response** script in the request:

```js
var template = `
    <table bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
        </tr>

        {{#each response}}
            <tr>
                <td>{{name}}</td>
                <td>{{email}}</td>
            </tr>
        {{/each}}
    </table>
`;
```

The variable names inside the double curly braces in the template are substituted with the data passed to the `pm.visualizer.set()` method. To apply the template, the following code completes the **Post-response** script:

```js
// Set visualizer
pm.visualizer.set(template, {
    // Pass the response body parsed as JSON as `data`
    response: pm.response.json()
});
```

The `template` variable is the template string created earlier. The second argument passed is an object defined as the `response` property. This is the variable that the template expects in the `{{#each response}}` loop. The value assigned to the `response` property is the response JSON data from the request parsed as an object.

### View visualizations

Click **Send** to run the request in Postman, then click the <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** tab. Postman renders the table as HTML, as it would be in a web browser.

![Visualize a table](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/visualizer-table-v11.24.png)

### Add styling and interaction to visualizations

You can load an external stylesheet using `<link>` tags in your HTML template code, using the same technique as adding a stylesheet to a web page. You can also add stylesheets as `<style>` tags. Similarly, you can add interactions using JavaScript code in `<script>` tags inside your template HTML code.

<Note title="Note">
  Visualizer doesn't support interactions that download resources.
</Note>

### Use your own libraries

You can use any of the libraries in the [Postman Sandbox](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) to programmatically generate the layout template. To import another external JavaScript library, add the URL to a `<script>` tag in the template code, like you would to load JavaScript into an HTML file. This lets you render your request data using the visualization tool of your choice (for example, D3.js).

### Access data inside the template

Any `<script>` elements inside your template can access the data passed in the second argument to `pm.visualizer.set()` by calling the `pm.getData(callback)` method. This is only applicable to JavaScript code in the template. For example, your template might include code to render a chart.

The `pm.getData(callback)` method takes a callback function as its parameter. This callback accepts the `error` and `data` parameters. The second parameter is the `data` passed to `pm.visualizer.set()`.

## Use Postbot to create visualizations

Not sure how to write a visualization for your request? Ask Postbot! Tell Postbot what you want to do using plain language, and Postman uses artificial intelligence to generate a visualization for you. Use Postbot to create a new visualization, change the type of visualization, fix your existing visualization, and more.

To create a visualization with Postbot, do the following:

1. Send your request so it has a response.
2. In the **Body** tab of the response, click <img alt="Down icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> next to <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualizer**.
3. In the menu, select your visualization option. Or, select **Set up with a prompt** to visualize your response in another format.

When you select **Set up with a prompt**, you can complete a preset prompt *Visualize response as* or enter your own, for example, *Create a pie chart*.

Once you create a visualization or close the Postbot window, you can access <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> Postbot again from the [footer](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#footer) or the **Scripts** tab.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can help improve Postbot by sharing your feedback with Postman. Selecting **Share Details** opens up a GitHub issue request.
</Tip>

## Try it out

For more examples of Visualizer code in action, add any of the following collections to your workspace by [forking the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/). You can also [export and then import](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/) the collection. After you fork or import the collection, open a request from **Collections** in the sidebar, then select **Send**. Postman displays the rendered data in the <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** tab.

## Visualizer API

You can access the Visualizer from the [Postman API](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-visualizer/). The `pm.visualizer.set()` method accepts the following parameters:

* `layout` --- (Required) The first parameter is a [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) HTML template string.
* `data` --- The second parameter is data that you can bind to the template. The properties of this object can be accessed in the template.
* `options` --- The third argument is an `options` object for [`Handlebars.compile()`](https://handlebarsjs.com/api-reference/). You can use this to control how Handlebars compiles the template.

Postman uses the information you pass to `pm.visualizer.set()` to render an HTML page in the sandbox for the Visualizer. Click <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Visualization** for the rendered HTML page. The `layout` string is inserted into the `<body>` of the rendered page, including any of the template's JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Debugging the Visualizer

You can debug a visualization in Postman by right-clicking in the Visualization area, then clicking **Inspect visualization**. This opens the Visualizer Developer Tools attached to the sandbox. You can use it in the same way as debugging a web page.

<Note title="Note">
  The Visualizer Developer Tools are only available in the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

## Next steps

Now that you've learned about visualizing responses in Postman, you can start creating visualizations of your own.

* To get started, you can experiment with the [More Visualizer examples](https://www.postman.com/postman/e9bb1adb-2f2e-4ace-a482-38c570d65275/overview) workspace. Run the example requests, then adjust the code to get the results you need for your own data.

# Create examples of request responses to illustrate API use cases

Examples show your API endpoints in action and give more details on how requests and responses work. You can add an example to a request by saving a response, or you can create an example with a custom response to illustrate a specific use case. Once you've created examples, you can use them to set up a mock server or add more detail to your API documentation.

## Understanding examples

In Postman, an example is a pairing made up of a *request* and a related *response*. Each example includes a request part (method, URL, parameters, headers, and body) and a response part (status code, body, and headers). You add examples to requests in collections, and one request can have multiple examples.

Having multiple examples for one request is useful for illustrating the different ways an endpoint can respond to a request. You might have examples that respond with different status codes (such as 200 or 404) or that return different data (or no data at all).

Examples are useful in several ways. Developers and testers can refer to examples to better understand how an endpoint functions in different scenarios. Examples can also be used to [set up mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/), so developers and testers can start [writing code](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) against your API, even before it's complete. In addition, you can include examples in your API's [public documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) to help anyone in the world who uses your API.

## Add an example

An example is always associated with a [request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/) in a [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/), and a request can have more than one example. To add an example to a request, send the request and then save the response as an example. You can also manually add an example to a request and define a custom response. After adding an example using either method, you can edit it at any time to make changes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For optimal Postman performance, example responses must be smaller than 5 MB.
</Info>

### Save a response as an example

When saving a [response](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/) in Postman, you have the option to save it as an example.

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Open a request and select **Send**.
3. In the response pane, select <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save Response**.

   <img alt="Save a response as an example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/examples-save-response-v11-42.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For [gRPC examples](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-grpc-examples/) with streaming methods, you must end the stream before saving the response/message stream as an example.
</Info>

### Add a custom example

With a custom example, you can define how both the [request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/) and the [response](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/) look, including the status code and response body.

2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a request and then select **Add example**.

3. Enter a name for the example.

4. Edit the request part of the example.

   * Add any parameters or headers as needed.
   * Enter the request body and select a content type.

5. Edit the response part of the example.

   * Enter a **Status Code** (such as `200` or `404`).
   * Enter the response body and select a content type.
   * Add any headers as needed.

## Use examples in documentation

Postman automatically [generates documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) for every collection you create. The generated documentation [includes any examples](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#including-examples) that have been added to the collection. If you edit an example, the documentation is automatically updated with your changes.

<img alt="Examples in documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-including-examples-v11-1.jpg" />

Examples give more details and clarification for your API and help your team to work together on API development. Front-end developers, back-end developers, and testers can all work in parallel, using the examples in the documentation for guidance or to set up [mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can [publish your documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) to make your examples publicly available to anyone in the world.

# Create and capture cookies using Postman's cookie manager

Postman's cookie manager enables you to view and edit cookies that are associated with different domains. You can manually create cookies for a domain, or you can [capture cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/) using the Postman proxy or Postman Interceptor. You can then use the cookies stored in the Postman cookie jar when sending requests in Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To turn off sending cookies with a request, select the request's **Settings** tab, then select **Disable cookie jar**.
</Info>

## About cookies

A *cookie* is a packet of data that a computer receives and then sends back without changing or altering it. Most cookies have two pieces of data: a unique ID for each user and a site name.

Websites can retrieve the cookie when you revisit them, so they can remember you and your preferences and tailor page content for you based on this information. Without cookies, you'd have to sign in again after you leave a site or rebuild your shopping cart if you closed a web page. This makes cookies an important part of the internet experience.

## Use the cookie manager

To manage cookies in Postman, open a request, then select **Cookies** (under **Send**).

![Cookies link](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/cookies-link-v11-b.jpg)

In the **Cookies** window, select the **Manage Cookies** tab to display a list of domains and the cookies associated with each one. If you want to view cookies for a domain that isn't in the list, you can [add a domain](#add-a-domain).

![Managing cookies](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/manage-cookies-v11-1.jpg)

## Add a domain

To add a new domain to the cookie manager, do the following:

1. Select the **Type a domain name** search box.
2. Enter the domain name. If you enter a protocol (such as `http://`) or port number, they won't be stored with the domain name in the cookie manager.
3. Select **Add domain**.

## Create cookies

To add a new cookie for a domain, select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add Cookie** under the domain. A pre-generated cookie string compliant with [HTTP State Management standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-4.1) is created.

```js
Cookie_1=value; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 09 Oct 2024 21:49:26 GMT;
```

Postman supports the following attributes:

* **cookieName** = **cookieValue** - The name of the cookie and its stored value.
* **Domain** - The domain Postman will send the cookie to.
* **Path** - The URL path that the cookie is restricted to. If the path is `/`, the cookie will be sent to all requests in the specified domain.
* **HttpOnly** - If present, the cookie won't be available to the client-side scripts run on the page (for example, with `document.cookie` in JavaScript). The cookie will only be added to the cookie header in requests that are made. This field doesn't have an effect on Postman's behavior.
* **Secure** - If present, the cookie is only sent when the URL begins with `https://` and won't be sent over an insecure connection.
* **Expires** - The time after which the cookie expires and won't be sent by Postman.

Select **Save** to save the cookie to the Postman cookie jar under the relevant domain.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman doesn't support the `SameSite` attribute, or the `__Secure-` and `__Host-` prefixes.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also add or edit the cookies in a response with the [Set-Cookie header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie).
</Info>

## Edit or delete cookies

To update an existing cookie for a domain, select the cookie you want to edit, edit any attribute, then select **Save**.

To delete a domain and all cookies associated with it, select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the domain. To delete an individual cookie, select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the cookie.

To remove all cookies and domains from the Postman cookie jar, select **Clear All Cookies**.

## Send cookies with a request

When you make a request to a domain you have added a cookie to, the cookie automatically appears in your request **Headers** tab. If the cookie isn't visible, select **hidden** to show autogenerated headers.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/autogenerated-cookie-header-v11-b.jpg" alt="Cookie header" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't override cookie headers directly in the **Headers** tab. Edit the cookie in the cookie manager, or delete the cookie and set your request headers manually. You can add cookies in the cookie manager and the **Headers** tab, and Postman will merge the cookies before sending the request.
</Info>

## Script with cookies

You can write scripts that create, get, and delete cookies, giving you more control over your cookies. Use the `pm.cookies` object to access cookies associated with the request. Use the `pm.cookies.jar()` methods to create, get, and delete cookies for a specific domain. To access cookies for specific domains using the `pm.cookies.jar()` methods, you must first [add domains to the allowlist](#access-cookies-in-scripts).

Learn more about [writing scripts that create, get, and delete cookies](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-cookies/).

### Access cookies in scripts

When you add a domain to the allowlist, cookies for that domain can be accessed in scripts using the `pm.cookies.jar()` methods.

To add a domain to the allowlist, do the following:

1. In the **Cookies** window, select **Domains Allowlist**.
2. Select **Add a domain to the Allowlist**.
3. Enter the allowed domain. If you include anything other than the domain name, such as a protocol, you won't be able to access cookies for that domain.
4. Select **Add**.

To remove a domain from the allowlist, select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the domain.

![Manage cookies domains allowlist](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/domains-allowlist-cookies-v11.jpg)

## Sync cookies

Postman can capture cookies for a browser or client application using the [Postman proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-with-proxy/) or [Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/). For the domains you select, captured cookies are continuously synced with the Postman cookie jar. This enables you to use any authentication sessions in your browser or client application to make API calls in Postman.

Learn more about [capturing cookies with the Postman proxy or Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).


# Debug API requests in Postman

If an API request isn't behaving as expected, there can be many possible reasons. You can ask Postbot to help you find out what the problem is, or use the Postman Console to troubleshoot the request. This guide also lists some common issues and their causes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This guide discusses troubleshooting API requests. To troubleshoot issues with the Postman app, see [Troubleshoot app issues](/docs/introduction/troubleshooting-inapp/). To troubleshoot issues with Postman Monitors, see [Troubleshooting monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/troubleshooting-monitors/).
</Info>

## Troubleshooting your requests

Postman indicates any whitespace or invalid characters in parts of your request that may not function as expected so that you can fix your values. Invalid characters are highlighted in the request method, URL (including the path), parameters, headers (including your key names), and body.

<img alt="Invalid Characters" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/invalid-character-message-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

If Postman isn't able to send your request or doesn't receive a response, you'll get a message with details about the error. Select **View in Console** to get an overview of your request and to help identify the source of the issue.

## Debugging requests with Postbot

If you get an unexpected error when you send a request, you can ask Postbot for help. Click <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **What's wrong?** in the error message. Postbot tells you about any problems it can identify, and offers possible solutions for fixing the issue.

For more information on Postbot, see [About Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/).

![Debug a request with Postbot](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postbot-debug-request-v11.jpg)

## Debugging in the Console

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Console logs are stored locally in the Postman Console and aren't synced to the cloud.
</Info>

Every request sent by Postman is logged in the Postman Console, so you can view the detail of what happened when you sent a request. This means you can use the Console to help debug your requests when an API isn't behaving as you expect. Keeping the Console open while you work increases the visibility of your network calls and log messages while debugging.

The Postman Console logs the following information:

* The primary request that was sent, including all underlying request headers, variable values, and redirects.
* The proxy configuration and certificates used for the request.
* Network information, such as IP addresses, ciphers, and protocols used.
* Log statements and asynchronous requests from pre-request or post-request scripts.
* The raw response sent by the server before it's processed by Postman.

Monitor results are logged to a separate console. For more information on how to view logs from a monitor run, see [View monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/#console-log).

### Opening the Console

Click <img alt="Console icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-console-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Console** in the Postman footer to open the Console. In the Postman desktop app, use **⌘+Option+C** or **Ctrl+Alt+C** to open the Postman Console in a new window.

### Viewing request errors from the Console

You'll get an error message if Postman isn't able to send your request or doesn't receive a response from the API you sent the request to. This message includes an overview of the issue and a link to the Console. There you can access detailed information about the request.

Select **View in Console** to inspect the request details in the Console and find out more about what went wrong.

<img alt="Error in Console" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/console-pane-opened-from-response-v10-22.jpg" />

### Navigating the Console

The Postman Console displays network information and the request and response headers and body for each request, together with any Console output messages coming from your scripts.

Filter by log message type under **All Logs**. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Options** to turn timestamps and network information on or off.

<img alt="Console options" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/console-pane-log-options-v11.jpg" />

The Console logs the last 5,000 messages and 24 hours by default. Select **Clear** to empty the list.

### Using log statements

Using log statements at appropriate locations in your post-response scripts can help you debug your requests. Postman accepts the following log statements:

* `console.log()`
* `console.info()`
* `console.warn()`
* `console.error()`
* `console.clear()`

<InterlinkCTA platform="community" datatype="ask-scripts" />

## Debugging by HTTP version

You can specify the HTTP version to use for requests. Postman supports HTTP versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0. The HTTP version you select is the default version you'll use globally to send HTTP requests. You can override the default version for an individual request.

It's useful to specify an HTTP version when debugging API requests so you can test requests by version. It's also useful for verifying if API requests support the expected HTTP version.

If the API supports HTTP version 2.0, make sure the request URL uses the `https` scheme. If you're using the Postman web app, also make sure you send requests with the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent). The supported 1.x HTTP version is used in the following scenarios:

* The request URL uses the `http` scheme.
* The request is sent with the [Postman Cloud Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-cloud-agent).
* You've configured Postman to use a [proxy server](/docs/getting-started/installation/proxy/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends you [use the latest version](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.

To specify an HTTP version for your requests, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then click **Settings** to specify an HTTP version globally. You can also specify the version for an individual HTTP request by opening it, then clicking the **Settings** tab.

2. Select the HTTP version dropdown list next to **HTTP Version**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you specify an HTTP version for an individual request, you can select **Restore Default**. This changes the HTTP version to the default version specified globally.
   </Info>

3. Select one of the following options:

   * **Auto** - Postman automatically selects HTTP version 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0, depending on which version the API supports and prefers.
   * **HTTP/1.x** - Send the request using HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1.
   * **HTTP/2** - Send the request using HTTP version 2.0.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If the API doesn't support the HTTP version you selected, an error displays in the response area. For example, the error will display if you select **HTTP/2** and the API doesn't support HTTP version 2.0.
   </Info>

After you send a request, you can verify the HTTP version in the response pane. Hover over <img alt="Connection secure icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-connectionSecure-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Network** to view information about the HTTP version that was used to send the request.

## Comparing your request's history

If your HTTP request isn't behaving as expected, you can view a previous configuration from the request's history to help you troubleshoot. You can only view the response for a previous request configuration if [saving response history](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#saving-responses-in-history) was turned on when you sent the request. You can also delete a response from your request's history.

The HTTP request must be in an internal or Partner Workspace. Postman doesn't support viewing an earlier configuration of a request and its response from public workspaces. Also, partners in [Partner Workspaces with multi-partner mode enabled](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/) can't view an earlier configuration of a request and its response.

To view a previous request configuration and its response, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and open an HTTP request.

2. Click <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **History** in the response area. This displays a list of the sent request's timestamps and the status code the system returned.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     When you select a previous response from the **History** dropdown list, the date and time you sent the request displays in the response area. Select the date and time to display the dropdown list again, then choose a different response. You can select **Current** to return to the latest version of the request configuration.
   </Info>

   <img alt="Select a request and response from your history" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/select-request-from-history-v11-18.jpg" />

3. Select a response from the dropdown list to view it and the request configuration.

To delete a request and its response from your history, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and open an HTTP request.
2. In the response area, click <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **History**.
3. Next to a response in the dropdown list, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Options** > **Delete**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also [share a link](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-a-request-with-its-response) to an HTTP request and its response with your team members or external partners. Share a link to the current response or a previous response from the request's history, along with the request configuration.

| **Connectivity**        | If Postman fails to send your request, you may be experiencing connectivity issues. Check your connection by attempting to open a page in your web browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Firewalls**           | Some firewalls may be configured to block non-browser connections. If this happens you'll need to contact your network administrators for Postman to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Proxy configuration** | If you are using a proxy server to make requests, check your configuration. By default, Postman uses the proxy settings configured in your operating system's network settings. The [Postman Console](#debugging-in-the-console) provides debugging information regarding proxy servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **SSL certificates**    | You may experience issues using HTTPS connections. You can turn off **SSL certificate verification** in [Settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/) by clicking <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then **Settings > General**. If that doesn't help, your server might be using a client-side SSL connection, which you can configure by clicking <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then **Settings > Certificates**. Use the [Postman Console](#debugging-in-the-console) to ensure that the correct SSL certificate is being sent to the server. Learn more about [working with certificates](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/). |
| **Client certificates** | Client certificates may be required for your API server. You can [add a client certificate](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/) in [Settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/) by clicking <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then **Settings > Certificates**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Wrong request URLs**  | If you are using variables or path parameters with your request, make sure the final address is correct by opening the [Postman Console](#debugging-in-the-console), which displays the URL your request was sent to when it runs. Unresolved request variables can result in invalid server addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Wrong protocol**      | Check if you're using "https\://" instead of "http\://" in your URL (or the opposite).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Short timeouts**      | If you configure a short timeout in Postman, the request could be timing out before completion, resulting in an error. To avoid this issue, increase the **Request timeout** in [Settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/) by clicking <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then **Settings > General**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

* Ask for community help in the [Postman forum](https://community.postman.com/).
* If you think the problem is with Postman itself, search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues) on GitHub to check if someone has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution.
* If you need to include confidential data, file a support ticket with [Postman support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us), including your Console logs.


# Reuse data with variables and environments in Postman

A *variable* is a reusable value you can use in API requests and scripts. Postman uses the variable's local value when running a request or script. You can group variables in an *environment* to make it easier to change variable values based on your work context.

## Variables quick start

To create and use a variable, do the following:

1. Click **Environments** in the sidebar, then click **Globals**.

2. Add a variable named `my_variable` and give it a value of `Hello`.

3. Open a new request tab and enter `https://postman-echo.com/get?var={{my_variable}}` as the URL. Hover over the variable name to inspect the variable's value and scope.

   <img alt="View the variable value and scope" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/variable-quick-start-hover-v11-18.jpg" />

4. Click **Send** and send the request. Inspect the response, which confirms that Postman sent the variable value to the API.

5. Click <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** in the [workbench](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) to open the variables pane.

6. Under **Variables in request**, change the value of `my_variable` and send the request again.

To learn more about using variables in Postman, go to [Store and reuse values using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/).

## Create and switch environments

With environments, you can create sets of variables for the various types of work you do in Postman. For example, you might want to use different values when sending requests to a test server or a production server.

To get started, learn how to [create and switch between environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) in Postman. You can then [add and edit variables in each environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/). You can also [use environments to collaborate with your team](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/) and share and manage sensitive data.


# Store and reuse values using variables

*Variables* enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. By storing a value as a variable, you can reference it throughout your collections, environments, requests, and scripts. Variables help you work efficiently, collaborate with teammates, and set up dynamic workflows.

## Understanding variables

A variable is a symbolic representation of data that enables you to access a value without having to enter it manually wherever you need it. This can be useful if you're using the same values in multiple places. Variables make your requests more flexible and readable by abstracting the detail away.

For example, if you have the same URL in more than one request, but the URL might change, you can store it in a "base\_url" variable. Then, use "\{\{base\_url}}" to reference the variable in your requests. If the URL changes, you can change the variable value and it'll be reflected throughout your collection wherever you've used the variable name.

The same principle applies to any part of your request where data is repeated. Whatever value is stored in the variable will be included wherever you've referenced the variable when your requests run. If the variable value is `https://postman-echo.com` and the request uses the `{{base_url}}/get` URL, then Postman sends the request to `https://postman-echo.com/get`.

![Environment editor](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/environment-editor-v11-60-4.jpg)

![Reference variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reference-var-v11-18.jpg)

Variables in Postman are key-value pairs. Each variable name represents its key, so referencing the variable name enables you to access its value. You can use variables to pass data between requests and tests. For example, if you are [chaining requests](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-team-collections/collection/fa2fdwg/extract-data-to-chain-requests) in a collection.

Use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data as vault secrets and reuse them in your local instance of Postman. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets and secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

Use environments to group sets of variables together and share them with collaborators. For example, if you use one set of config details for your production server and another for testing. See [Group sets of variables in Postman using environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) for more on how you can incorporate environments into your team workflows.

## Variable scopes

Postman supports variables at different scopes, allowing you to tailor your processing to a variety of development, testing, and collaboration tasks. Scopes in Postman relate to the different contexts that your requests run in, and different variable scopes are suited to different tasks.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can create a variable without a variable scope if it isn't meant to hold a default value. You can also create a variable without a scope to try out the value before adding it to a scope. Learn more about [creating variables without a scope](#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope).
</Info>

In order from broadest to narrowest, these scopes are: *global*, *collection*, *environment*, *data*, and *local*.

* **Global variables** enable you to access data between collections, requests, scripts, and environments. Global variables are available throughout a [workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/). Since global variables have the broadest scope available in Postman, they're well-suited for testing and prototyping. In later development phases, use more specific scopes.
* **Collection variables** are available throughout the requests in a collection and are independent of environments. Collection variables don't change based on the selected environment. Collection variables are suitable if you're using a single environment, such as auth or URL details.
* **Environment variables** enable you to scope your work to different environments, such as local development versus testing or production environments. One environment can be active at a time. If you have a single environment, using collection variables can be more efficient, but environments enable you to specify [role-based access levels](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/#share-an-environment).
* **Data variables** come from external CSV and JSON files to define data sets you can use when running collections with the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/), or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/). Data variables have local values, which don't persist beyond request or collection runs.
* **Local variables** are temporary variables that are accessed in your request scripts. Local variables are scoped to a single request or collection run, and are no longer available when the run is complete. Local variables are suitable if you need a value to override all other variable scopes but don't want the value to persist once the run ends.

![Variable scope](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/var-scope-v10.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with narrowest scope will be used. For example, if there is a "username" global variable and a "username" local variable, the local value is used when the request runs.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman stores variables as strings. If you store objects or arrays, remember to `JSON.stringify()` them before storing, and `JSON.parse()` them when you retrieve them.
</Info>

## Variable values

By default, collection, environment, and global variable values are only available locally in your instance of Postman. The local value is used when sending requests, and it isn't synced to the Postman cloud. Update your local value as you'd like, without sharing it with your teammates. Learn how to [define a local value for your variables](#defining-variables).

If you have Editor access to the element, you can [share a variable's value](#share-variable-values), syncing it's value to the Postman cloud. Share a variable's value to provide your teammates with a default value they can use to begin making requests to your API. Your teammates can continue to update their local value without sharing it. They can also reset their local value back to the shared value at any time.

Some Postman features that run on the Postman cloud also use the shared value when sending requests. These features include scheduled collection runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're more familiar with current and initial values, learn more about the [previous way of defining variables](#previous-way-of-defining-variables).
</Info>

### Previous way of defining variables

Postman no longer supports maintaining multiple independent values for your collection, environment, and global variables. Previously, you could provide a *current value* (local) and *initial value* (shared) for your variables and update them separately.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Initial and current values are supported in the Postman VS Code extension. Learn more about [variables in the VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/send-requests/#store-variables).
</Info>

With this change, you only need to provide a single value for your variables that's local by default (previously the current value). Learn how to [define a local value for your variables](#defining-variables).

You can choose to [share a variable's value](#share-variable-values) with your teammates (previously the initial value), based on the local value at the time of sharing. You can continue to update and use your local value without sharing it. Updates to your local value are only shared with your teammates if you intentionally choose to share the new value.

## Defining variables

Variable values are local by default and only available to you in your instance of Postman. These values aren't synced to the Postman cloud. Once you've defined a local value, you can optionally [share variable values](#share-variable-values), syncing the value to the Postman cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Remember to delete variables you're no longer using.
</Info>

To define variables at any scope in the request builder, do the following:

1. Select the data you need, for example in the address, parameters, headers, or body.

2. Right-click the selection and click **Set as variable**.

### Setting values for variables without a scope

Variables without a [variable scope](#variable-scopes) are useful for trying out the value before [adding the variable to a scope](#adding-variables-to-a-scope). This is also useful for sending data with requests that isn't meant to hold a default value. For example, a variable without a scope might send user-specific information that changes each time you send the request. Variables without a scope also enable you to create a placeholder variable to share with your API consumers, without having to define the variable at a specific scope.

In the request builder, you can create a variable without adding it to a variable scope. The value you enter for this variable is stored locally and is only available in the request it's set in. When you click <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables**, the variable isn't associated with a scope (highlighted by color) in the variables pane under **Variables in request**.

To create a variable from the request builder, [use double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) to reference a variable](#using-variables) that doesn't exist or isn't available from the request. For example, enter `{{username}}` to create a username variable that doesn't have a scope.

### Adding variables to a scope

From a Postman element, such as a request or collection, you can create a variable and add it to a specific [variable scope](#variable-scopes) to reuse it across your requests. You can also add a [variable without a scope](#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope) to a specific variable scope in your team. From the element, you can add a value that's stored locally for the variable.

<Info class="iconless-callout">

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you don't have Editor access to an environment, your script code will affect the local value but won't be synced or shared with your team.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Make sure you [enable scripts to access your vault secrets](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/). Otherwise, you'll receive an error in the Postman Console, and any code that comes after the method won't run. Also, you must use the `await` operator before each `pm.vault` method for it to run in your script.
</Info>

For instructions on how to use variables in pre-request or post-response scripts, see [Using variables in scripts](#using-variables-in-scripts).

## Set a value as sensitive data

With [Editor](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) access, you can set a global or environment variable as sensitive data. This masks the value, helping you avoid unintentionally sharing sensitive tokens, for example, to an unintended audience during screen sharing or live streaming. Postman stores variables as strings on the cloud. To learn about how Postman keeps your data safe, see [Security at Postman](https://www.postman.com/trust/security/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends that you use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data, such as API keys, as encrypted vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and they aren't synced to the Postman cloud.
</Info>

To set a variable value as sensitive data, do the following:

1. Open a [global](#defining-global-variables) or [environment](#defining-environment-variables) variable.
2. Click <img alt="Key icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-key-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Mark as sensitive**  next to the variable name.

   ![Set environment variable as sensitive data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/environment-variable-sensitive-data-v11-60-4.jpg)

To set all variable values as sensitive data, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Mark all sensitive**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you [share a value](#share-variable-values) that's set as sensitive data, Postman warns you about the outcome of sharing a sensitive value.
</Info>

Your teammates can view the value of a variable set as sensitive data by clicking <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Show** next to the variable's value.

To unset a variable value as sensitive data, do the following:

1. Open a [global](#defining-global-variables) or [environment](#defining-environment-variables) variable.
2. Click <img alt="Key icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-key-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Remove sensitive mark**  next to the variable name. The value is no longer masked.

To unset all variable values as sensitive data, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Unmark all sensitive**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also learn how to [set a value as sensitive data from the VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/send-requests/#store-variables).
</Info>

## Using variables

You can use double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`) to reference variables throughout Postman. For example, to reference a "username" variable in your request's authorization settings, use the following syntax:

```js
{{username}}
```

When you run a request, Postman resolves the variable and replaces it with your value. For example, you could have a request URL referencing a variable:

```js
https://postman-echo.com/get?customer_id={{cust_id}}
```

Postman sends the value stored for the "cust\_id" variable when the request runs. If "cust\_id" has a "3" value, the request is sent to the following URL with the query parameter:

```js
https://postman-echo.com/get?customer_id=3
```

If you want to access a variable from within a request body, wrap its reference in double-quotes:

```js
{ "customer_id" : "{{cust_id}}" }
```

You can use variables in request URLs, parameters, headers, authorization, body, and header presets.

When you hover over a variable, Postman shows its value and its scope. As you add variables to your requests, Postman displays any existing variables.

![Variable prompt](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/var-prompt-v11-60.jpg)

The prompt indicates the local value, scope (highlighted by color), and <img alt="Warning icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-warning-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Overridden** status where relevant. If a global or environment variable is set as [sensitive data](#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data), you can hover over the variable and click <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Reveal** to show its value. You can also press and hold **⌘** or **Ctrl** to show the values for all variables set as sensitive data.

If a variable doesn't have a value, Postman highlights it in red. Also, a red exclamation point displays on <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** in the upper-right of the workbench. For information on how to fix this, see [Fixing empty variables](#fixing-empty-variables).

![Unresolved variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/unresolved-variable-v11-18.jpg)

### Using dynamic variables

Postman provides dynamic variables you can use in your requests. Examples of dynamic variables include:

* \{\{\$guid}} - A v4-style GUID.
* \{\{\$timestamp}} - The current Unix timestamp, in seconds.
* \{\{\$randomInt}} - A random integer between 0 and 1000.

See the [Use dynamic variables to return randomly generated data](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/) section for a full list.

### Using variables in scripts

You can retrieve your local value of a variable in your scripts using the object representing the scope level and the `.get` method:

```js
//access a variable at any scope including local
pm.variables.get("variable_key");
//access a global variable
pm.globals.get("variable_key");
//access a collection variable
pm.collectionVariables.get("variable_key");
//access an environment variable
pm.environment.get("variable_key");
//access a vault secret
await pm.vault.get("secret_key")
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Using `pm.variables.get()` to access variables in your scripts gives you the option to change variable scope without affecting your script functionality. This method returns the variable that has the highest precedence (or narrowest scope).

  Postman doesn't support using `pm.variables` to access and manipulate vault secrets.
</Info>

To use [dynamic variables](#using-dynamic-variables) in pre-request or post-response scripts, use `pm.variables.replaceIn()`. For example:

```js
pm.variables.replaceIn('{{$randomFirstName}}')
```

See [Postman Sandbox API reference](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) for more details about scripting with variables.

#### Logging variables

You can log variable values to the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/) while your requests run. Use the following syntax in your script to log the value of a variable:

```js
console.log(pm.variables.get("variable_key"));
```

To view the results, click <img alt="Console icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-console-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Console** in the footer. You can also access the Console by selecting **View > Show Postman Console**.

### Using data variables

The Collection Runner lets you import a CSV or a JSON file and use the values from the data file inside requests and scripts. You can't set a data variable inside Postman because it's pulled from the data file, but you can access data variables inside scripts, for example using `pm.iterationData.get("variable_name")`.

For more details, see [working with data files](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) and the [Postman Sandbox API reference](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/).

## Share variable values

You can choose to share global, environment, and collection variables, syncing the values with the Postman cloud. By default, variables have a local value that only you can access in your instance of Postman. [Share a variable value](#create-a-shared-value) to create a separate, shared value your teammates can access. You can also [update a shared value](#update-a-shared-value) and [stop sharing a value](#stop-sharing-a-shared-value).

Shared values are also used with Postman features that run on the Postman cloud, like scheduled collection runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman.

Once the value is shared, you and your teammates can continue to [work with your own local values](#work-with-shared-values) during development and testing, without affecting the shared value. You can reset your local value back to the shared value, if you'd like.

### Stop sharing a shared value

You can also stop sharing a shared value, removing it from the Postman cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you stop sharing a value, you may break API workflows that rely on it.
</Info>

To stop sharing a variable with your teammates, do the following:

1. Open a [global](#defining-global-variables), [environment](#defining-environment-variables), or [collection](#defining-collection-variables) variable.
2. Choose one of the following:

   * If your local value and the shared value are the same, click <img alt="Synced icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-synced-v11.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Shared** next to the variable's value, then click **Unshare** to confirm.

     ![Stop sharing environment variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/stop-sharing-environment-variable-v11-60-4.jpg)

   * If your local value and the shared value are different, click <img alt="Edited icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-edited-v11.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edited** next to the variable's value, then select **Unshare**.

To stop sharing all values, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Unshare all**.

### Work with shared values

Once the variable has a [shared value](#create-a-shared-value), you can continue to update the local value, without affecting the shared value. Local values enable you to develop and test using private credentials or experimental values, without risk of exposing sensitive data to others on your team. You can reset your local value when you're done, returning it to the shared value that's synced to the Postman cloud.

For example, your team could have a shared API key and individual API keys. You could do experimental development work locally using your personal key, but use the shared key for team collaboration.

To reset your variable's value, do the following:

1. Open a [global](#defining-global-variables), [environment](#defining-environment-variables), or [collection](#defining-collection-variables) variable.
2. Update your local value to differ from the shared value.
3. Click <img alt="Edited icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-edited-v11.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edited** next to a variable's value, then select **Reset value**. Your local value is updated to match the shared value.

   ![Reset environment variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reset-local-environment-variable-v11-60-4.jpg)

To reset all shared values, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Reset all shared values**.

You can also reset a shared value from a [variable reference](#using-variables) or the [variables pane](#viewing-and-editing-variables-in-an-element) in a Postman element, such as a request or collection. Hover over the variable, update the local value, click <img alt="Edited icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-edited-v11.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edited**, then select **Reset**.

## Viewing and editing variables in an element

Use the variables pane to view and edit the variables and vault secrets a [Postman element](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/) uses and can access. With the variables pane, you can edit your variables and vault secrets in one location. You won't have to locate and update every variable in each [scope](#variable-scopes) and vault secret in your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/).

To access the variables pane, open a Postman element, then click <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** in the upper-right of the [workbench](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane). The variables pane opens on the right where you can view the following:

* **Variables in request** - View and edit your local value of variables and vault secrets referenced in a request. This also shows [variables without a scope](#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope) that are referenced in your request.
* **All variables** - View and edit your local value of variables and vault secrets that are available from your Postman elements, such as a request or collection. For example, if you have a request open, this might show variables defined in the active environment that you could choose to reference in the request.

You can also hover over a reference to a variable or vault secret, then click **Variables in request** or **All variables** to open the variables pane.

<Info class="iconless-callout">

</Info>

### Access variables from an element

Under **All variables** in the variables pane, you can view and update variables and vault secrets that are available from your Postman elements. For requests that reference a variable or vault secret, select **All variables** to display all variables and vault secrets a request can access. Variables and vault secrets in this section can be referenced and resolved in the element that's open.

You can edit your local value of a variable or vault secret that's available from an element. Click <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** to open the variables pane, delete the existing value next to a variable or vault secret, then enter a new value.

You can also take the following actions to update the variables and vault secrets from the variables pane:

* If an environment isn't selected, click **Select environment** to choose an environment from the environment selector.
* If there are no variables defined in the selected environment, associated collection, or globally in the workspace, click **Add** to open it in a new tab.
* If there are no vault secrets defined in your Postman vault, click **Add secrets** to open your Postman Vault in a new tab.

<img alt="All variables available from an element" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/all-variables-postman-element-v11-18.jpg" />

## Fixing empty variables

An *empty variable* is a variable that's referenced in a request but doesn't have a value. For example, Postman expects to find a value for "\{\{cust\_id}}" in the `https://postman-echo.com/get?customer_id={{cust_id}}` request. If Postman doesn't find a value for the variable, it's flagged as an empty variable and the request may fail when you send it.

A variable can be empty for the following reasons:

* The variable was created but changes weren't saved.
* The environment that has the variable isn't active.
* The variable is turned off in the respective collection, active environment, or globals.
* The variable doesn't have a scope, and a value hasn't been added to it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A vault secret can also be empty if it's missing a value and is referenced in a request. Learn how to [fix empty vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/troubleshoot-vault-secrets/).
</Info>

When you're working on an API request, Postman highlights empty variables in the **URL builder** and in the **Params**, **Authorization**, and **Headers** tabs. Postman highlights empty variable text in red. If your request has an empty variable, a red exclamation point displays on <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** in the upper right of the workbench.

![Unresolved variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/unresolved-variable-v11-18.jpg)

To view empty variables referenced in a request, do the following:

1. Open a request with empty variables, then click <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables**.
2. Under **Variables in request**, review the variables without values.

To check if the variable exists and is available from the request, do the following:

1. Select the collection in the sidebar that's associated with the request, then click the **Variables** tab. You can also click **Environments** in the sidebar, then select **Globals** or one of the environments.
2. Turn on the variable, make the necessary changes to the value of the variable, or make the correct environment active.

Learn more about [viewing and editing variables in an element](#viewing-and-editing-variables-in-an-element).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  From a request, you can [set local variables programmatically](#defining-variables-in-scripts) in a pre-request script using `pm.variables.set`. When the variable is also referenced in the request, it'll display as *Resolved via script* in the variables pane. Environment, global, and collection variables set programmatically (for example, `pm.environment.set`) are saved for later use at their respective scope. If you experience issues referencing a variable set programmatically, debug your requests with the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-in-the-console).
</Info>


# Group sets of variables in Postman using environments

In Postman, an *environment* is a set of one or more [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) that you can reference when [sending requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/), [writing pre-request scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/), or [writing post-response scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/). You can create environments for the different types of work you do in Postman. When you switch between environments, all of the variables in your requests and scripts will use the values from the current environment. This is helpful if you need to use different values in your requests depending on the context, for example, if you're sending a request to a test server or a production server.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Environments can also help you to collaborate on Postman data if you're working as part of a team. You can use environments to share variables and manage the visibility of sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, or tokens. Learn more about [working with environments as a team in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/).
</Info>

## Create an environment

Create a new environment when you want to be able to change the values of variables depending on your work context in Postman, or to share values with other team members. You can also create a new environment from the environment selector, making it the active environment.

To create a new environment, do the following:

1. Select **Environments** in the sidebar and select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />. You can also select the environment selector at the top right of the workbench and select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/environment-create-new-v10-20.jpg" alt="Create new environment" />

2. Enter a name for your new environment.

3. (Optional) [Assign a color](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-colors/) to your environment.

4. Add any variables you want to the environment. You can also add variables later. Learn more about [adding environment variables](#add-environment-variables).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Changes to your variables are automatically saved.

## Add environment variables

You can specify a local value when you add an environment variable. This means the value isn't synced to the Postman cloud or shared with your teammates.

To add variables to an environment, do the following:

1. Click **Environments** in the sidebar and select an environment.
2. Name your variable.
3. If the data is sensitive, next to your variable's name, click <img alt="Key icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-key-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Mark as sensitive**.
4. (Optional) Next to your variable's name, click <img alt="Edit description icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-edit-description-v11.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add description** and describe your variable. To display descriptions in their own column, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Description**.
5. Enter your variable's value. To display [shared values](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values) in their own column, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More** and select **Shared Value**.

## Switch between environments

Postman displays the active environment in the environment selector, located in the top right of the workbench. When you send a request or run a script, Postman uses the local value for all variables in the active environment. To make another environment active, select it from the environment selector.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/environment-selector-v11-14.jpg" alt="Environment selector" width="280px" />

You can select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the environment selector to create a new environment and make it the active environment.

You can also make an environment active by selecting **Environments** in the sidebar. Select the set active icon <img alt="Set active icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-checkmark-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> next to an environment to make it the active environment.

<img alt="Active environment" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/environment-editor-select-env-v10-20.jpg" />

To check a variable's local value, select <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** in the workbench to open the variables pane. The variables pane lists the local values for all variables in the active environment.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you want to make variables available regardless of which environment is active, use [global variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-global-variables). The quick look lists any global variables you have declared or that are shared in your workspace.
</Info>

## Use variables in requests and scripts

To use an environment variable in a request, reference it by name surrounded with [double curly braces](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#using-variables):

```js
{{base_url}}
```

You can reference environment variables in request URLs, parameters, headers, and body data. Hover over a variable reference to view its local value.

![Reference variable](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reference-var-v11-18.jpg)

You can access current environment variable values in your **Pre-request** and **Post-response** scripts using the [`pm.environment.get` method](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#using-variables-in-scripts):

```js
pm.environment.get("variable_name");
```

If more than one variable with the same name is available to a request, Postman will use the value from the variable with the narrowest [scope](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes). Therefore, if you have an environment variable with the same name as a collection or global variable, Postman will use the environment variable. However, local and data variable values will supersede environment values. The value of any overridden variables will display in strikethrough format.

## Edit an environment

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're working with environments as part of a team, you must have the Editor role to edit the environment or change shared values for variables. Learn more about [sharing environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/#share-an-environment).

# Edit and set environment variables in Postman

An [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) is a group of variables whose values you can change depending on your work context in Postman. After you [create an environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#create-an-environment), you can add new environment variables, update their values, or delete variables. You can also set environment values using scripts, and you can share variable values to make them available to your team.

## Edit environment variables

You can edit environment variables by adding new variables, changing a variable's value, marking a value as sensitive data, or deleting variables.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're working with environments as part of a team, you must have the Editor role to edit the environment and its values. Learn more about [sharing environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/team-environments/#share-an-environment).
</Info>

To edit environment variables, select **Environments** in the sidebar and select an environment. From here you can take the following actions:

* To filter the list of environment variables by name or value, click <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-search-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Search Variables**, and enter your search.
* To sort the list of environment variables, select a column header. You can toggle between ascending and descending order. To manually sort the list, clear the sort order if needed by selecting a column header, then drag rows using the handles.
* To add a new environment variable, select **Add new variable** in the bottom row of the table.
* To delete an environment variable, hover over a variable and select the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" />.
* To make an environment variable unavailable without deleting it, clear the checkbox next to the variable. Any references to the variable will be empty variables without a value. To make the variable available again, select the checkbox.

![Environment editor](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/environment-editor-v11-60-4.jpg)

To edit an environment variable, select the variable and change any of the following:

* **Variable** - The name of the variable. Use the name to [reference the variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#use-variables-in-requests-and-scripts) in requests and scripts.
* **Sensitive data** - Click <img alt="Key icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-key-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Mark as sensitive** next to the variable name to set the variable as sensitive data, masking the value in Postman. Learn more about [setting a variable as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).
* **Value** - This value is used when sending requests in your local instance of Postman. It's never synced to the Postman cloud or shared with your team. You can optionally [share the environment variable's value](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values), syncing it with the Postman cloud.

You can also hover over the reference to the environment variable, delete the existing value, then enter a new value.

Learn more about [viewing and editing variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#viewing-and-editing-variables-in-an-element) from an element.

## Set environment variables from scripts

You can change the values of environment variables from your **Pre-request** and **Post-response** scripts. Use the [`pm.environment` method](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-variables/#pmenvironment) to set an environment variable in the [active environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#switch-between-environments):

```js
pm.environment.set("variable_key", "variable_value");
```

If you use scripts to set values for environment variables, these values will be reflected in all requests that reference the variables. For example, you can use environments in conjunction with [the collection runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) and [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to use updated values for a series of requests throughout a run and after the run completes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To create new environment variables from a script, you must have Editor access to the environment. If you update or unset a value in a script when you have Viewer access, that change will be visible to you but won't be shared with other team members.

# Work with environments as a team in Postman

An [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) enables you to collaborate on Postman data when you're working as part of a team. You can use environments to share a group of variable values and use those values when sending requests. You can also use environments to share and manage the visibility of sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, or tokens.

To get started, [create a new environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#create-an-environment), move an environment, or fork an environment in your internal workspace. Then assign roles to team members to specify who can view or edit the environment.

## Move an environment to a shared workspace

To collaborate with others, move an environment to a shared [workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/). You can share data with other team members in internal workspaces, or share data with anyone using public workspaces.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You must be an Editor on an environment or a Workspace Admin to move the environment to another workspace. Learn more about [sharing environments](#share-an-environment).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Monitors and integrations in the original workspace that use the environment may no longer work and will need to be reconfigured in the new workspace. Collections, APIs, and mock servers that use the environment can be [moved manually](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces) or reconfigured.
</Info>

### Export an environment

Another way to move an environment is to export it from one workspace and import it into a different workspace.

1. Select **Environments** in the sidebar.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to an environment and select **Export**. The file downloads automatically.

You can import the JSON file into another workspace by dragging it into Postman. Learn more about [data import and export](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/).

### Share an environment

After you move an environment, you can share it with others and add them as collaborators.

1. Select **Environments** in the sidebar and select an environment.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** and select **Share**.
3. Enter the names, group names, or email addresses you want to share the environment with.
4. If you have the [Editor role](#share-an-environment) for the environment, select the role you want your collaborators to have (Viewer or Editor).
5. Select **Invite**.

Postman will notify the people you shared the element with about your request to collaborate. Learn more about [sharing your work in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To copy a link to the environment you can share with others, select <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy link to environment** next to the environment's name.
</Info>

### Use an environment with the Viewer role

If you have the Viewer role for an environment, you can access the values of all variables in the environment. You can update your local value for the variable, which is used to send requests in your local Postman instance. The local value also isn't shared with your team or synced to the Postman cloud. With the Viewer role only, you can't edit the environment or update a variable's shared value, which is synced to the Postman cloud and shared with your team.

If you have Viewer access to an environment, <img alt="Lock icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-lock-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Read only** displays next to the environment's name to indicate that you can't make changes to the environment. If you need to edit the environment or shared values for variables, [request Editor access to the environment](#request-access-to-an-environment).

### Use an environment with the Editor role

If you have the Editor role for an environment, you can edit the environment and update a variable's shared value. You can also [create and update variables from your scripts](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/#set-environment-variables-from-scripts).

When you edit the [shared value](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values) of an environment variable, your updated value will be reflected for everyone who has access to the environment. Make sure it's safe to share the value with your team and sync it with the Postman cloud. Learn more about [managing sensitive variable values](#manage-sensitive-variable-values).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you clear the checkbox next to an environment variable, the variable isn't available for use, and references to the variable won't have a value. Users with the Viewer role won't be able to change this setting to make the variable available again.
</Info>

### Request access to an environment

If you need to update the shared value of a variable in an environment you have Viewer access to, you can request Editor access.

1. Select **Environments** in the sidebar and select an environment.
2. Select <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Request to Edit**.
3. Select the team member you want to send the request to, and select the **Editor** role.
4. Select **Send Request**. You'll get an email when your request is approved.

### Manage sensitive variable values

With [Editor](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) access, you can set environment variables as sensitive data, masking the values for your collaborators. Learn how to [set an environment variable as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).

Postman recommends that you use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data, such as API keys, as encrypted vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and they aren't synced to the Postman cloud. This enables you to prevent unintentional disclosure of your sensitive data.

## Fork an environment

You can fork an environment to make changes to it without impacting the parent environment. You can also use a fork to contribute to an environment without having Editor access.

To fork an environment, do the following:

1. Select **Environments** in the sidebar and select an environment.
2. Select **Fork** <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-fork.jpg#icon" width="14px" /> in the workbench.
3. Enter a **Fork label** and select the **Workspace** where you want to create the fork.
4. Select **Fork Environment**.

You can edit your forked environment and use it as needed, or you can [create a pull request](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/) to update the original environment.

## View pull requests, forks, and environment details

You can view pull requests, forks, and details about an environment from the right sidebar.

* To view pull requests, select the pull request icon <img alt="Pull request icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-pull-request.jpg#icon" width="16px" />.

# Pin environments to collections

You can pin [environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) to an HTTP collection to organize your workspace and show other Postman users which environments work with that collection. If a user [forks](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) the collection, pinned environments will fork with the collection. By associating environments with collections, pinning helps other users understand and consume your requests.

## Pin an environment to a collection

You can pin environments to help users identify the environments they should use with requests in your collection. You can set one environment as the [default pinned environment](#set-a-default-pinned-environment) that's automatically selected as the active environment when users open the collection.

To pin an environment to a collection, do the following:

1. Click a collection, folder, or request.

2. Click the [environment selector](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) in the upper right of the workbench.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can hover over an environment and click <img alt="Open in Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openInPostman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open environment** to open it in a new tab.
   </Info>

3. Hover over an environment and click <img alt="Pin icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pin-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Pin to collection**. The pinned environment appears at the top of the environment selector. You can pin multiple environments to a collection. Pinned environments also display their assigned [color](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-colors/).

To unpin an environment from a collection, hover over a pinned environment, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**, and then click **Unpin**.

When you fork a collection that has pinned environments, Postman automatically forks the pinned environments with the collection. Postman makes the [default pinned environment](#set-a-default-pinned-environment) the active environment in your forked collection. To learn more, see [Fork collections and environments in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/).

## Set a default pinned environment

When you or another user opens the collection, Postman automatically makes the default pinned environment the active environment. This helps other users see which environment to start with when working with your collection. Your collection can only have one default pinned environment at a time.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman automatically sets the first pinned environment in your collection as the default pinned environment.
</Info>

To set a default pinned environment for a collection, do the following:

1. Click a collection, folder, or request.
2. Click the [environment selector](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) in the upper right of the workbench.
3. [Pin the environment](#pin-an-environment-to-a-collection), if you haven't already.
4. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**, then click **Set as Default**. The default pinned environment has the label **DEFAULT**.

When you fork a collection that has a default pinned environment, Postman automatically makes it the active environment in your forked collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you unpin the default pinned environment, the next pinned environment in the list will become the default pinned environment for the collection.

# Store secrets in your Postman Vault

Use *Postman Vault* to securely work with sensitive data, such as API keys and passwords, as vault secrets in Postman. You can reference vault secrets in your HTTP request and collections. Store vault secrets in your Postman Local Vault, where your sensitive data is local and only accessible by you. You can also create Postman Vault integrations to connect vault secrets with external vaults, allowing you to reference managed secrets without storing them in Postman.

## About Postman Vault

Postman Vault includes the following features:

* **[Postman Local Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/)** - Store sensitive data as vault secrets in your local instance of Postman. Only you can access vault secrets in your Postman Local Vault, and they aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

* **[Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/)** - Create integrations between Postman Vault and external vaults. Link vault secrets in your Postman Local Vault to secrets stored in external vaults, which aren't synced to the Postman cloud. Postman supports integrations with [1Password](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/1password/), [AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/aws-secrets-manager/), [Azure Key Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/azure-key-vault/), and [HashiCorp Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/hashicorp-vault/). Postman Vault integrations are available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.

## Get started with Postman Vault

When you first open Postman Vault, Postman generates a vault key that's required to open your Postman Local Vault when you sign in. To learn how to open your Postman Local Vault and get your vault key, see [Access Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/).

Once your Postman Local Vault is open, you can create, manage, and reference vault secrets in Postman. To learn more, see [Create and manage vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/).

## Feature availability

The following features require the Postman desktop app:

* **Open Postman Vault from public workspaces** - You must use the Postman desktop app to open your Postman Vault from a [public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/), and reference vault secrets in a public workspace. If you're using the Postman web app, you must add new vault secrets to your Postman Vault if you're opening it from a public workspace.

* **Create and manage Postman Vault integrations** ([Enterprise teams only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) with the Advanced Security Administration add-on) - You must use the Postman desktop app to [create and manage Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/). If you're using the Postman web app, Postman Vault integrations aren't available.

## Troubleshoot vault secrets

# Create and manage vault secrets

[Add vault secrets](#add-sensitive-data-as-vault-secrets) to your Postman Vault and reuse them in your local instance of Postman. Then you can [reference vault secrets](#use-vault-secrets) in your HTTP collections and requests, variables, and the Collection Runner. Only you can access and use values associated with your encrypted vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also [use Guided Auth to add vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/) that have authentication credentials for public APIs, and reference them in your HTTP requests.
</Info>

## Add sensitive data as vault secrets

After you [save your vault key](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/), you can add sensitive data, such as API keys and passwords, to your Postman Vault and reuse them in your local instance of Postman. From the HTTP request builder, you can [set existing data as a vault secret](#set-data-as-a-vault-secret). You can also set a value for a [vault secret that doesn't exist](#set-a-value-for-a-vault-secret-that-doesnt-exist) in your Postman Vault, and later [add the vault secret reference to your Postman Vault](#add-a-vault-secret-reference-to-your-postman-vault). Vault secrets are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can [set vault secrets in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/). Make sure you enable scripts to access your vault secrets. Otherwise, you'll receive an error in the Postman Console.
</Info>

You can also [create an integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/) ([Enterprise teams only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) that connects your Postman Vault with external vaults, such as Azure Key Vault. This enables you to link vault secrets with sensitive data stored in external vaults, and reuse it in your local instance of Postman.

<Error title="Caution">
  Vault secrets aren't preserved in your Postman Local Vault when you sign out of Postman, switch between the Postman desktop and web apps, or switch to a different machine.

6. Enter a name for the vault secret.

7. Select **Local Vault**.

### Set a value for a vault secret that doesn't exist

Vault secrets that aren't added to your Postman Vault are useful for trying out a value. If the value works as expected, you can [add the vault secret to your Postman Vault](#add-a-vault-secret-reference-to-your-postman-vault). You can also create placeholder vault secrets to share with your API consumers. Your consumers can use the placeholder vault secret to add their own sensitive data to their Postman Vault.

You can create a vault secret reference in an HTTP request without adding the vault secret to your Postman Vault. The value you enter for this vault secret is stored locally and is only available in the request it's set in. In the [variables pane](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) under **Variables in request**, the vault secret isn't associated with your Postman Vault.

To create a vault secret reference that isn't added to your Postman Vault, open your Postman Vault, then enter a name that doesn't exist using the following syntax: `{{vault:secret-name}}`. You can enter a name in the **URL builder**, the **Params** tab, the **Authorization** tab, and the **Headers** tab.

# Create and manage vault secrets using Guided Auth

[Use Guided Auth to add vault secrets](#add-authorization-as-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth) to your Postman Vault, enabling you to store authentication credentials for public APIs that set up Guided Auth. You can use vault secrets added using Guided Auth in your Postman team. Then you can [reference vault secrets added using Guided Auth](#use-vault-secrets-added-using-guided-auth) in new HTTP requests to the same public APIs. Only you can access and use values associated with your encrypted vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

Guided Auth enables you to set up authentication credentials for public APIs by following steps set up by API publishers. Once you set up your authentication credentials using Guided Auth, you can store them in your Postman Vault and reuse them throughout your workspaces.

Learn how to [explore public APIs](/docs/postman-api-network/explore/overview/) on the Postman API Network. If you're an API publisher, learn how to [set up Guided Auth for your public APIs in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/setting-up-authentication-for-public-apis/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also add vault secrets without using Guided Auth. Learn how to [add vault secrets to your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/).

## Add authorization as vault secrets using Guided Auth

After you [save your vault key](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/), you can add your authentication credentials for public APIs to your Postman Vault as vault secrets. To do this, public APIs you're sending a request to must have Guided Auth set up. Then you can [use authentication credentials added using Guided Auth](#use-vault-secrets-added-using-guided-auth) in your Postman team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using Guided Auth from the Postman web app, use the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent). Postman recommends you [use the latest version](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.

Guided Auth supports public APIs that require bearer, basic, API key, or OAuth 2.0 authentication credentials. If an API supports token refresh, Postman automatically refreshes OAuth 2.0 tokens that were stored in your Postman Vault using Guided Auth.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Vault secrets are deleted from your Postman Vault after signing out of Postman. Existing references to vault secrets are empty when you sign in to Postman. You can add your vault secrets to your Postman Vault using Guided Auth after you sign in to Postman.
</Info>

To add authentication credentials as vault secrets using Guided Auth, do the following:

1. Open an HTTP request, and enter the URL for a public API that has Guided Auth set up, such as `https://api.getpostman.com/`.

3. Generate and enter your authentication credentials:

   * For APIs that require authentication credentials like tokens or API keys, follow the instructions to get your credentials. Then enter them in the field under **Auth credentials**.
   * For APIs that support OAuth 2.0, click **Authorize** to get your credentials and automatically enter the access token in the field under **Auth credentials**.

4. Click **Store Auth in Vault**.

   ![Store auth in Postman Vault](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/store-auth-in-postman-vault-v11-16.jpg)

   If you haven't entered your vault key since signing in to Postman, you're asked to enter it.

5. Enter the **Auth method name** for the authentication credentials. By default, the auth method name is the public API's name, such as "Postman API", but you can use a different name if you'd like.

   The auth method name is used to categorize the vault secret in your Postman Vault. The auth method name is also used to generate the vault secret's key. For example, if you enter "Postman API Key" as the auth method name for an API key, the vault secret's key would be `postman-api-key:value`.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you use an auth method name that already exists in your Postman Vault, the existing auth method is overwritten.

In your Postman Vault, vault secrets added using Guided Auth are stored under **Created with guided auth**, and they're categorized by the auth method name. Each vault secret's key name is automatically appended with a suffix, which you shouldn't edit:

* For APIs that require authentication credentials like tokens or API keys, the suffix represents the authentication type, such as `:token`.
* For APIs that support OAuth 2.0, multiple vault secrets are added to your Postman Vault, including the access token and other properties returned by the public API (like the token type). Each vault secret has a suffix that represents the value, such as `:accessToken` and `:tokenType`.

![Vault secret created with Guided Auth](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-vault-guided-auth-v11-60.jpg)

The allowed domains for the vault secret are autofilled with the domains and subdomains for the public API. This is a comma-separated list of domains and subdomains you're allowed to send requests to with the vault secret. This enables you to prevent unintentional disclosure of sensitive data in your vault secret. Postman uses this information to suggest [using saved authorization](#use-vault-secrets-added-using-guided-auth) in future HTTP requests to the domain or subdomain.

Postman supports Postman Vault integrations with [1Password](https://1password.com/), [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/), and [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault).

Postman retrieves authentication credentials that enable you to authenticate with your external vault, such as a user access token. The type of authentication credentials that Postman retrieves can vary depending on the external vault you're authenticating with. Postman must authenticate with your external vault to retrieve secrets from it when you send HTTP requests.

Authentication credentials and retrieved secrets aren't stored in your local instance of Postman or the Postman cloud. Postman removes authentication credentials from your working memory and local storage when you close Postman or your authentication credentials expire.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You'll need to [reauthenticate with external vaults](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#reauthenticate-with-an-external-vault) each time you open Postman or when your authentication credentials expire in Postman. You'll need to create the integration again if you sign out and back in to Postman.
</Info>

You can only integrate your Postman Vault with one organization in an external vault provider at a time. If you want to integrate with a different organization in your external vault provider, you must [disconnect the integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#disconnect-an-integration), then create a new integration that authenticates with a different organization. See the following details about creating and managing integrations with external vault providers:

* **1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, and  Azure Key Vault** - You create and manage the integration with your Postman Vault. This means you and your team members can integrate with different organizations in 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, and Azure Key Vault.
* **HashiCorp Vault** - Only a Postman [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can create and manage the integration with your Postman Vault. This means that you and your team members must integrate with the same organization in HashiCorp.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  External partners assigned the [Partner role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles) can't access Postman Vault integrations.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Postman Vault integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

[1Password](https://1password.com/) enables you to store sensitive data in a vault that's external from your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). Once your Postman Vault is integrated with 1Password, you can link vault secrets with sensitive data stored in 1Password, and retrieve them when you send HTTP requests.

You can create Postman Vault integrations from the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/).
</Info>

## About the 1Password integration

When setting up an integration with 1Password, you need to [authenticate with your 1Password account](#integrate-with-1password). Then you can [link vault secrets with 1Password](#link-vault-secrets-with-1password) using the secret reference for each secret.

You can follow the steps to [create a vault](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/#create-a-vault), [add secrets to the vault](https://support.1password.com/1password-com-items/#create-and-edit-items), and [create a service account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started) in 1Password. Make sure the service account has at least `read` access to the 1Password vaults with secrets you want to link in Postman.

## Integrate with 1Password

When you create the integration, authorize Postman to access and retrieve secrets from 1Password, entering the service token for your 1Password account. Postman uses your service token to authenticate with 1Password, and the service token is valid in Postman forever.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You'll need to [reauthenticate with 1Password](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#reauthenticate-with-an-external-vault) each time you open Postman.

   ```

4. Select **Authenticate**.

## Link vault secrets with 1Password

Link a vault secret's value with a secret stored in 1Password. This enables you to retrieve a secret stored in 1Password directly from Postman. Once you link a vault secret's value, [reference the vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) in your Postman team, and the secret is retrieved from 1Password when you send the HTTP request that references the vault secret.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Secrets retrieved from 1Password aren't stored in your local instance of Postman or the Postman cloud. Learn more about [Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/#about-postman-vault-integrations).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Vault secrets are deleted from your Postman Vault after signing out of Postman. Your vault secrets can't be recovered with your vault key. When you sign in to Postman and open your Postman Vault, you can [create the integration](#integrate-with-1password) and link a vault secret's value.
</Info>

Before you link a vault secret, enable the option to copy a secret reference URI from the 1Password desktop app version 8 or later. From the 1Password desktop app, [integrate with 1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration) to enable this option. If you're using an earlier version of the 1Password desktop app, you must manually construct secret reference URIs.

# Integrate Postman Vault with AWS Secrets Manager

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Postman Vault integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

[AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/managing-secrets.html) enables you to store sensitive data in a vault that's external from your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). Once you create the [integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/) with AWS Secrets Manager, you can link vault secrets with sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager, and retrieve them when you send HTTP requests.

You can create Postman Vault integrations from the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

## About the AWS Secrets Manager integration

When setting up an integration with AWS Secrets Manager, [authenticate with your AWS account](#integrate-with-aws-secrets-manager) and select the security credentials type you'd like to use: long-lived or temporary. Enter the access key pair (access key ID and secret access key), session token, region, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) token for your AWS account. Then [link vault secrets with AWS Secrets Manager](#link-vault-secrets-with-aws-secrets-manager) using the secret Amazon Resource Name (ARN), role ARN, and version for each secret.

Postman uses your access key pair to authenticate with AWS. The key pair is valid in Postman for two hours if using long-lived security credentials. The key pair is valid for a specified period of time if using temporary security credentials.

You can follow the steps to [create a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html), [find a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_search-secret.html), and [retrieve a secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets.html) from AWS Secrets Manager. To view a secret's details, including the secret ARN, open the **Secrets Manager console** then click the secret's name.

By default, Postman retrieves the value that's entered in the **Plaintext** tab in the **Secret Manager console**. Postman retrieves the value as it's entered in the **Plaintext** tab, so enter the secret's value in the format you want it returned in Postman. You can configure Postman to retrieve the value of a JSON key-value pair in the **Key/value** tab.

## Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager

When you create the integration, authorize Postman to access and retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Enter the access key pair (access key ID and secret access key), session token (if using temporary security credentials), region, and MFA token for your AWS account.

If your AWS account requires an MFA token to authenticate, make sure you have the [`iam:listMFADevices` permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_ListMFADevices.html) in the [identity-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) associated with your AWS user. This enables Postman to check if your AWS account has MFA enabled, and then prompt you to enter your MFA token.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  You'll need to [reauthenticate with AWS](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#reauthenticate-with-an-external-vault) each time you open Postman, or when your access key pair expires in Postman.
</Warning>

To integrate with AWS Secrets Manager and authenticate with your AWS account, do the following:

1. Open your Postman Vault.
2. If you haven't created an integration with an external vault, click <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Set up external vault** in the upper right of your Postman Vault. Otherwise, click <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Use from existing vault**. Then select **AWS Secrets Manager**. You're then prompted to authorize Postman to access your AWS account.

   Optionally, you can click <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the upper right of your Postman Vault. From the **Settings** tab, click **Connect** next to **AWS Secrets Manager**.

<Note title="Note">
  Your computer must be able to access your Amazon Web Services instance, and your AWS account can't require a proxy server to access it.
</Note>

1. Select the security **Credentials Type** to use when authenticating with AWS: long-lived or temporary security credentials. The security credential type determines the length of time the access key pair (access key ID and secret access key) is valid for in Postman. You'll need to reauthenticate with AWS when the key pair expires. Learn more about [AWS security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html).

   * **Long-lived** --- Long-term security credentials that are valid for 2 hours in Postman.

     * **Access Key** --- Enter the [access key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for your AWS account.
     * **Secret Key** --- Enter the [secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for your AWS account.
     * **Region** --- Enter the AWS [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions) where your account is located.

     Optionally, you can [autofill each long-lived security credentials field](#autofill-authentication-credentials) using a credentials file.

   * **Temporary** --- Short-term security credentials that enable you to configure the length of time they're valid for. Learn more about [temporary security credentials in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html).

     * [Request temporary security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html), and enter them in Postman. You can request temporary security credentials using AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) operations. An AWS Admin can also generate temporary credentials using their internal AWS portal. The credentials include the **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, and **Session Token**.

     * **Region** --- Enter the AWS [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions) where your account is located.

2. Click **Authenticate**.

3. If your AWS account requires [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html), enter an **MFA Token**.

4. Click **Authenticate**.

### Autofill authentication credentials

If you're using long-lived security credentials, you can autofill each field from the credentials file in your `home` directory. This enables Postman to automatically fill in the details required to authenticate with your AWS account.

To create the credentials file, [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), then [configure the credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) with your access key, secret key, and region. Postman checks the `.aws/credentials` file in your `home` directory, and checks the `main` and then `default` profiles (in that order) in your credentials file. You can learn more about the credentials [file format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) and [default location](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-location.html) of the file in your `home` directory.

To autofill long-lived security credentials in Postman, do the following:

1. Select the **Long-lived** credentials type in the **Authenticate AWS Secrets Manager** window.
2. Click one of the fields, such as **Access Key**.
3. Select <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Autofill from config file**.
4. Complete the remaining steps to authenticate with your AWS account.

## Link vault secrets with AWS Secrets Manager

Link a vault secret's value with a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager. This enables you to retrieve a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager directly from Postman. Once you link a vault secret's value, [reference the vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) to retrieve it's value from AWS Secrets Manager when you send it with an HTTP request.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  Vault secrets are deleted from your Postman Vault after signing out of Postman. Your vault secrets can't be recovered with your vault key. When you sign in to Postman and open your Postman Vault, you can [create the integration](#integrate-with-aws-secrets-manager) and link a vault secret's value.
</Warning>

By default, Postman retrieves the value as it's entered in the secret's **Plaintext** tab. Under **Advanced settings**, you can configure Postman to retrieve the value of a JSON key-value pair in the secret's **Key/value** tab.

<Note title="Note">
  Secrets retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager aren't stored in your local instance of Postman or the Postman cloud. Learn more about [Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/#about-postman-vault-integrations).
</Note>

Before you link a vault secret, make sure you have the [`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html) in the identity-based policy associated with your AWS user. This enables you to retrieve secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager from your Postman team.

# Integrate Postman Vault with HashiCorp Vault

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Postman Vault integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

[HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/what-is-vault) enables you to store sensitive data in a vault that's external from your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/). Once your Postman Vault is integrated with HashiCorp Vault, you can link vault secrets with sensitive data stored in HashiCorp Vault, and retrieve them when you send HTTP requests.

You can create Postman Vault integrations from the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/).
</Info>

## About the HashiCorp Vault integration

To enable Postman to access your HashiCorp Vault instance, you first need to [set up an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider](#set-up-an-oidc-identity-provider) in HashiCorp Vault. [Integrating Postman Vault with HashiCorp Vault](#integrate-with-hashicorp-vault) requires a Postman [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enter the following for your OIDC identity provider:

* The OIDC client URL
* JWT auth path
* OIDC client ID
* Role name
* Namespace

You can integrate with a HashiCorp Vault instance that's managed in [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp) or [self-managed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/install).

Once the integration is connected, you need to [authenticate with your HashiCorp account](#authenticate-with-your-hashicorp-account). Then you can [link vault secrets with HashiCorp Vault](#link-vault-secrets-with-hashicorp-vault) using the path to the KV (key-value) [secrets engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets#secrets-engines), path to the secret, and key name for each secret. Postman supports version 1 and 2 KV secrets engines and static and dynamic secrets.

You can follow the steps to create a [version 1](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) or [version 2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2) KV secrets engine and [store static or dynamic secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/use-cases#general-secret-storage) in it.

## Set up an OIDC identity provider

To set up the integration, you need to first set up an [OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/oidc-provider) in HashiCorp Vault, enabling Postman to access your HashiCorp Vault instance.

Make sure you have permission to set up an OIDC identity provider. This includes permissions to create an OIDC client application, OIDC provider, auth method, policy, and role. Learn more about the [minimum permissions required to set up an OIDC identity provider](#permissions-to-set-up-an-oidc-identity-provider).

To set up an OIDC identity provider, run [HashiCorp Vault commands](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands) using one of the following options:

* Run the commands from the Vault Browser CLI in your HashiCorp Vault instance.
* Run the commands from your [local installation of Vault CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install).
* Use a script that automatically runs the commands. To learn more, see [Download and run the HashiCorp Vault setup script](#download-and-run-the-hashicorp-vault-setup-script).

To set up an OIDC identity provider in HashiCorp Vault using the CLI, do the following:

1. Create a public [OIDC client application](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/oidc-provider#client-applications). Learn about the [endpoint for creating a client application](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/oidc-provider#create-or-update-a-client).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write identity/oidc/client/<client-application-name> redirect_uris="http://127.0.0.1:10545/,http://127.0.0.1:10534/" client_type=public assignments=allow_all
   ```

2. Get the client ID of the OIDC client application, then save this value for later. Learn about the [output options for printing a specific field](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/read#output-options).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault read -field=client_id identity/oidc/client/<client-application-name>
   ```

3. Optionally, you can create a [scope](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/oidc-provider#scopes) with a custom claim. Use the scope and custom claim to associate an existing [entity](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/identity) with the auth method Postman uses to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault. Otherwise, a new entity will be created for each user when they authenticate with HashiCorp Vault using Postman. Learn about the [endpoint for creating a scope](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/oidc-provider#create-or-update-a-scope).

   The scope template in the following example has a claim that maps the `alias_name` key with a [template parameter](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/oidc-provider#scopes) that returns the [alias name for a specified mount accessor](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/identity#mount-bound-aliases). For this example, use the mount accessor associated with the auth method your users already use to sign in to HashiCorp Vault. Later in the instructions, you'll assign the scope to your OIDC provider and the claim's key name to the `postman` role.

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write identity/oidc/scope/<scope-name> template='{ "alias_name": {{identity.entity.aliases.<mount-accessor>.name}} }' description="Gets the name of the alias associated with the specified auth method."
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can use a different template parameter for the claim. Make sure to save the scope's name and claim key's name for later.
   </Info>

4. Create an [OIDC provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/oidc-provider#oidc-providers). If your HashiCorp Vault instance is managed in HashiCorp Cloud Platform, the `issuer` value must be the public cluster URL. If it's self-managed, the `issuer` value is the address of your Vault cluster as a URL and port, such as `https://192.0.2.255:8300`. Optionally, if you created a new scope with a custom claim earlier, add the `scopes_supported` parameter with the scope's name as the value. Learn about the [endpoint for creating an OIDC provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/oidc-provider#create-or-update-a-provider).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write identity/oidc/provider/<oidc-provider-name> allowed_client_ids="<oidc-client-id>" issuer="<vault-cluster-url>" scopes_supported=["<scope-name>"]
   ```

5. Get the URL for the OIDC provider, then save this value for later. Learn about the [output options for printing a specific field](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/read#output-options).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault read -field=issuer identity/oidc/provider/<oidc-provider-name>
   ```

6. Create a [JSON Web Token (JWT) auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/jwt) named `postman-jwt`. Learn about the [endpoint for creating auth methods](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/system/auth#enable-auth-method).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write /sys/auth/postman-jwt type="jwt"
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can use a different JWT auth method name. Make sure to save this name for later.
   </Info>

7. Configure a role named `postman` with permission to authenticate using the `postman-jwt` auth method. Learn about the [endpoint for configuring the role](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#configure).

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write auth/postman-jwt/config oidc_discovery_url="<oidc-provider-url>" default_role=postman
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can use a different role name. Make sure to save this name for later.
   </Info>

8. Create a HashiCorp Vault policy that's attached to the `postman` role then save the policy name for later. Learn about the [endpoint for creating a policy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/system/policy#create-update-policy).

   The policy in the following example allows all users with the `postman` role to read secrets from all secrets engines in HashiCorp Vault. Depending on your organization, you might want to specify which secrets engines users can access.

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write sys/policy/<policy-name> policy='path "*" { capabilities=["read"] } path "sys/*" { capabilities=["deny"] } path "auth/*" { capabilities=["deny"] }'
   ```

   To specify which secrets engines users can access, you can do one the following:

   * [Create an entity and define an alias for each user](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/identity#create-an-entity-with-alias). Then attach a policy to each entity that specifies which secrets engines the associated user can access.
   * [Create a group and add users to the group](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/identity#create-an-internal-group). Then attach a policy to the group that specifies which secrets engines users in the group can access.
   * [Use policy path templating](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating) to configure a policy that specifies which secrets engines users can access when authenticating with the `postman` role.

9. Create a role named `postman` and attach the policy to it. Optionally, if you created a scope with a custom claim earlier, replace the value of `user_claim` with the claim's key name. Learn about the [endpoint for creating a role](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#create-update-role).

   Note that the following example uses the `sub` claim to identify the user when they sign in to HashiCorp Vault. This claim is available in the `openid` scope, and the claim returns the entity ID associated with the user.

   ```shell wordWrap
   vault write auth/postman-jwt/role/postman bound_audiences="<oidc-client-id>" user_claim=sub token_policies=<policy-name> role_type=jwt
   ```

10. If you created a scope with a custom claim earlier, create a new [alias](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/identity) in an existing entity for each user who needs to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault using Postman. The `name` value and `canonical_id` value must be the entity ID for the existing entity where the new alias will be created. The `mount_accessor` value must be the mount accessor associated with the JWT auth method (`postman-jwt`) you created earlier. Learn about the [endpoint for creating an alias](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/entity-alias#create-an-entity-alias).

    ```shell wordWrap
    vault write /identity/entity-alias name="<entity-id>" canonical_id="<entity-id>" mount_accessor="<postman-jwt-accessor>"
    ```

    Once completed, the existing entity will have the alias associated with the `postman-jwt` auth method.

    <Info class="iconless-callout">
      If users authenticated with HashiCorp Vault using Postman before configuring the scope and custom claim, make sure to [delete the entity](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/entity#delete-entity-by-id) associated with the `postman-jwt` auth method.
    </Info>

### Permissions to set up an OIDC identity provider

To set up an OIDC identity provider, you must at least have the permissions specified in the following [HashiCorp Vault policy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policies):

```json wordWrap
path "/identity/oidc/client/*" {
    capabilities=["create", "read"]
}

path "/identity/oidc/provider/*" {
    capabilities=["create", "read"]
}

path "/sys/auth/*" {
    capabilities=["sudo", "update"]
}

path "/auth/*" {
    capabilities=["update", "create"]
}

path "/sys/policy/*" {
    capabilities=["update"]
}
```

* `/identity/oidc/client/*` - Allows you to create and read any OIDC client application in your HashiCorp instance.
* `/identity/oidc/provider/*` - Allows you to create and read any OIDC provider in your HashiCorp instance.
* `/sys/auth/*` - Allows you to create a new auth method. This permission enables you to create a new JSON Web Token (JWT) auth method.
* `/auth/*` - Allows you to update the JWT auth method, and create a new role in the JWT auth method.
* `/sys/policy/*` - Allows you to create a policy. The policy will be used to attach to the new role.

### Download and run the HashiCorp Vault setup script

You can optionally [download the HashiCorp Vault setup script](https://voyager.postman.com/script/hashicorp-setup-script-postman.sh) that will set up your OIDC identity provider in HashiCorp Vault, so you don't have to manually run each command. The script uses the [HashiCorp Vault CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands) to run the commands. Before you run the script, make sure you [install Vault CLI locally](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install) and set the required environment variables.

After the script runs, it prints the values you need to share with Postman to complete the HashiCorp Vault integration.

The script provides options you can use to test and customize the commands. You can add options after you specify the script's filename and Vault cluster URL:

```bash wordWrap
$ hashicorp-setup-script-postman <vault-cluster-url> [options]
```

If your HashiCorp Vault instance is managed in HashiCorp Cloud Platform, replace `<vault-cluster-url>` with the public cluster URL. If it's self-managed, replace `<vault-cluster-url>` with the address of your Vault cluster as a URL and port, such as `https://192.0.2.255:8300`.

| Option            | Details                                                 |

2. From the **Settings** tab, select **Set Up Integration** next to **HashiCorp Vault**.

3. Enter the following on the **Set up HashiCorp Integration** window:

   * **OIDC Provider URL** - Enter the OIDC provider URL of the client application.
   * **JWT Auth Path** - Enter the JWT auth path. If you used the recommended JWT auth path, enter **postman-jwt**.
   * **Client Id** - Enter the OIDC client application's ID.
   * **Role** - Enter the role name. If you used the recommended role name, enter **postman**.
   * **Scope** - Optionally, if you created and configured a new scope with a custom claim, enter the scope's name. This is the scope with the user claim you'd like to identify users when they sign in to HashiCorp Vault with Postman.
   * **Namespace (optional)** - Optionally, enter the [namespace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) where you want users to manage their sensitive data. If you're already using namespaces, Postman recommends creating a new namespace for this integration.

4. Select **Set Up HashiCorp**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Team and Super Admins can edit the HashiCorp Vault integration later. Select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings**, then select **Edit details** next to **HashiCorp Vault** from the **Settings** tab.
</Info>

Once you create the HashiCorp Vault integration, team members can [authenticate with HashiCorp](#authenticate-with-your-hashicorp-account), then [link vault secrets with HashiCorp Vault](#link-vault-secrets-with-hashicorp-vault).

## Authenticate with your HashiCorp account

After a Postman Admin creates the integration, you must authorize Postman to access and retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault.

Postman uses the JSON Web Token (JWT) configured in the [OIDC identity provider](#set-up-an-oidc-identity-provider) to authenticate with HashiCorp. The token is valid in Postman for a specified amount of time set up in HashiCorp Vault.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You'll need to [reauthenticate with HashiCorp](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#reauthenticate-with-an-external-vault) each time you open Postman, or when the JWT expires in Postman.
</Info>

To authenticate with your HashiCorp account, do the following:

1. Open your Postman Vault.
2. If you haven't created an integration with an external vault, select <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Set up external vault** in the top right of your Postman Vault. Otherwise, select <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Use from existing vault**. Then select **HashiCorp Vault**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Optionally, you can select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the top right of your Postman Vault. From the **Settings** tab, select **Connect** next to **HashiCorp Vault**.
   </Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your computer must be able to access your HashiCorp instance.
</Info>

1. You'll be prompted to authorize Postman to access your HashiCorp account. After you grant access, you can close the browser tab and return to Postman.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Don't sign in to HashiCorp Vault using the **Token** auth method because Postman won't be able to retrieve your secrets. You can use any other auth method to sign in, such as **Username** or **Okta**.
   </Info>

## Link vault secrets with HashiCorp Vault

Link a vault secret's value with a secret stored in HashiCorp Vault. This enables you to retrieve a secret stored in HashiCorp Vault directly from Postman. Once you link a vault secret's value, [reference the vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) in your Postman team. The secret is retrieved from HashiCorp Vault when you send the HTTP request that references the vault secret.

Secrets retrieved from HashiCorp Vault aren't stored in your local instance of Postman or the Postman cloud. Learn more about [Postman Vault integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/#about-postman-vault-integrations).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Vault secrets are deleted from your Postman Vault after signing out of Postman. Your vault secrets can't be recovered with your vault key. When you sign in to Postman and open your Postman Vault, you can [reauthenticate with HashiCorp](#authenticate-with-your-hashicorp-account) and link a vault secret's value.
</Info>

To link a vault secret's value with HashiCorp Vault, do the following:

1. In Postman, enter a name for the vault secret, hover over the **Value** cell, click <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Link Vault**, then select **HashiCorp Vault**.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/link-hashicorp-vault-secret-v11-20.jpg" alt="Link HashiCorp value" />

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you've already integrated with an external vault, you can link a secret from a different external vault provider. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add new vault**, then select an external vault.
   </Info>

2. You can use [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp) (HCP) to get the details for linking a secret in Postman:

   1. In HCP, select **Secrets engines** in the left sidebar to view a list of your secrets engines.
   2. Copy the name of the KV secrets engine and enter it as the **Secret Engine** in Postman.
   3. Click the KV secrets engine.
   4. Check the version number tag next to the secrets engine name at the top. Choose this version as the **Secret Engine Version** in Postman.
   5. Click through the secrets engine until you reach the secret you want to link. Copy the path to the secret at the top and enter it as the **Secret Path** in Postman.
   6. Copy the key name for the secret you want to link and enter it as the **Secret Key** in Postman.

3. In Postman, click **Use** to link the secret.

# Manage Postman Vault integrations

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Postman Vault integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Postman supports several features you can use to manage and update your Postman Vault integrations from the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/). You can set the expiration duration for cached secrets, change linked secrets, reauthenticate with your external vaults, and disconnect your integrations. With these features, you can customize settings for retrieving secrets from external vaults, and manage access to Postman Vault integrations.

## Set expiration duration for cached secrets

The value of secrets retrieved from external vaults are stored in a local cache for 1 hour by default. When secrets are cleared from the local cache, Postman retrieves your secrets' values from your external vaults, storing them in a local cache again for the specified duration. You can customize the duration that values are stored in the local cache, and you can manually reset the value stored in the local cache.

You can customize the amount of time secrets' values are stored in a local cache for. Open your Postman Vault, then click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings**. From the **Settings** tab, specify the amount of time secrets are valid for (in minutes) next to **Secret expiration duration**.

You can also manually reset secrets' values stored in a local cache. This ensures that Postman is using the latest values for your secrets. Open your Postman Vault, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings**, then click **Reset Cache** from the **Settings** tab.

## Link a different secret from an external vault

You can link a different secret stored in an external vault you've created an integration with. To link a different secret, open your Postman Vault, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Configure vault** next to a secret, then click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />. Enter the required details on the **Link secret** window, then click **Use**.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/retrieve-different-vault-secret-v11-20.jpg" alt="Link different secret value" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends that you [manually reset the value stored in the local cache](#set-expiration-duration-for-cached-secrets).
</Info>

To update the value of a secret stored in an external vault, you must sign in to your external vault provider and update the secret's value there. You can't update the value of secrets stored in external vaults directly from Postman.

## Reauthenticate with an external vault

You'll need to reauthenticate with your integrated external vaults each time you open Postman, or when your authentication credentials expire.

To reauthenticate with an external vault, do the following:

1. Open your Postman Vault.

2. In the **Value** cell with the integration you need to reauthenticate with, click <img alt="Vault icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-vault-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Link Vault**.

3. Click **Re-authenticate**.&#x20;

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reauth-external-vault-provider-v11-20.jpg" alt="Reauthenticate external vault" />

4. Follow the steps to reauthenticate with [1Password](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/1password/), [AWS Secrets Manager](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/aws-secrets-manager/), [Azure Key Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/azure-key-vault/), or [HashiCorp Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/hashicorp-vault/).

## Disconnect an integration

You can disconnect 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, and Azure Key Vault integrations from your Postman Vault. You must be a Postman [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to disconnect a HashiCorp Vault integration. When you disconnect an integration, references to the vault secret will be unresolved.

To disconnect an integration, do the following:

1. Open your Postman Vault, then click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the upper right.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **Disconnect** next to the integration you want to disconnect.

If you linked a secret stored in an external vault, you can also click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Configure vault** in the **Value** cell, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />, then click <img alt="Sign Out icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-signout-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Disconnect vault**.


# Troubleshoot vault secrets

A [vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/), [vault secret added using Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/), or vault secret linked with an [external vault integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/) can be empty or unresolved in your HTTP requests. An *empty vault secret* is a vault secret that doesn't have a value but is referenced in your request. An empty vault secret may or may not exist in your Postman Vault. An *unresolved vault secret* is a vault secret that exists in your Postman Vault but the value can't be accessed from your request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn about Postman Vault [features that require the Postman desktop app](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/#feature-availability).
</Info>

## View empty and unresolved vault secrets

When you're working on an API request, Postman highlights empty and unresolved vault secret text in red in the **URL builder**, the **Params** tab, the **Authorization** tab, and the **Headers** tab. If your HTTP request has an empty or unresolved vault secret, an exclamation point displays on the <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** icon in the upper-right of the [workbench](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane).

To view all empty or unresolved vault secrets used in a request, do the following:

1. Open a request with empty or unresolved vault secrets, then select <img alt="Variable list icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-variableList-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Variables** to open the variables pane.
2. Under **Variables in request**, review your vault secrets with [empty](#fix-empty-vault-secrets) or [unresolved](#fix-unresolved-vault-secrets) values.

You can also [open your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/) to check if a vault secret exists and should be available from the request.

## Fix empty vault secrets

To fix an empty vault secret that doesn't have a value, you can take the following actions:

* **Enter a value** - The vault secret doesn't have a value. [Enter a value for an empty vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#add-a-vault-secret-reference-to-your-postman-vault) to store it in your Postman Vault. You can [enter a value for a vault secret that doesn't exist](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#set-a-value-for-a-vault-secret-that-doesnt-exist) in your Postman Vault, but the value is only stored locally in the request until you close its tab or sign out of Postman.
* **Update the vault secret's key name** - The vault secret's key name (in the key-value pair) was updated in your Postman Vault, but references to the vault secret use the previous key name. Learn how to [edit the name of the vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#edit-vault-secrets) from your Postman Vault to match the syntax used in your request.
  * (*Vault secrets added using Guided Auth only*) The suffix associated with the vault secret's key name was edited or removed, for example, `:value` in the vault secret `postman-api-key:value`. The suffix must be present in your Postman Vault and in references to the vault secret. If you edit or remove the suffix, it's recommended that you [recreate the vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/#add-authorization-as-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth) using Guided Auth.

![Empty vault secrets](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/empty-vault-secret-v11-14.jpg)

## Fix unresolved vault secrets

To fix an unresolved vault secret that Postman can't access, you can take the following actions:

* **Turn on a vault secret** - The vault secret is turned off in your Postman Vault. Hover over the reference to the secret or <img alt="Error icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-error-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Error** in the variables pane, then select **Enable Secret**. You can also turn on the vault secret from your Postman Vault.
* **Update allowed domains** - The vault secret isn't allowed to be in requests to the domain. Hover over the reference to the secret or <img alt="Error icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-error-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Error** in the variables pane, then select **Update Domains**. Your Postman Vault will open in a new tab, and you can update the allowed domains for the vault secret.
* **Enter your vault key** - You haven't entered your vault key since signing in to Postman. Hover over the reference to the secret or <img alt="Error icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-error-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Error** in the variables pane, enter your vault key, then select **Access Vault**. You can also [open your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/) and enter your vault key.
* **Select a supported Postman Agent** - If you're using an unsupported Postman Agent to send requests from the Postman web app, [use the Desktop or Browser Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#select-a-postman-agent-for-requests), depending on which is best suited for your request. Alternatively, you can also use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

![Unresolved vault secrets](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/unresolved-vault-secret-v11-14.jpg)

To fix an unresolved vault secret that's linked with an [external vault integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/), you can also take the following actions:

* **Use the Postman desktop app** - You must use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) with external vault integrations.
* **Reauthenticate with your external vault** - Postman can't access a vault secret linked with an external vault if the integration isn't connected. This happens when you close and then open Postman, your authentication credentials expire, or you manually [disconnect the integration](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#disconnect-an-integration). To fix this, [reauthenticate with the external vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-postman-vault-integrations/#reauthenticate-with-an-external-vault).
* **Reconfigure your external vault** - Postman can't access a vault secret linked with an external vault if the integration isn't configured correctly. Review the integration configuration to make sure you've entered the required details for retrieving the secret from your external vault provider.
* **Grant permission to access your external vault** - Postman can't access a vault secret linked with an external vault if you don't have permission to access or retrieve secrets from your external vault. Contact the Admin for your external vault provider to verify you have permission to retrieve secrets.


# Capture HTTP traffic and sync cookies in Postman

Capturing HTTP traffic is an important tool for API development and testing. Postman enables you to inspect the requests passing between client applications and your API and save them to a collection. You can use the saved requests to understand how your API is behaving and to assist with debugging.

Postman's built-in proxy and Postman Interceptor provide two ways to capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic in Postman. You can also use the proxy or Interceptor to capture and sync cookies to the Postman cookie jar.

To capture traffic, begin a proxy or Interceptor session. A session represents a specific time frame during which you want to capture traffic. For example, you can capture traffic while a client application is sending a series of requests that you want to observe or debug.

After you stop the session, you can view the captured requests in Postman. You can also use Postman's search and filtering capabilities to narrow down the requests based on the criteria you choose.

## The Postman proxy

A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client application (like a mobile app) and the destination server the client is communicating with (like an API). When the Postman proxy is enabled and a client has been configured to use the proxy, a request from the client goes to Postman first. Postman then forwards the request on to the destination server.

If you start a proxy session while the proxy is enabled, Postman can capture any HTTP or HTTPS traffic passing through the proxy. You can then search or filter the requests, or save them to a collection.

To capture requests using the Postman proxy, view the instructions for your operating system and Postman version:

* If you're on macOS (Postman v10.17 or later) or Windows (Postman v10.18 or later), go to [Capture traffic using the Postman built-in proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-with-proxy/).

* If you're on Linux (all Postman versions), macOS (Postman v10.16 or earlier), or Windows (v10.17 or earlier), go to [Capture HTTP requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/).

* To capture secure HTTPS traffic from a client device like a phone, you need to install the Postman security certificate on the device. To learn more, go to [Capture HTTPS traffic using the Postman built-in proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-https-traffic/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To check which version of Postman you're using, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, click **Settings**, then click **About**.
</Info>

## Postman Interceptor

Postman Interceptor provides another way to capture requests sent between a client and a server. Interceptor uses a browser extension rather than Postman's built-in proxy. With Postman Interceptor, you can capture HTTP and HTTPS requests sent from a web browser.

Learn more about [using Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/).

## Capture and sync cookies

Along with capturing requests, Postman can capture cookies during a proxy or Interceptor session. You can manually add any captured cookies to the [Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) and use them when sending requests from Postman.

Postman's built-in proxy and Interceptor also support continuous cookie syncing. Once enabled, all captured cookies for the domains you specify are automatically synced to the Postman cookie jar.

Learn more about [syncing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).


# Capture traffic using the Postman built-in proxy

If you're using APIs to build client-side applications like mobile and desktop apps or websites, you may want to check the HTTP and HTTPS request traffic sent and received in the app. Sometimes you might discover undocumented APIs. You can capture network traffic, including requests, responses, and cookies, using the proxy that's built into Postman.

## How the built-in proxy works

The Postman desktop app has a built-in proxy that can capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Here's how it works:

1. The Postman desktop app listens for any calls made by a client app or device using the proxy.
2. The Postman proxy captures the request and forwards it to the server.
3. The server returns a response to the Postman proxy, where it can also be saved.
4. The response is returned back to the client.

![Postman capture proxy](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/proxymobile-aa.jpeg)

Similar to the [Interceptor extension](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/), the Postman proxy intercepts and captures your requests. It can also capture responses and cookies.

Starting the Postman proxy begins a *proxy session*, which is a time-bound period of traffic capture. You can pause, restart, and stop a proxy session, then later start another one. Each session is logged in the **History** tab and displays the total session time, a traffic overview, and all traffic captured. You can also send requests and responses to a collection and [save cookies to the Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).

## Using the Postman proxy

In the steps below, you'll use the Postman proxy to inspect HTTP and HTTPS communication going to and from your computer and phone. To get started, make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same local wireless network.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Follow these steps if you're on macOS (Postman v10.17 or later) or Windows (Postman v10.18 or later).** If you're on Linux (all Postman versions), macOS (Postman v10.16 or earlier), or Windows (Postman v10.17 or earlier), go to [Capturing HTTP requests](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/) instead. To check which version of Postman you're using, select <img alt="Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and select **Settings > About**.
</Info>

### Step 1: Start a proxy session

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't use the Postman proxy with the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#web-limitations). Make sure you've installed the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
</Info>

1. Click <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Start Proxy** in the Postman footer.
2. (Optional) Click the port number to change it. By default, the port is set to 5559. Make a note of the port number, as you'll use it later when configuring clients.
3. Click **Start Proxy Session**.

The first time you start a proxy session, Postman installs the **Postman Proxy CA** certificate on your computer. If prompted, enter your computer password to install the certificate. Installing the certificate enables the Postman proxy to capture secure HTTPS traffic sent from browsers and other client apps on your computer.

<img alt="Start a proxy session" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/proxy-start-session-v10-22.jpg" />

### Step 2: Control the proxy session

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't have more than one proxy or Interceptor session running at the same time.
</Info>

When you start the proxy session, the Postman proxy begins capturing traffic sent from your computer. After you start a proxy session, you can pause, restart, or stop it. You can also select what traffic you want to capture during the session.

To control an active proxy session, click <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Proxy active** in the footer to display the proxy session tab. (If the proxy session is paused, click <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Start Proxy** in the footer.) The proxy tab shows the total duration of the session and the size of the data captured.

With the proxy active, open a web browser and navigate to a website, or open an app that communicates with a server. Requests appear in the proxy session tab as they're captured.

From the proxy session tab, you can take the following actions:

* Click **Pause** to temporarily stop capturing traffic, then click **Resume** when you're ready to begin capturing traffic again. When you're finished capturing traffic, click **Stop** to end the proxy session.

* Click **Save responses for requests** to save each request's response along with the captured request.

* Click **Capture cookies** if you want to capture cookies along with requests during the proxy session.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    You can also capture cookies and sync them to Postman without starting a proxy session. Learn more about [syncing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).
  </Info>

* Click <img alt="Sort icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/table-sort-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the column headers to sort the results in ascending or descending order.

* Click <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the column headers to limit the requests and responses that are captured while the session is active. Postman captures requests that match the selected criteria and ignores requests that don't match. You can change the filters at any time during the session:

  * **Status** - Limit captured requests to the selected status codes.
  * **Method** - Limit captured requests to the selected methods.
  * **URL** - Limit captured requests to URLs that match the specified criteria. You can specify text that URLs must contain and can't contain, and you can use regular expressions. Click **Enter** to apply the specified filters. To remove a filter, click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the filter.
  * **Type** - Limit captured requests to the selected content types.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    In responses with a `content-type` that has images, audio, or video, the content is intercepted but not captured. The information captured is response headers, time taken, and the status code.
  </Info>

<img alt="Control a proxy session" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/proxy-control-session-v10-22.jpg" />

### Step 3: View the proxy session results

While your proxy session is running, the proxy session tab shows captured traffic as you use a browser or apps on a client device. You can view the status, method, URL, type, response size, response time, and timestamp for each captured request including.

You can view and work with the proxy session results while the session is active or paused, or after you stop the session.

* To rename the proxy session, click **Proxy debug session** and enter a new name.
* Select the **Requests** tab to view information about incoming requests and responses, or select the **Cookies** tab to view information about captured cookies.
* Use the search box to find specific requests or cookies.

### Step 4: Stop the proxy session

When you're finished capturing traffic, click **Stop** to end the proxy session. To view the proxy session again later, click **History** in the sidebar, then select the proxy session. You can also click <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View Past Sessions** on the proxy session tab.

The **Overview** tab shows summary graphs of traffic captured in the proxy session. Use the dropdown menu to group requests by method, domain, content type, or status code. The header also displays the session start time, session size, duration, and source.

To filter the list of requests, click <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the column headers. Postman displays requests that match the selected filters and hides requests that don't match.

To save captured requests to a collection, do the following:

1. Stop the proxy session if it's still active.
2. Select the checkbox next to the requests you want to save, or select the checkbox in the column header to select all requests.
3. Click **Save Requests**.
4. Select the collection where you want to save the requests, or click **New collection** to create a new collection.
5. Choose how to organize the requests in the collection. You can select the checkboxes to group the requests in folders organized by **Domain name**, **Endpoints**, or both.
6. Click **Save**.

<img alt="Save captured requests to a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/proxy-create-collection-v10-22.jpg" />

### Step 5: Configure the proxy on a client device

You can use the Postman proxy to capture traffic from a client device such as a phone.

1. Start a new proxy session. Click <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Start Proxy** in the Postman footer, then select **Start Proxy Session**.

2. Find the local IP address of the computer running the proxy:

   * On macOS, you can find your computer's IP address in **System Settings > Network**. Select a network interface, and if necessary select **Details > TCP/IP** to view your system's IP address.
   * On Windows, select **Start > Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi** or **Ethernet**, and then select your connection. Your IP address is listed under **Properties**.

3. Open the wireless settings of your client device and update the configuration of the network connection to use an HTTP Proxy. For example, in iOS:

   1. Select **Settings > Wi-Fi**.
   2. Click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to your Wi-Fi connection.
   3. Select **Configure Proxy > Manual**.
   4. Set **Server** and **Port** to the local IP address and proxy port.
   5. Click **Save**.

4. Open a web browser or app on the device, then view captured traffic on the proxy session tab in Postman.

# Capture HTTP requests in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Follow these steps if you're on Linux (all Postman versions), macOS (Postman v10.16 or earlier), or Windows (Postman v10.17 or earlier).** If you're on macOS (Postman v10.17 or later) or Windows (Postman v10.18 or later), go to [Capturing requests with the Postman proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-with-proxy/) instead. To check which version of Postman you're using, select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then select **Settings > About**.
</Info>

When using APIs to build client-side applications like websites or mobile and desktop apps, you may want to inspect HTTP and HTTPS request traffic. Sometimes you might discover undocumented APIs. You can capture network traffic, including requests, responses, and cookies, using the proxy that's built into Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also use the Postman proxy to automatically sync cookies from a browser to the Postman cookie jar. Learn more about [syncing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).
</Info>

## How the built-in proxy works

The Postman app has a built-in proxy that can capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Here's how it works:

1. The Postman app listens for any calls made by a client app or device using the proxy.
2. The Postman proxy captures the request and forwards it to the server.
3. The server returns a response to the Postman proxy, where it can also be saved.
4. The response is returned back to the client.

[![Postman capture proxy](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/proxymobile-aa.jpeg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/proxymobile-aa.jpeg)

Similar to the [Interceptor extension](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/), the Postman app proxy intercepts and captures your requests. It can also capture responses and cookies.

After you start the Postman proxy, you can start a proxy debug session, which is a time-bound session of traffic capture. You can start, pause, and stop a proxy debug session, then later start another one. Each debug session is logged in the **History** tab, and displays the total session time, a traffic overview, and all traffic captured. You can also send requests and responses to a collection, and save cookies to the Postman cookie jar.

## Using the Postman proxy

In the steps below, you'll use the Postman app's proxy to inspect HTTP communication going to and from a phone. To get started, make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same local wireless network.

### Step 1: Enable the proxy

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't use the Postman proxy with the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#web-limitations). Make sure you've installed the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
</Info>

1. Select <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Capture requests** in the Postman footer.

2. In the **Capture requests** window, select the **Via Proxy** tab.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/capture-via-proxy-tab-v9-13.jpg" alt="Capture via proxy tab" width="280px" />

3. In the upper right, select **Enable proxy**.

4. Enter a port number. By default, it's set to port 5555. Make a note of the port number you've used; you'll use it later when configuring clients.

5. Select **Enable Proxy**.

The proxy is running, but it won't capture traffic until you start a proxy debug session.

### Step 2: Start the proxy debug session

After the proxy is running, you can start a proxy debug session. This is a time-bound session where captured traffic is saved in an entry in the **History** tab, and optionally into a collection. Once a proxy debug session begins, you can then pause, restart, or stop it. Before you start the session, you can select what traffic you want to go into it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can only have a single proxy or Interceptor debug session running at the same time.
</Info>

To start a proxy debug session, do the following:

1. Go to the **Via Proxy** tab of the **Capture requests** window.
2. Select **Save Responses for Requests** to save each request's responses. They will be saved along with the captured requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  In responses with a `content-type` that has images, audio, or video, the content is intercepted but not captured. The only information captured is response headers, time taken, and the status code.
</Info>

1. Select **Capture Cookies** to capture cookies in addition to requests during the debug session.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also capture cookies and sync them to Postman without starting a debug session. Learn more about [syncing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).
   </Info>

2. Requests are saved in a debug session in the **History** tab in the sidebar. Select **Save requests to a collection** and select a collection from the list to also save the requests there. To create a new collection in which to save requests, enter a name for the new collection and select **Create**.

3. If you save requests and responses to a collection, they're added chronologically by default. You can alternately group them in folders organized by domain name or endpoints. Under **Organize requests by**, select **Domain name**, **Endpoints**, or both. Your requests and responses are then organized in folders in the selected collection.

4. Under **Configure Incoming Requests**, there are more options you can use to limit the requests and responses captured:

* **URL must contain** - Only capture URLs containing the specified string or regular expression.
* **URL cannot contain** - Don't capture URLs containing the specified string or regular expression.
* **Methods** - Only capture the selected methods.
* **Resources** - Exclude requests with image, JS, or CSS responses.

1. Select **Start Capture**.

The proxy debug session is started, but it won't capture anything until a device is configured with the proxy.

### Step 3: Configure the proxy on a client device

1. Find the local IP address of the machine running the proxy:

   * On macOS, you can find the computer's IP address in **System Preferences > Network**. Select a network interface, and the IP address of your system will be shown on the right:

     <img alt="system preferences" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/osx-network-settings-v9-5.jpg" />

   * On Windows, select **Start > Settings > Network & internet > Wi-Fi** or **Ethernet**. Your IP address is listed under **Properties**.

2. Open the wireless settings of your client device and update the configuration of the network connection to use an HTTP Proxy. For example, in iOS:

   1. Select **Settings > Wi-Fi**.
   2. Select <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to a Wi-Fi connection.
   3. Select **HTTP Proxy > Configure Proxy > Manual**.
   4. Set **Server** and **Port** to the local IP address and proxy port.
   5. Select **Save**.

3. In the Postman app, open the **Proxy debug session** window. Open the device's web browser or application and HTTP traffic will start passing through the app or the browser.

#### Configuring a proxy on other devices

The broader development community has published some useful tutorials for setting up a proxy server on various operating systems:

* [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-a-proxy-server-in-windows-03096c53-0554-4ffe-b6ab-8b1deee8dae1)
* [Linux](https://www.shellhacks.com/linux-proxy-server-settings-set-proxy-command-line/)
* [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2591/mac)
* [Android](https://www.howtogeek.com/295048/how-to-configure-a-proxy-server-on-android/)

### Step 4: Run the proxy debug session

While your capture session is running, the **Proxy Debug Session** window displays captured traffic as you use the browser or apps on the client device.

There are several controls you can use to limit, organize, and investigate traffic as it's captured:

* Select **Proxy debug session** and enter another name to rename the session.
* The **Configure incoming requests** controls at the top of the window enable you to limit captured traffic. Select items from **Methods**, **Status Codes**, **Resources**, and **URL** to limit the traffic. These controls are similar to the ones you set initially in Step 2, but they limit what's being captured, instead of what's going through the proxy.
* Select or deselect **Save Responses for Requests** and **Capture Cookies** to choose whether to collect responses or cookies.
* Select the **Requests** tab to get information about incoming requests and responses, or **Cookies** to get information about captured cookies.
* Use the search box to find specific requests.
* Select **>** next to a request to expand it for more details.
* Select the URL in the **URL** column to open the request as a new API request in Postman.
* Below the request list, there are controls to change the collection where the traffic is being sent, and if it needs to be grouped by domain name or endpoints.

When you select one or more requests from the list on the **Requests** tab, you can use the following controls:

* <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** - Delete the request.

When you select one or more cookies from the list on the **Cookies** tab, you can use the following controls:

* **+ Add to Cookie Jar** - Add the request to the [Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/).
* <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** - Delete the cookie.

The bottom right corner shows the total time of the capture session, along with the total size of captured traffic. If you want to temporarily stop the capture session, select **Pause**. To restart the session, select **Resume**.

### Step 5: Stop the debug session and proxy

When you're done with your debug session, select **Stop** in the lower right corner. This stops the session, and results of the debug session is saved in the **History** tab.

After stopping the session, the proxy is still running. Select <img alt="Capture icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-capture-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Capture requests** in the Postman footer, and you can either start another debug session, or select **Disable proxy** to turn off the proxy.

### Step 6: View the proxy debug session results

After completing a debug session, details from the session are located in the **History** tab, named **Proxy debug session**. When you open a saved debug session, the top header displays the session start time, total size, duration, and source.

The **Overview** tab displays summary graphs of the traffic captured in the session. You can select graphs summarizing traffic by method, domain, data mode, or return status code.

The **Requests** and **Cookies** tabs display requests, responses, and cookies, similar to the same tabs available during a capture session. The same options for searching, expanding, saving, and deleting items described in Step 4 are available. You can also add selected requests to a collection. Use the controls at the bottom of the table to limit the number of items per page and view the pages of results.

You can rename a proxy debug session by selecting the name at the top of the window and entering a new name. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the debug session name to rename or delete the session.

## Next steps

To also capture HTTPS data from your client devices, you'll need to add a certificate to the client. See [Capturing HTTPS traffic](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-https-traffic/) for more details.


# Capture HTTPS traffic using the Postman built-in proxy

In addition to capturing HTTP traffic, you can use the Postman's built-in proxy to inspect HTTPS communication from your Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows devices.

You must install the `postman-proxy-ca.crt` certificate on your device to be able to capture secure HTTP traffic. First, [set up the proxy in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/). Then follow the instructions below to install the required security certificate on the target devices.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can deactivate or remove the certificate from your device if you no longer need to capture HTTPS requests.
</Info>

## Windows

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on Windows and using Postman v10.18 or later, the Postman security certificate is automatically installed on your computer the first time you start the proxy. Also, you don't need to install OpenSSL. To learn more, go to [Capturing requests with the Postman proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-with-proxy/).
</Info>

Before you install the `postman-proxy-ca.crt` certificate, you must install the OpenSSL module.

### Installing OpenSSL on Windows

Postman uses **OpenSSL** to generate certificate-key pairs. For Postman to be able to generate the `postman-proxy-ca.crt` certificate, the OpenSSL module must be installed on your computer and accessible through the command line.

OpenSSL is already installed for macOS and is typically installed for Linux. For Windows systems, you must install OpenSSL manually.

To install OpenSSL for Windows systems, do the following:

1. Download and install the [OpenSSL v1.1.1 installer](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) for your operating system version. OpenSSL v1.x is required to generate certificates. Later versions of OpenSSL aren't supported at this time.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     During installation, make sure to select the option to copy the OpenSSL DLLs to the **OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory**.
   </Info>

2. Open the Windows **Start** menu, search for **Environment Variables**, and select **Open**.

3. On the **System Properties** window, select **Environment Variables**.

4. Select **Path** under **User variables**, and then select **Edit**.

   ![download OpenSSL installer](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/windows-environment-variables-edit-browse-bb.jpg)

5. Select **Browse**.

6. Find and select **This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Program Files > OpenSSL-Win64 > bin**.

   ![download OpenSSL installer](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/windows-oppssl-environment-variables-bin.jpg)

7. Select **OK** to add the folder directory. Then select **OK** to confirm changes and close the remaining windows.

8. Open the Windows command line. To do this, open the **Start** menu, search for **cmd**, and select **Open**. On the command line, enter the command `openssl version` to confirm that installation was successful. The output will be similar to the following:

   `OpenSSL 1.1.1l  24 Aug 2021`

# Capture traffic from a web browser using Postman Interceptor

Postman Interceptor is a browser extension that acts as a companion to Postman. Interceptor enables you to capture API traffic, including requests and cookies, from a web browser. After capturing requests or cookies, you can view and work with them in Postman.

To get started, install the Interceptor extension. You can then start an *Interceptor session*, which is a time-bound period of traffic capture. You can pause, restart, and stop an Interceptor session, then later start another one. Each session is logged in your Postman **History** and displays the total session time, a traffic overview, and all traffic captured. When you're finished, you can save captured requests and responses in a collection, or save captured cookies in the Postman cookie jar.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also use Postman Interceptor to automatically sync cookies from a web browser to the Postman cookie jar. Learn more about [syncing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/syncing-cookies/).
</Info>

## Install Interceptor

Use the links below to download and install the latest version of the Interceptor extension for your web browser. Interceptor is available for the following browsers:

* [Google Chrome](https://go.pstmn.io/interceptor-chrome)
* [Apple Safari](https://go.pstmn.io/interceptor-safari)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://go.pstmn.io/interceptor-firefox)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://go.pstmn.io/interceptor-edge)

To open the Interceptor extension, select the Interceptor icon in your browser's toolbar.

## Start an Interceptor session

Start an Interceptor session to capture traffic and cookies from your web browser. After you stop the session, captured traffic opens in Postman. All communication between Interceptor and Postman is encrypted.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't have more than one proxy or Interceptor session running at the same time.
</Info>

To start an Interceptor session, do the following:

## Install Interceptor Bridge

Depending on which version of the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) you're using, you may need to install Interceptor Bridge before you can use Postman Interceptor:

* If you're using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app), you can skip this step. You don't need Interceptor Bridge.
* If you're on macOS (Postman v10.17.4 or later) or Windows (Postman v10.18 or later), you can skip this step. Interceptor Bridge is built into your version of Postman.
* If you're on Linux (all Postman versions), macOS (Postman v10.16 or earlier), or Windows (Postman v10.17 or earlier), you must install Interceptor Bridge before you can capture requests and cookies.

To check which version of Postman you're using, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header and select **Settings > About**.

# Sync cookies using Postman Interceptor and the Postman proxy

Postman enables you to capture and sync cookies from a web browser or another client application to the [Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/). You can sync cookies using either the Postman proxy or Postman Interceptor at any time, without having to start a [proxy or Interceptor session](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-overview/).

Once configured, Postman continuously captures cookies from the browser or client applications. For the domains you specify, captured cookies are automatically synced to the Postman cookie jar. You can then [use the cookies](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/) when sending requests from Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also capture requests and cookies during a proxy or Interceptor session.

# GraphQL in Postman

Postman can make requests using GraphQL, an open-source query language and runtime for APIs.

## About GraphQL

APIs that support GraphQL enable clients to ask the server for only the data they need, using GraphQL's powerful query language and runtime. Unlike REST, which uses multiple endpoints to access different data sets, GraphQL streamlines querying by accessing all data through a single endpoint.

GraphQL is schema-driven, providing insight into an API's functionality and reducing dependency between teams building the client and the server. A client can introspect the schema from the server to see the available data fields, and then send queries specifying which fields to retrieve or manipulate. The server returns or modifies only the data requested in the query, which prevents fetching too much or too little data.

## GraphQL requests

Every GraphQL request has a URL and a query. The URL is the endpoint where the data is hosted, and the query defines what data to retrieve or manipulate. The API's schema defines available data fields. The request can also contain authentication, headers, and settings based on the requirements specified by the API.

GraphQL requests can perform three types of operations:

* **Query** - Retrieves data from the server. Queries specify the required data fields and can include arguments for more precise data retrieval.

* **Mutation** - Manipulates data on the server, including creating, updating, or deleting records. Mutations specify the fields to be returned after the operation and use arguments to detail the manipulation.

* **Subscription** - Gets real-time data updates from the server. Subscriptions enable clients to listen to specific data fields and receive updates automatically over a persistent connection.

## The Postman GraphQL client

Postman's [GraphQL client](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-interface/) loads automatically when you create a new GraphQL request. The GraphQL client interface is specifically designed for crafting GraphQL requests, enabling you to explore an API's data fields and construct queries by selecting fields.

GraphQL requests and [multi-protocol collections and folders](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections) can also contain scripts that you write to perform API tests. These can be run before a query or after a response. To learn more, see [Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also make GraphQL requests using Postman's HTTP request interface. To learn more, see [Make a GraphQL call with an HTTP request](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-http/).
</Info>


# Create GraphQL requests in Postman

Use Postman's GraphQL client to create GraphQL requests with one or multiple queries. The GraphQL client interface is specifically designed for crafting GraphQL requests. It enables you to explore a GraphQL API's data fields and construct queries by selecting fields or entering code in an editor. For requests with multiple queries, you can select specific queries and run them individually.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also create GraphQL requests [with Postman's HTTP interface](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-http/), which supports GraphQL but requires more steps than the GraphQL client.
</Info>

## Create a GraphQL request with one query

This example creates and runs a GraphQL query using the schema explorer.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using the Postman web app, you must use the Postman Desktop Agent. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

1. In Postman, click **New > GraphQL** to open a request in a new tab. (In the Postman desktop app, you can also press **⌘+N** or **Ctrl+N**, then click **GraphQL**.)
2. Click the URL box, then select `https://graphql.postman-echo.com/graphql` from the dropdown list. Postman uses introspection to load the schema and populate the schema explorer with data fields.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     In the schema explorer, the data fields are grouped under their respective types: **Query**, **Mutation**, and **Subscription**.
   </Info>
3. In the schema explorer, select the `hello` checkbox, then select the `person`, `name`, and `age` checkboxes. A query based on your selections appears in the query editor.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also build a query by entering code in the query editor.
   </Info>
4. Enter your age and name in the text boxes next to `age` and `name` or in the query editor.
5. Click **Query**.

   ![GraphQL request with a single query](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-single-query-v11-62.png)

## Create a GraphQL request with multiple queries

This request has multiple queries and runs them one at a time. To run only the selected query, select a checkbox in the schema explorer and click **Query**.

1. In Postman, click **New > GraphQL** to open a request in a new tab. (In the Postman desktop app, you can also press **⌘+N** or **Ctrl+N**, then click **GraphQL**.)

2. Click the URL box, then select `https://graphql.postman-echo.com/graphql` from the dropdown list. Postman uses introspection to load the schema and populate the schema explorer with data fields.

3. In the schema explorer, select the `hello`, `person`, and `name` checkboxes. Enter your name in the `name` field. A query appears in the query editor.

4. In the schema explorer, scroll down and select the `greetings` checkbox. A second query appears in the query editor and the first query is dimmed.

5. In the query editor, click anywhere in the first query to activate it and click **Query**.

6. Click anywhere in the second query and click **Query**.

   ![GraphQL request with multiple queries](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-multi-query-v11-62.png)

   You can also use the **Query** button dropdown list to browse and select queries from a request with multiple queries.

# The GraphQL client interface

Postman has a special client for GraphQL requests called the GraphQL client. When you create a GraphQL request in Postman, the GraphQL client loads automatically. The GraphQL client has features that enable you to create and run GraphQL requests more efficiently.

The GraphQL client automatically fetches a GraphQL API's schema and uses introspection to show you the available data fields. You can explore a GraphQL API's data fields and construct queries by selecting fields or entering code in an editor. For requests with multiple queries, you can select specific queries and run them individually.

The GraphQL client interface has three main sections:

* The request section
* The response section
* The right sidebar

![Different sections of a GraphQL request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-request-full-view-v11-2.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you are using the Postman web app, you must use the Postman Desktop Agent. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

## The request section

In the GraphQL client's request section, you can enter an endpoint in the URL box as you would in the regular Postman request interface. But the GraphQL client adds GraphQL-specific features, including an interactive schema explorer.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-request-section-v11-4.jpg" alt="The request section" />

* **Protocol dropdown list** - Change the protocol for a new request. Click the protocol dropdown list then select a request protocol.

  <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/change-protocol-v10-22.jpg" alt="Change protocol" width="256" />

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    You can't change the request protocol after you save the request.
  </Info>

* **URL box** - Enter the GraphQL server's URL here. You can also select this to browse URLs you've already used.

* **Tabs** - The following tabs are available:
  * **Query** - The **Query** tab has three subsections: the schema explorer, the query editor, and the variables editor.
  * **Authorization** - You can enter authorization credentials here. You can choose from a list of auth types including API key, basic auth, and bearer token. Learn more about [authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/).
  * **Headers** - The **Headers** tab enables you to pass headers with the request in the form of key-value pairs. The client uses these headers to provide information about the call to the server.
  * **Schema** - The **Schema** tab enables you to select an API and save it to the request. You can use GraphQL introspection, select an API from a Postman workspace, or import a schema from a local file or a URL. You can also select a specific published release of an API. The GraphQL client populates the schema explorer with fields from the chosen schema.
  * **Scripts** - The **Scripts** tab accesses Postman's powerful scripting environment that enables you to add JavaScript code (scripts) to your GraphQL requests. Use scripts to write API tests, debug your requests by logging them to the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/), or dynamically read or update the values of [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). You can [import packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) with scripts and tests from your team's Postman Package Library. You can also [import packages from external package registries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/), such as npm and JSR.

* **Schema explorer** - When you enter a GraphQL server's endpoint in the **URL box**, the endpoint's schema appears here. The schema explorer is also an interactive visual query editor where you can browse and select fields and arguments to [build queries](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-first-request/#create-a-graphql-request-with-one-query) in the query editor.

* **Save** - Saves the request to a collection. GraphQL requests can't be saved to collections that contain HTTP requests.

* **Share** - Collaborate with team members, groups, and external users by sharing your requests with them. Learn more at [Share your work in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/).

* **Query** - Runs the selected query. If there are multiple queries, a dropdown list is available where you can select individual queries to run.

* **Query editor** - Build and edit queries here. You can enter queries manually or build them with the schema explorer. You can [create multiple queries](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-first-request/#create-a-graphql-request-with-multiple-queries) in the query editor and run them individually.

* **Variables editor** - Create and edit your request's variables here. The variables editor is collapsed by default. Select the arrow next to **Variables** to expand it.

## The response section

When you run a query, the response from the server appears here. The GraphQL client's response section is similar to Postman's regular [response viewer](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/).

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/graphql-response-v10-20.jpg" alt="The response section" />

The GraphQL client response section has the following tabs:

* **Body** - Shows the data returned by the server for the fields in the query. You can format the body with **Pretty** and **Table**.
* **Headers** - Shows headers returned by the server.
* **Test Results** - Shows results for assertions in the scripts section. Results can be one of three types: Passed, Failed, or Skipped.

### Multiple responses

For subscription-type queries that return multiple responses over a persistent connection, the response section shows a list of messages in reverse chronological order, with the most recent message at the top. The messages can contain responses from the server or other information about the request like subscription confirmations or completion messages.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/graphql-multiple-responses-v10-20.jpg" alt="Multiple responses" />

Select a message to expand it and see its contents. You can search for specific messages with the search icon <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-search-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px" />. You can also filter for all messages, responses only, or other types of messages. Select **Clear messages** to remove all the messages from the response section. You can select **Restore** to show them again.

## The right sidebar

The GraphQL client's right sidebar gives you access to documentation, comments, and information about your request.

* **Documentation** - View descriptions of the fields and arguments in your query. Postman automatically generates detailed documentation tailored to each request, pulling relevant descriptions and type information from the schema. You can add descriptions by selecting **Add description** then entering your content using [Postman's built-in editing tools](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor). You can also select **Generate with Postbot** to use [Postman's AI assistant](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/) to document your request.
* **Comments** - Select the comments icon	<img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-comments-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> to collaborate with your teammates as you work on an API. You can use `@` to tag others to ask a question, give feedback, and discuss your API.
* **Info** - Select the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> to view details about your request, like the request ID and creation date.

## Next steps

After learning about the basic interface elements, try [making your first GraphQL query](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-first-request/).


# Make a GraphQL call with an HTTP request

Postman's [GraphQL client](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-overview/) is tailored for making GraphQL requests, but you can also create GraphQL requests using Postman's [HTTP request interface](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/). The HTTP request interface might be better for some use cases, like working with legacy systems or projects that include both GraphQL and non-GraphQL APIs.

## Use Postman's HTTP request for GraphQL

Postman has built-in support for [sending GraphQL queries in the request body](#send-graphql-queries-in-the-http-request-body), [using GraphQL variables](#use-graphql-variables), and [introspection and importing GraphQL schemas](#import-graphql-schemas).

### Send GraphQL queries in the HTTP request body

1. Click **New > HTTP** and enter a GraphQL endpoint URL in the URL box.
2. Select **POST** from the request method dropdown list.
3. Under the **Body** tab, select the **GraphQL** body type.
4. Enter your GraphQL query in the **Query** editor. The editor enables you to write and edit queries and variables separately.
5. Click **Send**.

   <img alt="Select the GraphQL body type" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-http-query-v11.jpg" />

### Use GraphQL variables

1. Enter your GraphQL variables in the **GraphQL variables** editor.
2. In the **Query** editor, declare the GraphQL variable in your query. For more information on how to use GraphQL variables, see the [GraphQL variables documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).

### Import GraphQL schemas

To enable autocompletion while writing queries, your request needs a GraphQL schema. When you enter a GraphQL endpoint URL in the URL box, Postman automatically fetches the GraphQL schema using introspection. When Postman successfully auto-fetches a schema, a notification appears next to the schema selection list. If your schema has changed, click the refresh icon <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px" /> to pull in the changes.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-autofetch-schema-v11.jpg" alt="GraphQL auto-fetch schema" width="280px" />

You also have the option to manually import a schema into your request. After [creating or importing a GraphQL API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/creating-an-api/) into your workspace, you can use that API's schema for your request instead of the auto-fetched schema.

To import a GraphQL schema into your request manually, do the following:

1. [Create or import a GraphQL API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/creating-an-api/) in your workspace.
2. Click **New > HTTP** and enter a GraphQL endpoint URL in the URL box.
3. Select **POST** from the request method dropdown list.
4. Under the **Body** tab, select the **GraphQL** body type.
5. Click the arrow next to **Auto Fetch** to open the schema selection dropdown list.
6. Select your schema from the dropdown list.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You may need to refresh by clicking the refresh icon <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px" />.
</Info>

When you write your query, Postman suggests autocomplete options from the data in the selected GraphQL schema.

## Use JSON in the request body

1. Open a new request tab in Postman and enter your GraphQL endpoint URL in the address field.
2. Select **POST** from the request method dropdown list.
3. Under the **Headers** tab, add the `Content-type` of `application/json`.
4. Under the **Body** tab, select the **raw** body type. Choose **JSON** from the format dropdown list.
5. Construct your query in the request body using proper JSON formatting.

## Use a GraphQL content type header

1. Click **New > HTTP** and enter a GraphQL endpoint URL in the URL box.

2. Select **POST** from the request method dropdown list.

3. Under the **Body** tab, select the **GraphQL** body type.

4. Under the **Headers** tab, add the `Content-type` of `application/graphql`.

   ![Set the content-type header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-http-content-type-v11.jpg)

5. Under the **Body** tab, select the **raw** body type. Choose **Text** from the format dropdown list.

6. Build your query in the request body using standard GraphQL formatting.

   ![GraphQL query request body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/graphql-http-content-type-body-v11.jpg)

## Import the query as a cURL request

1. Click **Import**.
2. Paste your cURL command in the request bar. Your cURL command must contain a GraphQL endpoint URL and must specify the `POST` request method. Postman opens the request in a new tab with the specified GraphQL endpoint URL and the `POST` request method selected.


# Manage gRPC APIs using Postman

Postman can make requests using *gRPC*, a schema-driven Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework often used to enable inter-service communication. Using a gRPC request, you can view supported services and methods (with a service definition), invoke the method of your interest, send a message payload, view the response from the server, and save example responses without entering commands in the terminal or writing any code.

Because it's RPC-based, gRPC facilitates client-server communication over a function call and provides easier abstraction than HTTP, support across multiple languages, and high performance.

gRPC uses [protobuf (protocol buffers)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface (service definition). This definition serves as a contract between the client and the server that specifies the supported services and methods.

Postman's [gRPC client interface](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-request-interface/) enables you to use and test your gRPC requests. You can also [manage your service definitions](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/) and [save gRPC example request-response pairs](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-grpc-examples/) for testing and demonstration purposes.

Postman also enables you to use scripts to write API tests, debug your gRPC requests, and dynamically read or update the values of variables. For more information, see [Test and debug values in gRPC requests using JavaScript in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/scripting-in-grpc-request/). You can also [use a mock server](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-grpc-mock/) to simulate the behavior of a real API by returning sample data for gRPC requests to the API endpoints.


# The gRPC client interface

Postman's gRPC client interface provides a variety of specialized tools, views, and controls for invoking and testing gRPC requests. For example, it includes a dropdown list that shows the methods available on the server. This topic highlights the various parts of the gRPC client interface and how to use them.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/grpc-request-v11-1.jpg" alt="gRPC request interface" />

## Create a new request

Click **New** in the sidebar to create a new gRPC request. Select **gRPC** from the list to open a blank gRPC request in a new tab.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-grpc-v11-1.jpg" alt="New gRPC request" />

## The request section

The request section includes the required configurations to connect to the server and run the selected method. Requests need a server URL, a service definition, and a selected method to be invoked. Based on the API requirements, you may have to include message payloads, metadata, and authorization details with the request. You may also have to configure TLS and other certificates based on the requirements.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/grpc-request-sections-v11-4.jpg" alt="Request pane" />

* **Request name** - To test multiple requests with different configurations, you can name each of them individually and save them into a collection. Saving into a collection enables you to reuse the requests later and share them with others.

* **Server URL** - Defines the server's hosted endpoint. A gRPC URL often starts with `grpc://` instead of `http://` or `https://`. While creating a new request, you can also browse through URLs you've used by selecting the URL box. This helps you create the request faster if you're testing multiple methods on the same endpoint.

  <Tip title="Tip">
    Alternatively, you can paste a gRPCurl command.
  </Tip>

* **Switch request type** - Select the method you wish to invoke using the **Switch request type** dropdown list. The service's definition populates the list of methods. For more details about the method types, see [About gRPC API requests](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/first-grpc-request/#about-grpc-api-requests).

* **Request actions** - Click <img alt="Down icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to view a list of request actions:

  * **Save As** - Saves the request into a collection so that you can reuse it later or share it with others. gRPC requests can only be saved to [multi-protocol collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections).

* **Share** - Collaborate with team members, groups, and external users by sharing your requests with them. Learn more at [Share your work in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/).

  * **Share** - Select how you want to share the gRPC request with your team. To include an environment with the request, click **Include environment** and select an environment.

  * **Copy link** - Click <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy link** to copy the link to the request to share with your team.

* **Invoke** - Once you have entered the server URL, selected a method, and defined the payload, click **Invoke** to invoke the request and get a response from the server.

* **Payload** - Contains the data to send in the request to the server. A gRPC payload has the following tabs to aid the server in running the request:

  * **Message** - Compose a message in JSON to send with the request. The server uses this message to perform appropriate actions and gives you a response in return.

  * **Authorization** - Pass credentials that the server uses to authorize the connection. Choose from a list of auth types, including **API Key**, **Basic Auth**, **Bearer Token**, and **OAuth 2.0**. Learn more about [authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/).

  * **Metadata** - Pass metadata with the request in the form of key-value pairs. The client uses the metadata to provide information about the call to the server.

  * **Service definition** - A service definition informs the client of all server-supported services, methods, message payload structures, and fields and data types. A service definition is loaded automatically after you enter the URL if the server supports server reflection. Otherwise, you must load a service definition manually by selecting or importing a `.proto` file. Learn more about [working with service definitions](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/).

  * **Scripts** - Postman has a powerful scripting environment that enables you to add JavaScript code (scripts) to your gRPC requests. Use scripts to perform API tests, debug your requests with the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-in-the-console), or dynamically read or update the values of [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). You can [import packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) with scripts and tests from your team's Postman Package Library. You can also [import packages from external package registries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/), such as npm and JSR. Learn more about [scripting in gRPC requests](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/scripting-in-grpc-request/).

  * **Settings** - Customize the gRPC request's behavior with various options to meet your security and performance requirements. These options include:

    * **Enable server certificate verification** - Verify the server certificate when invoking a method over a secure connection.
    * **Overwrite server name for certificate verification** - Configure the value used to validate the common name in the server certificate.
    * **Include fields with default values in the response** - View response fields with default values. Turning this off will omit such fields from the response.
    * **Maximum response message size** - The maximum allowed message size, in megabytes. To receive messages of any size, set this value to 0.
    * **Connection Timeout** - Configure the deadline to invoke and receive the response, in milliseconds. To keep the connection open indefinitely, set this value to 0.

* **Switch request type** - You can change the protocol for a new request. Click **New** in the sidebar, then select a request protocol, or click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add** to open a new tab. Click **Switch request type** next to the request's name, then select a different request protocol.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    You can't change the request protocol after you click **Save**.
  </Info>

* **Enable TLS** - Click <img alt="Lock icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-lock-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Enable TLS** to turn on transport layer security (TLS) for the request. Enabling TLS encrypts the data between the client and the server. Some servers require TLS.

* **Message actions** - Click <img alt="Pretty icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pretty-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Beautify** to make the composed JSON message more readable with advanced formatting. Click <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Use Example Message** to create an example message using the schema once you have selected the method to invoke.

## The response section

After invoking a method, the response data sent from the server appears in the response area.

The response section has the following items:

* **Response** - The information returned by the server after a successful request run.

  * **Wrap lines** - Click <img alt="Wrap icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-wrap-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Wrap lines** to adjust the width of the response body according to the width of the response area. This makes it easier to read longer responses without scrolling.

* **Metadata** - The response's metadata containing information about the run.

* **Trailers** - Trailers are metadata sent by the server at the end of a response stream.

* **Test results** - The results for assertions you write in the **Scripts** section appear here. Based on the post-response script, the results can be Passed, Failed, and Skipped. Learn more about [scripting in gRPC requests](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/scripting-in-grpc-request/).

* **Status code and Time** - Contains information about performance and if the request succeeded. You can assess the performance of the API using the time, which displays how long the request took to process. The status code provides information about the request's success or errors. The **0 OK** status code means the request succeeded. In the event of an error, a gRPC-based implementation returns different status codes for different error scenarios which help you understand the cause.

* **Save Response** - You can save your gRPC request responses as [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/). For streaming methods, you must end streaming before you can save an example. See [Save, edit, and share gRPC request-response examples](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-grpc-examples/) to learn more.

* **Search** - Click <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-search-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Search** to find specific text in the response.

* **Multiple responses** - While invoking a streaming method type (client streaming, server streaming, or bidirectional streaming), the client-server communication within a single session is recorded in the response area as a series of sent and received messages in a timeline instead of a single response.

  * **Connection status** - The connection status displays whether connection with the server is active and if messages are streaming.

  * **Message stream** - The message stream contains the list of sent, received, and informative messages arranged in reverse chronological order (latest appears on the top).

  * **Expand or collapse message** - Click <img alt="Down icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to view a message's contents in the message stream.

  * **Search** - Use the text box to search for specific messages.

  * **Message filter** - Click <img alt="Down icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to adjust the view based on the type of message. Instead of all messages, you can choose to view only sent or received messages.

  * **Clear Messages** - Hides all messages from the view, cleaning up the response area so that you can focus on the new messages. Click **Restore** to restore of all messages.

  * **End Streaming** - Appears when you invoke a method that sends multiple messages from the client. Click **End Streaming** to conclude the streaming operation between the client and the server.

  * **Send** - Appears when invoking a method that sends multiple messages from the client. Click **Send** to send the request message to the server.

## The right sidebar

In the right sidebar, you can access your gRPC request's documentation, comments, and request details.

* **Documentation** - Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Documentation** to view the request's documentation. When you select a method, Postman automatically generates documentation for the payload fields and data types using the protobuf definition. You can also add a description to help users understand and use the request. Click **Add request description**, then write your content using Postman's [built-in editing tools](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/). Or click <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open Agent** to write content with the [Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/).

# Invoke a gRPC request in Postman

This guide describes how to create and invoke a gRPC request in Postman using the Postman Echo service for gRPC. The procedure below uses a unary method and shows how to add an example message to your request. There are also some troubleshooting tips in case you encounter any issues.

## About gRPC API requests

APIs provide a structured way for one application to access the capabilities of another application. Typically, this communication happens over the internet by way of an API server. A client application (like a mobile app) sends a request to the server, and after the request processes, the server returns a response to the client.

A gRPC request consists of the server URL where the service is hosted, the method to be invoked on the server, and a request payload that has the message and required information on how the request will be run. Since gRPC is a schema-driven framework, the request also needs to have a service definition (schema) reference that has information on the services, methods, message fields, and data types supported by the server. The client must follow the service definition to avoid errors.

The Postman API client supports four types of gRPC methods that enable the client and server to interact in different ways depending on the required use case:

* **Unary** - This is the traditional request-response communication pattern also seen in HTTP where the client makes a request and the server returns a response.

* **Client streaming** - The client sends a series of messages to the server and the server returns a response after processing them.

* **Server streaming** - The client makes a single request and the server returns a response with a stream of messages.

* **Bidirectional streaming** - The client and server communicate with each other asynchronously over a persistent session.

## Creating and invoking a request

This example creates and runs a unary request. To learn about invoking the other method types, see [The gRPC interface](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-request-interface/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you are using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

1. In a Postman workspace, click **New > gRPC** to open a request in a new tab.

   <img alt="New gRPC request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-grpc-v11.65.jpg" />

2. Enter a URL in the request URL box. For this example, use the Postman Echo service for gRPC, which is `grpc.postman-echo.com`.

3. Click **Select a method** and browse through the supported services and methods. When you enter the URL, Postman automatically loads the service definition using server reflection (if supported by the server). If server reflection isn't supported on the server, you have to load the service definition manually. Learn more about [working with service definitions](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/).

4. From the list of methods, select **SayHello**. This is a unary method.

5. In the **Message** area, click **Use Example Message**. This creates an example message using the service definition itself so that you don't have to set the correct fields and data types.

6. Replace the sample string data with your name (or any other string) and click **Invoke**.

Once the method is invoked, the server processes the information passed and returns a response.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a problem with a gRPC request, the following troubleshooting steps may help you identify and resolve the issue:

* **Service unavailable** The server you're using is unreachable with the current client settings. If you've confirmed the server is working, check the TLS settings in the client. By default, TLS is turned off.

* **Server reflection failed** Check if server reflection is supported by the server, check the TLS settings of the request, or retry server reflection by using **Service definition > Use server reflection > Try again**.

* **Switch to Postman Desktop Agent to connect with a gRPC server** To use all of Postman's gRPC features, you must run the Postman Desktop Agent. Learn more about [installing the Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent).

For more troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshoot app issues](/docs/introduction/troubleshooting-inapp/) and [Debug API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

## Next steps

Try invoking some other methods available on `grpc.postman-echo.com` and see how things act differently.

When you're done, learn about [managing service definitions for gRPC requests](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/).


# Manage service definitions for gRPC requests in Postman

gRPC is a schema-driven framework. This means the client and server must adhere to a standard agreement (schema) while invoking and running a request. A service definition enables this. On the client side, a service definition makes the client aware of the server's supported services, methods, fields, data types, and message payload structure. Anything that doesn't follow the regulations enforced by the service definition results in an error. During the request run, the service definition is used to serialize the information exchanged between both parties.

gRPC uses [protobuf (protocol buffers)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the service definition. While creating a gRPC request, you need to add a service definition to the request (or use server reflection) before selecting a method to invoke. You can configure the service definition from the **Service definition** tab in a gRPC request.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/service-definition-tab-v11.jpg" alt="Service definition tab" />

While creating a new request, if a service definition isn't configured or available through server reflection, Postman prompts you to configure it when you click the **Method selection** dropdown list. This interface serves as a quick way to add your service definition and move on to invoking your request. From this menu, you can select a protobuf API available in your workspace or import a new one from your local system.

To load a service definition to the request, you can either use server reflection to load the service definition, or use a protobuf API as the service definition.

## Use server reflection

If enabled by the server, server reflection can be the easiest way to add a service definition to the client. It fetches the latest information available in the schema from the server without requiring you to manually load a `.proto` file or create a protobuf schema. Enter the URL, and Postman automatically loads the service definition.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/using-server-reflection-v11.jpg" alt="Using service definition" />

## Use a protobuf API

If server reflection isn't enabled by the server, you can use a protobuf API as a service definition for the request. For this, you can either select an existing protobuf API in your workspace or import a `.proto` file as a protobuf API into Postman.

### Select an existing protobuf API from the workspace

Go to the **Service definition** tab and click **Select a Protobuf schema or paste a link to one**. This opens the **API selection** dropdown list where you can browse through the available APIs and select the one you want to use.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/method-selection-dropdown-v11-1.jpg" alt="Using a protobuf API from the workspace" />

While testing the services, you can also switch to a different version of the selected API by clicking the **Version** selector next to the API name.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/version-selector-v11-1.jpg" alt="Changing an API version in the request" />

### Import a .proto file

If you don't have the protobuf API available in your workspace, you can also import a `.proto` file as a protobuf API into Postman and use it as a service definition.

To import a `.proto` file, do the following:

1. Go to the **Service definition** tab and click **Import a .proto file**.

2. You can drag and drop a `.proto` file from your local system or click **Choose a File** to open the file explorer.

3. Once you have selected the file, click **Next**. This takes you to the **Import as API** interface.

4. Give your new API a name, add a version name, and click **Import as API**.

This creates a new protobuf API from the `.proto` file and uses it in the request as a service definition.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also import the `.proto` file as an update to an existing API. While on the **Import as API** interface, you can select an API from the list of available APIs in the workspace and add the `.proto` file as a new version. You can also replace it with an existing version by selecting an existing version from the list.
</Info>

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/import-proto-file-v11-2.jpg" alt="Importing a proto file" />

Instead of importing a `.proto` file from your local system, you can also fetch a `.proto` file from a URL by entering the URL into the import interface instead of clicking **Choose a File**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman supports importing of multi-file schemas. You can import `.proto` files containing `import` directives referring to other files.
</Info>

### Store a .proto file in your working directory

To foster collaboration on `.proto` files and ensure consistent file paths across team members, you can use the Postman [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory). By storing `.proto` files in the working directory, you and your team can share and collaborate on service definitions without needing to manually re-import files for each user. When a `.proto` file is imported from the working directory, it ensures that shared requests or collections referencing the file work across everyone's system, provided that all team members have the respective `.proto` file in their configured working directory. This setup is useful when collaborating in shared workspaces or when using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) for automated testing.

On macOS and Linux, you can find the default working directory at `~/Postman/files`. On Windows, you can find the default working directory at `%userprofile%\Postman\files` (File Explorer and Command Prompt) or `~/Postman/files` (PowerShell).

### Add import paths

Sometimes, gRPC schemas can be divided into multiple `.proto` files. These `.proto` files are referred through *import directives* in a schema. Import directives containing absolute paths (for example, `/Users/johndoe/projects/my-app/protos/enums/NumericEnum.proto`) and relative paths (`../enums/NumericEnum.proto`) are automatically resolved by Postman and don't require any more configuration. If the import directives don't contain absolute or relative paths, you must add their parent directories.

Consider this example file structure:

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-labs-docs/grpc-docs/using-service-definition/import-path-file-structure.jpg" alt="Example file structure" />

In this example, `root.proto` has import directives that refer to other `.proto` files in the `protos` folder. These import directives could look something like this in the schema:

```shell
import "enums/NumericEnum.proto"
import "messages/EmptyMessage.proto"
import "messages/HelloResponse.proto"
import "messages/HelloRequest.proto"

```

In this scenario, you'll need to configure the parent directory of `enums` and `messages` (in other words, `protos`) as your import path in Postman. The added import path can look something like this: `/Users/johndoe/projects/my-app/protos/`. After you [import a proto file](#import-a-proto-file), click the **Import paths** tab to configure import paths in a request.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/adding-import-paths-v11-1.jpg" alt="Adding import paths" />


# Test and debug values in gRPC requests using JavaScript in Postman

Postman has a powerful scripting environment that enables you to add JavaScript code (scripts) in your gRPC requests and [multi-protocol collections and folders](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections). You can define scripts for three hooks available during the request run lifecycle:

* Before invoking the method and establishing a connection with the server, in the **Before invoke** tab.
* When the client receives a message from the server, in the **On message** tab.

You can use scripts to write API tests, debug your requests by logging to [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/), or dynamically read/update the values of [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). You can [import packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) with scripts and tests from your team's Postman Package Library. You can also [import packages from external package registries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/), such as npm and JSR.

# Create and use gRPC mock servers

In an API-first design lifecycle, you may be designing a new feature that depends on new API endpoints, but another team is responsible for implementing those endpoints, and aren't finished yet. Instead of being blocked by this, you can use a mock server, which returns sample data for requests to the API's endpoints, simulating the behavior of a real API. You can then use the mock server to test your API, before it's even implemented by the other team.

## Use a gRPC mock server

Before creating a gRPC mock server, you must have an API definition. This can either be an API in your workspace, a protobuf (protocol buffers) file you want to import, or you can create a new API using the Postman API Builder.

To create the gRPC mock server, do the following:

1. Create a new gRPC request. See [Creating a new request](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-request-interface/#create-a-new-request) for more information.

2. Click **Enter URL** in the request URL box, then click **Select a Protobuf API**. This opens the **Service Definition** tab in your request.

3. In the **Service Definition** tab, you can enter the protobuf API in one of the following ways:

   * Click **Select a Protobuf schema or paste a link to one** to open the API selection dropdown list. Browse through the available APIs and select the one you want to use. You can also paste a link here to a protobuf API in your workspace.
   * Click **Import a .proto file** to add a new protobuf API from a `.proto` file.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     To learn more about selecting and importing protobuf APIs with the **Service Definition** tab, see [Manage service definitions for gRPC requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/).
   </Info>

4. After you have selected an API, click **Enter URL** again, and select **Use Mock URL for (your API name)**.

The mock server is automatically generated, and ready for use. The request URL has a server name beginning with a random name and ending in `.srv.pstmn.io`. Select a method, then click **Invoke**, and your request will receive responses with random values.

The mock server dynamically updates based on changes to your protobuf API. If changes are made to the protobuf API, requests to the mock server automatically implement the changes.

## Reuse mock server responses

Each time you make a request to the mock server, different random data is returned. However, if you are writing tests, you might need to get the same response every time. This is possible using the seed metadata in each response. The seed is a random number in the response metadata. If you pass the seed in a request, the same response is returned each time.

To pass seed data, do the following:

1. Make a gRPC request to a mock server.
2. In the **Metadata** pane of the response, find the value of the key-value pair named `seed`.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/grpc-response-seed-v11.jpg" alt="gRPC response seed" />
3. In the **Metadata** pane of the request, set a key-value pair for `seed` with the value of the seed.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/grpc-request-seed-v11.jpg" alt="gRPC request seed" />
4. Invoke the request again.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The mock servers in gPRC are independent of the mock server feature in Postman. See [Set up a Postman mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) for more information about using mock servers for your other APIs.

## Next steps

Learn about [gRPC request-response examples](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-grpc-examples/).


# Save, edit, and share gRPC request-response examples

You can save, edit, and share gRPC request-response pairs as [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/). You can even create gRPC examples from scratch.

APIs can be complex, and so can the guidelines for using them. Examples help you understand APIs by capturing the request sent from the client and the response received from the server in a single visual snapshot. You can combine these snapshots in a request and store the request in a collection to illustrate how the API functions under different scenarios. Examples help API producers tell the world beautifully what their API is about.

## Saving a gRPC example

This walkthrough creates and runs a unary request, then saves the response as a gRPC example.

6. Click **Send**.

7. Open the dropdown list again and select a different message.


# Read and write gRPC data using the Postman JSON interface

When sending or receiving a gRPC request or response, the messages being sent back and forth are transmitted in a format called [protobuf (protocol buffers)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). Unlike other data formats such as JSON or XML, which are text-based, protobuf uses a binary format. Binary formats aren't meant to be read by humans, so Postman provides a **JSON interface** that enables you to read and write data when using gRPC.

## JSON interface

## Inspecting fields and types

When composing a message for a gRPC request, you input the data as JSON. Internally, that JSON represents protobuf (protocol buffers) data. For example, you can enter a base64 JSON string to represent `bytes` in protobuf data.

Postman uses the [service definition you select](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/using-service-definition/) to provide rich type information as you compose your message. Hover over any JSON field or value to expose a tooltip that explains the underlying protobuf type. This can help you remember how to enter certain types of data, or to understand what's going on internally.

# Send WebSocket requests with Postman

Postman supports the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket protocol provides a way to exchange data between a client and a server over a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions with low latency and overhead, and without breaking the connection.

WebSockets offers a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that operates over HTTP through a single TCP socket connection. This means the server can independently send data to the client without the client having to request it, and vice versa.

In Postman, you can create a WebSocket request and use it to send and receive messages across a WebSocket connection. If you haven't already, [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to get started.

## Next steps

To get started with WebSocket, see [Create a WebSocket request](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/create-a-websocket-request/).


# Create a WebSocket Request

You can create a WebSocket request from the sidebar in Postman.

1. Click **New > WebSocket** to open a raw WebSocket request in a new tab. You can also click **New > Socket.IO** to open a [Socket.IO request](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/create-a-socketio-request/) in a new tab. (In the Postman desktop app, you can also press **⌘+N** or **Ctrl+N**.)

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-websocket-v11-60.png" alt="New WebSocket request" />

2. Enter the WebSocket server URL. A WebSocket URL begins with `ws://` or `wss://`.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/websocket-server-url-v11-62.png" alt="New WebSocket request" />

3. Click **Connect**.

To disconnect your WebSocket request's connection, click **Disconnect**.

</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Socket.IO typically uses WebSockets as its transport layer, but sometimes uses HTTP *long polling* as a fallback when WebSockets can't be used. Postman doesn't support long-polling mode in Socket.IO.
</Info>


# Work with WebSocket messages

*WebSocket messages* are data packets sent over a WebSocket connection. WebSocket messages include information about the type and length of the message, and whether it's the final message or part of a larger set of messages. You can send, save, and view WebSocket messages in Postman. You can also add names and arguments to Socket.IO events.

## Send WebSocket messages

After making a WebSocket connection, you can use the editor pane to compose and send messages.

![WebSocket message editor](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/websocket-message-editor-v11-1.jpg)

In the bottom left corner of the editor, you can select the format of your message: **Text**, **JSON**, **XML**, **HTML**, or **Binary**. If you click **Binary**, you can then select **Base64** or **Hexadecimal**. The editor has syntax highlighting according to the selected format. You can also click <img alt="Pretty icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pretty-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Beautify** to beautify JSON, XML, or HTML messages.

After you finish composing your message, click **Send**. The sent message remains in the window, in case you want to change it and resend, or save it.

## Save and load WebSocket messages

You can save composed messages, then load and resend them later.

To save a message, do the following:

1. Compose a message (see [Send WebSocket messages](#send-websocket-messages)).
2. Click **Save** to save the message with the request.
3. (Optional) Click **Saved messages**, then select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" /> **Add message** to create a new blank message and add it to the list of saved messages.

To load a saved message, do the following:

1. Click **Saved messages** to open the **Saved messages** pane.
2. Select a saved message. It appears in the editor pane.

You can then [send](#send-websocket-messages) the message or edit it and click **Save** to save the changes.

## View WebSocket messages

The **Response** pane displays a list of messages for the WebSocket connection, including incoming, outgoing, and network messages.

At the top of the **Response** pane is a connection details badge. It shows if the connection is connecting, connected, disconnecting, or disconnected. Hover over the badge to show connection details. Click the arrow next to the badge to show or hide the **Response** pane.

![WebSocket messages](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/websocket-messages-v11-1.jpg)

* Click <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-search-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Search** to search the message.
* Hover over a line number and click <img alt="Up icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-up.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Up** or <img alt="Down icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Down** to expand or collapse message blocks.

## Add Socket.IO event names and arguments

To listen to specific events, you can add names and arguments to events you send with a Socket.IO connection.

For a Socket.IO connection, you can enter an event name to publish next to **Send**. If you click **Send** without entering a name, the default name `message` is used.

If you click the **Ack** option, the server will acknowledge that it has received the message.

You can also add arguments to a Socket.IO connection. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Arg** in the editor pane. A sidebar opens with a new argument that you can use to add the argument's message. Hover over an existing argument and click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> to delete it. The workflow to inspect each argument's message is similar.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/socketio-second-arg-v11-1.jpg" alt="Socket.IO arguments" />


# Listen to Socket.IO events

You can configure Socket.IO requests to listen to specific events. The **Response** pane displays the received events that the request is listening to. Events are color coded to make them more identifiable.

To listen to a new event, do the following:

1. In your Socket.IO request, click **Events**.
2. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> or click the **Add event** box.
3. Enter a name and description for the event.
4. Click **Listen** next to an event to turn listening on or off for that event.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     To delete the event listener, hover over the event and click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icons/icon-delete-red-v10-19.jpg#icon" width="14px" /> **Delete**.
   </Info>


# Use variables in WebSocket requests

You can use Postman variables in the URL of a WebSocket connection or the body of a message. For example, you can create a variable named "my\_host", set the value to "example.com", and then use "ws\://\{\{my\_host}}/api/example" as a URL. If you enter "\{\{" in either the URL box or message editor, you can autocomplete your variables.

See [Store and reuse values using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) for more information.


# Add details to a WebSocket or Socket.IO request

You can add details to your WebSocket or Socket.IO request, such as parameters, headers, and connection settings. Click the **Params**, **Headers**, or **Settings** tab to make changes.

<Note title="Note">
  You can't add or change request details while you're connected. Make any changes before you connect, or click **Disconnect** to stop the current connection.
</Note>

## Send parameters

On the **Params** tab, add any parameters you'd like to append to the WebSocket URL. This works similarly to [sending parameters](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) in a REST request.

## Configure headers

On the **Headers** tab, enter any headers you'd like to send with your message. This works similarly to [configuring request headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/) in a REST request.

## Configure request settings

You can configure the following settings on the **Settings** tab:

| Setting                                    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable server certificate verification** | Set this to **ON** to verify the server certificate when connecting over a secure connection.                   |
| **Client version**                         | The Socket.IO client version to be used to connect with the server. (Socket.IO only)                            |
| **Handshake path**                         | The server path to be used during the handshake request. (Socket.IO only)                                       |
| **Handshake request timeout**              | How long the handshake request waits before timing out, in milliseconds. This is reset after every redirection. |
| **Reconnection attempts**                  | The maximum number of reconnection attempts before disconnecting.                                               |
| **Reconnection intervals**                 | The time in milliseconds between reconnection attempts.                                                         |
| **Maximum message size**                   | The maximum allowed message size in megabytes. To receive messages of any size, set this to 0. (WebSocket only) |


# Save WebSocket requests

You can save your WebSocket requests to a collection. This enables you to reuse requests, share them with other team members, and add documentation to the collection of requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also save your WebSocket request *responses* as [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to illustrate different use cases, serve as test data, and more.
</Info>

To save a new request, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save** in the request tab.
2. Under **Save to**, select a collection, or click **New Collection**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     There are limitations to WebSocket requests in collections. Keep reading for more information.
   </Info>
3. If you're creating a new collection, enter a name and click **Create**.
4. Click **Save**.

Postman displays your collection and saved request in **Collections** in the sidebar.

Because WebSocket requests have different features than HTTP requests, adding them to a collection puts the collection in a beta state with certain limitations.

When in this state, a collection can contain WebSocket or gRPC requests. It can't contain HTTP requests. Some features related to collections aren't supported, such as collaboration, version control, or scripting.


# Document WebSocket requests

Postman automatically generates documentation for each of your requests. The documentation includes the request's URL, parameters, settings, and any saved messages. You can also add a description to help users understand how to use the request.

To view and edit documentation for a WebSocket request, do the following:

1. Open the request.
2. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Documentation** in the right sidebar.
3. Click **Add request description**.
4. Write your content using Postman's [built-in editing tools](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/). Your documentation automatically saves. If you need to make changes, you can edit the description.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  In your collection, you can also add a description to the overview or a folder. Click the collection or folder in the sidebar, then click **Overview** and write your description.
</Info>


# Troubleshoot WebSocket requests

You can use the Postman Console to debug issues with a WebSocket connection. To open the Console and view log messages, select <img alt="Console icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-console-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Console** in the Postman footer.

For more information on using the Console, see [Debug API requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-in-the-console).


# MQTT overview

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its usage spans from small devices for home automation and wearables, to automating large-scale industrial machineries. It's a lightweight technology where clients connected to a single broker can publish messages to different topics and subscribe to topics to receive messages from other connected clients. The messages are transferred with low-bandwidth usage, low-power consumption, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers, all adding to the popularity of MQTT.

## Work with MQTT APIs using Postman

Postman provides you with a client interface to debug your MQTT-based APIs. If you haven't already, [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to get started.

You can do any of the following when you create a new MQTT request:

* Connect to a broker.
* Subscribe to topics.
* Publish messages.
* View messages received from the broker.

After saving your MQTT request into a collection, you can do the following:

* Reuse it later.
* Document it.
* Share it with your teammates.
* Publish it to the community on the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

  <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mqtt-hero-v11-60-1.png" alt="MQTT interface" />

## Next steps

Get started with MQTT with the following topics:

* [Using the MQTT request interface](/docs/sending-requests/mqtt-client/mqtt-request-interface/)
* [Creating your first MQTT request](/docs/sending-requests/mqtt-client/first-mqtt-request/)


# Using the MQTT request interface

MQTT requests in Postman include a variety of tools, views, and controls to help you debug and document your MQTT APIs. This topic highlights parts of the request interface and explains how to use them.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mqtt-interface-v11.jpg" alt="MQTT interface" />

## Create a new MQTT request

Create a new MQTT request by selecting **New** in the sidebar, which brings up the **Create new** dialog. Select **MQTT** to open a blank MQTT request.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-new-request-v10-1.jpg" alt="New MQTT request" />

## The MQTT request interface

In the **Request** interface, you can add configuration to connect to an MQTT broker, subscribe to topics, and publish messages. You can also add last will details, authorization details, properties, and settings along with the request.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mqtt-interface-v11.jpg" alt="MQTT interface" width="500" />

* **Enter URL** - Enter the broker's address, such as `test.mosquitto.org`. Some MQTT services also require you to define a port number. You can define a port number in the URL by appending the port number to the URL. For example, `test.mosquitto.org:1883`.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    To connect to the broker over TLS, you need to use `mqtts://` as your URL scheme. For example, `mqtts://test.mosquitto.org`.
  </Info>

  * **MQTT Version** - Every MQTT version has some distinctions in terms of the protocol features. Postman supports two major versions of MQTT: 3.1.1 and 5.0. Version 5.0 is selected by default.
  * **Client ID** - Client ID is an identifier differentiating each client connected to the broker. By default, Postman generates a random client ID for each request. You can override this by selecting **Client ID** and entering a custom client ID.
* **Message** - This tab is where you compose and publish messages to the broker. You can write your message in the text area, enter a topic name, and select **Send** to publish the message.
  * **Message type** - Select the dropdown menu to set the message type as **Text**, **JSON**, **Base64**, or **Hexadecimal**. This defaults to **Text**. For example, to send a binary payload, you'd select the **Base64** or **Hexadecimal** message type.
  * **Options** (<img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />) - You can add custom user properties and settings to each message here. Settings include the following:

- Topic Alias

* Response Topic
* Correlation Data
* Message Expiry Interval
* Content Type
* Payload Format Indicator
* **Retain** - Retain is a flag that asks the broker to retain the last message sent on the topic and send it to the new subscribers. The broker retains the last message even if the new subscribers join the network after the message was sent from the client. You can configure the retain flag for the message by selecting the <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Options** and select the checkbox next to **Retain**.
* **QoS** - Quality of Service (QoS) defines the guarantee of delivery for the message. You can configure the QoS level for the message by selecting a QoS level from the dropdown list.
* **Add Topic** - You can define the topic name for the message. The broker uses the topic name to route the message to the appropriate subscribers.
* **Saved messages** - You can use the **Saved Messages** tab to create, save, and reuse messages for debugging. You can use these messages during an active connection.
* **Send** - Once you've configured the payload, select **Send** to publish the message to the broker.
* **Topics** - This tab is where you can list and document multiple topics, and subscribe to them. You can also configure the QoS level for each topic listed. You can also view topics by selecting <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Documentation** in the [right sidebar](#using-the-right-sidebar).
* **Last Will** - Last will is a message that's sent by the broker to the subscribers when the client disconnects from the broker. You can configure the last will message by going to the **Last Will** tab, entering the message, and configuring more settings such as topic name, QoS level, and retain flag. You can also configure the delay interval by selecting <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Options** and entering the delay interval in milliseconds.
* **Authorization** - Authorize your connection with Basic Auth. You can pass your credentials in the form of a username and password to the broker using the **Authorization** tab.
* **Properties** - You can add custom properties to your request. These properties are sent while connecting to the broker.
* **Settings** - You can configure more settings for your request by selecting the **Settings** tab. You can configure settings such as request timeout, enable or turn off SSL certificate verification, use clean sessions for each connection, and auto reconnect.

## The MQTT response

When you connect to the broker, the response area creates a message stream showing the published and received messages to different topics in a single session (until you select **Disconnect**).

* **Messages** - The message stream tab shows the published and received messages in a timeline. You can expand the message to view the message details such as topic name, QoS level, retain flag, and message type. You can search for specific messages using the search bar, filter messages by received and sent, and clear the message stream by selecting <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Clear Messages**.

  <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-response-v10-2.jpg" alt="Response section" />

* **Visualization** - The **Visualization** tab shows the message stream in a graphical format, a more comprehensible way to view telemetry data. The interface is divided into multiple windows per topic you have received messages for. For JSON responses, the values for the first field are plotted on the graph. You can change the selected field, and add more fields to compare the values side by side. You can also change the visualization style from line to bar chart.

  <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-visualization-v10.jpg" alt="Visualization section" />

## Using the right sidebar

The right sidebar gives you access to more tools and information like documentation, commenting, and request details. Open an MQTT request, and then select an option in the right sidebar:

* **Request documentation** - Select <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Documentation** to view the description of a request. You can add a description by selecting the text area, then writing your content using [Postman's built-in editing tools](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/).
* **Comments** - Select <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-comments-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Comments** to collaborate with your teammates as you work on an API. You can tag others to ask a question, give feedback, and discuss your API.
* **Request information** - Select <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** to view more details about a request, like the request ID and creation date.

* [Creating your first MQTT request](/docs/sending-requests/mqtt-client/first-mqtt-request/)


# Creating your first MQTT request

In this example of an MQTT request, you will connect to a public broker, subscribe to topics, publish messages, and visualize the response.

## Create an MQTT request

In Postman, click **New** and select **MQTT** as the request type.

<img alt="Create new request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-mqtt-request-v11.jpg" width="500x" />

Alternatively, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add** next to an open tab. You can switch your request type by clicking the request icon next to the request name.

<img alt="Switch request type" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/switch-request-type-v11.51.png" width="280px" />

## Connect to a broker with Postman

To connect to an MQTT service, you need a broker URL. This example uses the public broker `test.mosquitto.org`. You can also use any other public broker or a broker hosted on your local machine.

1. Enter `test.mosquitto.org` as the request **URL**.
2. Click **Connect** to connect to the broker.

A message in the response area indicates that you're connected to the broker.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mqtt-connected-v11.jpg" alt="Connect to a broker" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using the Postman web app, use the Postman Desktop Agent to connect to an MQTT broker. See [About the Postman Agent](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

## Subscribe to topics

While connected to the broker, select the **Topics** tab. This enables you to create, document, and subscribe to multiple topics.

1. In the **Topics** column, enter `my-toys` as the topic name.
2. Select **Subscribe** to subscribe to the topic.

A message appears in the response area indicating that you're subscribed to the topic.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-subscribed-v10.jpg" alt="Subscribe to a topic" />

## Publish messages

You can use the **Message** tab to compose and send messages to the broker.

1. Select the **Message** tab and enter `{"age": 2, "number of toys": 5}` as the message.
2. Enter `my-toys` as the topic name.
3. Select **Send** to publish the message.

An outgoing message appears in the response area indicating that the message was published. Because you have already subscribed to the topic, `my-toys`, you will also see an incoming message with the same body. Go ahead and send a few more messages counting the number of toys you had growing up.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-published-v10.jpg" alt="Subscribe to a topic" />

## Visualize the response

Now that you've subscribed to a topic and published a few messages, you can use the Postman Visualizer to view the messages in a more comprehensible format.

1. Switch to the **Visualization** tab in the response area. You'll see the messages for the `age` field visualized as a line chart.
2. Select the field name dropdown list to select the field you want to visualize.
3. Select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add** to add more fields to the chart and view the changes in the values.
4. Select the <img alt="Chart icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/chart-icon-v10.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> icon next to any of the field names to change the chart type.

The visualization changes in real time as you receive newer messages for the same topic.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mqtt/mqtt-visualization-v10.jpg" alt="Visualization" />

## Next step

Try subscribing to multiple topics at once and publishing messages to them.


# Make HTTP calls using the SOAP protocol

Postman can make HTTP calls using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), a platform-independent messaging protocol specification. In this example, the SOAP endpoint validates an ISBN book number.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more SOAP request examples, see Postman's [Public SOAP APIs](https://www.postman.com/cs-demo/public-soap-apis/overview) collection.
</Info>

## Enter your SOAP endpoint

1. In Postman, select **New > HTTP** to create a new HTTP request.

   <img alt="Create new request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-http-v11-45.jpg" />

2. Enter your SOAP endpoint URL in the address field. For this example, use the `http://webservices.daehosting.com/services/isbnservice.wso` endpoint URL.

3. Select **POST** from the request method dropdown list.

## Add body data

1. In the **Body** tab, select **raw** and choose **XML** from the dropdown list.

   ![SOAP body type](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/soap-body-type-v11-46.jpg)

2. Enter your XML in the text entry area. To validate the book number, enter the following XML:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
       <soap:Body>
           <IsValidISBN10 xmlns="http://webservices.daehosting.com/ISBN">
               <sISBN>0-19-852663-6</sISBN>
           </IsValidISBN10>
       </soap:Body>
   </soap:Envelope>
   ```

   Your request body must include the SOAP `Envelope`, `Header`, and `Body` tags as required by the endpoint, and any namespaces. The data must include the name of the operation and any values you need to post to the service.

## Set your request headers

When you select an XML body type, Postman automatically adds a content type header of `application/xml`. But depending on your service provider, you may need `text/xml` for some SOAP requests. Check with your SOAP service to decide which header is appropriate. If you need the `text/xml` header, override the default Postman setting.

To set request headers, do the following:

1. Click **Headers** in the request. If the auto-generated headers are hidden, click **hidden** to display them.
2. Clear the `Content-Type` header checkbox.
3. Add a new `Content-Type` and `text/xml` key-value pair.
4. Add the `SOAPAction` and `"#MethodName"` key-value pair (for example, `"#POST"`).

   ![SOAP content type](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/soap-header-v11-46.jpg)

## Send your request

Click **Send** to make your call to the SOAP service. On success, Postman displays the response in the lower tab.

![SOAP response data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/soap-response-data-v11-46.jpg)


# Send requests over Unix sockets or named pipes

If you are running a local server, Postman can send requests to that server using [Unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) (UDS) on macOS or Linux, or [named pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe#In_Windows) on Windows. This is a form of [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) (IPC). Unix domain sockets are also called Unix sockets.

## Format Unix sockets request on macOS or Linux

On Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux), a Unix domain socket (UDS) is a special kind of file that lets processes on the same machine communicate using the socket API.

Suppose you've created a local HTTP server with a Unix domain socket whose path is `/tmp/http-server.sock`, and that serves a resource whose path is `/hello`.

You can send a request to this server from Postman using the following syntax:

```shell
<protocol>://unix:<socket-path>:<resource-path>
```

Provide values for the placeholders as follows:

* `<protocol>` (optional) can be either `http` or `https`. If omitted, Postman defaults to `http`.
* `<socket-path>` is the absolute path to the socket file. In the example, that's `/tmp/http-server.sock`.
* `<resource-path>` (optional) is the path to a resource on the server. In the example, that's `/hello`.

Applying the example values, the URL for communicating with your UDS will be this:

```shell
http://unix:/tmp/http-socket.sock:/hello
```

If you omit the optional `<protocol>` section, the URL will be:

```shell
unix:/tmp/http-socket.sock:/hello
```

When you create the request in Postman, the HTTP method to select will depend on how you've configured your local server. For the `hello` example resource, the appropriate method will be GET.

## Format a named pipes request on Windows

Windows doesn't support Unix domain sockets as filesystem path-based sockets. Instead Windows provides a similar abstraction with its version of named pipes. The name of the pipe and its path are the same.

Suppose you've created a local HTTP server with a Windows named pipe whose path is `\\.\pipe\myserver`.

You can send a request to this server from Postman using either the Windows-style backslashes, or forward slashes.

For backslashes, use the following syntax:

```shell
http://unix:\\\\.\\pipe\local-service:\hello
```

If you prefer forward slashes, the URL will be:

```shell
http://unix://./pipe/local-service:/hello
```

When you create the request in Postman, the HTTP method to select will depend on how you've configured your local server. For the `hello` example resource, the appropriate method will be GET.

## Send your request

Click **Send** to make your call to the Unix domain socket or named pipe. On success, Postman displays the response in the lower tab.

The following screenshot shows a slightly more elaborate example that uses the POST method:

![UDS example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/sending-requests-unix-socket-v11.70.4.jpg)


# Test APIs and write scripts in Postman

In an API-first world, APIs are developed before the rest of an application. That means API testing happens earlier in the API lifecycle. With Postman, you can run API tests in the same place where you collaborate and build APIs with your team.

Postman provides a variety of tools you can use to ensure the quality and reliability of your APIs. Use scripts to add logic to your requests, replicate complex user workflows, and write test assertions. Then use Postman collections to group individual tests into comprehensive test suites. Once you've set up your tests, you can run them manually or automate them as part of your regular development process.

## Add logic and process data with scripts

You can add dynamic behavior to your API requests with Postman's built-in JavaScript runtime. Write test scripts to check for a specific status code, set a variable, or validate a response. You can also use scripts to process data and build dynamic workflows.

Postman can run scripts before a request is sent (pre-request) or after (post-response). You can also create packages for your favorite scripts and reuse them across your Postman team.

Learn more at [Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).

## Test APIs at every stage of development

Testing plays an important role throughout the API development lifecycle. You can use Postman to perform essential types of testing, such as integration, end-to-end, and regression testing. You can also use Postman to test performance to make sure your API can handle the expected load.

Learn more at [Test API functionality and performance in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/test-apis/).

## Run and automate your API tests

Postman supports both manual testing and test automation. You can run a single test on demand by sending a request, or run an entire test suite using the Collection Runner.

To increase efficiency and test coverage, you can configure test collections to run automatically on a schedule. You can also use the Postman CLI to run test collections as part of your continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

Learn more at [Run and automate API tests in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests/).


# Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests

Postman's runtime is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about). You can use this to write scripts that add dynamic behavior to requests and collections. You can use pre-request and post-response scripts to write API tests, build requests that can contain dynamic parameters, or pass data between requests.

Scripts run asynchronously. That means you can run multiple scripts without waiting for the previous script to complete. If you want scripts to run in sequence, you can use a callback function.

## Scripts in Postman

You can add JavaScript code to run during two events in a flow:

* Before a request is sent to the server, as a [pre-request script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) under the **Scripts > Pre-request** tab.
* After a response is received, as a [post-response script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) under the **Scripts > Post-response** tab.
* GraphQL requests run scripts before a query (under the **Scripts > Before query** tab) or after a response (under the **Scripts > After response** tab).
* gRPC requests run scripts before invoke (under the **Scripts > Before invoke** tab), during a message (under the **Scripts > On message** tab) or after a response (under the **Scripts > After response** tab).

Postman prompts you with suggestions as you enter text. Select one to autocomplete your code.

![Script autocomplete](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/autocomplete-v11-v2.jpg)

In addition to requests, you can add pre-request and post-response scripts to a collection or folder.

## Run order of scripts

In Postman, the script run order for a single request looks like this:

* A pre-request script associated with a request runs before the request is sent.
* A post-response script associated with a request runs after the request is sent.

![Workflow for single request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/req-resp-v11.jpg)

For every request in a collection, scripts run in the following order:

* A pre-request script associated with a collection runs prior to every request in the collection.
* A pre-request script associated with a folder runs prior to every direct child request in the folder.
* A post-response script associated with a collection runs after every request in the collection.
* A post-response script associated with a folder runs after every direct child request in the folder.

![workflow for request in collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/execOrder-v11.jpg)

For every request in a collection, the scripts always runs according to the same hierarchy. Collection-level scripts run first, then folder-level scripts, and then request-level scripts. This run order applies to both pre-request and post-response scripts.

For example, the following collection is structured with a single folder and two requests within the folder.

<img alt="Collection with nested folder and requests" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/console-log-statement-v11-2-v4.jpg" />

If you created log statements in the pre-request and post-response script sections for the collection, folder, and requests, the run order is returned in the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

![Logs in the Console](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/logs-in-console-v11-v3.jpg)

### How it works

The [Postman Sandbox](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) is available to you when you write your pre-request and post-response scripts. The sandbox is a JavaScript runtime environment for Postman, the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/), and [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  <img alt="Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Collections.png#icon" width="24px" /> You can build workflows to test different API scenarios using a collection, and that branch and loop over a set of requests. To try out this collection template, select [API scenario testing](https://www.postman.com/templates/collections/api-scenario-testing/).
</Info>

## Reuse scripts

You can add commonly used scripts and tests to packages in your team's Postman Package Library. This enables you to reuse internal scripts in your team's HTTP gRPC, and GraphQL requests. Learn how to [reuse scripts and tests in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/).

You can also [import external packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) from npm and JSR package registries into your team's HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

## Debugging scripts

Debugging scripts can be written under either the **Pre-request** tab or the **Post-response** tab. You can log debugging messages in the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

## Test examples

You can use post-response [script examples](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-examples/) to write your own tests for requests, folders, and collections. Post-response scripts run when Postman receives a response from the API you sent the request to. When you add tests to a folder or collection, they run after each request inside it.

## Dynamic variables

Postman uses the [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library to generate sample data, including random names, addresses, email addresses, and more. You can use these predefined variables to return different values per request. Learn how to [use dynamic variables](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/).

## Postman JavaScript APIs

Postman provides [JavaScript APIs](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) that you can use in your request scripts. The `pm` object provides functionality for testing your request and response data.


# Write pre-request scripts to add dynamic behavior in Postman

You can use pre-request scripts in Postman to run JavaScript before a request runs. By including code in the **Pre-request** tab for a request, collection, or folder, you can carry out pre-processing such as setting variable values, parameters, headers, and body data. You can also use pre-request scripts to debug code, for example, by logging output to the Postman Console.

## Pre-request scripting example

The following is an example of using pre-request scripts:

* You have a series of requests in a collection and are running them in a sequence, such as when using the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).
* The second request is dependent on a value returned from the first request.
* The value needs to be processed before you pass it to the second request.
* The first request sets the data value from a response field to a variable in its post-response script.
* The second request retrieves the value and processes it in its pre-request script, then sets the processed value to a variable. This variable is then referenced in the second request, for example, in its parameters.

## Scripting before your request runs

To include code you want to run before Postman sends a request, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Open the request, then select the **Scripts** tab.
3. Click the **Pre-request** tab.
4. Enter the JavaScript you need to process before the request runs, then click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**.
5. Click **Send** to send the request. The code runs before Postman sends the request to the API.

   ![Pre-Request Code](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pre-request-script-v11-12.jpg)

To make your code more readable, click <img alt="Pretty icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pretty-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Beautify** in the lower right of the code editor.

## Add documentation to pre-request scripts

Postman supports JSDoc for documenting JavaScript functions in your pre-request scripts. Documentation added to your functions using JSDoc display in a popup window when you call your functions. You can use the official [JSDoc documentation](https://jsdoc.app/) to learn how to add documentation to your pre-request scripts.

The following example has documentation for the `logger` function using JSDoc. The documentation explains what the function does, and defines what the `data` parameter is used for and that it accepts a string data type.

```js
/**
 * This function prints a string to the Postman Console.
 * @param {string} data - The text to print to the Postman Console.
 */
function logger (data) {
    console.log(`Logging information to the console, ${data}`)
}
```

## Reuse pre-request scripts

You can add pre-request scripts to entire collections and folders within collections. In both cases, your pre-request script will run before every request in the collection or direct child request in the folder. This enables you to define commonly used pre-processing or debugging steps you need to run for multiple requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can define a pre-request script when you first create a collection or folder, or at any time after that. You can also [store pre-request scripts in the Postman Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/). This lets you maintain commonly used scripts in a single location, share them with your team, and reuse them in your internal workspaces.
</Info>

To add pre-request scripts to a collection or folder, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Select a collection or folder.
3. Click the **Scripts** tab.
4. Click the **Pre-request** tab. Enter code that will run before every request in the collection or direct child request in the folder.
5. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**.

After learning the basics of writing pre-request scripts, you can extend your scripts:

* To learn more about how to use the `pm` object, visit the [Postman JavaScript reference](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/).
* For more information about storing and reusing commonly used scripts, learn about [the package library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) in Postman.


# Write scripts to test API response data in Postman

You can use post-response scripts in Postman to run JavaScript after a request runs. By including code in the **Scripts > Post-response** tab for a request, collection, or folder, you can write and validate API tests. You can also use post-response scripts for debugging your tests.

## Testing in Postman

Some of the most common approaches to [API testing](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-testing/) are contract testing, unit testing, end-to-end testing, and load testing. Tests confirm that your API is working as expected, that integrations between services function reliably, and that any changes haven't broken existing functionality.

You can write tests for your Postman API requests in JavaScript in the **Post-response** tab. You can also use test code to aid the debugging process when something goes wrong with your API project. For example, you might write a test to validate your API's error handling by sending a request with incomplete data or wrong parameters.

The **Pre-request** and **Post-response** tabs use the Postman Sandbox, a runtime based on Node.js that enables you to add dynamic behavior to requests and collections.

* The **Scripts > Pre-request** tab enables you to do any processing needed before sending a request, like setting variable values. Any code here runs before the request is sent. To learn more, see [Write pre-request scripts to add dynamic behavior in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/).

* The **Scripts > Post-response** tab provides for any post-processing after a request is sent and includes the ability to write tests for assessing response data. The **Post-response** tab has the [Chai.js](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) library built in, so you can use Chai's behavior-driven development (BDD) syntax to create readable test assertions.

Select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snippets** at the lower right of the code editor to view a list of test snippets. You can search for and select snippets to inject pre-written blocks of code. Some will help you retrieve data from variables, some are boilerplate tests, and some perform common utility functions. You can also ask Postman's AI assistant Postbot to [write tests for you](#write-tests-using-postbot).

## Add a post-response test

You can add tests to [requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/), [collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/), and folders in a collection. Postman includes code snippets you add and then change to suit your test logic.

To add a test, open the request, collection, or folder and enter your code in the **Scripts > Post-response** tab. You can write your own JavaScript. You can also select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snippets** at the lower right of the code editor and select a snippet. To make your code more readable, you can select <img alt="Pretty icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pretty-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Beautify** in the lower right of the code editor.

Post-response scripts can use dynamic variables, carry out test assertions on response data, and pass data between requests. Tests run after the request runs and a response is received from the API. The output appears in the response's **Test Results** tab.

In the **Test Results** tab, you can click <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-refresh-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Refresh results** in the upper right of the response pane to refresh your test results. This gives you the option to refresh your test results without re-sending the request.

![Request Test Tab](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/request-test-tab-v11.45.1.jpg)

Your scripts can include as many tests as you need and will be saved along with the request details when you select <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**. If you share a collection, publish documentation, or use the **Run in Postman** button, your test code will be included for anyone who views or imports your collection.

### Add a test to a gRPC request

You can add tests to a gRPC request before invoke, when the client receives a message, or after response. All hooks are available for all gRPC requests regardless of the method type (unary, client streaming, server streaming, or bidirectional streaming).

To add a test to a gRPC request, do the following:

1. Go to the **Scripts** tab in your gRPC request.
2. Select the hook (**Before invoke**, **On message**, or **After response**) you want to add a test to.
3. Select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snippets** at the lower right of the code editor to add a test. You can also write a custom assertion.

When you select **Invoke**, tests run before, during, or after the request is invoked. Once you invoke your gRPC request, updates to scripts in the **On message** tab won't take effect until the next time you invoke the request. If you select **Cancel**, the request and any further script runs are stopped.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If there are any errors in your **Before invoke** script, the request will stop.
</Info>

## Validate responses

To validate the data returned by a request, you can use the `pm.response` object in a test. Define tests using the `pm.test` function. Provide a name and function that returns a boolean (`true` or `false`) value to indicate if the test passed or failed. Use Chai.js BDD syntax and `pm.expect` in your assertions to test the response detail.

The first parameter for the `.test` function is a text string that appears in the test result output. Use this to identify your tests and communicate the purpose of a test to anyone viewing the results.

For example, enter the following in the **Post-response** tab of a request to test if the response status code is `200`:

```js
pm.test("Status test", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

Select **Send** to run your request, then select the **Test Results** tab in the response. The tab header displays how many tests passed and how many ran in total. You can also select the **Filter Results** dropdown list to view the test results by type: **Passed**, **Skipped**, and **Failed**.

If the request returned a `200` status code, the test passes. To find out what happens with a different status code, change the expected status code in your post-response script and run the request again.

## Format test result messages using pm.expect

Using the `pm.expect` syntax gives your test result messages a different format. Experiment with the options to get the output you find most useful.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Fork the [Intro to writing tests collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-team-collections/collection/9fqcfpk/intro-to-writing-tests-with-examples?action=share\&creator=16724969) to import templates containing some example post-response scripts into Postman and experiment with the code.
</Info>

Your code can test the request [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), as in the following example:

```js
pm.test("environment to be production", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.environment.get("env")).to.equal("production");
});
```

You can use different syntax variations to write your tests in a way that you find readable, and that suits your application and testing logic. For example:

```js
pm.test("response should be okay to process", function () {
    pm.response.to.not.be.error;
    pm.response.to.have.jsonBody("");
    pm.response.to.not.have.jsonBody("error");
});
```

Your tests can validate request responses using syntax that you tailor to the response data format. For example:

```js
pm.test("response must be valid and have a body", function () {
     pm.response.to.be.ok;
     pm.response.to.be.withBody;
     pm.response.to.be.json;
});
```

## Test collections and folders

You can add post-response scripts to a collection, a folder, or a single request within a collection. A post-response script associated with a collection will run after every request in the collection. A post-response script associated with a folder will run after every direct child request in the folder. This enables you to reuse commonly run tests after requests. The run order for each request will be collection tests, folder tests and then request tests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also [store post-response scripts in the Postman Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/). This enables you to maintain commonly used scripts and tests in a single location, share them with your team, and reuse them in your internal workspaces.
</Info>

Adding scripts to collections and folders enables you to test the workflows in your API project. This helps to ensure that your requests cover typical scenarios, providing a reliable experience for application users.

To add or edit collection and folder tests, select a collection or folder in the sidebar, then select the **Scripts > Post-response** tab.

When you [run a collection](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), the collection runner displays the results for all tests. The test results include the response time in milliseconds and details about whether a specific request in the collection passed or failed its tests.

![Collection Tests](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/collection-tests-run-v11.45.1.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can write scripts to control the order in which your requests run using [branching and looping](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/).
</Info>

## Write tests using Postbot

You can use Postman's AI assistant [Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/) to write tests for your requests. Tell Postbot what to do in natural language, and Postbot generates post-response scripts for you. Use Postbot to add a new set of tests, visualize responses, save a field from a response, or fix your existing tests.

To write tests with Postbot, do the following:

1. Open a request and select **Send** so it has a response.
2. Select the **Scripts > Post response** tab.
3. (Optional) Select code you'd like Postbot to help with.
4. Select <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open Postbot** in the code editor. You can also select **Control+Option+P** or **Ctrl+Alt+P** to open Postbot.
5. Tell Postbot what you want to do and select **Enter**.

   <img alt="Write tests with Postbot" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postbot-write-tests-v11-41.jpg" />

You can also work with Postbot in the following ways:

* Postbot can offer suggestions based on your request and the response data. Select the down arrow (↓) on your keyboard and select one of Postbot's suggestions.

  <img alt="Get test suggestions from Postbot" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postbot-test-suggestions-v11-41.jpg" />

* Postbot understands context. Select part of a script or the response body, then tell Postbot what you want to do or change based on the selection.

  <img alt="Postbot understands context" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postbot-test-context-v11-41.jpg" />

* You can also select part of a JSON response, right-click, then select <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Use Postbot**. You can tell Postman to generate tests based on the selection. For example, go to a response, select a property, and ask Postbot to generate a test to verify that it exists. Or select specific values in a response and ask Postbot to visualize only that data.

  <img alt="Postbot understands context" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postbot-inline-response-v11.45.1.jpg" />

* Postbot also powers autocomplete in the post-response script editor. If you’ve [enabled Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/#get-started-with-postbot), you’ll see code suggestions as you type. Select the **Tab** key to accept the suggestion. If you’ve already paid for Postbot, you get unlimited suggestions and acceptances. For everyone else, feature usage is capped at 200 suggestion acceptance events per month.

}
```

## Debug your tests

If you're having trouble with your tests, do the following:

* Check if there are any errors in your scripts. A red underline will highlight possible errors. Hover over the error and select **View Problem** to get help. You can also check the response viewer for specific errors.
* Debug your tests using [log statements](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#using-log-statements) to ensure that you are asserting on correct data.

## Next steps

After writing your first tests in Postman, you can write more complex tests and use them with other Postman tools.

* For more information about what you can do with the `pm` object, check out some post-response script [examples](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-examples/) and visit the [Postman Sandbox API reference](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/).

# Import packages into Postman

You can import packages from your team's Postman Package Library into scripts in your internal workspaces. You can also import packages from external packages registries, such and npm or JSR, into your scripts. Postman supports importing packages into HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

## Create and import internal scripts as packages

With the package library, your team can store commonly used scripts and tests as packages. Team members can access the packages in your team's package library and reuse them in internal workspaces.

To learn more, see [Add internal scripts to the Package Library in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/).

## Import packages from external registries

In Postman, you can search npm and JSR package registries for public packages you'd like to use in your scripts. Public packages are supported in your internal, partner, or public workspaces. If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, you can also import private packages from npm that an Admin configured.

You can also use the [Postman Sandbox API](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) functionality, enabling you to use the `pm` object to access and alter request and response data, write test assertions, and more. The contents of packages run in the order they're listed. After you write code in a package, you can [import a package](#import-a-package).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't use the previous style of writing Postman tests (using the `tests` object) in packages in the package library.
</Info>

Export your functions and objects using the `module.exports` object property, enabling you to call them from your scripts. The name you export must match the name of the function declaration or object in your package.

```js
function functionName {
    return result
}

module.exports = {
    functionName
}
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can learn how to [document JavaScript functions](#add-documentation-to-a-package) in your packages.
</Info>

If your package only includes JavaScript code or `pm` object instances, and no callable functions or objects, you don't need to export anything.

The following example is a package named `postman_logger`:

* The package has a function named `logger` that accepts a parameter named `data`, and prints an argument to the Postman Console. The function is exported using `module.exports`.
* The package also uses the `pm` object to run the `test` method. The function inside the test checks whether an API returns a `200` response code. The test result displays in the **Test Results** tab in the response area of the request.

```js
// package name: postman_logger
function logger (data) {
    console.log(`Logging information to the console, ${data}`)
}

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

module.exports = {
    logger
}
```

## Add documentation to a package

Postman supports JSDoc for documenting JavaScript functions in your packages. Documentation added to your functions using JSDoc will display in a popup window when you call each function from your scripts. You can use the official [JSDoc documentation](https://jsdoc.app/) to learn how to add documentation to your packages.

The following example has documentation for the `logger` function using JSDoc. The documentation explains what the function does, and defines what the `data` parameter is used for and that it accepts a string data type.

```js
/**
 * This function prints a string to the Postman Console.
 * @param {string} data - The text to print to the Postman Console.
 */
function logger (data) {
    console.log(`Logging information to the console, ${data}`)
}

module.exports = {
    logger
}
```

## Import a package

Once you [write code in a package](#write-code-in-a-package), you can import a package into your scripts. This enables you to access the scripts and tests in your packages, and call specific functions and objects. The contents of packages will only run from internal workspaces.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't import a package into the contents of another package in the package library.
</Info>

Select <img alt="Package icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-package-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Packages** at the lower right of the code editor. Search for packages to import into the code editor. Select **Postman packages** to filter your search results by packages in your team's package library. Select a package to import it into the code editor.

Packages are imported into the code editor using the `pm.require` method. Your team domain and the package name are included as the argument in the following format: `@team-domain/package-name`. This also declares a JavaScript variable that you can use to call functions and objects in your packages. By default, the variable identifier is based on the package name.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you change your team domain in your [publisher profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-your-publisher-profile), you must also change the team domain in each occurrence of the `pm.require` method. You can manually update the team domain, or re-import each package.
</Info>

```js
const variableName = pm.require('@team-domain/package-name');

variableName.functionName()
```

If your package only includes JavaScript code or `pm` object instances, and no callable functions or objects, you only need to import it in your scripts. You don't need to also declare it as a JavaScript variable.

```js
pm.require('@team-domain/package-name');
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To view all packages imported in your request's script, select <img alt="Package icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-package-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Packages** at the lower right of the code editor. Packages with a blue checkmark are imported in your script.
</Info>

The following example imports a package named `postman_logger`:

* The package is declared as a variable named `postmanLogger`, and the variable is used to call the `logger` function that's in the package. The function accepts one parameter, and the argument passed to the function is the string `The test passed`, which is printed to the Postman Console.
* The package also uses the `pm` object to run the `test` method. The test result is displayed in the **Test Results** tab in the response area of the request.

```js
// team domain: postman
// package name: postman_logger
const postmanLogger = pm.require('@postman/postman_logger');

postmanLogger.logger("The test passed")

// output in the Postman Console: Logging information to the console, The test passed
```

## Edit a package

All team members can view and edit packages in your Postman team.

To edit a package, do the following:

1. Open an HTTP collection, folder, or request. You can also open a gRPC or GraphQL request.
2. Select the **Scripts** tab.
3. Select <img alt="Package icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-package-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Packages** at the lower right of the code editor, and select **Open package library**.
4. Search for a package you'd like to edit.
5. Edit the **Summary** and **Code** for the package as needed.
6. Select <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**.

## Delete a package

You must be a [Team or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or the package's owner, to delete a package from your team's package library. To find a package's owner, open the package library, then view the team member associated with a package.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't reuse the name of a package deleted from your package library.

## Use external libraries in packages

You can use external library modules in packages. Learn about [supported external library modules and how to use them](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-require/#use-external-libraries).

You must use the `require` method to use the following external library modules in packages:

* [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)
* [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The following libraries are deprecated and no longer supported:

# Import packages from external registries in Postman

You can [import public packages](#import-a-public-package) from external package registries into your scripts. Postman supports importing public packages from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [JSR](https://jsr.io/) registries. If you're on a Postman Professional or Enterprise plan, you can also [import private packages](#import-a-private-package) from npm that an Admin configured access to. You can import external packages in your internal, partner, and public workspaces. External packages are supported in HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/), [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/requests-and-variables/), and the Postman CLI ([collection runs](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-collection/) and [monitors](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-monitor/)) to run collections and requests that import external packages in scripts. External packages aren't supported in [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
</Info>

## Import a public package

You can search for public external packages in npm and JSR and import them directly into your HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, an Admin can [manage external packages](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#allow-packages-from-external-package-registries) your team is allowed to use in scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, you can view external packages your Admin has allowed in scripts. Select **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, select **Team resources** in the sidebar, then select **External packages**.

5. Select a package to import it into the code editor.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can [view external packages in your script](#view-external-packages-in-your-script), including packages Postman was unable to import.
</Info>

![Find and use public packages in external registries](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/import-external-packages-v11-46.jpg)

When you select a public external package from search, a JavaScript variable is automatically declared in the code editor. Use the variable to call functions and objects in the package. By default, the variable identifier is based on the external package name. The variable's value is the `pm.require` method with the package registry, name, and latest version number as the argument in the `registry-name:package-name@version-number` format.

The script will always use the defined package version when the request runs. You can omit the version number (`@version-number`) from the argument to [use the latest package version](#use-the-latest-package-version) in all of your scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You must use the exact version number in the argument. Postman doesn't support other ways to specify a version, such as version ranges or tags.
</Info>

```js
// package imported from npm
const npmVariableName = pm.require('npm:package-name@version-number');

npmVariableName.functionName()

// package imported from jsr
const jsrVariableName = pm.require('jsr:package-name@version-number');

jsrVariableName.functionName()
```

## Import a private package

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Private npm packages are supported on [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can import private external packages from npm if an Admin [configured access to the private package](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#configure-access-to-private-packages) from your team's scripts. You can import private npm packages directly into your HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, an Admin can [manage external packages](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#allow-packages-from-external-package-registries) your team is allowed to use in scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on a Postman Professional or Enterprise plan, you can view external packages your Admin has allowed in scripts. Select **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, select **Team resources** in the sidebar, then select **External packages**.
</Info>

To import a private external package, do the following:

1. Open an HTTP collection, folder, or request. You can also open a gRPC or GraphQL request.
2. Select the **Scripts** tab.
3. Declare a JavaScript variable in the code editor you can use to call functions and objects in the package. The variable's value must use the `pm.require` method with "npm", scope, package name, and latest version number as the argument in the `npm:@scope/package-name@version-number` format.

If you specified a version number, the script will always use the defined package version when the request runs. You can omit the version number (`@version-number`) from the argument to [use the latest package version](#use-the-latest-package-version) in all of your scripts.

```js
// package imported from npm

npmVariableName.functionName()
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can [view external packages in your script](#view-external-packages-in-your-script), including packages Postman was unable to import.
</Info>

## Use the latest package version

When you import an external package, you can configure the argument so the latest package version is used in all of your scripts. To do this, omit the version number (`@version-number`) from the `pm.require` method's argument. By default, scripts use the latest version number available when you first opened or ran the request.

Each script in your Postman app that imports the package without a version number will use the same version. The package version is specific to your Postman app, meaning the version may differ for your collaborators.

To update the package version number in your Postman app, do the following:

1. Open an HTTP collection, folder, or request. You can also open a gRPC or GraphQL request.
2. Select the **Scripts** tab.
3. Select <img alt="Package icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-package-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Packages** at the lower right of the code editor.
4. Hover over the imported package, and select <img alt="Syncing icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-syncing-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Update to latest version**. The version number is updated in each of your scripts that import the package without specifying a version number.

## View external packages in your script

To view external packages in your request's script, select <img alt="Package icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-package-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Packages** at the lower right of the code editor. To learn more about a package, hover over the package and select <img alt="Open in Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openInPostman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View in npm** or <img alt="Open in Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openInPostman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View in JSR**.

Use the following to troubleshoot external packages in your script:

* Packages with a blue checkmark were successfully imported in your script.
* Packages with a red exclamation point couldn't be imported in your script. For example, the version may not be valid or the package isn't allowed in your team. Hover over the exclamation point to view a tooltip about the issue.

## Supported external packages

Postman runs scripts in a sandbox environment that's secure by default. There are strict measures in place to ensure external code that runs inside the sandbox environment doesn't get extra privileges or access. Because of this, there may be some limitations when running the contents of external packages in the sandbox environment, depending on the package's dependencies.

Consider the following when importing external packages into Postman:

* Postman's sandbox environment runs code uniformly, regardless of whether the code runs on the browser or Node.js. External packages that use Nodes.js built-in modules may not work as expected in Postman because the modules aren't also available in the browser.
* Postman doesn't support all of JavaScript's [standard built-in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects). Learn about the [JavaScript objects Postman supports](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-require/#use-global-objects).
* Packages and their dependencies that exceed 50 MB aren't supported.
* Packages that use the [`await` keyword outside of an async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await) aren't supported.
* Packages that use both named and default exports must use specific syntax to access the default exports:

  ```js
  // access default exports
  const fooDefaultExport = pm.require("npm:foo").default

  // access named exports
  const { fooNamedExport } = pm.require("npm:foo")
  ```


# Postman test script examples

Depending on your test logic and how you want to get the results, there are various ways to structure the test assertions in a test script. This page provides post-response script examples for various API testing scenarios in Postman. You can use these post-response scripts in your request to parse response data and make assertions. You can also use these scripts to validate response structure and troubleshoot common test errors.

This section covers some common ways to write assertions, along with a list of examples explaining how to use [pm.\* APIs](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) to write tests. To try these tests, open a request in Postman, then select the **Scripts > Post-response** tab and enter the JavaScript code for the example.

## Test for a status code

You can use the `statusCode` property available over [pm.response](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-response/) to test the status code of the response.

```js
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

This code uses the `pm` library to run the `test` method. The text string will appear in the test output. The function inside the test represents an assertion. In this case, the code uses a `to.have` chain to express the assertion.

This test checks the response code returned by the API. If the response code is `200`, the test will pass, otherwise it will fail.

![Test output](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/example-test-assertion-result-v11.45.0.jpg)

To learn what test results look like when they pass or fail, change the status code in the assertion code and send the request again.

You can also assert the same using the [pm.expect](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-test-expect/) method.

```js
pm.test("Status code is 200", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.eql(200);
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the `pm.response.to.be.ok` as shorthand to test if the status code is 0.
</Info>

Refer to the [Chai Assertion Library Docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) for a complete overview of assertion syntax options.

### Test response times

Test for the response time to be within a specified range:

```js
pm.test("Response time is less than 200ms", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(200);

  // or
  pm.response.to.have.responseTime.not.above(200);

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(300);
});
```

For requests with streaming methods, `pm.response.responseTime` denotes the total duration for the request's execution.

## Test metadata

To check if response metadata is present:

```javascript
pm.test('"content-type" is present in response metadata', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.metadata('content-type');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.metadata.has('content-type')).to.be.true;
});
```

You can also assert the value of the metadata:

```javascript
pm.test('"content-type" response metadata is "application/grpc"', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.metadata('content-type', 'application/grpc');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.metadata.get('content-type')).to.equal('application/grpc');
});
```

Similar assertions can be written for request metadata using the [pm.request](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-request/) object.

## Testing response trailers

To check if a response trailer is present:

```javascript
pm.test('"grpc-status-details-bin" is present in response trailers', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.trailer('grpc-status-details-bin');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.trailers.has('grpc-status-details-bin')).to.be.true;
});
```

You can also assert the value of the trailer:

```javascript
pm.test('"grpc-status-details-bin" response trailer is "dummy-value"', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.trailer('grpc-status-details-bin', 'dummy-value');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.trailers.get('grpc-status-details-bin')).to.equal('dummy-value');
});
```

## Testing response trailers

To check if a response trailer is present:

```javascript
pm.test('"grpc-status-details-bin" is present in response trailers', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.trailer('grpc-status-details-bin');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.trailers.has('grpc-status-details-bin')).to.be.true;
});
```

You can also assert the value of the trailer:

```javascript
pm.test('"grpc-status-details-bin" response trailer is "dummy-value"', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.trailer('grpc-status-details-bin', 'dummy-value');

  // Using pm.expect
  pm.expect(pm.response.trailers.get('grpc-status-details-bin')).to.equal('dummy-value');
});
```

## Testing responses

For requests with multiple response messages, such as those using a bidirectional streaming method, the tests in this section check all messages for the given assertion. For requests with a single response message, like those using unary or client streaming methods, the assertion is tested only on that message.

Also, when writing assertions using `pm.response.messages.to.*`, you will be asserting on an array of message content and not the complete [pm.response](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-response/) message object.

You can test the assertions in this section on request messages as well using the `pm.request` object.

### Test the existence of a message

To test the existence of a response message (strictly):

```javascript
pm.test('Correct user details are received', () => {
  pm.response.to.have.message({
    userId: '123',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    phone: '+1-555-555-5555',
    age: 30,
    company: 'XYZ'
  });
});
```

### Test for a message with a specific property

You can assert that the given object's properties are a subset of any messages received as a response:

```javascript
pm.test('User details are updated successfully', () => {
  pm.response.messages.to.include({
    action: 'update-user-details',
    status: 'success'
  });
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  By default, `pm.response.messages.to.include()` has `.deep` applied to it.
</Info>

### Test for a common property across all messages

To check if a common property exists in all the received messages:

```javascript
pm.test('All users have "company" in their profile', () => {
  pm.response.messages.to.have.property('isActive');
});
```

You can also assert the value of a common property:

```javascript
pm.test('All users are in same company', () => {
  pm.response.messages.to.have.property('company', 'XYZ');
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  By default, `pm.response.messages.to.have.property()` has `.deep` and `.nested` applied to it.
</Info>

### Test messages against a JSON Schema

You can assert that the received messages match the given JSON Schema:

```javascript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    username: {
      type: "string",
      pattern: "^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$"
    }
  }
};

pm.test('All response messages have correct username', () => {
  pm.response.messages.to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
});

pm.test('Assert on a specific message', () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.messages.idx(10).data).to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
});
```

## Work with a stream of messages

The examples below show how to work with a stream of messages and write assertions on them.

```javascript
pm.test('Should receive keep-alive message roughly every 5 seconds', () => {
  const keepAliveMessage = pm.response.messages.filter({
    data: {
      type: 'keep-alive'
    }
  });

  for (let i = 1; i < keepAliveMessage.length; i++) {
    const time1 = keepAliveMessage[i-1].timestamp;
    const time2 = keepAliveMessage[i].timestamp;

    pm.expect(time2-time1).to.be.within(4800, 5200);
  }
});
```

```javascript
pm.test('Every request message should have a corresponding response message', () => {
  pm.request.messages.each((reqMsg) => {
    pm.response.messages.to.include({ id: reqMsg.data.id });
  });
});
```

## Use multiple assertions

Your tests can include multiple assertions as part of a single test. Use this to group together related assertions:

```js
pm.test("The response has all properties", () => {
    //parse the response JSON and test three properties
    const responseJson = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(responseJson.type).to.eql('vip');
    pm.expect(responseJson.name).to.be.a('string');
    pm.expect(responseJson.id).to.have.lengthOf(1);
});
```

If any of the contained assertions fails, the test as a whole will fail. All assertions must be successful for the test to pass.

## Parse response body data

To carry out assertions on your responses, you will first need to parse the data into a JavaScript object that your assertions can use.

To parse JSON data, use the following syntax:

```js
const responseJson = pm.response.json();
```

To parse XML, use the [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js) library with the [`require` method](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#use-external-libraries-in-packages):

```js
var parseString = require('xml2js').parseString;
parseString(pm.response.text(), function (err, result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're working with complex XML responses you may find [Console logging](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-in-the-console) useful.
</Info>

To parse CSV, use the [CSV parse (csv-parse/lib/sync)](https://csv.js.org/parse/) utility:

```js
const parse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync');
const responseJson = parse(pm.response.text());
```

To parse HTML, use [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) with the [`require` method](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#use-external-libraries-in-packages):

```js
const $ = require('cheerio').load(pm.response.text());
//output the html for testing
console.log($.html());
```

### Handle responses that don't parse

If you can't parse the response body into JavaScript because it's not formatted as JSON, XML, HTML, CSV, or any other parsable data format, you can still make assertions on the data.

Test if the response body has a string:

```js
pm.test("Body contains string",() => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("customer_id");
});
```

This doesn't tell you where the string was encountered because it carries out the test on the whole response body. Test if a response matches a string:

```js
pm.test("Body is string", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.body("whole-body-text");
});
```

## Make assertions on the HTTP response

Your tests can check various aspects of a request response, including the [body](#test-response-body), [status codes](#test-status-codes), [headers](#test-headers), [cookies](#test-cookies), [response times](#test-response-times), and more.

### Test response body

Check for particular values in the response body:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "name": "Jane",
  "age": 23
},
*/
pm.test("Person is Jane", () => {
  const responseJson = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(responseJson.name).to.eql("Jane");
  pm.expect(responseJson.age).to.eql(23);
});
```

### Test status codes

Test for the response status code:

```js
pm.test("Status code is 201", () => {
  pm.response.to.have.status(201);
});
```

If you want to test for the status code being one of a set, include them all in an array and use `oneOf`:

```js
pm.test("Successful POST request", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.be.oneOf([201,202]);
});
```

Check the status code text:

```js
pm.test("Status code name has string", () => {
  pm.response.to.have.status("Created");
});
```

### Test headers

Check that a response header is present:

```js
pm.test("Content-Type header is present", () => {
  pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Type");
});
```

Test for a response header having a particular value:

```js
pm.test("Content-Type header is application/json", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get('Content-Type')).to.include('application/json');
});
```

### Test cookies

Test if a cookie is present in the response:

```js
pm.test("Cookie isLoggedIn is present", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.cookies.has('isLoggedIn')).to.be.true;
});
```

Test for a particular cookie value:

```js
pm.test("Cookie isLoggedIn has value 1", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.cookies.get('isLoggedIn')).to.eql('1');
});
```

## Common assertion examples

The following examples of common assertions might help you write your post-response scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For a more comprehensive overview of what you can include in your assertions, refer to the [Chai Assertion Library Docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/).
</Info>

### Assert a response value against a variable

Check if a response property has the same value as a variable (this example uses an environment variable):

```js
pm.test("Response property matches environment variable", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.json().name).to.eql(pm.environment.get("name"));
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  See [Using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) to learn more about using variables in your post-response scripts.
</Info>

### Assert a value type

Test the type of any part of the response:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "name": "Jane",
  "age": 29,
  "hobbies": [
    "skating",
    "painting"
  ],
  "email": null
},
*/
const jsonData = pm.response.json();
pm.test("Test data type of the response", () => {
  pm.expect(jsonData).to.be.an("object");
  pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.be.a("string");
  pm.expect(jsonData.age).to.be.a("number");
  pm.expect(jsonData.hobbies).to.be.an("array");
  pm.expect(jsonData.website).to.be.undefined;
  pm.expect(jsonData.email).to.be.null;
});
```

### Assert array properties

Check if an array is empty, and if it has particular items:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "errors": [],
  "areas": [ "goods", "services" ],
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "notification",
      "detail": [ "email", "sms" ]
    },
    {
      "type": "visual",
      "detail": [ "light", "large" ]
    }
  ]
},
*/

const jsonData = pm.response.json();
pm.test("Test array properties", () => {
    //errors array is empty
  pm.expect(jsonData.errors).to.be.empty;
    //areas array includes "goods"
  pm.expect(jsonData.areas).to.include("goods");
    //get the notification settings object
  const notificationSettings = jsonData.settings.find
      (m => m.type === "notification");
  pm.expect(notificationSettings)
    .to.be.an("object", "Could not find the setting");
    //detail array must include "sms"
  pm.expect(notificationSettings.detail).to.include("sms");
    //detail array must include all listed
  pm.expect(notificationSettings.detail)
    .to.have.members(["email", "sms"]);
});
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The order in `.members` doesn't affect the test.
</Info>

### Assert object properties

Assert that an object has keys or properties:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
},
*/
pm.expect({a: 1, b: 2}).to.have.all.keys('a', 'b');
pm.expect({a: 1, b: 2}).to.have.any.keys('a', 'b');
pm.expect({a: 1, b: 2}).to.not.have.any.keys('c', 'd');
pm.expect({a: 1}).to.have.property('a');
pm.expect({a: 1, b: 2}).to.be.a('object')
  .that.has.all.keys('a', 'b');
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Target can be an `object`, `set`, `array` or `map`. If `.keys` is run without `.all` or `.any`, the expression defaults to `.all`. As `.keys` behavior varies based on the target `type`, it's recommended to check the `type` before using `.keys` with `.a`.
</Info>

### Assert that a value is in a set

Check a response value against a list of valid options:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "type": "Subscriber"
},
*/

pm.test("Value is in valid list", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.response.json().type)
    .to.be.oneOf(["Subscriber", "Customer", "User"]);
});
```

### Assert that an object is contained

Check that an object is part of a parent object:

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "id": "d8893057-3e91-4cdd-a36f-a0af460b6373",
  "created": true,
  "errors": []
},
*/

pm.test("Object is contained", () => {
  const expectedObject = {
    "created": true,
    "errors": []
  };
  pm.expect(pm.response.json()).to.deep.include(expectedObject);
});
```

The `.deep` assertion causes all `.equal`, `.include`, `.members`, `.keys`, and `.property` assertions that follow in the chain to use deep equality instead of strict (`===`) equality.

### Assert the current environment

Check the [active environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#switch-between-environments) in Postman:

```js
pm.test("Check the active environment", () => {
  pm.expect(pm.environment.name).to.eql("Production");
});
```

# Use dynamic variables to return randomly generated data

The [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library enables you to generate sample data in Postman using predefined variables. Use these variables like you would any other variable in Postman. Their values are generated when the request runs, and their names start with a `$` symbol, for example, `$guid` or `$timestamp`.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  <img alt="Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Collections.png#icon" width="24px" /> See how to use dynamic variables to create randomized mock data. To try out this collection template to [generate fake test data](https://www.postman.com/templates/collections/generate-fake-test-data/).
</Info>

To use dynamic variables in pre-request or post-response scripts, use `pm.variables.replaceIn()` and surround the variable names below with double curly braces. For example, to enter a random first name, use `pm.variables.replaceIn('{{$randomFirstName}}')`. Note that variable names are case-sensitive.

The following is a list of dynamic variables whose values are randomly generated during the request/collection run.

# Postman Sandbox API reference

Postman provides JavaScript APIs with the `pm` object, enabling you to test and access request and response data in your test scripts run in the [Postman Sandbox](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-sandbox). You can use the `pm` object to access request and response details, write assertions, and access and use variables. You can also use the `pm` object to send HTTP requests and other meta information in the Postman Sandbox.

## Use scripts to access cookies

Use the `pm.cookies` methods in scripts to access and manipulate cookies. To learn more, see [Access cookies in Postman scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-cookies/).

## Use scripts with requests and responses

Reference requests and responses with the `pm.request` and `pm.response` objects in scripts. Streaming protocols also return a `pm.message` object. The `pm.info` object contains meta info related to the request and script Use the `pm.sendRequest` method in your scripts to send requests in Postman. To learn more, see [Reference Postman requests in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-request/), [Use scripts to send requests in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-send-request/), [Reference request metadata in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-info/) and [Reference message data in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-message/).

## Use scripts with collections

The `pm.execution` object provides information and context about requests and their responses during a [collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), such as sending requests or which request is running, its position in a collection, and run-related metadata. To learn more, see [Use scripts in collection runs](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-execution/).

## Script variables

Access and manipulate different [variable types](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) and scopes in your scripts. To learn more, see [Reference variables in Postman scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-variables/).

## Use scripts to visualize data

The `pm.visualizer` object enables you to visually represent your API's request responses with the [Postman Visualizer](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/visualizer/). To learn more, see [Script Postman visualizations](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-visualizer/).

## Manage Postman Vault with scripts

Access and manipulate [vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) in your scripts with the `pm.vault` methods. To learn more, see [Reference vault secrets in Postman scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/).

## Test assertions with scripts

Use the `pm.test` and `pm.expect` methods in your scripts to add test specifications and assertions. To learn more, see [Writing tests and assertions in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-test-expect/).

## Import packages into your scripts

The `pm.require` method enables you to import packages from your team's [Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) or [external package registries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) inside scripts in HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests. To learn more, see [Import packages into your scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-require/).

# Reference variables in Postman scripts

Access and manipulate [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) in your scripts at a variety of [variable scopes](#variable-scope-precedence) with the `pm` object. You can use the [pm.globals](#pmglobals), [pm.collectionVariables](#pmcollectionvariables), [pm.environment](#pmenvironment), [pm.iterationData](#pmiterationdata), and [pm.variables](#pmvariables) methods to access variables at individual scopes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Use the [pm.vault](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/) method to access vault secrets in your Postman Vault.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can learn about using variables in the [Postman Collection SDK](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Variable.html).
</Info>

## Variable scope precedence

Variable scope determines the precedence Postman gives to variables when you reference them in your scripts. The following is the variable scope precedence from broadest to narrowest: global, collection, environment, data, and local. Learn more about [variables scopes in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes).

When referencing the `pm.variables` method in your scripts, the variable with the closest scope overrides the others. For example, if you have variables named `score` in the current collection and active environment, `pm.variables.get('score')` returns the current value of the environment variable. You can use `pm.variables.set` to create a local variable with a different value, but the value only persists for the current request or collection run.

The following example shows the scope Postman prioritizes when multiple variables are set with the same name:

```js
// collection var 'score' = 1
// environment var 'score' = 2

// first request run
console.log(pm.variables.get('score')); // outputs 2
console.log(pm.collectionVariables.get('score')); // outputs 1
console.log(pm.environment.get('score')); // outputs 2

// second request run
pm.variables.set('score', 3);// local var
console.log(pm.variables.get('score')); // outputs 3

// third request run

# Reference vault secrets in Postman scripts

Access and manipulate [vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) in your scripts with the `pm.vault` methods. You must [enable support for vault secrets in scripts](#enable-support-for-vault-secrets-in-scripts). When you send a request or manually run a collection that uses the `pm.vault` methods, you'll be prompted to [grant or deny](#grant-scripts-access-to-your-vault-secrets) the collection or workspace access to your vault secrets using scripts.

You can use the [`pm.vault` methods](#pmvault) in pre-request and post-response scripts in your HTTP collections and requests and manual collection runs.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Scheduled collection runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support the `pm.vault` methods. The methods also aren't supported in [multi-protocol](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections), such as GraphQL and gRPC.
</Info>

Note the following when using the `pm.vault` methods:

* Use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to access [vault secrets linked to external vaults](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/).
* Use the [Postman Desktop Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-desktop-agent) if using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) to access vault secrets. Postman recommends you [use the latest version](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#update-the-postman-desktop-agent) of the Postman Desktop Agent to receive recent changes and improvements.

## Enable support for vault secrets in scripts

You must enable support for vault secrets in scripts. You'll be prompted to [grant or deny](#grant-scripts-access-to-your-vault-secrets) a collection or the workspace access to your vault secrets before you can use the [`pm.vault` methods](#pmvault).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you try to send requests that use `pm.vault` methods without enabling support, you'll receive an error in the Postman Console. Also, any code that comes after a `pm.vault` method won't run.
</Info>

To enable support for vault secrets in scripts, do the following:

1. [Open your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/).
2. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the upper right of your Postman Vault.
3. In the **Settings** tab, turn on the toggle next to **Enable support in scripts**.
4. Click **Enable** to confirm.

## Grant scripts access to your vault secrets

Postman only allows you to run the [`pm.vault` methods](#pmvault) from collections or workspaces you've granted access. When you send a request or manually run a collection that uses the methods, you'll be prompted to [grant or deny access](#grant-or-deny-access) to your vault secrets using scripts. You can [manage the collection or workspace's access](#manage-access-to-your-vault-secrets) to your vault secrets from your Postman Vault.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You'll only be prompted to grant or deny access if you've [enabled support for vault secrets in scripts](#enable-support-for-vault-secrets-in-scripts).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A new HTTP request not saved to a collection won't be prompted because it'll automatically be granted access to your vault secrets.
</Info>

### Grant or deny access

You can grant or deny a collection or workspace access to your vault secrets using scripts. To keep vault secrets in your Postman Vault secure, make sure to only run scripts you trust.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you deny the collection or workspace access to your vault secrets, you'll receive an error in the Postman Console when you send a request at the denied level. Also, any code that comes after a `pm.vault` method won't run when you send a request or manually run a collection.
</Info>

To grant or deny access to your vault secrets using scripts, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then open an HTTP collection or request with a script that accesses or manipulates your vault secrets.

2. [Send the request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/#send-a-request) or [manually run the collection](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

3. Choose the element you'd like to grant or deny access to:

   * **Only this collection** - To grant or deny access to all requests in the collection.
   * **Entire Workspace** - To grant or deny access to all collections and requests in the workspace.

4. Choose if you'd like to **Grant Access** or **Deny Access**.

Once you've chosen to grant or deny access, Postman won't prompt you again at the chosen level. For example, if you denied access to one collection, Postman will prompt you again from another collection in the workspace. You can [manage the collections and workspace](#manage-access-to-your-vault-secrets) you granted or denied access to.

### Manage access to your vault secrets

To manage a collection or workspace's access to your vault secrets, do the following:

2. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the upper right of your Postman Vault.
3. Click the **Manage Access** tab.
4. Click one of the following next to a collection or workspace, depending on whether you granted or denied access earlier:

   * **Reset Access** - Reset your decision to grant scripts in the collection or workspace access to your vault secrets. When you send a request in the collection or workspace, you'll be prompted again to grant or deny access.
   * **Grant Access** - Grant all scripts in the collection or workspace access to your vault secrets. This option is available if you denied scripts in the collection or workspace access.

## pm.vault

Use the `pm.vault` methods in your scripts to get, set, and remove [vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) in your Postman Vault.

The `pm.vault` methods run asynchronously in your scripts. Each method also returns a Promise object that represents the completion or failure of the method. Add the `await` operator before each `pm.vault` method to wait for the Promise and its resulting value. Note that a method without the `await` operator may run in your script, but it may not behave as expected.

Use the syntax shown in the following examples:

```js
console.log(await pm.vault.get("secretKey"));
await pm.vault.set("secretKey", "newValue");
await pm.vault.unset("secretKey");
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you log the value of a vault secret using `console.log`, the value will be masked in the Postman Console by default. To unmask the value of vault secrets in the console, [open your Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-key/), select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings**, then turn off the toggle next to **Mask vault secrets** from the **Settings** tab.

# Reference Postman requests in scripts

The `pm.request` object provides access to the data for the request from a script running within it. `pm.request` is available in both **Before invoke** and **After response** scripts. For a **Pre-request** script, this is the request that's about to run. For a **Post-response** script, this is the request that has already run.

You can use the `pm.request` object pre-request scripts to alter various parts of the request configuration before it runs.

## pm.request

Use the `pm.request` methods in your scripts to access and manipulate collection requests.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  See the Postman [Collection SDK Request reference](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Request.html) for more information.
</Info>

### pm.request.headers.add(header:Header):function

Adds a header with the given name and value for the current request.

### pm.request.headers.remove(headerName:String):function

Deletes the request header with the given name.

### pm.request.headers.upsert(\{key: headerName:String, value: headerValue:String}):function

Inserts the given header name and value if the header doesn't exist. If it exists, the existing header updates with the given value.

## Examples

Add a header with the given name and value for the current request:

```js
pm.request.headers.add({
  key: "client-id",
  value: "abcdef"
});
```

## pm.request properties

The `pm.request` object contains the following properties:

* `pm.request.url:Url` - The request's URL.

* `pm.request.headers:HeaderList` - The list of headers for the current request.

* `pm.request.method:String` - The HTTP request's method.&#x20;

* `pm.request.methodPath` - The package, service, and method name in `packageName.serviceName.methodName` format.&#x20;

* `pm.request.body:RequestBody` - The request body's data. This object is immutable and can't be modified from scripts.

* `pm.request.auth` - The request's authentication details.&#x20;

* `pm.request.metadata` - The list of metadata sent with the request. An individual metadata item is an object containing the `key` and `value` properties. For example, `PropertyList<{ key: string, value: string }>`.

* `pm.request.messages` - The list of outgoing messages.  An individual message is a [`PropertyList`](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/PropertyList.html) object with the following properties:

  * `data` - The contents of the sent message.
  * `timestamp` - The time the message was sent, represented as a Date object.

  For requests with unary and server streaming methods, `pm.request.messages` contains only one message at index `0`, which can be accessed as `pm.request.messages.idx(0)`.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Request mutation isn't supported in the `pm` object.
</Info>


# Reference Postman responses in scripts

The `pm.response` object provides access to the data returned in the response for the current request. This object is only available in **Post-response** scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more information, see the Postman Collection SDK [Response](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Response.html) reference.
</Info>

## pm.response

Use the `pm.response` methods in your scripts to access and manipulate responses.

### pm.response.text():Function

Gets the response text string.

### pm.response.json():Function

Gets the response JSON object, which you can use to get the properties received.

## pm.response properties

The `pm.response` object contains the following properties:

* `pm.response.code:Number` - The response status code.

* `pm.response.status:String` - The status text string.

* `pm.response.headers:HeaderList` - The [list of response headers](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/HeaderList.html).

* `pm.response.responseTime:Number` - The time the response took to receive in milliseconds. For requests with streaming methods, `responseTime` denotes the total duration for that request execution.

* `pm.response.responseSize:Number`- The size of the response received.

- `pm.response.metadata` - The list of metadata received with the response. An individual metadata item is a [`PropertyList`](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/PropertyList.html) object with the `key` and `value` properties.

- `pm.response.trailers` - The list of trailers received with the response. An individual trailer item is a `PropertyList` object with the `key` and `value` properties.

- `pm.response.messages` - The list of outgoing messages.  An individual message is a `PropertyList` object containing the following properties:

  * `data` - The contents of the received message.
  * `timestamp` - The time the message was received, represented as a `Date` object.

  For requests with unary and client streaming methods, `pm.response.messages` contains only one message at index `0`, which can be accessed as `pm.response.messages.idx(0)`.

## Validate response data with a JSON Schema

The `jsonSchema` method enables you to [write a test assertion](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-test-expect/#pmtest) that validates the response data with a JSON Schema. Postman uses version 6.12.5 of the [Ajv JSON Schema validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv/v/6.12.5) to validate response data with a JSON Schema.

To write your test assertion, use the `pm.response` object and [Chai Assertion Library BDD](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) syntax to access the data returned in the response.

The `jsonSchema` method accepts a JSON Schema as an object in the first argument. It also accepts an object of optional [Ajv options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv/v/6.12.5#options) in the second argument:

```js
pm.response.<bdd-syntax>.jsonSchema(schema, options);
```

You can define a JSON Schema in Postman, such as in the **Scripts** tab of a request. Then you can write a test that validates the properties in your response data against the defined JSON Schema.

### Examples

In this example, the JSON Schema requires the response data to contain an `alpha` property that's a Boolean data type. If the response data is missing this property or it's a different data type, the test fails. This example uses BDD syntax `to.have` to express the assertion:

```js
const schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "alpha": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "required": ["alpha"]
};

pm.test('Response is valid', function() {
  pm.response.to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
});
```


# Use scripts to send requests in Postman

Use the `pm.sendRequest` method to send a request asynchronously from a **Pre-request** or **Post-response** script in HTTP requests. For gRPC scripts, you can use the method in **Before invoke**, **On message**, and **After response** scripts.&#x20;

This method enables you to run logic in the background if you are carrying out computation or sending multiple requests at the same time without waiting for each to complete. You can avoid blocking issues by adding a callback function so that your code can respond when Postman receives a response. You can then carry out any more processing you need on the response data.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To send a request in your collection using its request ID, [use the `pm.execution.runRequest` method](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-execution/#pmexecutionrunrequest-method).
</Info>

## pm.sendRequest

You can pass the `pm.sendRequest` method a URL string, or you can provide a complete request configuration in JSON including headers, method, body, [and more](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Request.html#~definition).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more information, see the [Request definition](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Request.html#~definition) and [Response structure](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Response.html) reference documentation.
</Info>

The following examples demonstrate use of the `pm.sendRequest` method:

### Examples

Example with a plain string URL:

```js
try {
    const response = await pm.sendRequest('https://postman-echo.com/get');

    console.log(response.json());
}
catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
}
```

Example with a full-fledged request:

```js
const postRequest = {
  url: 'https://postman-echo.com/post',
  method: 'POST',
  header: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Foo': 'bar'
  },
  body: {
    mode: 'raw',
    raw: JSON.stringify({ key: 'this is json' })
  }
};
pm.sendRequest(postRequest, (error, response) => {
  console.log(error ? error : response.json());
});
```

Example containing a test:

```js
pm.sendRequest('https://postman-echo.com/get', (error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }

  pm.test('response should be okay to process', () => {
    pm.expect(error).to.equal(null);
    pm.expect(response).to.have.property('code', 200);
    pm.expect(response).to.have.property('status', 'OK');
  });
});
```


# Script Postman visualizations

You can use the `pm.visualizer` object and the `pm.getData` method to visually represent your API's request responses with the [Postman Visualizer](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/visualizer/).

## pm.visualizer

Use the `pm.visualizer.set` method to specify a template you want to use to display response data in the Postman Visualizer:

```js
pm.visualizer.set(layout:String, data:Object, options:Object):Function
```

This method uses the following properties:

* `layout` - (Required) A [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) HTML template string.
* `data` - A JSON object that binds to the template. You can access it inside the template string.
* `options` - An [Options object](https://handlebarsjs.com/api-reference/compilation.html) for `Handlebars.compile()`.

Example:

```js
var template = `<p>{{res.info}}</p>`;
pm.visualizer.set(template, {
    res: pm.response.json()
});
```

## pm.getData

Use the `pm.getData` method to get response data inside a Postman Visualizer template string.

```js
pm.getData(callback):Function
```

The `callback` function accepts the following parameters:

* `error` - Any error detail.
* `data` - Data passed to the template by the `pm.visualizer.set` method.

Example:

```js
pm.getData(function (error, data) {
  var value = data.res.info;
});
```


# Writing tests and assertions in scripts

You can add test specifications and assertions to your scripts using the [pm.test](#pmtest) and [pm.expect](#pmexpect) methods.

## pm.test

Use the `pm.test` method to add test specifications inside **Pre-request** or **Post-response** scripts (for HTTP) or **Before invoke**, **On message**, or **After response** scripts (for gRPC).   Tests include a name and assertion function.

A test for HTTP request would look something like the following:

```js
pm.test(testName , specFunction)
```

Where:

* `testName` - A string that contains the test's name.
* `specFunction` - The function defining the test logic.

Postman outputs test results as part of the response. The `pm.test` method returns the `pm` object, enabling you to chain calls.

### Examples

Check whether a response is valid to proceed:

```js
pm.test("response should be okay to process", function () {
  pm.response.to.not.be.error;
  pm.response.to.have.jsonBody('data') // checks existence of a property in the JSON response
  pm.response.to.have.jsonBody('data', { "id" : 1 }); // Performs deep comparison
});
```

Test an asynchronous function using an optional `done` callback:

```js
pm.test('async test', function (done) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.equal(200);
    done();
  }, 1500);
});
```

Get the total number of tests run from a specific location in code:

```js
pm.test.index(); // Number
```

Include multiple assertions to group the related assertions in a single gRPC test:

```js
pm.test("Should receive update events for both users", function () {
  pm.response.messages.to.include({ action: 'update', userId: 'user1' });
  pm.response.messages.to.include({ action: 'update', userId: 'user2' });
});
```

Get the total number of tests run from a specific location in code:

```js
pm.test.index; () =>number
```

Skip a test:

```js
pm.test.skip: (testName, specFunction) => pm
```

## pm.expect

The `pm.expect` method enables you to write assertions on your response data using [ChaiJS expect BDD](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/) syntax.

```js
pm.expect(value: *): Assertion
```

* `value` - What you want to test, where `*` can be any type of value, such as a string or integer.
* `Assertion` - A Chai Assertion object containing chainable methods.

You can also use `pm.response.to.have.*` and `pm.response.to.be.*` to build your assertions.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  See [Postman test script examples](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-examples/) for more assertions.
</Info>

### Examples

Check if the response returns an HTTP 200 OK response:

```js
pm.test("Response status code is 200", function () {
    // value: pm.response.code (a number)
    // Assertion: checks if it equals 200
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.eql(200);
});
```

Check if the request's response body contains the `true` value:

```js
pm.test("Response body has success = true", function () {
    const jsonData = pm.response.json();
    // value: jsonData.success (a boolean)
    // Assertion: checks if it equals true
    pm.expect(jsonData.success).to.eql(true);
});
```


# Import packages into your scripts

You can use the `pm.require` method to import packages from your team's [Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) or [external package registries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) inside scripts in HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

## pm.require

The `pm.require` method accepts the name of a package. Declare the method as a variable if the package has functions or objects you want to call. If the package only has code or instances of the `pm` object, you don't need to declare the method as a variable.

### Examples

Use the following format to import a package from the Package Library:

```js
const variableName = pm.require('@team-domain/package-name');

variableName.functionName()
```

Use the following format to import an external package from a package registry:

```js
// package imported from npm
const npmVariableName = pm.require('npm:package-name@version-number');

npmVariableName.functionName()

// package imported from jsr
const jsrVariableName = pm.require('jsr:package-name@version-number');

jsrVariableName.functionName()
```

# Use scripts in collection runs

The `pm.execution` object provides information and context about requests and their responses during a [collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), such as sending requests or which request is running, its position in a collection, and run-related metadata.

## pm.execution.runRequest method

Use the `pm.execution.runRequest` method in a pre-request or post-response script to send HTTP requests stored in your collections.

A *referenced request* is the request referenced in the method. A *root request* is the request or collection where you call the method. You can call the method a maximum of 10 times from each script.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To write a request directly in your script, use the [`pm.sendRequest`](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-send-request/#pmsendrequest) method.
</Info>

Consider the following when using this method:

* The `pm.execution.runRequest` method isn't supported with Newman or the Postman VS Code extension.
* The `pm.execution.setNextRequest` and [`pm.visualizer`](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-visualizer/) methods won't run in the referenced request.
* The referenced request won't run if it uses the `pm.execution.skipRequest` method in its pre-request script. The `pm.execution.runRequest` method returns a `null` value in the response.
* If the referenced request uses [`pm.vault`](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/) methods and the root request is in a different collection, you're prompted to [grant the script access](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-vault/#grant-scripts-access-to-your-vault-secrets) to your vault secrets.
* If the referenced request uses [`pm.cookies.jar`](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-cookies/), make sure the referenced request's URL is added to the root request's [domain allowlist](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/cookies/#access-cookies-in-scripts).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Request IDs aren't preserved when you [export a collection](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/). If you import a collection with requests referenced using the `pm.execution.runRequest` method, you'll need to update the request IDs in the root request.
</Info>

### Variable resolution

When resolving variables, the `pm.execution.runRequest` method uses the following order, from lowest to highest priority:

* Global variables
* The root request's collection variables
* The referenced request's collection variables
* Environment variables
* Data variables
* Local variables
* Variable overrides provided by the `pm.execution.runRequest` method's second argument

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For information about Postman's resolution precedence for variables, see [Variable scopes](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes).
</Info>

### Arguments

The `pm.execution.runRequest` method accepts the following arguments:

* As its first argument, the `pm.execution.runRequest` method accepts the request ID of the referenced request. The request dropdown list displays when you enter the argument. Enter the request or collection's name, then select a request from the dropdown list. The dropdown list shows requests in the current workspace and any workspace you have access to. You can also enter the request ID or [link to the request](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#renaming-and-linking-elements). The argument displays the referenced request's method and name, and you can click this to update the argument.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    To get a request's ID, click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the [right sidebar](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#right-sidebar) of a request, then click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy request ID**.
  </Info>

* As the second argument, the method accepts an options object that overrides variables referenced in the request. Learn about the order the method follows to [resolve variables](#variable-resolution).

![Use scripts to send request stored in collection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reusable-request-script-v11-63.jpg)

When you send the root request, the referenced request runs as it's configured in its collection. This includes defined parameters, headers, variables, test scripts, and more. As an example, if the referenced request has [test assertions](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-test-expect#pmtest) in its scripts, the test results display in the root request where you called the method. As another example, if the referenced request references variables defined in one of its parent elements, these variable values are used when you send the root request.

The method runs asynchronously in your scripts and returns a Promise object that represents the completion or failure of the method. Add the `await` operator before the method to wait for the Promise and its resulting value. The method may run in your script without the `await` operator, but it may not behave as expected.

### Examples

Use the syntax shown in the following example:

```js
try {
  const response = await pm.execution.runRequest(
    "12345678-12345ab-1234-1ab2-1ab2-ab1234112a12",
    {
      variables: {
        base_url: "https://example.com",
        vip: "123"
      }
    }
  );

  console.log("Response received from collection request with status:", response.code, response.json());
}
catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to send a request from the collection", error);
}
```

## pm.execution.skipRequest

The `pm.execution.skipRequest` method enables you to stop the run of a request from a [pre-request script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/).

```js
pm.execution.skipRequest()
```

You can use the `pm.execution.skipRequest` method in the **Pre-request** tab of a request, collection, or folder. When `pm.execution.skipRequest()` is encountered, the request isn't sent. Any remaining scripts in the **Pre-request** tab are skipped, and no tests are run.

In the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/), when `pm.execution.skipRequest()` is encountered, Postman skips running the current request (including its post-response scripts) and moves to the next request in order. The run results will show no response and no tests found for the request. This same behavior also applies to [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/), [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/), and [the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Using the `pm.execution.skipRequest` method isn't supported in the **Post-response** tab of a request, collection, or folder and will have no effect there. You will also get a `TypeError: pm.execution.skipRequest isn't a function` Console error.
</Info>

### Examples

Skip a request if an authentication token isn't present:

```js
if (!pm.environment.get('token')) {
  pm.execution.skipRequest()
}
```

## pm.execution.setNextRequest

You can use the `pm.execution.setNextRequest` method for building request workflows when you use the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  `setNextRequest` has no effect when you run requests using **Send**. It only has an effect when you run a collection.
</Info>

When you run a collection with the Collection Runner or Newman, Postman runs your requests in a default order or an order you specify when you set up the run. However, you can override this run order using `pm.execution.setNextRequest` to specify which request to run next.

### Examples

Run the specified request after this one (where `requestName` is the name of the collection's request, for example "Get customers"):

```bash
pm.execution.setNextRequest(requestName:String):Function
```

Run the specified request after this one (where `requestId` is the request ID returned by `pm.info.requestId`):

```js
//script in another request calls:
//pm.environment.set('next', pm.info.requestId)
pm.execution.setNextRequest(pm.environment.get('next'));
```

## pm.execution.location

The `pm.execution.location` property enables you to get a request's complete path, including its parent folder and collection, in array format.

You can use the `pm.execution.location` and `pm.execution.location.current` properties in your scripts to understand which items run when a request is sent. This information enables you to implement logic and actions in your scripts tailored to the current location within your API testing or collection structure.

### Examples

For a request named **R1** in folder **F1** in the **C1** collection, the following post-response script code returns the `["C1", "F1", "R1"]` array:

```js
console.log(pm.execution.location);
```

To get the name of the current element, use the `pm.execution.location.current` property. For example, if you add the following code to the pre-request script of a folder named **F1**, it returns `F1`:

```js
console.log(pm.execution.location.current);
```


# Reference message data in scripts

The `pm.message` object provides access to the data returned in the message that's received from the server. `pm.message` is only available in **On message** scripts.

## pm.message properties

The `pm.message` object contains the following properties:

For an incoming message:

* `pm.message: PropertyList<{ data: any, timestamp: Date }>` - An individual message [`PropertyList`](https://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/PropertyList.html) object with the `key` and `value` properties:
* `data` - The received message content.
* `timestamp` - The time the message was received, represented as a `Date` object.


# Reference request metadata in scripts

The `pm.info` object provides meta information related to the request and the script itself.

## pm.info properties

The `pm.info` object contains the following properties:

* `pm.info.eventName:String` - For HTTP requests, this is either `prerequest` or `test`, depending on where the script is executing within the request. For gRPC, it's either `beforeInvoke`, `onIncomingMessage`, or `afterResponse`, depending whether script is running a **Before invoke**, **On message**, or **After response** hook, respectively.&#x20;

* `pm.info.iteration:Number` - The value of the current [iteration](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

* `pm.info.iterationCount:Number` - The total number of iterations that are scheduled to run.

* `pm.info.requestName:String` - The saved name of the request running.

* `pm.info.requestId:String` - A unique GUID that identifies the running request.


# Troubleshoot common test errors

When you encounter errors or unexpected behavior in your post-response scripts, [the Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/) can help you to identify the source.

## Use the Postman Console logs

By combining `console.log()`, `console.info()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()` debug statements with your test assertions, you can examine the content of the HTTP requests and responses, and Postman data items such as variables. You can also use the `console.clear()` method to clear information from the console. Select <img alt="Console icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-console-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Console** from the Postman footer to open it.

![Console info](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/console-logs-in-pane-v11-v2.jpg)

Log the value of a variable or response property:

```js
console.log(pm.collectionVariables.get("name"));
console.log(pm.response.json().name);
```

Log the type of variable or response property:

```js
console.log(typeof pm.response.json().id);
```

Use Console logs to mark code execution, sometimes known as "trace statements":

```js
if (pm.response.json().id) {
  console.log("id was found!");
  // do something
} else {
  console.log("no id ...");
  //do something else
}
```

## Assertion deep equality error

You might encounter the `AssertionError: expected <value> to deeply equal '<value>'` error. For example, this would arise with the following code:

```js
pm.expect(1).to.eql("1");
```

This happens because the test is comparing a number to a string value. The test will only return true if both the type and value are equal.

## Variable not defined error

You might encounter the `ReferenceError: <variable> is not defined` error. This typically happens when you're attempting to reference a variable that hasn't been declared or is outside the scope of your test code.

In the following example, a JSON object is the value of a variable in the first test. The second test is attempting to reference the variable, but it can't because the variable is outside the scope of the second test's code.

```js
/* Response has the following structure:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 29
},
*/
pm.test("Test 1", () => {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql("John");
});

pm.test("Test 2", () => {
  pm.expect(jsonData.age).to.eql(29); // ReferenceError: jsonData is not defined
});
```

Make sure variables are available at the global scope if test functions needs to reference it. In the previous example, moving `const jsonData = pm.response.json();` before the first `pm.test` would make it available to both test functions.

## Assertion undefined error

You might encounter the `AssertionError: expected undefined to deeply equal <value>` error. Typically this happens when you are referring to a property that doesn't exist or is out of scope.

```js
const jsonData = pm.response.json();
pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql("John");
```

In this example, if you get the error `AssertionError: expected undefined to deeply equal 'John'`, this indicates that the `name` property isn't defined in the `jsonData` object.

## Test not failing

There may be occasions where you expect a test to fail, and it doesn't. Make sure your test code is syntactically correct, then resend your request.

In the following example, the test is expected to fail because `true` doesn't equal `false`. The test actually passes because the `pm.test` function isn't correctly defined. The `pm.test` function is missing the first parameter, which is a text string that displays in the test result output. You can learn more about [defining tests using the `pm.test` function](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/#validate-responses).

```js
pm.test( function () {
    pm.expect(true).to.eql(false);
});
```


# Test API functionality and performance in Postman

Testing is a critical part of the API development lifecycle. Testing confirms that API endpoints, methods, and integrations work as expected and that your API can meet the expected load.

Here are some of the essential types of API testing you can perform in Postman:

* **Integration testing** - Observe data flow and test compatibility between the various components in your application. You can also test how your application interacts with other systems. Learn more at [Test API integrations and data flow in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/integration-testing/).

* **End-to-end testing** - Simulate complex user operations from start to finish to test real-world workflows. End-to-ending testing makes sure the entire system works as expected and helps identify problems with user experience. Learn more at [Test end-to-end API workflows in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/end-to-end-testing/).

* **Regression testing** - Make sure updates and improvements to your application don't introduce any new defects or issues. Regression testing supports the overall quality of your API by ensuring code changes are backwards compatible. Learn more at [Test your APIs for regressions in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/regression-testing/).

* **Performance testing** - Simulate real-world traffic to your application with virtual users. Each virtual user sends a series of requests to your API, so you can observe how your API behaves under load. Learn more at [Test your API's performance in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/performance-testing/).

To explore recommended testing types across different API patterns, see [best practices for API test automation in Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/api-test-automation/).


# Test API integrations and data flow in Postman

As an application grows, it's important to make sure each of its components work together as expected. *Integration testing* makes sure that the different parts of your application are compatible with one another. It also tests how your application functions with other systems, like databases and third-party services.

## About integration testing

Rather than trying to test an entire application at once, integration testing focuses on individual components and how they interact. This makes it easier to identify the pieces of your application that aren't able to communicate, or places where data isn't flowing between components as required.

With Postman, you can test how your application's APIs work together using requests and collections. You can send API requests in a predefined order to test complex operations, and you can observe the flow of data to and from endpoints. You can also send API requests to other systems or services to make sure your application can integrate with them as needed.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  <img alt="Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Collections.png#icon" width="24px" /> View an example that shows how you can use Postman to set up and run integration tests for your API. To try out this collection template, see [Integration testing basics](https://www.postman.com/templates/collections/integration-testing-basics/).
</Info>

## Integration test setup in Postman

To set up integration tests for your application in Postman, use the following framework:

* **The basic unit of testing is an API request.** Each request tests a specific piece of functionality by calling an API endpoint. You can configure request authorization as needed. You can also send any required test data such as parameters, headers, and body data. Learn more about [creating and sending requests](/docs/sending-requests/requests/).

* **Write scripts to add test logic to requests.** For each request, you can write test scripts to check if the expected data is received when the request is sent. You can test and validate the response code, headers, body data, and more. Learn more about [writing test scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).

* **Organize suites of tests using collections.** You can save multiple requests in a collection and organize them into categories. Collections enable you to run and rerun a group of tests in the order you choose. You can also upload data files to run tests multiple times using different data each time. Learn more about [creating collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    You can also add a test suite to an API in Postman. Learn more at [Add automated tests and CI integrations in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/testing-an-api/).
  </Info>

* **Use scripts to build complex workflows.** With scripts, you can process response data from one request and use it as an input in the next request to test data flow. You can also use scripts to dynamically control the order of requests. For example, send a request to create a user account, then send another request to get the new account and verify that it was created. Learn more about the [Postman Sandbox API reference](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/).

* **Run your tests in multiple environments.** In Postman, environments are groups of related variables you can use in your requests. Environments enable you to reuse the same suite of tests in different contexts. For example, if your test and production setups require different URLs or configuration values, you can use Postman environments to switch between them. Learn more about [working with environments and variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/).

* **Simulate other systems with mock servers.** You can test how your application interacts with other APIs and systems without having to connect to the actual resources. Instead, you can use Postman to set up a mock server that simulates the behavior of a real API server by accepting requests and returning responses. Learn more about [setting up mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/overview/).

## Run integration tests in Postman

After setting up your integration tests in Postman, you can run them in the following ways:

* **Run tests manually.** To run a single test, open a request and send it. You can view the test results in the workbench. To run an entire test suite, use the [Collection Runner](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-manually/). As the collection runs, Postman displays the test results in real time. Learn more about [running tests manually in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-manually/).

* **Automate tests on a schedule.** You can run test suites automatically on a schedule using the [Collection Runner](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-on-schedule/). Get notifications when tests fail, and view test results in Postman. Learn more about [running API tests on a schedule in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-on-schedule/).

* **Run tests in your CI/CD pipeline.** You can run tests as part of your regular application build process using the Postman CLI. Run your test suites after every code push and view test reports in Postman. Learn more about [running API tests in your CI/CD pipeline](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-with-ci-cd/).


# Test end-to-end API workflows in Postman

While unit testing focuses on individual requests and responses, *end-to-end testing* puts these pieces together to test complex user journeys. End-to-end testing touches multiple components in your application and ensures the entire system works as expected. It also identifies issues in real-world workflows before they can impact users.

## About end-to-end testing

End-to-end testing covers complete application flows from start to finish. Each flow represents the sequence of actions a user takes in the application and can involve multiple endpoints and APIs. By simulating complex user interactions, end-to-end testing can identify bottlenecks, integration errors, and problems with user experience.

With Postman, you can use collections to [send requests](/docs/sending-requests/requests/) in a specific order and chain requests together. You can also pass data between requests. This enables you to validate real-world usage scenarios and test workflows involving various system components. After running your end-to-end tests, you can view the results in Postman to find out which tests passed or failed.

# Test your APIs for regressions in Postman

*Regression testing* plays a vital role in maintaining the overall quality and performance of your API. Regression tests ensure that your API keeps working as expected after any updates or changes. They can also identify new bugs or issues introduced during development and verify that your changes are backwards compatible.

## About regression testing

When making updates or enhancements to an application, it's important to confirm that those changes don't have a negative impact on any existing functionality. Regression testing involves running a series of tests to make sure the changed components work alongside the rest of the application and don't introduce any new defects. These kinds of defects are often called *regressions*.

For an API, regression testing means verifying that updates made to the API or its environment don't affect any other components that depend on it. Regression tests can be run after any sort of change, such as fixing a bug or adding a new feature. The tests can cover the following types of API elements:

* **Status code** - Verify the API returns the expected status codes for different types of requests.
* **JSON schema** - Verify the structure and format of a response matches the API definition.
* **Response time** - Verify the API's response time is within acceptable limits.
* **Response body** - Verify the structure and content of the response body matches expectations.
* **Headers** - Verify the response headers are present and correct.

You can use automation tools like the Postman CLI to run regression tests before releasing code updates and make sure breaking changes don't make it into production. You can also schedule tests using the [Collection Runner](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-on-schedule/) to monitor test results over time and get insights into the reliability of your API.

# Test your API's performance in Postman

To ensure user success, it's not enough for your APIs to support the required functionality. Your APIs also need to handle the expected traffic volume. *Performance testing* enables you to simulate user traffic, so you can observe how your API behaves under load and identify any issues or bottlenecks.

## About performance testing

Performance testing involves simulating real-world traffic with virtual users. As the virtual users make calls to your API, you can observe how your API behaves under the load. This enables you to evaluate how well your API meets expectations for response time, throughput, and availability under various conditions.

API performance testing can help you to do the following:

* **Simulate user traffic** - Verify that your API can handle the expected traffic and check how your API responds to changes in load.

* **Locate bottlenecks** - Identify issues such as latency and errors to ensure your API scales under load.

* **Improve the user experience** - Optimize your API's performance to create a better user experience.

In Postman, you can use the [*Collection Runner*](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) to test the performance of your API. Select a collection, and all of the virtual users loop through the requests in the collection in parallel. In the Collection Runner, you can set the duration of the test and the number of virtual users. You can also choose whether the number of virtual users is fixed for the duration of the test or ramps up and down during the test.

## Run performance tests in Postman

Once you're ready, you can run your performance tests in Postman using the Collection Runner:

1. **Set up the collection you want to use for virtual users.** The requests in the collection can simulate real-world user actions. During the performance test, each virtual user loops through the requests in the collection, in parallel with the other virtual users. Learn more about [creating collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

2. **Configure settings for the performance test.** You can specify the duration of the test and the number of virtual users. You can also choose a profile to simulate different load conditions, and upload a data file to use unique data for each virtual user. Learn more about [running a performance test in Postman](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/).

3. **View real-time performance metrics and errors.** While the test runs, you can view metrics such as throughput and response time. Once the test finishes, you can view error trends and failed test assertion trends, providing details to help you debug problems. Learn more about [viewing performance test metrics](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/), [debugging performance test errors](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-errors/), and [debugging failed test assertions](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-failures/).


# Run and automate API tests in Postman

Testing is a critical part of the API development lifecycle. Postman provides a variety of ways you can run your API tests. After [setting up your tests in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/test-apis/), you can run tests manually as needed, or you can automate your tests to save time and increase test coverage.

Here are the different ways you can run your API tests in Postman:

* **Run tests manually** - To run a single test, open a request and send it. You can view the test results in the workbench. To run an entire test suite, use the [Collection Runner](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-manually/). As the collection runs, Postman displays the test results in real time. Learn more at [Run API tests manually in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-manually/).

</Info>

For guidance on how to use test automation to improve collaboration while catching issues before they hit production, see [best practices for API test automation in Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/api-test-automation/).


# Run API tests manually in Postman

In Postman, you can run your [functional API tests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/test-apis/) at any time. Running tests manually enables you to run tests on demand and view the results right away. For example, you can check if an endpoint is working or verify that a code change fixes a specific error.

Running tests manually gives you the flexibility to adjust your test plans based on the changing needs of your project. You can also use manual testing to investigate complex issues and find root causes and possible solutions.

## Run a single test

In Postman, the basic unit of testing is an [API request](/docs/sending-requests/requests/). Each request tests a specific piece of functionality by calling an API endpoint. You can use scripts to add test logic to a request. For example, you can [write test scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) to check if the expected data is received when the request is sent.

To manually run a single test, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar. Select a collection, then the request with the test you want to run.
2. (Optional) To send the request with an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), select it using the environment selector at the top right of Postman.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Click the **Test Results** tab in the request's response to view the results.

Learn more at [Send a request with the Postman API client](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

## Run a test suite

Use [Postman Collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) to organize individual API requests into a test suite. Then use the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) to run the tests in the order you choose. You can also [upload data files](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) to run tests multiple times using different data each time.

To manually run a test suite, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then select the collection or folder you want to run.
2. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.
3. On the **Functional** tab, select **Run manually**.
4. (Optional) To run the collection with an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), select it using the environment selector at the top right of Postman.
5. Select your configuration options, such as the number of iterations you want to run.
6. Click **Run Examples**. Postman displays the test results in the workbench in real time.

# Run API tests on a schedule in Postman

In Postman, you can run your [functional API tests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/test-apis/) automatically on a schedule. Use the *Collection Runner* to select a test suite, change the run order of tests, and set the run schedule. Each time the collection runs, you'll get notified if any tests fail.

During the API development process, you need to repeat tests often to ensure quality. Running tests manually is time-consuming and can lead to gaps in testing. Running your tests on a schedule saves both time and effort, and enables you to increase your test coverage. You can also view trends in your API's quality over time.

## Run tests on a schedule

You can organize individual API requests into a test suite using [Postman Collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/). You can then use the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) to configure when and how often the tests run. You can also [upload data files](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) to run tests multiple times using different data each time.

To run a test suite on a schedule, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar, then select the collection or folder you want to run on a schedule.
2. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.
3. On the **Functional** tab, select **Schedule runs**.
4. Enter the name of the scheduled run, then specify the run frequency and time.
5. Select your configuration options, such as the number of iterations you want to run and the [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) to use. You can also upload a JSON or CSV data file (1 MB maximum size) to use in your scheduled runs.
6. (Optional) Select the users you want to notify about test failures and errors.
7. Click **Schedule Run**.

# Run API tests in your CI/CD pipeline using Postman

The goal of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is to deliver frequent software updates that provide value for users. At the same time, it's important to maintain software quality. Running API tests automatically during the build process helps to ensure that every code change is ready for production.

The [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) enables you to run your test collections and monitors as part of your CI/CD pipeline. Using the Postman CLI, you can run your tests and monitor their results every time there's a push to your code repository. After the pipeline runs, you can view a detailed test report in Postman.

## Configure Postman CLI test runs

To run tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline, first create a [Postman Collection](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) with the tests you want to run. Then use Postman to generate a code snippet you can include in your CI/CD pipeline configuration. The [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) runs your test collection and monitor each time your pipeline runs.

### Run collections

To configure your CI/CD pipeline to run a test collection, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar, then select the collection or folder you want to run in your CI/CD pipeline.

# Run API tests using Postman Monitors

Postman Monitors provide a way to automatically run post-response scripts and perform tests at regular intervals. When you [set up a monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/), you choose a collection with the requests and post-response scripts you want to run, and you specify how frequently Postman runs the collection. You'll be notified if a test fails, and all results are recorded on the [monitor's dashboard](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/).

Below are some ways you can use monitors to test your APIs and ensure they're functioning correctly.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For examples of monitors in action, visit the [Postman API Monitoring Examples public workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-api-monitoring-examples/overview) to find example collections for some common monitoring use cases. You can collaborate on the collections in the workspace by [creating a fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork), or modify the collections for your team's use by [exporting and importing them into your internal workspace](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/).
</Info>

## Monitoring an API endpoint

To monitor a specific endpoint, create a collection with different variants of the same endpoint in different requests to test responses for each variant and ensure complete test coverage. To learn more about testing requests, see [Write scripts to test API response data in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/).

## Monitoring an entire API

This is similar in approach to monitoring a specific endpoint, with the subtle difference of storing the common API host in an environment variable, such that the requests across different API endpoints differ in their path, among other request parameters. Such a sequence also makes it possible to chain data across requests, which enables testing an entire API as a whole.

## Running API tests

In an API where various endpoints are interlinked, precise knowledge about their functioning is crucial. In cases where data is passed from one request to another, the entire response, or a part of it, can be saved as an environment variable. Pay extra attention while setting non-atomic values (like objects and arrays), since the original value will be lost. Instead, such complex objects and arrays can be handled as follows:

```js
// set the value
pm.environment.set('complexObj', JSON.stringify(myComplexObjOrArray, null, 2));

// get the value
var theValue;
try {
    theValue = JSON.parse(pm.environment.get('complexObj'));
}
catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    theValue = { __parseError: true };
}
if (theValue.__parseError) {
    // handle parse errors here
}
```

With the stringified nested value in place, it can be passed to subsequent requests, for instance, as a request body.

## Monitoring HTTP response codes

Response code tests can be done by checking the value within post-response scripts.

```js
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

## Monitoring latency

As an alternative to request timeouts, website response latency can be monitored within post-response scripts.

```js
pm.test("Response latency is acceptable", function () {
    // responseTime is in milliseconds
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.lte(1000);
});
```


# Organize and automate API requests in Postman Collections

[*Postman Collections*](https://www.postman.com/collection/) are portable sets of API requests that you can reuse, automate, and share with others. You can use a collection to save important details for each API request, such as the authorization type, parameters and headers, request bodies, scripts and variables, and documentation.

## Get started with collections

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **New to Postman and collections?** Learn how to [create your first collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/) in Postman.
</Info>

Create a collection to save API requests and organize them into folders. You can create a collection from scratch or by using one of Postman's predefined templates. Collections can contain HTTP requests or requests that use other protocols, such as GraphQL or gRPC.

Once you've created a collection, you can invite other team members to collaborate on it, or you can share it with the world. Learn more about [creating and managing request collections in Postman](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/).

## Run and automate collections

Use the *Collection Runner* to send some or all of the API requests in a collection in the sequence you specify. Run a collection to test your API's functionality or to replicate user workflows. You can run collections manually, on a schedule, or from a webhook. Learn more about [testing your API functionality](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also run collections from the command line or as part of your CI/CD pipeline by using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
</Info>

## Test your API's performance

You can use the Collection Runner to test the performance of your API with the same collections and requests you use for functional API tests. Simulate real-world user traffic with virtual users so you can observe how your API behaves under load. Learn more about [simulating user traffic to test your API performance](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/).

## Use collections in API development workflows

You can use Postman Collections throughout your API development, testing, and publishing workflows:

* View and generate [API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) from collections, and publish your documentation on the web.
* Create a [Postman Monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) with a collection to continuously check the health of your API and get alerts when failures occur.
* Set up a [mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) with a collection to simulate the behavior of a real server for API development and testing purposes.
* Generate collections from API specifications using [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/) or the [Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/).
* Add more details to request parameters, headers, and bodies with [types in a collection](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/). Define types such as data type, format, and possible values. This enables you to design your API using a collection.

## Learn about a collection's elements and activity

Collaborators can view a summary of a collection's purpose, recent activity, and related elements on the collection's [**Overview** tab](/docs/collections/use-collections/collection-overview-tab/). It provides a snapshot of the collection's description, changelog, and associated environments, monitors, and mocks.

## About the collection format

Postman Collections are based on the open source *collection format*. The collection format is portable and defines a structure for organizing API requests and modeling API workflows. The format is machine and human readable, and it can be used to generate client and server SDKs, documentation, and mock servers.

To learn more, see the [Postman Collection schema documentation](https://schema.postman.com/).


# Create and manage request collections in Postman

A *collection* is one of the fundamental [elements](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/) in Postman. Use collections to save all your API requests, keep them organized, and find them when you need them. When you're ready, you can share your collections with other members of your team—or anyone in the world.

## Create new collections

Create a new Postman Collection to save requests you use often, or to group requests for a specific purpose, such as testing APIs or simulating workflows. You can create a collection from scratch or from one of Postman's predefined templates. To learn more, go to [Create collections of API requests in Postman](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/).

## Add API requests

You can save new API requests to a collection, or move existing requests into a collection. A collection can contain HTTP requests, or you can create a multi-protocol collection with other types of requests, such as GraphQL or gRPC. To learn more, go to [Add API requests to Postman Collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/).

## Keep your collections organized

You can arrange the API requests in a collection in any order you choose, or add folders to group requests together. If you make a change you don't like, or delete a collection by mistake, you can restore it back to an earlier state. To learn more, go to [Manage and organize Postman Collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/).

## Collaborate with others

You can share collections to invite others to collaborate with you, or watch a collection to get notified about changes. Tag collections to make them easier for others to find, and add comments to a collection to let others know what you're thinking. You can also apply status tags to a collection to show its lifecycle status. To learn more, go to [Share and collaborate on Postman Collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/).


# Create collections of API requests in Postman

Create a Postman Collection to save and share your favorite requests, to group requests you use for testing an API, or to document your API. You can create a new collection from scratch, or jump-start your collection with a template.

Once created, you can customize your collection by adding a name and description. You can also specify authorization details and add scripts and variables.

## Create a new collection

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To create a collection, you must be [signed in to your Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/).

<img alt="Create new collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/new-collection-v11-6a.jpg" />

## Create a collection from a template

Not sure how to get started with your collection? Instead of creating a collection from scratch, you can use a template with predefined content. Postman has templates designed for integration testing, API documentation, conditional workflows, data visualization, and more.

To create a collection from a template, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then select **+ > Collection template**.
2. Select a recommended template. You can also search for a template, or browse templates by role or use case.
3. Review the information about the template, and when ready click **Use template**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also apply a template to an existing, empty collection. In the collection's overview, select a template or click **More templates**. You can't apply a template to a collection that already contains items.
</Info>

## Configure a collection

To customize and configure your new collection, do any of the following:

* Click the collection name in the workbench to rename your collection. You can also select a collection in the sidebar and press the **Enter** or **Return** key to rename it.
* You can add a [description](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) for your collection in the **Overview** tab. The description also appears in the collection's documentation.
* Click **Authorization** to configure [authorization details](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/) for all requests in the collection.
* Select **Scripts > Pre-request** to add a [pre-request script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) for your collection. The script will run before each request in the collection is sent.
* Select **Scripts > Post-response** to add a [post-response script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) for your collection. The script will run after each request in the collection is sent.
* Click **Variables** to define [collection variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). Collection variables are reusable values you can use across all requests and documentation in a collection.

## About multi-protocol collections

You can add non-HTTP requests, such as GraphQL and gRPC requests, to collections. Because these requests have different features than HTTP requests, when they're added to a collection, the collection becomes a *multi-protocol collection*.

Multi-protocol collections can't contain HTTP requests. They can only contain requests with the following protocols:

* [GraphQL](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-overview/)
* [gRPC](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-client-overview/)
* [WebSocket](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/websocket-overview/)
* [Socket.IO](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/create-a-socketio-request/)
* [MQTT](/docs/sending-requests/mqtt-client/mqtt-client-overview/)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Multi-protocol collections don't support some HTTP collection features, such as creating mock servers and generating tests.
</Info>


# Manage and organize Postman Collections

You can save, organize, and find all of your API requests in Postman Collections. Use folders to group requests by type or use case, and reorder requests to replicate workflows.

## View a deleted collection

You can view HTTP collections that you and other team members deleted. Deleted collections are retained for a limited period of time depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

To view collections you and your team members deleted, click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Trash** in the Postman footer.

You can view collections that you and other team members deleted, including collections from workspaces you deleted. For each collection, you can view the collection's name, workspace it was deleted from, user who deleted it, and the date it was deleted. You can also view the date the collection will be permanently deleted. Take the following actions to search for and filter your team's deleted collections:

* Click the **Search collections** box and search for a collection by name.
* Click the **Workspaces** dropdown list, then select the workspace a collection was deleted from.
* Click the **Deleted by** dropdown list, then select a user who deleted the collection.
* Click a collection to view more information, such as the number of times it was forked.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If a collection you expected to be in the trash isn't there, it may have been moved to another workspace rather than deleted. Learn more about [moving elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces).
</Info>

## Use the changelog

To review the changelog for a collection in Postman, open the collection and click <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Changelog**.

The changelog provides a chronological list of the collection's activities. You can view the time and date at which changes occurred, the users who made changes, and the affected parts of the collection.

<img alt="Collection changelog" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/changelog-view-v10.14.jpg" width="400px" />

Postman groups changes made within several minutes of each other into sessions for readability. You can select a session in the changelog to review its changes.

Click **View diff** to view the collection's diff. If a diff is too large to view in the changelog, you can hover over the diff and click **View more** to open it in a new tab.

<img alt="Collection changelog view changes" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/changelog-view-diff-v10.14.0.jpg" width="400px" />

### Hide diffs in the changelog

If you have an [Editor role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) for a collection, you can hide specific actions in its [changelog](#use-the-changelog). When you hide a changelog entry's diff, users who don't have Editor permissions on the collection can't view that diff in the changelog. This enables you to protect sensitive data in a public collection.

Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **View more actions** for the changelog entry, then click **Hide diff for this change**.

Once you restore the visibility of a diff, all users can view it in the changelog.

## Recover or permanently delete a collection

You can recover and permanently delete HTTP collections you and other team members deleted where you had Admin or Editor permissions. The actions you can take on the deleted collection depend on the roles you were assigned when the collection was deleted. Deleted collections are retained for a limited period of time depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

You can also recover and permanently delete collections that were in workspaces you deleted. If a team member deletes a workspace, you won't be able to view or take any actions on the deleted collections, even if you had Admin or Editor permissions.

Users on paid plans regularly receive emails that notify you when collections will permanently delete from your team. Once a collection is permanently deleted, it can't be recovered. The email will include collections you created or deleted.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't recover deleted collections that are larger than 30 MB.
</Info>

To recover a deleted collection, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Trash** in the Postman footer.

# Share and collaborate on Postman Collections

You can collaborate on Postman Collections with your team and other Postman users. Share collections with others, watch collections to get notified when changes are made, and comment on collections to let others know your thoughts. You can also use collection tags to help organize and find collections.

Forking offers another way to collaborate on collections. You can fork a collection into your own workspace, make changes, and then create a pull request to merge your changes back to the original collection.

## Share a collection

To share a collection with other Postman users, use any of the following methods:

* Select a collection in the sidebar, then click **Share** in the workbench. You can enter the users you want to share the collection with, or copy a link you can share with others. Learn more about [sharing elements in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-postman-collections-and-other-elements).

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    To share a link with users who aren't in your Postman team, turn on **Allow guests to view collection via link**. Learn more about [sharing collections with Guests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests).

## Tag a collection

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Tagging collections is available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

You can use shared tags to organize and search for collections. Once you add tags to a collection, you can select a tag to search for collections and other elements with the same tag.

You can apply shared tags to workspaces, collections, and APIs. Tags can be two to 64 alphanumeric characters in length and must start with an alphabetical character. Tags can contain dashes but no other special characters or spaces. You can add up to five tags.

To learn more about searching using tags in Postman, go to [Search Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#search-postman). You can search by tags in your Private API Network. Use tags to search for [elements on your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/use-private-network/#search-filter-and-sort). You can also use tags to search for [elements to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/#add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) and [elements to request to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#request-to-add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) to your Private API Network.

To add tags to a collection, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection.

2. Click the **Select status or other tags** section to edit it.

   <img alt="Add tags to a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/add-tags-collection-v11-68.png" />

3. Click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to a tag.
4. Click outside the **Select status or other tags** section to save your changes.

## Set a collection's status

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Status tags are available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)** You can apply status tags to internal collections.
</Info>

You can indicate a collection's lifecycle status with *status* tags. Status tags are special tags that let developers know that a collection is in development, in review, ready to use, or deprecated. Use Postman's pre-defined status tags or create your own. You can search status tags the same way you [search other tags](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#search-postman).

Status tags can be two to 64 alphanumeric characters in length, must start with an alphabetical character, and must include an emoji. Status tags can contain dashes but no other special characters or spaces. You can apply one status tag at a time to a collection.

To apply a status tag to a collection, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection.
2. Click the **Select status or other tags** section to edit it.
3. Hover over **Status** and select a status tag from the dropdown list.

To create a custom status tag, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection.
2. Click the **Select status or other tags** section to edit it.
3. Hover over **Status** and select **+ Create custom status**.

4. Click outside the **Select status or other tags** section to save your changes.

## Fork a collection

If you don't have edit access to a collection, you can make changes by forking the collection into your own workspace. You can then create a pull request to submit your changes to the original collection.

To fork a collection, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection.
2. Click <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-fork-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Fork** in the workbench.

# View collection activity and elements with the Overview tab

A collection's **Overview** tab provides a summary of the collection's purpose, recent activity, and related elements. Collaborators can check this tab to view the collection's description, recent changes, pinned environments, monitors, mocks, and more.

<img alt="Collection Overview tab" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/collection-overview-v11.68.png" />

On the **Overview** tab you can view the following collection information:

* **Description** - Explains what the collection is and how it can be used. To learn more, see [Add descriptions to a collection](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/#add-descriptions-to-a-collection).

* **View complete documentation** - Click to view all of the collection's [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/).

* **Number of requests, views, forks, and watchers** - Shows how many requests the collection contains, how many views, how many collection [forks](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) exist, and how many Postman users are watching the collection.

# Test your API functionality

You can run Postman Collections to test and interact with your APIs. In Postman, a collection can be a group of saved [requests](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/), a [workflow](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/), or a [test suite](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/). When you run a collection, Postman sends some or all of the requests in the collection in the order you choose.

In Postman, you can run your collections in the following ways:

* You can [run collections manually](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) with the *Collection Runner*. Running collections manually is useful when you're sending a small number of requests and don't need to repeat them on a regular schedule.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    You can also use the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) to manually run collections in the same application you use to develop your APIs.
  </Info>

* You can schedule collections to run automatically. [Scheduled collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) are useful for automating your API testing. [Monitors](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors/) are useful for checking your API's performance, availability, and reliability.

* You can automate collection runs in your CI/CD pipeline with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

* You can use [webhooks](/docs/collections/running-collections/collection-webhooks/) to trigger collection runs at certain times or when a specific event happens in your application.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also run collections to simulate real-world traffic and [test the performance of your API](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/) under load.
</Info>


# Test your API using the Collection Runner

Send some or all of the API requests in a Postman Collection in the order you choose with the *Collection Runner*. The Collection Runner logs the [test results](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) for each request, and it can use [scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) to pass data between requests and change the request workflow.

Use collection runs to automate your functional API testing. You can run collections manually, or schedule collection runs in the Postman cloud with the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) or [monitors](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors/). You can also integrate collection runs with your CI/CD pipeline using [the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/), Postman's command line tool.

## Configure a collection run

You can manually run the requests in a [collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/) or a [folder](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/#add-folders-to-a-collection).

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection or folder you want to run.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also run a collection or folder that's linked to an API. Learn more about [adding a collection to an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#add-a-collection-to-your-api).
   </Info>

2. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

   <img alt="Click Run from the collection overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/collection-runner-button-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Runner** from the Postman footer. Drag a collection from the sidebar into the Collection Runner. Or click **start with a template** to create a new collection with example tests you can run.
   </Info>

3. On the **Functional** tab, click **Run manually**.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also [schedule runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) and [automate runs with the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-collection/).
   </Info>

4. If you want your collection to run with an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), select it using the environment selector at the upper right of Postman. You can also click **Environments** in the sidebar, then select the environment you want to use.

5. Choose any configuration options:

   * **Iterations** - The number of times to run the collection. You can also run collections multiple times with different data sets to [build workflows](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/).
   * **Delay** - An interval delay before each request, in milliseconds.
   * **Test data file** - Upload or select an existing [data file](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) for the collection run. You can select a data file that was previously uploaded, or you can select a local data file.
   * **Advanced settings**
     * **Persist responses for a session** - By default, response headers and bodies are persisted so you can [review them after running the collection](#debug-run-results). Request and response bodies are persisted only if they're less than 300 KB in size.

       Your browser or computer may not have enough memory available to persist responses for large collection runs. It's recommended that you use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to store a larger amount of request and response data using your computer's disk space. Learn how to [troubleshoot a large collection run](#troubleshoot-large-collection-runs).

       <Info class="iconless-callout">
         Request and response details are persisted locally during your current Postman session and aren't saved permanently. Signing out of Postman, signing into another device with the same account, or refreshing your browser will end your session and remove the logged data.

         Response and request details are available for the user who started the collection run. Other team members can't view details for collection runs that you start.
       </Info>

     * **Turn off logs during run** - Turn off logging to the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-in-the-console) during the collection run. Request and response details such as method, URL, headers, and body won't be logged to the Postman Console. Also, all [log statements](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/#using-log-statements) in scripts will be ignored. Selecting this option may improve performance of the Postman app during large collection runs. You can still view request and response details from the [run results](#debug-run-results).

     * **Stop run if an error occurs** - By default, the collection run stops if an exception is encountered within a script or if there's a problem sending a request. Clear this checkbox if you want the collection run to continue after an error occurs.

     * **Keep variable values** - Persist the variables used in the run, so that any variables updated by the run will remain changed after it completes. If you don't persist variables, changes aren't saved after the run completes.

## Troubleshoot large collection runs

A collection run may be large if it has many requests, its requests and responses are large in size, or the number of its iterations is high. Your browser or computer may run out of memory during large collection runs, reducing the performance of your collection runs.

You may be able to use the Postman web app for large collection runs with some configuration changes. For improved performance, it's recommended that you use the Postman desktop app for large collection runs. The Postman desktop app uses your computer's disk space, making more memory available during larger collection runs.

If you're using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) with large collection runs, you can take the following actions to make more memory available in your browser and improve the performance of your collection runs:

* Deselect the **Persist responses for a session** checkbox when [configuring the collection run](#configure-a-collection-run).
* Select the **Turn off logs during run** checkbox when [configuring the collection run](#configure-a-collection-run).

If you're using the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) with large collection runs, you can take the following actions to make more memory available in your computer and improve the performance of your collection runs:

* Deselect the **Persist responses for a session** checkbox when [configuring the collection run](#configure-a-collection-run).
* Clear your local data and restart Postman. Open the Postman desktop app, click **Help** in your computer's menu bar, then click **Clear Cache and Reload**.
* Free up disk space on your computer.
* Select the **Turn off logs during run** checkbox when [configuring the collection run](#configure-a-collection-run).
* If the collection run has many requests, break up the requests into multiple smaller collections and run them separately.
* Reduce the number of iterations for the collection run when [configuring the collection run](#configure-a-collection-run).

When using the Postman desktop app during a large collection run, you may be unable to persist responses if your computer runs out of memory during the collection run. Postman may delete responses persisted earlier to create space for new persisted responses. You'll be notified from the run results if memory was exhausted during the collection run. You can click **Retry Run** in the notification to run the collection again using the same settings.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more help troubleshooting a large collection run, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) with log files attached to your request. Learn how to [locate Postman logs](/docs/introduction/troubleshooting-inapp/#locating-postman-logs).
</Info>

## Export collection runs

You can share collection run results with others by exporting the results from the Collection Runner.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The option to export a collection run report is available in the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) but not in the Postman web app.
</Info>

To export a collection run, do the following:

1. Open the collection run in the **Collection Runner**. You can also access the collection run using **History** in the sidebar if you don't have the run open.

3. Choose a location to save your downloaded collection run, then click **Save**.

You can import the results of a collection run that was exported to a file. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Runner** from the Postman footer and drag the exported file into the Collection Runner.

## View run history

Each collection has a **Runs** tab you can use to view past functional runs, scheduled runs, and performance runs. You can also view details such as test counts and average response times.

![Past runs tab](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/collection-run-tab-v11-57.jpg)

### View past runs

The **Functional** tab has controls to select how many recent collection runs to view. You can filter the displayed runs by user, by run status, and by source (Collection Runner or Postman CLI).

The following are displayed for each collection run:

* A checkbox for each run and an option to select all runs. Select one or more collection runs and click **Delete** to remove them.
* The start time of the collection run.
* The run source, duration, all tests, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests, and the average response time. Click any of these items to sort the table by that item. Click again to change the sort order.
* Total number of comments your teammates shared about the collection run. Click <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-comments-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **(number of comments)** to go to the run results and open the comments in the sidebar.

* <img alt="Share icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-share-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Share** - Click to share the results with another team member. This provides a link you can give to other team members to view the details of this run. You can also click <img alt="Invite icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-invite-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Invite people** to [invite teammates to your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces). If you're in an internal workspace only you can access, you can click **Invite people** to invite teammates to your workspace and then share the results.

### View scheduled runs

The **Scheduled** tab shows all the scheduled runs for the current collection. The following are displayed for each scheduled run:

* The upcoming run's scheduled time
* The name of the scheduled run
* The environment associated with the scheduled run (if any)

Hover over an item to show the following controls:

* **View** - Click to open a page detailing the scheduled collection run's latest results.
* <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** - Click to [pause, resume, edit, or delete](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/#pause-or-resume-a-scheduled-run) the schedule.

### View performance runs

The **Performance** tab shows past [performance runs](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/) for the collection. You can view metrics for each run, including the number of virtual users (VUs), duration, total number of requests, requests per second, average response time, and error rate.

Click a run to view a graph and full details for the performance run. Learn more about [viewing performance metrics](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/).

## Automate collection runs

In addition to running collections manually, you can [schedule collections](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) to run automatically at specified times in the Postman cloud. You can also use collection runs with other Postman utilities to build automation into your API projects:

* Use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) command-line interface to run collections and build them into your development pipeline, responding to test outcomes to support your API performance.
* You can also use [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) to run collections from the command line.
* Adding a [monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to your collection lets you schedule collection runs and stay informed of any issues.
* You can also set up a [collection webhook](/docs/collections/running-collections/collection-webhooks/) to trigger a collection run at a specific time with your own custom payload.

## Next steps

Build on the Collection Runner fundamentals you've learned with the following topics:

* Use scripts to build workflows with conditional sequences for running the requests in your collections. To learn more, go to [Customize request order in a collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/).

* Run your collections on a schedule to automatically test the functionality of your APIs. To learn more, go to [Automate collection runs on a schedule](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/).

* Use the Collection Runner to test the performance of your API with the same requests, collections, and environments you use for functional API tests. To learn more, go to [Simulate user traffic to test your API performance](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/).


# Automate collection runs on a schedule

Instead of running collections manually, Postman can run collections for you on a schedule. Use the Collection Runner to select a collection and configure a schedule. For example, you can run a collection that tests the functionality of your API every day at a specific time.

When you schedule a collection run with the Collection Runner, the scheduled run is added to the **Runs > Scheduled** tab in the collection. From here you can view, pause, edit, and delete scheduled collection runs.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also schedule collection runs with [monitors](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors/). Schedule runs with monitors when you want to set up alerts, like triggering on-call alerts for failures. For all other use cases, such as automating API tests, schedule runs with the Collection Runner.
</Info>

## About scheduled collection runs

When working with scheduled collection runs, keep in mind the following:

* Scheduled collections run in the Postman Cloud, not locally.
* Scheduled runs don't support requests that use files in your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory) to send [body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/). Instead, [upload your test data files](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/) to make them available for scheduled runs in the cloud.
* Schedules share permissions with their collections. For example, if you have permission to edit a collection, you can edit that collection's schedules.
* You can schedule collection runs in personal, private, and team [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
* If you import or export a collection, its schedules don't import or export with it. However, if you delete a collection, its schedules are also deleted.
* Scheduled collection runs share the same [usage limits as monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).
* Scheduled runs don't support OAuth 2.0 authentication. To learn how to use an OAuth 2.0 token with scheduled runs, see [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/#oauth-20-overview).

   * Click <img alt="Right icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-right.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Advanced settings** for more configuration options:
     * **Retry if run fails** - Select this checkbox to retry a request after it fails, and enter the number of times to retry the request. Each retry counts toward your [monitoring usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#monitoring-usage).
     * **Set request timeout** - Select this checkbox to skip a request after it times out, and enter the timeout period in milliseconds. A scheduled run can't exceed a total duration of 15 minutes.
     * **Set delay before requests** - Select this checkbox to wait before sending requests, and enter the interval delay in milliseconds.
     * **Follow redirects** - Clear this checkbox to prevent requests that return a 3xx series response from automatically redirecting.
     * **Enable SSL validation** - Clear this checkbox to prevent Postman from checking the validity of SSL certificates when making requests.

5. By default, your requests run in the sequence they're listed in the collection. If you need to change the run order, click and drag a request to its new location in the order. You can also remove an individual request from the run by clearing the checkbox next to its name. For more information, see [Change run order](#change-run-order).

6. Click **Schedule Run**.

<Note>
  Requests sent by scheduled collection runs are deducted from your maximum number of monitoring API calls. For more information about checking your monitor usage, see [Manage monitor usage in Postman](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).

# View scheduled collection runs in Postman

Postman can run your collections on a schedule at specific times each day or week. For example, you may want to run a collection that tests your API every day. Use the Collection Runner to [schedule collections to run automatically](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) at specified dates and times.

To view scheduled collection runs in Postman, click a collection in the sidebar and select the **Runs > Scheduled** tab. To view the results of a scheduled collection run, hover over the run and click **View**.

  Scheduled collection runs in workspaces are visible to all members of the workspace.
</Info>

## Scheduled collection run summary

Use the graph to understand the health of your APIs over time. Each bar in the graph represents a collection run.

The upper section shows the average response time for each scheduled collection run. The lower section shows the number of failed tests for each run across all regions. To view the exact values for failed percentage and response time, hover over a run.

### Filter by type

Filter by run type to compare how response times changed between all runs, manual runs, and scheduled runs. Click the **Type** dropdown list, then select the type of run to view.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Manual runs are initiated in Postman. Scheduled runs are initiated by the schedule you set when creating or editing your scheduled run. Webhook runs are initiated by integrations you've created.
</Info>

### Filter by run result

Each scheduled run is labeled based on its result:

* **Successful** - The scheduled collection run finished with no issues and passed all tests.
* **Failure** - The scheduled collection run finished; however, one or more tests failed.
* **Error** - The scheduled collection run was unable to complete due to an error. An error can occur if there is a syntax error in the test code, a network error, or for various other reasons. If you get an error, the [Console log](#console-log) can help you identify what caused it.

- **Abort** - The scheduled collection run timed out because it didn't complete within the allotted 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans).

Filter by run result to compare how runs with the same result differ. Select the **Run result** dropdown list, then select one or more types of run results to view.

To learn more about the test results for a scheduled run, you can view the following:

* Click the **All Tests** tab to view all requests in the scheduled run with tests that passed, failed, had errors, or were skipped, including requests without any tests. Click the **Passed**, **Failed**, or **Skipped** tab to only view requests with tests in that category. The number of tests in that category appears next to each tab.
* Next to each request you can view the response code, time, and size.
* Next to each request you can view the number of tests that passed (green background), failed (red background), or skipped (gray background). Hover over one of these numbers to view a detailed breakdown of the tests in the request.
* Click a request to view which tests passed, failed, or skipped.
* Click the name of a request to open the request in a new tab.
* If your requests are in a folder, click the name of the folder to open it in a new tab.

## Errors

* Click the **Errors** tab to filter results by requests that encountered errors. Note that *errors* indicate runtime issues like timeout or TLS handshake errors. *Failed* requests occur when one or more user-specified checks (like post-request scripts) don't match expectations.
* The requests in your scheduled run that have errors appear in the run results page with an error badge and the error message. Badges identify errors as related to **NETWORK**, **REQUEST**, or **SCRIPT** issues.

# Automate collection runs using Postman Monitors

You can automate [collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) using [Postman monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/). Create a new monitor, select a collection, and configure a schedule. Postman will run the collection at the scheduled times in the Postman Cloud. You'll get an alert if there are any errors or failures.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also schedule collection runs using the Collection Runner. Schedule runs with monitors when you want to set up alerts, like triggering on-call alerts for failures. For all other use cases, such as automating API tests, [schedule runs with the Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/).
</Info>

To schedule collection runs with a monitor, do the following:

1. Click **Monitors** in the sidebar, then click **+ Create new monitor**.

   <img alt="Create a new monitor" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/monitor-create-new-v11-10.jpg" width="280px" />

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If **Monitors** isn't available in the sidebar, you can add it by clicking <img alt="More apps icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-moreApps-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Configure workspace sidebar**.
   </Info>

2. Enter a **Monitor name** and select the **Collection** you want to run.

3. Under **Run**, select **Schedule** and then specify when and how often you want the collection to run.

4. Choose any other configuration options for your monitor. For more help, go to [Set up a monitor in Postman](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).

5. Click **Create Monitor**.

Postman runs the collection on the schedule you configured in the monitor. You'll get an alert if errors or failures occur. To view a summary of the monitor results, click **Monitors** in the sidebar and select a monitor. Learn more about [viewing monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your Postman plan gives you a limited number of requests that can be run by your Postman Monitors each month. Requests run by your scheduled collection runs count toward this same limit. Learn more about [resource usage in Postman](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#monitoring-usage).
</Info>


# Trigger collection runs using webhooks

A webhook provides a way to automatically send data from one application to another. Using a webhook, you can trigger a [collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) at a specific time or when an event occurs. When the webhook is triggered, Postman runs the collection using a [monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/).

You can also send a custom payload to the webhook, and Postman can access the data when the collection runs. Sending a custom payload means the collection can run without an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), and instead rely on the data sent to the webhook.

## Create a webhook

With a collection webhook, data is sent to the webhook URL using a POST request when certain events are triggered. You must configure the application that sends the data and the trigger events. Webhooks for a collection must be created using the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/). Learn how to use the Postman API to [create a webhook](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/z961fuf/create-a-webhook).

To access the data sent to the webhook, use the [`pm.globals.get` method](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-variables/#pmglobals) with the `previousRequest` global variable. Using [scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/), you can parse that data and use it during the collection run in any way possible.

## Access the request body in scripts

When you trigger the webhook, the `previousRequest` global [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) is temporarily created, and its value is the request body of the webhook as a JSON string. Use the `pm.globals.get('previousRequest')` method to get the request body of the webhook, then parse it using `JSON.parse()`. The data sent to the webhook is available in the `data` parameter inside the parsed object, as shown in the following example code:

```js
var previousRequest = JSON.parse(pm.globals.get('previousRequest'));

var webhookRequestData = previousRequest.data;

// webhookRequestData contains the data sent to your webhook.
console.log(JSON.stringify(webhookRequestData));
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The request body sent to the webhook must use JSON format.
</Info>

When you [create a webhook](#create-a-webhook) using the Postman API, a monitor is created for the webhook. You must trigger the webhook in a separate request to run the example code using the monitor. Then you can [view the monitor run details](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/#console-log) that were logged to Console. To learn more about monitor results, go to [View monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/).

## Send output to another API

Use the data that's sent to the collection webhook to define logic and trigger another API. For example, you might set up a webhook for your GitHub repository. Based on the updates happening in your repository, you can use the webhook to run custom build pipelines or perform CI tests.


# Customize request order in a collection run

By default, when you [run a collection](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), Postman runs all requests in the order they appear in your collection. Requests in folders run first, followed by requests in the root of the collection. To dynamically change the order of requests during a collection run, use the `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function in a post-response [script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).

Instead of manually changing the order of requests each time you start a collection run, you can automate this behavior. Add `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` to your post-response scripts to specify which request Postman runs next, following the current request. With this function, you can build workflows that chain requests, running them one after the other in a custom order.

## Set the next request

To specify the request to run next, add the following code on the **Scripts > Post-response** tab of a request. Replace `request_name` with the name or ID of the request you want to run next, in quotes.

```js
pm.execution.setNextRequest("request_name");
```

Postman runs the specified request after completing the current request.

## Loop over a request

If you pass the name or ID of the current request to the `setNextRequest` function, Postman will run the current request again after it's completed.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:** To prevent the request from looping indefinitely, add extra logic to the `setNextRequest` function. For example, you can set the request to exit the loop after a certain number of iterations or when another condition is met. Otherwise, to end the loop, you can force close the Collection Runner. For example, use the following post-response script in a request in a collection. When the collection is run, it runs the request three times, then exits.
</Info>

```js
var i = !pm.variables.get("i") ? 1 : pm.variables.get("i");

if (i < 3) {
    console.log("this is run "+i+" for request " + pm.execution.location.current);
    pm.execution.setNextRequest(pm.execution.location.current)
    i++;
    pm.variables.set("i", i);
} else {
    pm.execution.setNextRequest(null);
}
```

## Stop a workflow

To stop a workflow, you can enter "null" as the `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function's argument in your post-response script. The collection run stops after the current request runs. If your collection run is configured to run more than one iteration, Postman stops each iteration after the current request runs.

```js
pm.execution.setNextRequest(null);
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also skip a request using the `pm.execution.skipRequest()` method in your post-response script. Learn more about [skipping requests from pre-request scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-execution/#pmexecutionskipRequest).
</Info>

## Tips for building request workflows

Keep the following tips in mind when using the `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function.

### Use setNextRequest() when you run an entire collection

Use the `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function when running a collection with the Collection Runner, the Postman CLI, or Newman. It has no effect when you run a request in Postman using **Send**.

### Use setNextRequest() in pre-request or post-response scripts

You can use `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` in the pre-request script or the post-response script of a request. If more than one value is assigned, the last value that's set takes precedence.

### Specify the next request using the request ID

A request's name may change, but changing its name doesn't change its ID. For this reason, it's best to use the request ID when you specify the next request. When specifying the ID, it must be in quotes. For example: `pm.execution.setNextRequest("1ab12345-4ab4-4124-c000-12341abc1234");`

To get the request ID of the currently running request, use `pm.info.requestId`. For example, run `console.log(pm.info.requestId)` to see the current request's ID. To learn more, see [Script Workflows](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-info/).

You can also get the request ID in Postman. Open the request and, from the right sidebar, click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info**. The request ID is prepended with your user ID (the first block of characters).

### setNextRequest() always runs last

The `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function always runs at the completion of the current request, regardless of its location in the script. If you put code in the pre-request script or post-response script after this function, the code blocks will still run before `pm.execution.setNextRequest()`.

### setNextRequest() scope is limited to the collection

The scope of `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` is the source of your collection run.

* If you run an entire collection, you can set any request in the collection as the next request, even requests inside folders.
* If you run a folder, the scope of `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` is limited to that folder. In this case, you can set any request in the same folder as the next request, but not requests located in other folders or at the root of the collection.

Learn more about [running collections or folders](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

## Next steps

After learning about how to build request workflows, you can write some scripts.

* To learn more about writing pre-request and post-response scripts, visit [Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).


# Run collections using imported data

When you configure a [manual](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) or [scheduled](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) collection run, you can choose to use custom data for each iteration. Select a valid CSV or JSON file with data you want to use. When you run the collection, Postman uses data from the file to populate [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) in the collection's requests.

You can add a [local data file](#use-a-local-data-file) to a collection run when you configure it. You can also [upload a data file](#use-an-uploaded-data-file) to your workspace, and add the file to a manual collection run when you configure it. Uploaded data files are synced to the Postman cloud and can be reused with later manual collection runs in your workspace. Scheduled runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support uploaded data files.

Make sure your data file follows the [data file formatting guidelines](#format-a-data-file). Otherwise, you may experience errors when Postman tries to read your data file. If you experience any issues, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

## Use a local data file

You can add a local data file to a [manual collection run](#use-a-local-data-file-with-a-manual-run) or [scheduled collection run](#use-a-local-data-file-with-a-scheduled-run). The local data file is only available in the collection run, and you can't reuse the data file with a later run.

Once a local data file is added to a manual collection run, you can choose to upload the file to your workspace. This enables you and your team members with access to the workspace to reuse the file in later manual collection runs.

### Use a local data file with a manual run

To use a local data file with a manual collection run, do the following:

1. Under **Test data file**, click **Select File**.

2. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Select from computer** to choose a new data file from your computer.

3. Select a local file.

4. Preview the data file. You can make the following changes before adding the local data file:

   * Click the data type dropdown list for each column to ensure the desired data type is used.
   * Click the file type dropdown list in the top right to ensure the desired file type is used.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">

### Use a local data file with a scheduled run

To use a local data file with a scheduled collection run, do the following:

1. Under **Data file**, click **Select file**.
2. Select a local file.
3. Finish configuring the scheduled collection run.

Once the data file is added to the scheduled collection run, click the file type dropdown list to change the type if needed. Then you can click **Preview** to view the file's data before you run the collection.

Click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to a data file to remove it from the scheduled collection run.

## Use an uploaded data file

You can upload a data file to a manual collection run in your workspace, syncing the file with the Postman cloud. You must have Editor permissions to upload a data file to a workspace. You and your team members who can access the workspace can reuse the uploaded data file with later manual collection runs in the workspace. Note that scheduled runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman don't support uploaded data files.

Data files are only available in the workspace they were uploaded to. To use the same data file in another workspace, you must upload the data file to the other workspace as well.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Data files must be smaller than 5 MB to upload to your workspace.

</Info>

## Format a data file

Before you upload or use a CSV or JSON file with a collection run, ensure the file follows the formatting guidelines. Learn how to [format a CSV file](#csv-file-format) and [format a JSON file](#json-file-format).

For example, you may have a collection with requests that accept both a serial number and a contact number as query parameters. The respective values must be [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) like `{{serial}}` and `{{contact_no}}` in your request. Then you can format your file to use the same variable names according to the file's respective guidelines. Note that variable names are case sensitive, so the name and case must match between Postman and your data file.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Variables in data files resolve as [local variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes). You can [write a test script](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) that checks each value, such as confirming the values are valid. Learn more about how to [use iteration data in scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/).
</Info>

### CSV file format

For a CSV file, the first row must have the variable names you want inside the requests. Then every row after will be used as a data row. Each line ending must be in Unix format, and each row must have the same number of columns.

Be aware of the following when formatting a CSV file:

* If the numbers in your data file are longer than 15 digits, you'll need to format them as text in your spreadsheet program, so they're not truncated when exporting to CSV format.
* If your CSV file has numbers longer than 16 digits, numbers with preceding zeroes (for example, `000000345`), or phone numbers (for example, `+12125556709`), you'll need to preview the file and specify the data type for the column in Postman.

```csv
City,Ramen
Vancouver,100
San Francisco,84
Singapore,79
Austin,66
Los Angeles,65
```

### JSON file format

For a JSON file, the data must be formatted as an array of key-value pairs. Each key is the variable name, and each value is the data that'll be used in the request.

```json
[
  {
    "City": "Vancouver",
    "Ramen": 100
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "Ramen": 84
  },
  {
    "City": "Singapore",
    "Ramen": 79
  },
  {
    "City": "Austin",
    "Ramen": 66
  },
  {
    "City": "Los Angeles",
    "Ramen": 65
  }
]
```


# Simulate user traffic to test your API performance

Test the performance of your APIs with the Postman desktop app. Simulate user traffic by automatically sending requests in the app. You can observe how your API behaves under load and identify potential issues or bottlenecks that affect performance.

## Test API performance with virtual users

To [configure a performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/), create a collection with the requests you want to send to your API. Postman uses these requests to simulate the activity of your API's users. Each *virtual user* runs the requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. All of the virtual users operate in parallel to simulate real-world load on your API.

## View real-time performance metrics

Performance tests run in the Postman desktop app on your computer and not in the cloud. When you start the test, the *Collection Runner* displays performance metrics in real time.

You can [view performance test metrics](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/) such as the average response time, error rate, and throughput for all requests or individual requests. You can also [compare two performance runs](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/#compare-two-performance-runs) to understand how your API's performance has changed over time.

## Find and debug performance issues

After the performance test finishes running, you can [view details about errors](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-errors/) and [view details about failed test assertions](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-failures/) that occurred during the test. You can view the most common error, failed test assertions, and trends over time to help you identify the source of any performance issues.

## Use unique data for each virtual user

By default, each virtual user sends requests with the same data during a performance test. You can also [upload a data file](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-data-files/) with custom values for each virtual user. This enables you to vary the behavior of the virtual users to better simulate real-world traffic.


# Configure and run performance tests in Postman

Use the *Collection Runner* to test the performance of your API with the same requests and collections you use for [functional API tests](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/). When you run a performance test, Postman uses the requests in the selected collection to simulate the activity of your API users.

In the Collection Runner, you can set the duration of the test and the number of *virtual users*. Each virtual user runs the requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. All of the virtual users operate in parallel to simulate real-world load on your API. You can choose whether the number of virtual users is fixed for the duration of the test or ramps up and down during the test.

## Configure a performance test

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to configure and run performance tests.** You can't use the Postman web app for performance testing. During a performance test, all requests are sent from the host computer where you are running the Postman desktop app.
</Info>

Before you configure a performance test, [create a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/) or [add a folder](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/#add-folders-to-a-collection) with the requests you want to use to simulate user activity. Each virtual user runs the selected requests in the specified order and repeats the sequence throughout the test. Multiple virtual users all operate in parallel to simulate real-world usage of your API.

To configure a performance test in the Postman desktop app, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection or folder you want to use for performance testing.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also use a collection or folder that's linked to an API to run a performance test. Learn more about [adding a collection to an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#add-a-collection-to-your-api).
   </Info>

2. On the **Overview** tab, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

   <img alt="Click Run from the collection overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/collection-runner-button-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Runner** from the Postman footer and drag a collection from **Collections** or **History** in the sidebar.
   </Info>

3. Select the **Performance** tab.

4. (Optional) Change the order in which the requests are run by dragging a request to a new location. To skip a request, clear the checkbox next to its name.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Performance tests run all of the requests selected in the Collection Runner in order, and each virtual user runs through the sequence of requests. This helps you test the performance of your API workflows. To test API calls in isolation, you can run performance tests on individual requests instead.
   </Info>

5. Select a **Load profile**.

   * **Fixed** - The maximum number of virtual users is used throughout the test.
   * **Ramp up** - Enter an **Initial load** and drag the handles to adjust the length of the ramp up period. During the ramp up period, the number of virtual users increases from the initial load to the maximum.
   * **Spike** - Enter a **Base load** and drag the handles to adjust the duration of the spike. During the spike, the number of virtual users increases from the base load to the maximum, then decreases back to the base load.
   * **Peak** - Enter a **Base load** and drag the handles to adjust the duration of the peak. During the peak, the number of virtual users increases from the base load to the maximum, holds steady, then decreases back to the base load.

6. Enter the number of **Virtual users**. While the test is running, each virtual user runs the selected requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. A higher number of virtual users puts increased load on your API.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     The maximum number of virtual users you can simulate depends on available system resources and the collection you're using. Learn more about [virtual users and system resources](#virtual-users-and-system-resources).
   </Info>

7. Enter the **Test duration** in minutes.

8. (Optional) Select a **Data file** with custom values to use for each virtual user. The file must be in CSV or JSON format. Learn more about [using a data file to simulate virtual users](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-data-files/).

9. (Optional) Click **Pass test if** to set a metric, condition, and value that determines whether the test passes or fails.

   * **Metric** - Select the performance metric:
     * **Avg. Response Time** - The response time of all requests averaged together, in milliseconds.
     * **p90** - The 90th percentile of response times, in milliseconds.
     * **p95** - The 95th percentile of response times, in milliseconds.
     * **p99** - The 99th percentile of response times, in milliseconds.
     * **Error %** - The percentage of requests that result in an error. Errors indicate runtime issues such as timeouts, connection or TLS failures, or uncaught exceptions in user scripts.
     * **Requests per second** - The number of requests sent each second during the performance test.
   * **Condition** - Select the condition that must be met for the test to pass.
   * **Value** - Enter a number that must be met for the test to pass.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Later performance runs with the same collection will have the metric, condition, and value autofilled from the previous run.
   </Info>

10. Choose how you'd like to run the performance test:

    * **In the app** - Trigger the performance test from the Postman app. When you're ready to begin the performance test, click **Run**.
    * **via the CLI** - Trigger the performance test from the Postman CLI. Learn more about [running a performance test using the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-performance-test/).

You can view real-time performance metrics while the test is running. Learn more about [viewing performance test metrics](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/).

After the test completes, you can view details for any [errors](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-errors/) or [test assertion failures](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-failures/) that occurred during the performance test.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of performance runs you can use each month. A message will display in the Collection Runner when you're approaching your usage limit. Learn more about [resource usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#performance-test-limit) in Postman.
</Info>

## Virtual users and system resources

The number of virtual users a performance test can simulate depends on available system resources and the collection used for the test. Using pre-request or post-response scripts will reduce the number of virtual users that can be simulated.

Attempting to simulate a higher number of virtual users than your system resources can support may cause inaccurate metrics and reduced throughput (requests per second). Try running a small test with 10 to 20 virtual users and observing system resource usage.

During a performance test, an in-app notification may warn you that your system resources are approaching their threshold. If your system resources exceed their threshold, you'll receive an in-app notification with this warning and the performance test stops running.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you have a problem with the performance testing feature, contact the [Postman support team](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us). Make sure to attach your [Postman logs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025298633-How-to-get-logs-from-the-Postman-Desktop-app) in your support request.

# View metrics for performance tests

During a [performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/), all requests are sent from your computer where you are running the Postman desktop app. You can view real-time metrics such as the average response time, error rate, test assertion failure rate, and throughput. You can also customize the performance test graph to focus on the requests or test metrics you're most interested in.

To understand how your API's performance has changed over time, you can choose two performance runs and compare metrics between them.

## View performance metrics

The **Summary** tab displays performance metrics in real time so you can observe how your API performs under load.

<img alt="Viewing performance metrics" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-graph-v11-76.png" />

You can view the following information about the performance test:

* Name of the collection being run and the active environment (if any). Click the name to open the collection or environment.
* The number of virtual users (VU). Each virtual user simulates the behavior of a real-world user by running the collection in a repeating loop, in parallel with other virtual users.
* Start time, duration, load profile (fixed, ramp up, spike, or peak), and [data file](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-data-files/) (if used).
* Whether the test passed or failed based on the metric, condition, and value.
* **Total requests sent** - The total number of requests sent across all virtual users.
* **Requests/second** - The number of requests sent each second during the performance test, a measure of throughput.
* **Avg. response time** - The response time in milliseconds of all requests averaged together.

## Compare two performance runs

APIs in service tend to change with the addition of new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Over time, these changes can have an impact on the API's performance.

To understand how the performance of your API has changed over time, you can compare performance runs. Select two runs to compare, and Postman displays the difference between the two runs for various performance metrics.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Make sure to [name your performance runs](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/#rename-a-performance-run) so it's easier to identify them when comparing runs.
</Info>

To compare two performance runs, do the following:

1. Open the [past performance run](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/#view-past-performance-runs) you want to compare other runs to. This will be the reference run.

2. Click <img alt="Compare icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-compare-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Compare runs** to enter comparison mode.

3. Choose a performance run to compare to the reference run. Select a recent run from the list, or search for a run by name.

4. Use the performance view to compare the selected runs:

   * The graph shows performance data for the reference run (solid lines) and the comparison run (dotted lines). Hover over a point on the graph to view more details.
   * The table below the graph shows how values in the comparison run differ from the reference run. A value in green (<span>▼</span>) indicates better performance and a value in red (<span>▲</span>) indicates worse performance. Values in gray indicate differences that aren't necessarily better or worse.
   * You can [customize the performance view](#customize-the-performance-view) to display the metrics or requests you're most interested in comparing.
   * At any time you, can choose another comparison run in the list.

5. When you're finished comparing performance runs, click **Exit Comparison**.

# View error details for performance tests

During a [performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/), requests are tracked as errors if they result in a runtime error that isn't handled by your pre-request or post-response scripts. For example, a DNS or TLS failure may stop the request before any headers are returned. You can view details about the top errors that occurred during the test and error trends over time. Use this information to gain insight into when errors are occurring and the possible causes.

## View top errors

You can view a breakdown of errors and top errors on the **Summary** tab while the performance test is running or after the test is complete. Errors indicate runtime issues such as timeouts, connection or TLS failures, or uncaught exceptions in user scripts.

Click the **Error %** above the graph to view a breakdown of errors and the top errors for the entire test.

![View top errors during performance test](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-top-errors-v11-76.png)

## View error trends

You can view error trends after the performance test is complete. The error trend shows the top five errors that occurred during the test and the frequency of those errors over time. This information can help you understand how error rates change in response to increased load on your API.

To view error trends, select the **Errors** tab. You can also click **Error %** on the **Summary** tab, then click **View Error Trends**.

<img alt="Viewing error trends" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-errors-graph-v11-76.png" />

You can view the following information about the error trends:

* **Error %** - The percentage of requests that result in an error.
* **Errored requests / Total requests sent** - The number of requests that result in an error per number of requests sent.
* **Top error** - The type of error that occurred most often during the test.
* **Top request with errors** - The request that had the highest number of error responses. Select the request name to open the request.

From the **Errors** tab, you can take the following actions:

* Hover over a point on the graph to view more details.
* Click a metric in the legend below the graph to show or hide that metric in the graph.
* To view the error trends for a specific request, select the request in the dropdown list. This information can help you understand which requests are associated with certain types of errors. To change the graph back to the default view, click **Reset**.

## Debug errors

You can view details about errors that occurred during the performance test to help in the debugging process. The **Errors** tab shows the error classes that were encountered during the test and the number of times each error occurred.

Expand an error class below the graph to view all requests that encountered the error. For each request, you can view a list of unique responses (as determined by headers and body). Postman displays the 10 most common responses and shows a count of how often that response occurred.

Click a request to view details about it, including the response, headers, and request body. Use the controls on the **Response** tab to format, copy, or search within the response. Click the name of a request to open it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Request and responses details for errors are persisted locally during your current Postman session and aren't saved permanently. If you close the current tab or quit Postman, request and response details will no longer be available. You will still be able to view error classes and error counts for requests.
</Info>


# View failed test assertions for performance tests

After a [performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/) completes, you can view the requests with failed test assertions that ran during the test. View details about the top failed requests and error trends that occurred over the duration of the test. Use this information to identify why your API isn't behaving as expected under load and possible causes.

## View failed test assertions

You can view the top requests that failed and also view requests with test assertion failures over the duration of the performance test.

On the **Summary** tab, you can click **Failure %** to view the top requests with failed test assertions that ran during the performance test. You can click **View Failure Trends** to view request failure trends during the performance test.

![View top test assertion failures during performance test](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-top-failures-v11-76.png)

You can also click the **Tests** tab to view request failure trends during the performance test. In the table, you can view the requests that ran during the run and each failed test assertion. Next to each test assertion, you can view the percentage of how often it failed compared to all of the requests that ran. Learn more about [debugging failed test assertions](#debug-failed-test-assertions).

![View test assertion failures during performance test](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-failures-trend-v11-76.png)

## Debug failed test assertions

The **Tests** tab shows requests that ran and how often each test assertion failed during the performance test. This is useful for understanding how test assertion failures change in response to increased load on your API.

You can take the following actions to debug your requests:

* Hover over a point on the graph to view the date and time the requests sent, number of failed requests, number of virtual users, and top failed requests.
* Click a point on the graph to view the requests and test assertions that failed during the timestamp. Click **Clear Filter** to return to the default view.
* Click the **Filter by requests** dropdown list to filter the results by a specific request. Click **Reset** to return to the default view.

![View test assertion failures details](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-failures-details-v11-76-8.png)


# Use a data file to simulate virtual users

When you [configure a performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/), you specify a number of *virtual users*. During the test, each virtual user (VU) runs the selected requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. You can customize the behavior of the virtual users by importing a CSV or JSON file

By default, each virtual user runs the same requests using the same values. If you import a data file, each virtual user can instead send requests using different values from the imported file. Using custom data for each virtual user can help you to simulate real-world traffic when testing the performance of your API.

## Run a performance test with a data file

Import a data file to populate variables with custom data when running a performance test. Each virtual user can use data from a different row in the data file, customizing their behavior and simulating real-world usage of your API.

Before you begin, [add variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) to the requests in your collection. Then [create a data file](#data-file-format) with the data to use for each variable.

To run a performance test with a data file, do the following:

1. [Configure a performance test](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-configuration/), specifying the number of **Virtual users**, the **Test duration**, and a **Load profile**.

2. Select a **Data file** with custom values to use for each virtual user. After you select your data file, a preview of the data file displays.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     The data file must be in CSV or JSON format. Learn more about [formatting a data file](#data-file-format).
   </Info>

   <img alt="Selecting a data type for imported data" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-select-data-type-v10-22.jpg" />

3. Postman automatically detects the **Data file type**. If needed, you can select a different file type (CSV or JSON).

4. Under **VU data mapping**, select how rows in the data file are mapped to virtual users:

   * **Ordered** - Each VU uses data from a specific row of the data file. The first VU uses the first data row, the second VU uses the second data row, and the pattern continues until each VU has been assigned a data row. Extra rows aren't used.
   * **Randomized** - Each VU uses data from a random row of the data file every time the VU runs the collection.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you select **Ordered** and your data file has fewer rows than the number of VUs, some VUs won't receive data during the performance test. You can add more rows to your data file and import the file again, or you can select **Randomized**.
   </Info>

5. (Optional) For CSV files, Postman automatically detects the data type for each column in the file. If needed, you can use the dropdown menu at the top of a column to select a different data type (**String**, **Boolean**, or **Number**).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If your CSV file has numbers longer than 16 digits, numbers with preceding zeroes (for example, `000000345`), or phone numbers (for example, `+12125556709`), select the **String** data type to prevent values from being truncated.
   </Info>

6. Click **Continue** when you're done configuring the data file.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can click <img alt="Manage icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-manage-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open preview** to reconfigure the data file. You can also select a new data file or click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** to remove the data file.
   </Info>

   <img alt="Configure a data file" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/performance-test-configure-data-file-v11-35.jpg" />

7. Click **Run** to run the performance test using the data file. Each VU uses the assigned data from the data file to populate variables when running the requests in the collection.

## Data file format

Format the CSV file so that the first row has the variable names you want to use inside the requests. After that, every row will be used as a data row. The line endings of the CSV file must be in Unix format. Each row must have the same number of columns.

<img alt="CSV format" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/ramen-csv-screenshot.jpg" width="280px" />

For CSV files, note the following:

* If the numbers in your data file are longer than 15 digits, you'll need to format them as text in your spreadsheet program, so they're not truncated when exporting to CSV format.

* If your CSV file has numbers longer than 16 digits, numbers with preceding zeroes (for example, `000000345`), or phone numbers (for example, `+12125556709`), you'll need to configure the file in Postman and specify **String** for the column data type. Learn more about [running a performance test with a data file](#run-a-performance-test-with-a-data-file).

Format JSON files as an array of key-value pairs. Each key is the name of a variable, and the value is the data to use within the request.

<img alt="JSON format" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/ramen-json-screenshot.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Variable names are case sensitive, so make sure to use the same case for variables in Postman as in the CSV or JSON file. Variables in data files are resolved as [local variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes), so you can access them using `pm.variables.get("variable_key")`. Learn more about [using variables in scripts](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#using-variables-in-scripts).

## Decide which command-line companion to use

You can use the Postman CLI or Newman to run and test collections from the command line. One may be a better fit, depending on your use case or preferences.

For example, assume you already manage your own security for open-source software, and you want to run collections from a script. Also assume you want visibility into any software you build into your CI/CD pipeline. Newman would be a good fit for this use case because Newman's repository is public and Newman isn't signed or secured by Postman.

Here's another example. Assume you don't already support or secure any open-source software, and you want the software you use to be signed and secured by its developer. The Postman CLI would be a good fit for this use case because the Postman CLI is signed and secured by Postman.

## About the Postman CLI and Postman API usage

Some Postman CLI commands use the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) to fetch data from and send data to Postman's servers. These commands count toward your monthly [Postman API usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#postman-api-usage). The number of Postman API calls you can make each month depends on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

The following Postman CLI commands make calls to the Postman API and count toward your Postman API usage:

* `postman login` - Uses one call to authenticate a user with a Postman API key.
* `postman collection run` - Uses one call to fetch a collection by ID, one call to fetch an environment (if any), and one call to send data back to Postman.
* `postman monitor run` - Uses one call to fetch a monitor by ID, one call to start a monitor run, and multiple calls that poll Postman for the run's completion.
* `postman spec lint` - Uses one call to fetch the API governance rules and one call to send a report back to Postman.
* `postman api lint` - Uses one call to fetch the API governance and security rules and one call to send a report back to Postman.

# Install the Postman CLI

Install the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) by following the instructions for your operating system below.

<Note title="Note">
  The Postman CLI supports the same system requirements as the Postman desktop app. For a complete list of requirements, see [Install and update Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).
</Note>

## npm installation for Windows, macOS, and Linux

If you have Node.js and npm installed on your system, you can run the following command. This will download and install the Postman CLI binary, making the `postman` command available in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g postman-cli
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Alternatively, you can also install the Postman CLI binary with a script specific to [Windows](#windows-installation). You can also use [curl to install the Postman CLI binary](#macos-linux-and-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-installation) on systems running macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Linux support excludes Alpine Linux distributions due to libc compatibility requirements.
</Info>

## Windows installation

Run the following command to install the Postman CLI for Windows. This will download and run an install script. The script creates a `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs the `postman` binary there.

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/win64.ps1'))"
```

## macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installation

Run the following command to install the Postman CLI on systems running macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This will download and run a unified install script that detects your OS and architecture. The install script creates a `/usr/local/bin` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs the `postman` binary there.

```bash
curl -o- "https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/unix.sh" | sh
```

## Update your Postman CLI installation

To update your Postman CLI installation to the latest version, run the same command you used to install it. The new version will overwrite the earlier version. For details about the latest changes and features, see the [Postman CLI release notes](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/postman-cli/).

## Uninstall Postman CLI

If you installed the Postman CLI with npm, you can uninstall it with the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall -g postman-cli
```

If you installed the Postman CLI with any method other than npm, you can uninstall it by deleting the `postman` binary. For Windows systems, the binary is in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps` by default. For macOS, Linux, and WLS systems, the binary is in `/usr/local/bin` by default.

## Troubleshooting

If you’ve installed the Postman CLI using both npm and the curl-based script, your system may have two copies of the binary. Which binary is active depends on the order of directories in your `PATH` environment variable.

To check which binary is active, do the following:

1. Run one of the following commands, depending on your system:

   * For macOS, Linux, or WSL, run `which postman`.

   * For Windows, run `where postman`.

2. Run `postman --version`.

If you have two copies of the binary in your `PATH` environment variable, you can resolve the conflict by [uninstalling](#uninstall-postman-cli) one of the binaries.


# Postman CLI command options

This topic covers the commands and options supported by the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

## Basic command line options

### `postman`

The base command of the Postman CLI is `postman`. Run this command with the syntax and options detailed below.

#### Options

| Option            | Details                                                     |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--help`, `-h`    | Returns information about Postman CLI commands and options. |
| `--version`, `-v` | Returns the version number for the Postman CLI.             |

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can run the `man postman` command to return a manual page with the Postman CLI commands and options.
</Tip>

#### Example

```plaintext
postman -v
```

## Sign in and out

You can use the Postman CLI to sign in and out of Postman with the [`login`](#postman-login) and [`logout`](#postman-logout) commands.

<Note title="Note">
  If you're using the Postman CLI from a network with outbound restrictions, you must [allowlist specific domains](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-postman-behind-a-firewall) to connect to Postman.
</Note>

### `postman login`

The `login` command prompts you to securely sign in and authenticate from the browser. Signing in is required once per session.

If you purchased a [Postman EU Data Residency plan](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-eu-data-residency/), the `login` command also requires the `--region` option. Use this option with the argument `eu` to specify that your instance of Postman is hosted in the EU region.

You can also use the `--with-api-key` option to authenticate using your [Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key). This method is recommended when using the Postman CLI from your CI/CD pipeline, but you can also use this method from your local machine.

You remain signed in until you use the `logout` command or your Postman credentials or API key expire.

#### Options

| Option                     | Details                                                                         |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--with-api-key <api-key>` | Authenticate the user with the given API key.                                   |
| `--region <region>`        | Specify that your instance of Postman is hosted in the EU region. Accepts `eu`. |

#### Examples

```plaintext
postman login

postman login --with-api-key ABCD-1234-1234-1234-1234-1234

postman login --with-api-key ABCD-1234-1234-1234-1234-1234 --region eu
```

### `postman logout`

This command signs you out of Postman and deletes the stored API key.

#### Example

```plaintext
postman logout
```

## Sync local elements with workspaces

The Postman CLI includes workspace commands to validate, synchronize, and push local collections and environments to Postman workspaces in the cloud.

<Note title="Note">
  The `postman workspace` commands are a beta feature available on Basic and Professional plans. Enterprise plan users can request access from their Postman Customer Success Manager.
</Note>

### `postman workspace prepare`

This command validates and prepares local collections and environments for pushing to a Postman workspace. It checks for valid UUIDs, regenerates IDs if needed, and ensures all items and responses have proper IDs.

#### Options

| Option                      | Details                                                                    |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--collections-dir <path>`  | Path to the collections directory. The default is `postman/collections`.   |
| `--environments-dir <path>` | Path to the environments directory. The default is `postman/environments`. |

#### Configuration

The command expects a `.postman/config.json` file in your working directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "workspace": {
    "id": "your-workspace-id"
  },
  "entities": {
    "collections": ["./collections/collection-name.postman_collection.json"],
    "environments": ["./environments/environment-name.postman_environment.json"]
  }
}
```

Collection and environment paths can be relative (resolved from `.postman/`) or absolute. Only valid JSON files are processed. Invalid paths like empty strings and non-JSON files are automatically filtered with warnings.

#### Example

```plaintext
postman workspace prepare
```

### `postman workspace push`

This command pushes local collection and environment changes to your Postman workspace. It synchronizes your local files with the workspace in the Postman cloud, performing create, update, and delete operations as needed.

#### Options

| Option                      | Details                                                                    |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--collections-dir <path>`  | Path to the collections directory. The default is `postman/collections`.   |
| `--environments-dir <path>` | Path to the environments directory. The default is `postman/environments`. |
| `--no-prepare`              | Skip the prepare step before pushing.                                      |
| `-y, --yes`                 | Skip all confirmation prompts.                                             |

#### Workflow

1. **Validate** - Checks if the collections and environments exist globally and in the target workspace.
2. **Prepare** (unless `--no-prepare`) - Runs prepare automatically if invalid or missing IDs are detected.
3. **Sync** - Creates, updates, or deletes entities to match your local state.
4. **Update Local Files** - After successful creation, updates local files with server-returned IDs.

#### Configuration

The command expects a `.postman/config.json` file in your working directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "workspace": {
    "id": "your-workspace-id"
  },
  "entities": {
    "collections": ["./collections/collection-name.postman_collection.json"],
    "environments": ["./environments/environment-name.postman_environment.json"]
  }
}
```

If the `config.json` file contains collection or environment paths, those specific files are used instead of directory scanning.

#### Example push with automatic prepare and interactive prompts

```plaintext
postman workspace push
```

#### Example push without the prepare step

```plaintext
postman workspace push --no-prepare
```

#### Example automatic push without prompts (useful for CI/CD)

```plaintext
postman workspace push --yes
```

## Run collections

<Note title="Note">
  The Postman CLI supports running HTTP collections. You can't run multi-protocol collections with the CLI.
</Note>

You can run your collections with the `postman collection run` command:

### `postman collection run`

This command runs a collection and sends the run results to the Postman cloud. You can specify the collection with its file path or Collection ID.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can find the collection ID in Postman. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection. Then click **Info** <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the right sidebar to view or copy the collection ID.
</Tip>

#### Options

| Option                                                                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--bail [optional modifiers]`                                          | Specifies whether to stop a collection run on encountering the first error. `--bail` can optionally accept two modifiers: `--folder` and `--failure`. `--folder` skips the entire collection run if there are any errors. If a test fails, `--failure` stops the collection run after completing the current script.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `--color [value]`                                                      | Controls colors in the CLI output. Accepts `on`, `off`, and `auto`. The default is `auto`. With `auto`, the Postman CLI attempts to automatically turn color on or off based on the color support in the terminal. This behavior can be changed by using the `on` or `off` value.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `--cookie-jar [path]`                                                  | Specifies the file path for a `JSON` cookie jar. This uses the `tough-cookie` library to deserialize the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--delay-request [number]`                                             | Specifies a delay (in milliseconds) between requests.

Global variables are similar to environment variables but have lower precedence and can be overridden by environment variables having the same name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--integration-id [ID]`                                                | Specifies an integration ID when using an integration with CI/CD. This sends the Postman CLI results to the correct integration in Postman. When you generate the Postman CLI command for a Git integrated API collection, the integration ID is automatically added to the command. To learn how to generate the Postman CLI command with the integration ID, go to [Configure the Postman CLI for CI](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/#configure-the-postman-cli-for-ci). |

| `--iteration-data [file-path]`, `-d`                                   | Specifies the local file path to a data file (JSON or CSV) to use for each iteration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `-i [requestUID] or [folderUID]`                                       | Runs only the specified folder UID or request UID from the collection. Multiple items can be run in order by specifying `-i` multiple times, for example: `postman collection run collectionUID -i folder1UID -i folder2UID`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `-i [requestName] or [folderName]`                                     | Runs only the specified folder name or request name from the collection. If there are duplicate names, the Postman CLI runs the folder or request that appears first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

```

## Run requests

You can test and debug HTTP requests from the command line with the `postman request` command.

### `postman request`

Use this command to test and debug HTTP requests from the command line with the Postman CLI. Use many of Postman's features for sending requests, including authentication, environment variables, test assertions, and more. The command accepts the request's method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, or OPTIONS) as the first argument, defaulting to GET if a method isn't provided. The command accepts the target URL as the second argument.

<Tip title="Tip">
  In Postman, you can also [convert an API request into a Postman CLI code snippet](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/). Copy the generated code snippet, add options to help you test your request, then send the request with the Postman CLI.

## Run monitors

You can use the `postman monitor run` command to trigger monitor runs within your CI/CD pipeline. You can also use the `postman runner start` command to run your organization's APIs from your internal network.

### `postman monitor run`

This command runs a monitor in the Postman cloud. Add the command into your CI/CD script to trigger a monitor run during your deployment process. Then your team can use your Postman tests to catch regressions and configuration issues. Learn more at [Run a monitor using the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-monitor/).

The command also invokes the monitor and polls Postman for the run's completion, returning the monitor results. Specify the monitor with its monitor ID.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can find the monitor ID in Postman. Click **Monitors** in the sidebar and select a collection. Then click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the right sidebar to view or copy the monitor ID.
</Tip>

### `postman runner start`

<Note title="Note">
  Private API Monitoring is a beta feature available with [Postman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To enable Private API Monitoring and the `postman runner start` command in your Enterprise team, contact your Postman Customer Success Manager.
</Note>

With [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/), you can use runners to monitor and test your organization’s APIs from your internal network, without publicly exposing your endpoints.

Run this command to start a runner from your internal network that regularly polls Postman for upcoming monitor runs. The collection’s tests run in your internal network. Then the test results are sent back to the Postman cloud, making them available in the monitor results. Provide the runner ID and key from the command you copied when you created the runner. Learn more about [setting up a runner in your internal network](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/set-up-a-runner-in-your-network/).

Optionally, you can configure the runner to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic through a proxy server that enforces outbound request policies. You can use the `--proxy` option to provide the URL for the proxy server used by your organization. Or you can use the `--egress-proxy` option to enable the built-in proxy and use the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option to provide the URL for the runner authorization service that evaluates outbound request policies. Learn more about [configuring a runner to use a proxy server](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/runners-proxy-server/).

<Note title="Note">
  You can't use the `--proxy` and `--egress-proxy` options together.
</Note>

If the runner is running in the background, stop the runner using your system's process control. You can also press **Control+C** or **Ctrl+C** to stop the runner.

## Governance and security

<Note title="Note">
  API governance and security rules are available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Note>

API governance is the practice of applying a defined set of standards consistently across the API design and testing phases of your development process. The Postman CLI includes commands that checks your API specifications in [Spec Hub](#postman-spec-lint) and the [Postman API Builder](#postman-api-lint) against your team's configured [Postman API governance and security rules](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/).

### `postman spec lint`

This command runs syntax validation and governance rule checks against a single- or multi-file API specification in [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). Provide the local file path or ID for a specification that's in OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 format. If you're providing the local file path for a multi-file specification, provide the path to the [root file](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/#about-multi-file-specifications).

By default, if you provide a local file path for a specification, the command runs syntax validation and governance checks using the **All workspaces** governance group. Use the `--workspace-id` option to run governance checks using the rules from a specific workspace.

<Tip title="Tip">
  Click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specification Info** in the [right sidebar](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#right-sidebar) of a specification and copy its ID.

### `postman api lint`

This command runs validation checks for governance and security rules against the API specification provided in the Postman config file, a local file, or a UUID. The `api lint` command shows a warning if it's unable to find the API ID to send data back to Postman.

<Note title="Note">
  This command supports APIs in the [Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) that aren't linked to Git.

## Publish an API version

You can [publish API versions in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/) from the command line with the Postman CLI. Use the Postman CLI to automate the API version publishing process.

### `postman publish api`

Publish a snapshot of an API for the given `apiId`. All elements linked to the API are published by default. You can choose which elements to publish by using other command options.

When publishing an API that's linked with Git, you must enter the command from inside the local Git repo. Also, you must provide paths to the schema directory and collection paths instead of IDs.

#### Options

| Option                                              | Details                                                                                                                                                 |

| `--name <name>`                                     | Specifies the name of the version to publish.                                                                                                           |
| `--release-notes <releaseNotes>`                    | Enter release notes as a string in quotes for the version to publish. This option supports Markdown.                                                    |
| `--collections <collectionIds/paths...>`            | Specifies the collections to publish. If the API is linked with Git, provide the `filePath` instead of the ID.                                          |
| `--api-definition <apiDefinitionId/directory/file>` | Specifies the API specification to publish. If the API is linked with Git, provide the `schemaDirectoryPath` or `schemaRootFilePath` instead of the ID. |
| `--do-not-poll`                                     | Specifies not to poll for completion status of the publish action.                                                                                      |

#### Example for repos not linked with Git

```plaintext
postman api publish <apiId> --name v1\
--release-notes "# Some release notes information"\
--collections <collectionId1> <collectionId2>\
--api-definition <apiDefinitionId>
```

#### Examples for repos linked with Git

The options for the `api publish` command differ depending on if you specified a schema folder or schema root file when setting up the Git integration. Git integrations added in Postman v10.18 or later use a schema root file. Git integrations added in other Postman versions use a schema folder. Learn more about [connecting an API in the Postman API Builder to a Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/).

* If the API uses a schema folder, publish the API using the `--api-definition <schemaDirectoryPath>` option:

  ```plaintext
  postman api publish <apiId> --name v1\
  --release-notes "# Some release notes information"\
  --collections <collectionPath1> <collectionPath2>\
  --api-definition <schemaDirectoryPath>
  ```

* If the API uses a schema root file, publish the API using the `--api-definition <schemaRootFilePath>` option:

  ```plaintext
  postman api publish <apiId> --name v1\
  --release-notes "# Some release notes information"\
  --collections <collectionPath1> <collectionPath2>\
  --api-definition <schemaRootFilePath>
  ```

<Note title="Note">
  If you specify a file when a folder is required, or a folder when a file is required, the `api publish` command returns the following error: `API Definition <file/folder> isn't part of API <apiId>`. Try the command again using the other option.
</Note>


# Run a collection using the Postman CLI

You can use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to manually run collections to test the functionality of your API. You can also use the Postman CLI to automate collection runs in CI/CD pipelines.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman supports running HTTP collections. You can't run multi-protocol collections.
</Info>

When the Postman CLI runs a collection, the collection and its tests run locally, and the results are sent to the Postman cloud using an API call.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Postman CLI doesn't support OAuth 2.0 authentication. To learn how to use an OAuth 2.0 token with the Postman CLI, see [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/#oauth-20-overview).
</Info>

## Run a collection locally with the Postman CLI

You can use the Postman CLI to run the requests in a [collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/) or a [folder](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/#add-folders-to-a-collection).

## Run a collection in a specific order

By default, when you generate the command to run a collection from the Collection Runner, a single Collection ID for the collection is specified. This runs the folders and requests in that collection in the sequence they're listed in the collection.

If you need to change the request order, select a request in the Collection Runner and drag it to its new location in the order. You can also remove an individual request from the run by clearing the checkbox next to its name.

When you change the folder and request sequence, the generated command also changes. In addition to the Collection ID, the generated command specifies a number of folder and request UIDs with the `-i` option. This runs each of the folders or requests in that specified order.

## Run a collection that uses test data files

The Postman CLI can't run requests that use files in your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory) to send [body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/). If your collection has requests that use files, [upload your test data files](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/) to make them available to the Postman CLI.

## Run a collection that uses packages

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Using the Postman CLI to run packages from your team's Postman Package Library is available with [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can use the Postman CLI to run collections with scripts that import packages from your team's [package library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/). Learn how to [add packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#add-a-package) to the package library, and [import packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#import-a-package) into your scripts.

You can also use the Postman CLI to run collections that [import external packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) from npm or JSR package registries.


# Run a monitor using the Postman CLI

Monitors enable you to regularly check the health and performance of your APIs. You can use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to trigger [monitor runs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) within your CI/CD pipeline. Then your team can use your Postman tests to automatically catch regressions and configuration issues during your deployment process. Depending on whether the monitor run passes or fails, you can push or roll back your changes.

By default, Postman supports monitoring public APIs. If you're on a paid plan, you can use [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/) to monitor your organization's internal APIs from your internal network using runners, without publicly exposing your endpoints. As an [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can create runners when you configure a monitor and then set up the runner in your internal network using the [`postman runner start` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#postman-runner-start).

Once your monitor is created, add the Postman CLI installation command and [`postman monitor run` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#postman-monitor-run) into your CI/CD script to integrate them into your workflow. Postman recommends replacing your monitor ID and API key with variables.

The Postman CLI triggers the monitor using the `postman monitor run` command and polls Postman for the run's completion. Then the Postman CLI makes the test results available in the [monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/) in Postman. When the Postman CLI triggers a monitor for a public API, the collection and its tests run in the Postman cloud. When the Postman CLI triggers a monitor for an internal API, the collection and its tests run in your internal network.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Monitors support HTTP collections. You can't use monitors with multi-protocol collections.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Postman CLI doesn't support OAuth 2.0 authentication. To learn how to use an OAuth 2.0 token with the Postman CLI, see [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/#oauth-20-overview).

# Run a performance test using the Postman CLI

With performance tests, you can simulate user traffic and observe how your API behaves under load, identifying potential issues that affect performance. You can use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to trigger [performance tests](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/) for specified collections, all within your CI/CD pipeline. Your team can use your tests to automatically catch performance issues during the deployment process. Depending on whether the performance test passes or fails, you can push or roll back your changes.

With the [`postman performance run` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#run-performance-tests), you can configure a performance test for a collection. Add the command into your CI/CD script to [integrate performance tests into your workflow](#run-a-performance-test-within-your-cicd-pipeline). Postman recommends replacing your collection ID and API key with variables.

The Postman CLI triggers the performance test using the `postman performance run` command. The performance test runs against the specified collection according to your performance test configuration. Then the Postman CLI makes the test results available in the [performance test results](/docs/collections/performance-testing/performance-test-metrics/) in Postman.

<Note title="Note">
  Performance tests aren't supported with the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app).

# Generate collection run reports using the Postman CLI

The Postman CLI has built-in reporters you can use to generate reports for your [collection runs](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-collection/). The following reporters are available: CLI, JSON, JUnit, and HTML. You can use more than one reporter for a run, and you can customize the report output to meet your needs.

## About built-in reporters

Each Postman CLI reporter generates a local report with details about a collection run, including the requests sent, response codes and times, and the number of passed and failed tests. JSON and HTML reports also include details about failed requests ran from scripts at the collection and folder levels. The following reporters are available:

* **CLI** - Displays a report in the terminal. The CLI report is displayed by default if no reporter options are specified.
* **JSON** - Creates a JSON file containing the report. By default, the report structure follows the Postman CLI JSON reporter schema. You can optionally generate a report using the Newman JSON reporter schema ([example](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/examples/reports/sample-collection-report.json)).
* **JUnit** - Creates an XML file containing the report. To learn more about JUnit reporting, see the [JUnit documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#junit-platform-reporting).
* **HTML** - Creates an HTML file containing the report. You can filter your collection run iterations by test failures or errors, or by test failures only. Then select the iteration you'd like to view from the filtered results. You can also filter the requests within each iteration to show requests that encountered test failures or errors, or errors only.

## Use a built-in reporter

To generate a report for a collection run, use the `-r` or `--reporters` option. Then specify the reporter you want to use to generate the report: `cli`, `json`, `junit`, or `html`. Use the following syntax:

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r <reporter>
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can find the collection ID in Postman. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection. Then click **Info** <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the right sidebar to view or copy the collection ID.
</Info>

By default, reports are created inside the directory `postman-cli-reports` in the current working directory. If the `postman-cli-reports` directory doesn't exist, it's automatically created. You can also [specify an output directory](#configure-the-json-junit-and-html-reporters). The filename includes the collection name and a system timestamp in 24-hour format: `collection-name-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss`.

### Use more than one reporter

You can specify one or more reporters for a collection run. If you specify more than one reporter, separate the reporter names in a comma-separated list, for example, `-r json,junit`.

By default, CLI reporter output is shown in the terminal when you run a collection. If you specify one or more reporters, for example `-r json`, then CLI reporter output isn't shown. In this case, to show the CLI reporter, you must explicitly specify it along with the other reporters, for example: `-r cli,json`.

The following example runs the `cli` and `json` reporters:

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r cli,json
```

## Configure built-in reporters

You can customize the output of each reporter by including one or more options when running the command. Use the following syntax:

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r json <--reporter-json-option1> <--reporter-json-option2>
```

The following example runs the `json` reporter with the omit headers and omit response bodies options:

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r json --reporter-json-omitHeaders --reporter-json-omitResponseBodies
```

### Configure the CLI reporter

The CLI reporter is turned on by default when running a collection with the Postman CLI and prints the report to the terminal. Use the following options to configure the CLI reporter.

| Option                                 | Details                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--reporter-cli-silent`                | Turns off the CLI reporter, and no output is displayed in the terminal.                                  |
| `--reporter-cli-show-timestamps`       | Prints the local time that each request was made.                                                        |
| `--reporter-cli-no-summary`            | Doesn't print the statistical summary table.                                                             |
| `--reporter-cli-no-failures`           | Doesn't print details for run failures.                                                                  |
| `--reporter-cli-no-assertions`         | Turns off output for assertions as they happen.                                                          |
| `--reporter-cli-no-success-assertions` | Turns off output for successful assertions as they happen.                                               |
| `--reporter-cli-no-console`            | Turns off `console.log()` output (and other console methods) from pre-request and post-response scripts. |
| `--reporter-cli-no-banner`             | Turns off the banner shown at the beginning of each collection run.                                      |

### Configure the JSON, JUnit, and HTML reporters

The JSON, JUnit, and HTML reporters create a report file in the specified format in your working directory. Use the following options to configure the reporter. Replace `<reporter>` with the reporter you are using: `json`, `junit`, or `html`.

| Option                                        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--reporter-<reporter>-export <path>`         | Specify a path to save the report. By default, reports are saved to the `/postman-cli-reports` directory in your current working directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically. If the specified path is an existing directory, the report file will be saved within it. |
| `--reporter-<reporter>-omitRequestBodies`     | (JSON and HTML reporters only) Remove all request bodies from the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `--reporter-<reporter>-omitResponseBodies`    | (JSON and HTML reporters only) Remove all response bodies from the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--reporter-<reporter>-omitHeaders`           | (JSON and HTML reporters only) Remove all request and response headers from the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `--reporter-<reporter>-omitAllHeadersAndBody` | (JSON and HTML reporters only) Remove all request and response headers, and all request and response bodies, from the report.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--reporter-json-structure newman`            | (JSON reporter only) Generate a JSON report using the Newman schema. By default, JSON reports use the native structure of the Postman CLI.                                                                                                                                                             |

### Configure options for more than one reporter

If you're using more than one reporter, you can specify an option for a single reporter using the syntax `--reporter-<reporter>-<option>`. Replace `<reporter>` with the reporter you are using: `cli`, `json`, `junit`, or `html`. Replace `<option>` with the [reporter option](#configure-built-in-reporters) you want to apply to the reporter.

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r json,html --reporter-json-omitHeaders
```

If you want all reporters to accept the same option, you can specify a [reporter option](#configure-built-in-reporters) for all reporters using the syntax `--reporter-[option]`.

```bash
postman collection run <collection-id> -r json,html --reporter-omitHeaders
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When using more than one reporter, options specified for a single reporter take precedence over options specified for all reporters.

# Run Postman CLI commands in your CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions

With the Postman CLI GitHub Action, you can run [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) commands directly in your GitHub CI/CD workflows, without creating and maintaining custom actions. The action supports collection runs, monitors, syntax checks, governance validation, and more. By catching regressions and configuration issues early, you can confidently decide whether to proceed with or roll back a deployment.

To learn more about the Postman CLI GitHub Action, see the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/postman-cli).

## Use the Postman CLI GitHub Action

Specify the Postman CLI commands you'd like to run in your CI/CD workflows. For each command, you can customize inputs to suit your API project, such as the Postman CLI version. Each command returns an exit code output you can use to check whether the results succeeded or failed.

```yaml
name: API Tests

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Postman Collection
        uses: postmanlabs/postman-cli-action@v1
        with:
          command: 'collection run 12345678-collection-id'
          api-key: ${{ secrets.POSTMAN_API_KEY }}
```

The Postman CLI GitHub Action accepts the following inputs:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api-key`             | Specify your [Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) used for authentication. Required if you're accessing the Postman cloud. This is optional if you're accessing local files. |
| `command`             | (Required) Specify the [Postman CLI command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/) you'd like to run and its options.                                                                                                           |

# Run and test collections from the command line using Newman CLI

Newman is a command-line tool for running Postman Collections. Use Newman to run and test collections from the command line instead of in the Postman app. Newman is built with extensibility in mind, so you can incorporate it in your continuous integration (CI) pipelines and build systems.

The topics in this section will help you get started with Newman. For complete usage information, see Newman in the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **You can also run collections from the command line with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).** For more information on the differences between Newman and the Postman CLI, see [Decide which command-line companion to use](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/#decide-which-command-line-companion-to-use).
</Info>

![Running Newman](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/newman-running-in-terminal.gif)

## Get started in Newman

To get started, install Node.js and Newman, then run your collections. Learn more about [installing and running Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/installing-running-newman/).

You can also run Newman using Docker. Learn more about [running Newman with Docker on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-with-docker/).

## Newman options

Newman provides a rich set of options to customize a collection run. Learn more about [Newman options](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-options/).

## Upload files in Newman

Newman supports file uploads, so you can use a data file (such as a text file) to fill in form data fields. Learn more about [uploading files in Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-file-uploads/).

## Newman reporters

Reporters can generate collection run reports for specific use cases, for example, logging the response body when a request (or its tests) fail. Learn more about using [Newman built-in reporters](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-built-in-reporters/) and [Newman external and custom reporters](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-custom-reporters/).

## Newman and continuous integration (CI)

You can integrate Newman in your continuous integration (CI) environment. Run your collections and tests automatically after every code push. Learn more about [using Newman with CI](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/continuous-integration/), [using Newman with Travis CI](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/integration-with-travis/), or [using Newman with Jenkins](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/integration-with-jenkins/).


# Install and run Newman

Newman is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about). To get started, first install Node.js, then install Newman. After installing Newman, you can run your Postman collections from the command line. Collections can be run as an exported JSON file or by passing the URL of the collection to Newman.

## Install Newman

Before installing Newman, make sure you've installed Node.js v16 or later. Follow the [steps to download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your continuous integration (CI) system. (Some CI systems have configurations that pre-install Node.js.)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using an earlier version of Newman, learn more about [Node.js version compatibility with Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#nodejs).
</Info>

Install Newman globally so you can run it anywhere on your system. Use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g newman
```

### Update Newman

If you've already installed Newman, you can upgrade to a later version. Learn more about [upgrading to a later version of Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md).

## Run a collection with Newman

To run a collection with Newman, first [export the collection](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-collections) as a JSON file. Then run the collection from your file system with the following command:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't use Newman to run scripts and tests in packages that are in your team's [Postman Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/). Use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to run the contents of packages from the command line.
</Info>

### Run a collection with a URL

You can run a collection by passing the URL of the collection to Newman. In the following example, substitute the `<collection-id>` with the ID of the collection you want to run:

```bash
newman run https://www.postman.com/collections/<collection-id>
```

You can find the collection ID in Postman. First, click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection. Then click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Info** in the right sidebar to view and copy the collection ID.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your collection URL isn't publicly available, [use the Postman API](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman?tab=readme-ov-file#using-newman-with-the-postman-api) to run your collection with Newman.
</Info>

### Run a collection with an environment

If your collection uses environment variables, you must provide the [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) used in your collection. [Export the environment](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-environments) from Postman and include it with the `-e` flag. For example:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -e dev-environment.json
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Newman doesn't support OAuth 2.0 authentication. To learn how to use an OAuth 2.0 token with Newman, see [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/#oauth-20-overview).
</Info>

### Example collection run with failing tests

The following example shows the results of a collection run in Newman with failing tests.

![Newman tests example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/newman-test-example-v11-12.jpg)

In the output, `test-scripts` refers to [post-response scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/). Newman supports the same [libraries and objects](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/overview/) as Postman for pre-request and post-response scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can export the run results, including all requests and tests, to a file using [Newman's built-in reporters](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-built-in-reporters/).
</Info>

## Customize a collection run

Newman provides a rich set of options for customizing a collection run. To learn more, see the [Newman command reference](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-options/).

## Using Newman with CI/CD

By default, Newman exits with a status code of `0` if everything runs as expected without any exceptions. You can configure your continuous integration (CI) tool to pass or fail a build based on Newman's exit codes.

Use the [`--bail` option](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-options/#more-configuration-options) to make Newman stop a run if it encounters a test case error with a status code of `1`. This status code can then be used by your CI tool or build system.

## Using Newman as a Node.js library

You can use Newman within your JavaScript projects as a Node.js module. The entire set of Newman CLI functionality is available to use programmatically. The following example runs a collection by reading a JSON collection stored in your file system:

```javascript
const newman = require('newman'); // require Newman in your project

// call newman.run to pass the `options` object and wait for callback
newman.run({
    collection: require('./sample-collection.json'),
    reporters: 'cli'
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

# Newman command reference

Use Newman's command line options to customize your collection runs. You can use options to set up a collection run, configure request delays and timeouts, specify SSL details, and more. When you run a collection iteratively, you can [specify different data sets and variables](#data-file-example) for each iteration. After a run finishes, Newman exits with a [status code](#exit-status) that you can pass to your continuous integration (CI) tool.

To use options, add them to the `newman run` command after you [specify the collection file or URL](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/installing-running-newman/#run-a-collection-with-newman):

```bash
newman run my-collection.json [options]

## Exit status

By default, Newman exits with a status code of `0` if everything runs as expected without any exceptions. You can configure your continuous integration (CI) tool to pass or fail a build based on Newman's exit codes. To override the default exit code for the current run, use `-x` or `--suppress-exit-code` option.

Use the `--bail` option to make Newman stop a run if it encounters a test case error with a status code of `1`. This status code can then be used by your CI tool or build system. For example:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -e dev-environment.json --bail
```

## Data file example

To use a different set of data or variables for each iteration in a collection run, use the `-d` option to specify a JSON or CSV file.

The following example shows a JSON data file for a run with two iterations, with each iteration using different values for a set of variables.

```json
[{
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000",
    "user_id": "1",
    "id": "1",
    "token_id": "123123",
},
{
    "url": "http://postman-echo.com",
    "user_id": "2",
    "id": "2",
    "token_id": "899899",
}]
```

To run the collection, use the `-d` option and specify the data file. For example:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -d data-file.json
```

The following example shows the same data formatted in a CSV file.

```bash
url, user_id, id, token_id
http://127.0.0.1:5000, 1, 1, 123123123
http://postman-echo.com, 2, 2, 899899
```

# Upload test data files with Newman

Newman supports file uploads so you can send test data (form data or a binary) with an API request. The data file must be located in the same [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory) as the collection JSON file you are running. Also, you must include the filename in the `src` attribute of the request.

The following example shows the exported JSON file for a collection named `file-upload`. The collection has a single request that uploads a form data file named `sample-file.txt` in the request body.

```json
// the filename is sample-file.txt
{
	"info": {
		"_postman_id": "9dbfcf22-fdf4-f328-e440-95dbd8e4cfbb",
		"name": "file-upload",
		"description": "A set of `POST` requests to upload files as form data fields",
		"schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
	},
	"item": [
		{
			"name": "Form data upload",
			"event": [
				{
					"listen": "test",
					"script": {
						"exec": [
							"const uploadedFile = pm.response.json()?.files['sample-file.txt'];",
							"",
							"pm.test(\"Status code is 200\", () => pm.response.to.have.status(200));",
							"pm.test('File was uploaded correctly', () => pm.expect(uploadedFile).to.match(/^data:application\\/octet-stream;base64/));"
						],
						"type": "text/javascript",
						"packages": {}
					}
				}
			],
			"request": {
				"method": "POST",
				"header": [],
				"body": {
					"mode": "formdata",
					"formdata": [
						{
							"key": "file",
							"type": "file",
							"src": "sample-file.txt"
						}
					]
				},
				"url": {
					"raw": "https://postman-echo.com/post",
					"protocol": "https",
					"host": [
						"postman-echo",
						"com"
					],
					"path": [
						"post"
					]
				},
				"description": "Uploads a file as a form data field to `https://postman-echo.com/post` using a `POST` request."
			},
			"response": []
		}
	]
}
```

The file `sample-file.txt` must be present in the same working directory as the collection. Run this collection as usual:

```bash
newman run file-upload.postman_collection.json
```

You'll get a message that the file was uploaded correctly, and the test will pass.


# Generate collection run reports with Newman built-in reporters

Newman has built-in reporters you can use to generate reports for your collection runs. The following reporters are available: CLI, JSON, JUnit, Progress, and Emoji train. You can use more than one reporter for a run, and you can customize the report output to meet your needs.

## Use built-in reporters

To generate reports of the current collection run, you can configure reporters using the `-r` or `--reporters` options. Then specify the reporters you'd like to generate reports for: `cli`, `json`, `junit`, `progress`, or `emojitrain`.

You can specify one or more reporters. If you specify more than one reporter, separate reporter names as a comma-separated list, for example, `-r cli,json`. To learn more about each reporter, see [About built-in reporters](#about-built-in-reporters).

The CLI reporter (`cli`) is turned on by default when using Newman in the terminal. If you turn on one or more reporters, for example `-r json`, the CLI reporter will be turned off. To turn on the CLI reporter, you must specify the CLI reporter, for example, `-r cli,json`.

The following example runs the `cli` and `json` reporters:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,json
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If the built-in reporters aren't right for your use case, you can [use an external reporter or build a custom reporter](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/newman-custom-reporters/).
</Info>

### About built-in reporters

Each reporter generates a report about your collection run in a different format.

* **CLI** - Displays the report in the terminal.
* **JSON** - Creates a JSON file containing the report.
* **JUnit** - Creates an XML file containing the report.
* **Progress** - Displays a progress bar in the terminal showing the progress of the collection run.
* **Emoji train** - Displays emojis in the terminal that represent the report's details.

## Configure built-in reporters

If you specify more than one reporter, you can specify an option for one reporter using the `--reporter-[reporter-name]-[reporter-option]` option. The following example silences the CLI reporter only:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,json --reporter-cli-silent
```

If you specify more than one reporter, and you want all reporters to accept the same option, you can specify an option for all reporters using the `--reporter-[reporter-option]` option. The following example passes `silent: true` to both the CLI and JSON reporters:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,json --reporter-silent
```

### CLI reporter

The CLI reporter is turned on by default when using Newman as a CLI, and prints the report to the terminal. You can use the following options to configure the CLI reporter:

| Option                                 | Details                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--reporter-cli-silent`                | The CLI reporter is turned off, and you don't see an output in the terminal.                                    |
| `--reporter-cli-show-timestamps`       | Prints the local time that each request was made.                                                               |
| `--reporter-cli-no-summary`            | Doesn't print the statistical summary table.                                                                    |
| `--reporter-cli-no-failures`           | Doesn't print the details for run failures.                                                                     |
| `--reporter-cli-no-assertions`         | Turns off the output for assertions as they happen.                                                             |
| `--reporter-cli-no-success-assertions` | Turns off the output for successful assertions as they happen.                                                  |
| `--reporter-cli-no-console`            | Turns off the output of `console.log()` (and other console methods) from pre-request and post-response scripts. |
| `--reporter-cli-no-banner`             | Turns off the Newman banner shown at the beginning of each collection run.                                      |

The following example prints the time that each request was made:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,json --reporter-cli-show-timestamps
```

### JSON reporter

The JSON reporter creates a JSON file in your working directory that contains the report. You can use the following option to configure the JSON reporter:

| Option                          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--reporter-json-export [path]` | <p>Specify a path where the output JSON file will be created in your file system. By default, the JSON file is created in `/newman` in your working directory. If the `/newman` directory doesn't exist, it will be created. If the specified path is an existing directory, the file will be created in that directory.</p> <p>Optionally, you can specify a name for the file, for example, `... --reporter-json-export collection-run-1.json`.</p> |

The following example generates the output JSON file for the JSON reporter in the `/json-file-reports` directory:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,json --reporter-json-export json-file-reports
```

### JUnit reporter

The JUnit reporter creates an XML file in your working directory that contains the report. You can use the following option to configure the JUnit reporter:

| Option                           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--reporter-junit-export [path]` | <p>Specify a path where the output XML file will be created in your file system. By default, the XML file is created in `/newman` in your working directory. If the `/newman` directory doesn't exist, it will be created. If the specified path is an existing directory, the file will be created in that directory.</p> <p>Optionally, you can specify a name for the file, for example, `... --reporter-junit-export collection-run-1.xml`.</p> |

The following example generates the output XML file for the JUnit reporter in the `/xml-file-reports` directory:

```bash
newman run my-collection.json -r cli,junit --reporter-junit-export xml-file-reports
```


# Use Newman external and custom reporters

Generate reports for your collection runs in Newman with custom and external reporters. You can generate reports for specific use cases, for example, logging the response body when a request or test fails. Use existing external reporters to generate reports, or build your own custom reporters.

## Build custom reporters

A custom reporter is a Node.js module with a name in the format `newman-reporter-<name>`.

To create a custom reporter, do the following:

1. In the directory of your choice, create a blank npm package with `npm init`.

2. Add an `index.js` file that exports a function in the following format:

   ```javascript
   function CustomNewmanReporter (emitter, reporterOptions, collectionRunOptions) {
     // emitter is is an event emitter that triggers the following events: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunevents
     // reporterOptions is an object of the reporter specific options. The usage examples below have more details.
     // collectionRunOptions is an object of all the collection run options: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunoptions-object--callback-function--run-eventemitter
   }
   module.exports = CustomNewmanReporter
   ```

3. To use your reporter locally, use `npm pack` to create a TGZ file. This can be installed using `npm i -g newman-reporter-<name>.<version>.tgz`. Learn more about [using custom reporters](#use-external-and-custom-reporters).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Scoped reporter package names like `@myorg/newman-reporter-<name>` are also supported.
   </Info>

4. (Optional) You can publish your reporter to npm using `npm publish`.

## Use external and custom reporters

You must install an external or custom reporter to use it. For example, to use the [Newman HTML reporter](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html), install the reporter package:

```bash
npm install newman-reporter-html
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use external reporters with Newman if the reporter works with Newman's event sequence. To learn more, view [examples of how Newman reporters work](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/tree/develop/lib/reporters).
</Info>

The name of the package follows the format `newman-reporter-<name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the reporter. The installation is global if Newman is installed globally, and local otherwise. Run `npm install ...` with the `-g` flag for a global installation.

To use local (non-published) reporters, run the following command:

```bash
npm install <path/to/local-reporter-directory>
```

You can use the installed reporter either with the command-line tool or programmatically. In either case, the `newman-reporter` prefix isn't required while specifying the reporter name in the options.

On the command line:

```bash
newman run /path/to/collection.json -r myreporter --reporter-myreporter-<option-name> <option-value> # The option is optional
```

Programmatically:

```js
var newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
   collection: '/path/to/collection.json',
   reporters: 'myreporter',
   reporter: {
     myreporter: {
       'option-name': 'option-value' // this is optional
     }
   }
}, function (err, summary) {
  if (err) { throw err; }
  console.info('collection run complete!');
});
```

Scoped reporter packages must be specified with the scope prefix. For example, if your package name is `@myorg/newman-reporter-name`, you must specify the reporter with `@myorg/name`.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The reporter options used in these examples are optional.

# Run Newman with Docker on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for building and running applications in a virtual environment. You can use [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) to run your Postman Collections in a Docker container. When running collections in Docker, you can use all available Newman command options and run local collection files.

## Use Newman with Docker on macOS and Ubuntu

To use Newman with Docker for macOS or Ubuntu, do the following:

1. Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. Go to [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), choose your operating system, and follow the instructions.

2. To test your Docker installation, run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

3. Pull the [Newman Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/postman/newman/) image from Docker hub:

   ```bash
   docker pull postman/newman;
   ```

4. Run Newman commands on the image. For example, to run a [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/), use the collection ID and your Postman API key:

   * To get the collection ID, select a collection in the sidebar. Click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Info** and copy the ID.

   * To get an API key, go to [Generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).

   ```bash
   docker run -t postman/newman run "https://api.getpostman.com/collections/<collection-id>?apikey=<your-api-key>"
   ```

The collection runs in Newman, and the output displays in the terminal.

The entry point to the Docker image is Newman, so you can use all Newman command line parameters. You can also run locally stored collection files. The [Newman Docker documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/postman/newman/) describes how to mount shared data volumes.

## Use Newman with Docker on Windows

To learn more about using Newman with Docker on Windows, go to [Using the Newman Docker Image in Windows](https://blog.postman.com/using-the-newman-docker-image-in-windows/).

# Run Postman Collections in your CI environment using Newman

You can use [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) and the [Postman API](https://api.postman.com/) to run Postman Collections in your continuous integration (CI) environment. First install Node.js and Newman in your CI environment. You can then use Newman to get and run your collection using the Postman API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, check the following prerequisites for running collections using Newman and the Postman API:

* Make sure you have a CI system setup that can run shell commands and that you have edit access.
* [Generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key), and copy it for later use.
* Make sure you have a Postman Collection that tests your localhost server, and copy the collection ID for later use. If your collection needs an environment, copy the environment ID for later use.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Developing an API?** Postman offers built-in tools to integrate your API with some of the most popular continuous integration (CI) tools. After you set up CI for your API, you can view the status of builds or start a new build, all from within Postman. You can also use Newman to run API tests as part of your CI pipeline. To learn more, see [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).
</Info>

## Install Newman and Node.js

To learn how to install Newman and Node.js, see [Install and run Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/installing-running-newman/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You don't need to install Node.js if your CI environment already has it installed.
</Info>

## Run a collection using Newman and the Postman API

To run a collection using Newman and Postman API, use the following command:

```bash
newman run "https://api.getpostman.com/collections/collection-id?apikey=postman-api-key"
```

If you need to provide an environment to the collection, add the `--environment` option with the appropriate parameters to the Newman command:

```bash
newman run "https://api.getpostman.com/collections/collection-id?apikey=postman-api-key"
--environment "https://api.getpostman.com/environments/environment-id?apikey=postman-api-key"

# Integrate your Postman tests with Travis CI using Newman

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a development practice that encourages developers to commit their code changes to a shared repository on a regular basis. With CI/CD, developers might commit their code as often as several times a day. This approach helps the team avoid technical debt and detect problems.

With CI/CD, every code commit triggers an automated process that builds the code, runs tests, and can even deploy the updated code if all checks pass. This integrated process ensures a smooth, efficient workflow and maintains code quality throughout the development cycle.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Developing an API?** Postman offers built-in tools to integrate your API with some of the most popular continuous integration (CI) tools, including Travis CI. After you set up CI for your API, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman. You can also use Newman to run API tests as part of your CI pipeline. To learn more, see [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).
</Info>

## Run Postman tests with Travis CI

In general, integrating your [Postman tests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) with Travis CI is the same process as [running on Jenkins](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/integration-with-jenkins/), AppVeyor, or any other build system. You will set up your CI configuration to run a shell command when starting your build. The command is a [Newman script](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) that runs the collection containing the tests and returns a pass or fail exit code that's logged in your CI system.

This example shows you how to integrate Postman with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/), a continuous integration platform that development teams use to automatically build and test code changes. When you're finished, Travis CI will run your tests every time you make a commit to your GitHub repo.

![Travis workflow](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/travis_workflow.jpg)

## Get started

1. **Choose the Postman Collection with your tests.** In most cases, you'll already have a Postman Collection with your tests.

2. **Set up a GitHub repository.** Travis CI is free for open source projects on GitHub. For this example, you'll store the collection with your Postman tests in a public GitHub repository. Create a new public repo on GitHub and clone the project to your local system.

3. **Set up Travis CI.** Follow the [Travis CI getting started guide](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started) for a complete walk through. You will need to [sign in to Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/signin) and [activate Travis CI integration](https://app.travis-ci.com/account/repositories) for your new public GitHub repo.

## Connect Postman to Travis CI

1. [Export the "Hello World" collection](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) as a JSON file and rename the exported file `hello_world.postman_collection.json`.

2. Create a folder named `tests` at the root of your local project, and move the exported JSON file into the new `tests` folder.

   ```bash
   .
   └── tests
       └── hello_world.postman_collection.json
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If your collection uses an environment, you also need to [export the environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) as a JSON file and move it to the `tests` folder.
   </Info>

3. Create a new file named `.travis.yml` at the root of your project repository. You'll use this file to tell Travis CI the programming language for your project and how to  build it.

   ```bash
   .
   ├── .travis.yml
   └── tests
       └── hello_world.postman_collection.json
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Any step of the build process [can be customized](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build). The scripts in the `.travis.yml` file will run the next time you commit and push a change to your repo.
   </Info>

4. In the `.travis.yml` file, add a command to `install` Newman in the CI environment, and then add a `script` telling Newman to run the Postman tests (which you placed in the `tests` folder).

   Because Travis CI doesn't know where Newman is located, you need to update the `PATH`. In this example, the `newman` tool is located in the `.bin` folder which is in the `node_modules` folder.

   For this example, your `.travis.yml` file will look like the following:

   ```bash
   language: node_js
   node_js:
   - "16.13.2"

   install:
   - npm install newman

   before_script:
   - node --version
   - npm --version
   - node_modules/.bin/newman --version

   script:
   - node_modules/.bin/newman run tests/hello_world.postman_collection.json
   ```

   Note that if you exported an environment, you need to add it to the script as well:

   ```bash
   script:
   - node_modules/.bin/newman run tests/hello_world.postman_collection.json -e tests/tests.postman_environment.json
   ```

5. Commit all the changes to your local project and push them to your public GitHub repo.

   Travis CI will automatically trigger a build and run  your tests every time you push a commit to your repo. Open the [Travis CI dashboard](https://app.travis-ci.com/dashboard) to get details about the status of your build. If all went well, your build was successful.

   ![Travis CI build successful](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/travis-ci-build-success.jpg)

## Fix test failures

What do things look like when a test fails? To find out, make a change in your imported "Hello World" collection in Postman so that one of the tests breaks.

To view a failed test, do the following:

1. Open the collection, select the "Hello World" request, and then select the **Scripts > Post-response** tab.

2. Change the final test so that it looks for the text "Hello, Everyone!" instead of "Hello, World!"

   ![Tests tab error](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/travis-ci-test-error-example-v11-b.jpg)

3. Save the change and then export the collection again. As before, rename the exported file `hello_world.postman_collection.json` and move it into the `tests` directory in your local project.

4. Commit and push the change to your public GitHub repo. This will trigger a new build in Travis CI, and this time the build will fail.

   ![Travis CI build failed](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/travis-ci-build-failed.jpg)

5. Select the failed build link to view the build logs in Travis CI. The logs will tell you that the assertion failed. If this was your own collection, you could use the error message to help understand why the test failed and debug the problem.

   ![Travis CI error log](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/travis-ci-error-log.jpg)

6. For this example, if you want, you can correct the error in the test in Postman and export the collection again. As before, rename the JSON file, add it to the `tests` folder in your local project, then commit and push. This time your build in Travis CI will be successful.


# Integrate your Postman tests with Jenkins using Newman

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open source automation server that can act as a continuous integration (CI) server or a continuous delivery (CD) hub. Use Newman to integrate your [Postman tests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) with Jenkins. You can run a Postman Collection and its API tests from Jenkins. You can also specify the frequency that Jenkins runs a collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This guide uses a Jenkins installation that runs locally, but in most cases you'll run Jenkins on a build server in your production environment.

# Monitor health and performance of your APIs in Postman

*Postman Monitors* enable you to [continuously check the health and performance of your APIs](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-observability/). You can create monitors that run requests in selected collections. Requests can run API test scripts, chain together multiple requests, and more. You can also schedule how often Postman runs monitored collections.

You'll be alerted to any test failures once the monitor is running, so you can identify and address issues before your API's consumers are affected.

## About Postman Monitors

You can [set up monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/), enabling you to run a series of requests from the Postman cloud based on a schedule. When creating a monitor, you choose a [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) with the requests you want to run. You can learn more about [use cases for monitors](#monitor-use-cases).

With [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/), you can use runners and the Postman CLI to monitor and test your organization's APIs from your internal network, without publicly exposing your endpoints. Once set up, monitors run in your internal network and the runner sends the results to the Postman cloud. You can also [configure monitors to run from static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/) to monitor APIs that are behind a restricted firewall.

You can [view results for monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/) to learn more about the monitors you're running. You can also [manage your team's monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/), enabling you to track your team's resource usage and purchase more blocks of monitoring calls.

## Monitor use cases

Monitors run Postman requests and scripts, enabling you to [monitor APIs](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-monitoring/) in a variety of ways. The following are examples of what you can check with monitors:

* **Check API health and performance** - Ensure the API is up and running in production and other environments.
* **Validate API response structure and data** - Ensure the API is functioning according to specifications.
* **Test complex, multi-step workflows** - Ensure that critical API flows and edge cases are working as expected.
* **Run tests in multiple environments and regions** - Ensure your APIs are working everywhere. (Running monitors in multiple regions requires a paid Postman plan.)
* **Monitor the security of your endpoints** - Continuously test APIs for known security vulnerabilities.
* **Visualize results on the monitor dashboard** - Get better visibility into API performance over time and identify trends.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more examples of monitors in action, visit the [Postman API Monitoring Examples public workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-api-monitoring-examples/overview) to find example collections for some common monitoring use cases. You can collaborate on the collections in the workspace by [creating a fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork), or customize the collections for your team's use by [exporting and importing them into your internal workspace](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-collections).

## Monitor FAQs

To learn more about configuring monitors in Postman, see the [Monitor FAQs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/faqs-monitors/).


# Set up a monitor in Postman

Create a new monitor to continuously check your API's health, run test suites, or validate critical workflows. When creating a monitor, you select a collection with the requests you want to run and set a schedule for how often Postman runs the collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Monitors support HTTP collections. You can't use monitors with multi-protocol collections.
</Info>

Other configuration options enable you to tailor the monitor to your specific API development workflow. You can upload a data file with sets of values to use as variable inputs when running the monitor.

[Monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) are typically used to schedule runs when you want to set up alerts like triggering on-call upon failure. You can also schedule collection runs using the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/). Choose the Collection Runner to schedule runs and automate API testing. Learn more about [scheduling collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/).

You can also integrate monitors with your CI/CD pipeline using [the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/), Postman's command line tool.

## Create a monitor

You can create a new monitor from the sidebar or select a collection to monitor. To create a new monitor from the sidebar, do the following:

1. Click **Monitors** in the sidebar.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman maintains limits on various team and user actions, including monitor creation. For more information, see [Monitor activity limits](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/#monitor-activity-limits).
</Info>

1. Click **Select File** to [upload a data file](#upload-a-data-file). Locate and open your CSV or JSON file. Postman uses the data file when running your monitor. Data files are limited to 1 MB in size and a maximum of 50 data rows (CSV) or 50 objects (JSON).

2. Under **Run**, choose if you'd like the monitor to run on a schedule or only run when triggered by the Postman CLI. If running the monitor on a schedule, click the first dropdown list and select a timer increment. For more information, see [Run monitors](#run-monitors).

3. Click the next dropdown list to select the timer's frequency (for example, every 5 minutes or every Monday at 1:00 AM).

4. To [select a region or runner](#add-regions-and-runners) to monitor your requests from, under **Runners**, select **Auto Select** or **Manually Select**. If you select **Manually Select**, select one or more regions or runners from the list.

5. You can choose to get failure and error [notifications](#get-monitor-notifications) by email, in Slack, or in Microsoft Teams.

   * To have notifications sent to your or a team member's email address, select the **Receive email notifications for run failures and errors** checkbox under **Notifications**. Enter one or more email addresses and specify how many consecutive failures trigger notifications before stopping.
   * To have notifications sent to a Slack channel, select **Notify a Slack or Microsoft Teams channel or chat**. Click **Connect Slack** and select a channel in which to receive [notifications](#get-monitor-notifications). A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Click **Continue**, then enter your workspace URL and sign in with your email or SSO.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If someone on your team created an [installed app](/docs/integrations/installed-apps/) for Slack, or [connected a Slack channel](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/slack-monitoring/), a message and green checkmark lets you know you're already authenticated with your Slack workspace.

   * **[Follow redirects](#manage-redirect-behavior)**
   * **[Enable SSL validation](#turn-off-ssl-validation)**

## Upload a data file

You can upload a data file to pass Postman sets of values to use during a monitor run. Postman substitutes the values for [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) in requests or scripts in the monitored collection. By uploading a data file, you can run your tests with multiple sets of values within a single monitor run.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about uploading data files and attaching files to monitors, see the [Monitor FAQs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/faqs-monitors/#can-i-upload-data-files-or-attach-files-to-a-monitor).
</Info>

Data files can be in CSV or JSON format and must use the following structure:

* **CSV** - The first row of the file must contain the variable names and one variable per column. Each following row is considered a data row, with values for each variable. Make sure all rows have the same number of columns and use a UNIX format line ending. Postman iterates through the data rows, running the monitored collection once for each data row in the file.

* **JSON** - The file must be formatted as an array of objects containing the key-value pairs you want to use as variables. For each pair, the key corresponds to a variable name, and the value is used for that variable when running the monitored collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **How do I use data variables in requests and scripts?** In requests (URLs, parameters, headers, authorization, and body), use double curly braces around your variable name, for example: `{{variable}}`. In pre-request scripts and post-response scripts, use `pm.iterationData` to access and manipulate variables. Learn more about [using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#using-variables) and [reference variables in Postman scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-variables/).
</Info>

## Run monitors

Under **Run**, choose if you'd like the monitor to run on a schedule or only run when triggered by the Postman CLI:

* Select **Scheduled**, then specify how often Postman runs the monitor. This can be as often as every five minutes for a status page, or a basic check once a week or month on your endpoints.
* Select **Postman CLI** to only run the monitor when triggered by the Postman CLI. This displays commands for installing the Postman CLI and running the monitor using its ID. You can use the Postman CLI to run monitors within your CI/CD pipeline, enabling your team to catch regressions and configuration issues using your Postman tests. Learn more about [running a monitor with the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-monitor/).

To learn how to use scheduled and on-demand monitors to continuously validate the health of your APIs, see [best practices for API observability](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/api-observability/) with Postman.

<Note>
  Only paid plans can schedule minute-based monitor runs. For Enterprise plans, you can schedule minute-based monitor runs to run every one minute.
</Note>

## Add regions and runners

Postman can automatically select a runner in a region where your monitor runs. You can manually select regions where your monitor runs. With [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/), you can also manually select runners an Admin set up in your internal network to monitor internal APIs. This is helpful if you want to monitor API health or performance across multiple geographic regions or networks.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Servers in each selected region or runner will run the monitor according to your schedule, counting towards your [monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/#view-monitor-usage).
</Info>

### Use static IPs

Static IPs are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans when you manually select a region. This option enables you to securely monitor private APIs using a direct channel to Postman. Learn how you can [monitor using static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/).

## Get monitor notifications

When configuring a monitor, you can choose to receive email, Slack, and Microsoft Teams notifications for monitor run failures and errors.

If you choose email notifications, you can add up to five email recipients to receive notifications. By default, Postman stops sending failure notifications after three consecutive failures. You can specify a different value if you want Postman to send more or fewer emails when a monitor fails. Once the monitor run succeeds, Postman sends an email notification to let you know the monitor has recovered. Note that if the number of monitor failures is less than the consecutive failure limit, you won't get a recovery email when the monitor is successful.

<img alt="Monitor summary email" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/monitor-summary-email.jpg" width="400px" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You'll receive daily and weekly summaries of your active monitors by email. If you want to opt out of daily or weekly summaries, click <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-notification-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notifications** in the Postman header and select <img alt="Manage icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-manage-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notification settings**.
</Info>

If you choose to connect a Slack channel or Microsoft Teams channel or group chat, you can select the relevant channel to send monitor run failure and error notifications. After you connect Slack or Microsoft Teams from a monitor, you'll get a confirmation in the selected channel that you're subscribed to notifications for that monitor. You can send notifications for every completed run, or for three consecutive failures and the first successful run after that. Learn more about [sending Postman Monitor results to Slack or Microsoft Teams](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#configure-a-monitor).

## Advanced settings

Select or specify advanced settings to configure your monitor.

### Use retry on failure

To run a monitor again after a failure or error, select the **Retry if run fails** option. When enabled, Postman automatically runs the failed request again. This can help to avoid false alarms due to transient issues. Postman logs the initial failure and alerts you if the run continues to fail.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Enabling this option may affect your [monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/#view-monitor-usage). For example, if a collection of three requests fails on the first request, but is successful on retrying, the run counts as four total requests.
</Info>

### Add request timeouts

You can choose to **Set request timeout** if you'd like to make sure all of your requests run within a certain amount of time. By default, each monitor run has a timeout of 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans). These timeout values apply to the entire monitor run, including all HTTP requests, responses, pre-request scripts, and post-response scripts.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  With Postman Free plans, monitor timeout can't exceed 10 minutes (600000 ms). With Postman paid plans, monitor timeout can't exceed 15 minutes (900000 ms)
</Info>

### Add delays before requests

Enabling **Set delay before requests** inserts a delay before each request in your collection. To configure the delay for individual requests, you can add a delay in your [pre-request or post-response scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) using `setTimeout()`.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  With Postman Free plans, the delay before requests can't exceed 10 minutes (600000 ms). With Postman paid plans, the delay before requests can't exceed 15 minutes (900000 ms). Note that these values are the same as the maximum runtime for a monitor.
</Info>

### Manage redirect behavior

The **Follow redirects** option is selected by default. This enables URL redirection for requests run by the monitor.

### Turn off SSL validation

The **Enable SSL validation** option is enabled by default. You can turn off SSL validation if you're using self-signed certificates and want to stop validations of SSL certificates. For more information, see [Working with certificates](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/) and [How to Troubleshoot SSL Certificate & Server Connection Issues](https://blog.postman.com/self-signed-ssl-certificate-troubleshooting/).

# Manage monitor usage in Postman

Postman provides tools to help you manage your team's monitor usage. Track the number of monitoring requests that have been made against your plan's monthly usage limit, and enable overages or purchase more blocks if needed. You can also view all of the monitors your team has created to make sure you're not exceeding monitor activity limits.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about the resources included with your Postman plan and what happens when you reach your usage limits, see [About resource usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/).
</Info>

## View monitor usage

The maximum number of monitoring API calls you can make each month depends on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To check your team's monitor usage, review the following dashboards:

* To check your team's current monitoring usage, select **Team > Resource Usage** to open the [**Resource usage** dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview).
* For a detailed breakdown of usage, click **View detailed usage** (next to **Monitoring Usage**) to view the [**Monitoring Usage** dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage/monitors).

The **Monitoring Usage** dashboard displays your team's current billing period, the number of monitoring APIs made, and which monitors have run. The dashboard also displays each monitor's name, status, creator, and number of requests sent.

![Monitoring usage details](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/monitoring-usage-details-v11-1.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Concerned about overages?** Go to your [Monitoring Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage/monitors) for a list of all of your team's active monitors in one place. You'll also find information to help you and your team make informed decisions on things like monitoring frequency. Learn more about [monitor overages](#enable-monitor-overages).
</Info>

## How Postman calculates monitor usage

Monitor usage is calculated based on the number of monitoring API calls:

* Running one request (that is, calling an API endpoint) in one region counts as one monitoring API call.
* If the collection used by the monitor has multiple requests, each request in the collection counts as one API call.
* If the monitor is scheduled to run in multiple regions, each request made in a different region counts as an API call.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you use the `pm.execution.setNextRequest()` function to [skip a request or run a request multiple times](/docs/collections/running-collections/building-workflows/), Postman adjusts monitor usage as necessary. Postman also counts any requests required for [authorization](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/).
</Info>

## Enable monitor overages

With a free Postman account, once you've reached your monthly usage limit, your monitors are automatically paused for the remainder of the billing period. To continue using monitoring for the remainder of the billing period, [upgrade your Postman plan](https://go.postman.co/purchase).

With a paid Postman account, you have the option to enable monitoring overages. Once you've reached your monthly usage limit, your monitors continue to run, and you are charged at a pay-as-you-go rate for each monitoring API call.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Overages are allowed by default for paid Postman accounts. To disallow overages, select **Team > Resource Usage** to open the [**Resource Usage** dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview), and then turn off **Pay-as-you-go** under **Monitoring Usage**.
</Info>

## Purchase monitoring blocks

Instead of paying for overages after reaching your monthly usage limit, you have the option to purchase more blocks of monitoring calls. Purchasing blocks may offer savings compared the pay-as-you-go rate, depending on the number of monitoring calls your team makes.

To purchase more monitoring call blocks, do the following:

1. Select **Team > Resource Usage**.
2. Click **View detailed usage** in the **Monitoring Usage** section to open the [**Monitoring Usage** dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage/monitors).
3. Click **Update usage plan**.
4. In the **Edit plan** dashboard, enter the number of blocks you want to purchase next to **50K monitoring requests**.
5. Click **Next**, review your changes, then click **Confirm Changes** to complete your purchase.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Unused monitoring calls or blocks expire at the end of the billing period and don't roll over to the next month.
</Info>

## Monitor activity limits

Postman maintains default limits on various team and user actions to ensure the overall performance and availability of monitoring. Postman will email your Admins if your team encounters these limits. In addition, team members will get an alert in Postman.

Postman maintains the following monitoring limits per team:

* Maximum number of active and paused monitors - 300
* Maximum parallel runs of all monitors - 500
* Maximum parallel runs of a single monitor - 200

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For help regarding these limits, contact the [Postman support team](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).

# Monitor internal APIs with runners

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Private API Monitoring is available with [Postman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To enable Private API Monitoring in your Enterprise team, contact your Postman Customer Success Manager.
</Info>

With Private API Monitoring, you can use runners to monitor and test your organization's APIs from your internal network, without publicly exposing your endpoints. Create a runner in your Postman team, then use the Postman CLI to set up the runner in your internal network.

Once set up, the runner securely polls Postman for monitor runs from your internal network, following your organization's internal routing and access controls. Monitors run in your runner in your internal network and the runner sends the test results to the Postman cloud.

## Configure a runner in your team

Create a runner to monitor and test your organization's internal APIs. You can create a runner when you configure a monitor. With a Postman Enterprise plan, you can also create a runner from **Runner** settings. Once you start the runner from your internal network, your teammates can select the runner when creating monitors and check the health and performance of internal APIs from Postman.

Learn more at [Configure runners for internal APIs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/configure-a-runner/).

## Set up a runner in your restricted network

Once you've created the runner in your team, use the Postman CLI to set up the runner in your internal network. Get started by learning how to start and configure the runner. To set up the runner in your cloud network, such as a virtual private cloud, you can learn how to containerize the runner using Docker.

Learn more at [Set up a runner in your restricted network](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/set-up-a-runner-in-your-network/).

## Configure a runner to use a proxy server

For extra governance and security, you can configure your runner to use a proxy server that routes traffic and evaluates requests from the runner. If your organization has an existing proxy server, you can specify its URL when you start the runner. You can also use the built-in proxy server if you don't want to create and maintain your own. To use the built-in proxy server, you only need to set up an authorization service with rules that decide which requests from the runner are allowed or blocked. If your proxy service or authorization service require custom CA certificates, you can also specify the path to the file.

Learn more at [Set up a runner to use a proxy server](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/runners-proxy-server/).

## Manage runners in your team

View and manage all of your team's runners when you configure a monitor. You can view the commands for starting the runner with the Postman CLI, update your runners, delete runners you no longer need, and more. With a Postman Enterprise plan, you can also manage runners from **Runner** settings where you can view more details about your runners, like their health status.

Learn more at [Manage runners for internal APIs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/manage-runners/).

Set up a runner in your internal network to monitor your organization's internal APIs and send the test results to Postman. To get started, you can learn how to [start the runner](#start-a-runner). Then you can learn how to [containerize the runner using Docker](#start-a-runner-in-your-cloud-network) when you're ready to set up the runner in your cloud network, like a virtual private cloud.

## How a runner works

Once set up and running in your internal network, the runner works in the background to poll Postman for upcoming monitor runs. Postman recommends installing the Postman CLI and starting the runner on a stable machine in the same internal network as the internal APIs you want to monitor.

Postman identifies a runner using its ID, and a runner uses the ID and key to authenticate with Postman. Any runner started through the Postman CLI using the same ID and key is an *instance* of that runner. Each instance runs in the background, increasing the number of pollers available to run the monitor. Learn how to [scale your runner instances](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/scale-runners/).

When a monitor runs in your internal network, the following happens:

1. The Postman CLI fetches the monitor run configuration with relevant Postman elements, like the associated collection and environment, from the Postman cloud.
2. The collection's tests run in your internal network.
3. The Postman CLI sends the test results back to the Postman cloud, making them available in the [monitor results](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/).

For extra governance and security, you can configure the runner to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic generated during monitor runs through a proxy server that enforces outbound request policies. This is useful for inspecting traffic from the runner and ensuring the runner only communicates with approved destinations.

You can specify an [external proxy server](#external-proxy-server) URL your organization already uses. Or you can use the [built-in proxy server](#built-in-proxy-server) with a runner authorization service you've configured to decide which requests from the runner are allowed or blocked. If required by your external proxy server or runner authorization service, you can [add custom CA certificates](#custom-ca-certificates). Learn how to [start a runner with the built-in proxy server](#start-a-runner-with-the-built-in-proxy-server).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about the [`postman runner start` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#postman-runner-start) and its supported options.
</Info>

## External proxy server

You can use your organization's existing external proxy server to route and inspect outbound traffic. Use the `--proxy` option to specify the external proxy server URL.

```bash
postman runner start --proxy <proxy-url> --id <runner-id> --key <runner-key>
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Instead of specifying the `--proxy` option, you can define the proxy server URL using the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.
</Info>

## Built-in proxy server

You can use the built-in proxy server to route and inspect outbound traffic using rules defined in your runner authorization service. First, you need to set up a runner authorization service with rules that decide which requests from the runner are allowed or blocked. Learn how to [create a runner authorization service and start the runner with the built-in proxy](#start-a-runner-with-the-built-in-proxy-server).

Once the authorization service is running, start the runner with the Postman CLI and use the `--egress-proxy` option to enable the built-in proxy server. Also use the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option to specify the URL for the runner authorization service.

```bash
postman runner start --egress-proxy --egress-proxy-authz-url <authorization-service-url> --id <runner-id> --key <runner-key>
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Instead of specifying the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option, you can define the runner authorization service URL using the `POSTMAN_RUNNER_AUTHZ_URL` environment variable.
</Info>

When the built-in proxy is enabled, the following happens:

* The runner routes all outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the built-in proxy.
* For each outbound request, the proxy references a runner authorization service that determines if the request is allowed or blocked.
* The proxy only forwards approved requests to their final destination.
* All traffic remains end-to-end encrypted, including HTTPS traffic. The proxy inspects outbound traffic and enforces policies defined by your runner authorization service.

## Custom CA certificates

You can specify custom CA certificates if your external proxy server or runner authorization service require them. Use the `--ssl-extra-ca-certs` option to specify a path to the file in PEM format. Note that the PEM file can have multiple certificates.

```bash
postman runner start --ssl-extra-ca-certs <path-to-pem-file> --proxy <proxy-url> --id <runner-id> --key <runner-key>
```

## Start a runner with the built-in proxy server

Use the following examples to start a runner with the built-in proxy server. First create a [runner authorization service API](#runner-authorization-service-api) with a `POST /validate` endpoint that validates outbound requests, using the specified JSON request and response format. [Create a runner authorization service](#create-a-runner-authorization-service) with rules that decide which requests from the runner are allowed or blocked. Then you can [start a runner](#start-a-runner) or [containerize a runner using Docker](#start-a-runner-in-your-cloud-network) in your cloud network, such as a virtual private cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the Postman CLI to trigger monitor runs for internal APIs within your CI/CD pipeline.

Learn more about [running a monitor with the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-monitor/).
</Info>

### Runner authorization service API

Create a runner authorization service API that exposes a `POST /validate` endpoint. The [built-in proxy server](#built-in-proxy-server) calls the endpoint to validate outbound requests from the runner. The runner makes HTTP requests to the runner authorization service based on the URL you specify using the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option.

Requests to the runner authorization service must send a JSON payload in the following format:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/api/endpoint?param=value",
  "queryParams": "param1=value1&param2=value2",
  "body": "request body content as string",
  "headers": "{\"content-type\":\"application/json\",\"x-pstmn-outbound-identifier\":\"c9-post\"}",
  "method": "POST"
}
```

| Field         | Details                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | (Required) Specify the destination URL.                               |
| `queryParams` | Specify query parameters.                                             |
| `body`        | Specify request body content.                                         |
| `headers`     | (Required) Specify the JSON-encoded string with request headers.      |
| `method`      | (Required) Specify the HTTP method (such as, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). |

Responses from the runner authorization service must return a JSON response in the following format:

```json
{
  "allowed": true

### Create a runner authorization service

Use the following example code to create and deploy your own runner authorization service in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) (v18 or later) with Express. You can implement the runner authorization service using any technology stack and deploy it however you prefer. The only requirement is that the runner authorization service API exposes a `POST /validate` endpoint using the specified JSON request and response format. Before you start a runner, the runner authorization service must be deployed and running.

1. Use the following JavaScript code example to create your own runner authorization service with rules that decide which requests are allowed or blocked.

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env node
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   const PORT = process.env.AUTH_SERVER_PORT || 8080;

   /**
   * Evaluates whether a request from the runner is allowed.
   * Customize with your authorization logic based on: url, method, headers, body, queryParams
   */
   function evaluateRequest({ url, method }) {
   try {
       console.info('Evaluating authorization request');
       const hostname = new URL(url).hostname;
       const pathname = new URL(url).pathname;

       // Block unsafe methods
       if (["DELETE", "PUT", "PATCH"].includes(method)) {
       console.warn(`Blocked unsafe method: ${method}`);
       return false;
       }

       // Block: Admin paths
       if (pathname.includes("/admin") || pathname.includes("/internal")) {
       console.warn(`Blocked sensitive path: ${method} ${hostname}`);
       return false;
       }

       // Add more policies here

       // Consider blocking by default in production
       console.info(`Request allowed: ${method} ${hostname}`);
       return true;
   } catch {
       return false;
   }
   }

   app.post("/validate", (req, res) => {
   if (!req.body?.url || !req.body?.method) {
       return res.status(400).json({ allowed: false });
   }

   const allowed = evaluateRequest(req.body);
   res.status(allowed ? 200 : 403).json({ allowed });
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () =>
   console.log(`Runner authorization service on port ${PORT}`)
   );
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the runner authorization service:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. Run the runner authorization service:

   ```bash
   node <path-to-authorization-service-file>
   ```

Once the service is running, you can [start a runner](#start-a-runner) with the built-in proxy server or [containerize a runner using Docker](#start-a-runner-in-your-cloud-network) in your cloud network. Use the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option to specify the runner authorization service URL, such as `http://localhost:8080`.

### Start a runner

To start a runner, install the Postman CLI and then use the `postman runner start` command to begin polling Postman for monitor runs. To start the runner with the [built-in proxy server](#built-in-proxy-server), use the `--egress-proxy` option that enables the built-in proxy server and the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` option for specifying the URL for the [runner authorization service](#create-a-runner-authorization-service).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also learn how to [containerize a runner using Docker](#start-a-runner-in-your-cloud-network) in your cloud network.
</Info>

1. [Install the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-installation/). You can run the following command to install the Postman CLI using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g postman-cli
   ```

2. Run the Postman CLI `runner` command with the runner ID, key, and authorization service URL.

   ```bash
   postman runner start --egress-proxy --egress-proxy-authz-url <authorization-service-url> --id <runner-id> --key <runner-key>
   ```

   In this example, the value of `<authorization-service-url>` is the root URL of the authorization service, such as `http://localhost:8080`.

### Start a runner in your cloud network

Use the following example Dockerfile to create your own that installs the Postman CLI and starts the runner with the `postman runner start` command. The example includes the `--egress-proxy` option that enables the [built-in proxy server](#built-in-proxy-server) and the `--egress-proxy-authz-url` for specifying the URL for the [runner authorization service](#create-a-runner-authorization-service). This example shows best practices for running the runner in a containerized environment.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also learn how to [start the runner from your machine](#start-a-runner) with the built-in proxy server.
</Info>

1. Use the following example Dockerfile to install the latest version of the Postman CLI, start the runner with the built-in proxy server enabled, and specify the runner authorization service URL:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:22-bookworm-slim

   # Install CA certificates for SSL/TLS connections and curl for health checks
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   # Install Postman CLI
   RUN npm install -g postman-cli

   # Set working directory for runner
   WORKDIR /app

   # Create non-root user and set up directories
   # The directory permissions ensure the runner can write logs and cache data
   RUN groupadd --system --gid 1001 postman && \
       useradd --system --uid 1001 --gid postman --home-dir /app postman && \
       mkdir -p /.postman/logs \
               /app/.postman/logs \
               /app/.postman/cli \
               /app/.postman-runner-proxy-ca && \
       chown -R postman:postman /app && \
       chown -R postman:postman /.postman && \
       chmod -R 777 /.postman && \
       chmod -R 777 /app/.postman-runner-proxy-ca

   # Switch to non-root user for security
   USER postman

   # Start the Postman runner with the built-in proxy enabled
   CMD ["sh", "-c", "postman runner start --id ${POSTMAN_RUNNER_ID} --key ${POSTMAN_RUNNER_KEY} --egress-proxy --egress-proxy-authz-url ${AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE_URL}"]
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Learn more about [installing the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-installation/) and the [`postman runner start` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#postman-runner-start) to help you configure your Dockerfile.
   </Info>

2. Build an image using your Dockerfile. Tag the image with "postman-runner".

   ```bash
   docker build -t postman-runner .
   ```

3. Run the container using the image tagged with “postman-runner”. Provide the runner ID, key, and [authorization service](#create-a-runner-authorization-service) URL.

   ```bash
     docker run --rm \
     -e POSTMAN_RUNNER_ID="<runner-id>" \
     -e POSTMAN_RUNNER_KEY="<runner-key>" \
     -e AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE_URL="<authorization-service-url>" \
     postman-runner
   ```

   In this example, the value of `<authorization-service-url>` is the root URL of the authorization service, such as `http://localhost:8080`.

Docker containers can't use `localhost` to reach authorization services on your computer. If your authorization service is running on your computer (not in the same Docker container), use the following hosts depending on your platform. Replace `8080` with your authorization service's port number.

* **Mac/Windows:** `http://host.docker.internal:8080`
* **Linux:** `http://172.17.0.1:8080` (The default gateway IP address for a bridge network. Your gateway IP address may vary based on your network's configuration.)

For more information and the latest recommended approaches, see [Docker's networking documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/faqs/general/#how-do-i-connect-from-a-container-to-a-service-on-the-host).

# Scale runners in your restricted network

<Info class="iconless-callout">

</Info>

Properly scaling runners in your internal network helps keep them reliable and available. Because runners poll Postman for monitor runs, under-provisioning can cause delays while over-provisioning can increase costs. Using metrics, such as the number and age of monitors waiting to run, can help you scale your runners appropriately and maintain consistent performance.

## About scaling runners

Postman identifies a runner by its ID, and the runner uses its ID and key to authenticate with Postman. Any runner [started through the Postman CLI](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/set-up-a-runner-in-your-network/) using the same ID and key is an *instance* of that runner. Each instance runs in the background and polls Postman for monitor runs.

Increase or decrease the number of runner instances to change the number of pollers available to run monitors. To determine whether you need to scale a runner, you can use the following metrics:

* **Current jobs in queue** - This metric returns the number of monitors waiting to run in the runner. For example, if there are usually around zero monitors waiting to run, this could indicate that runner instances are often inactive. You may want to remove runner instances in this scenario because you may have more than you need.
* **Oldest queued job age** - This metric returns the oldest age of the monitor (in seconds) that's been waiting the longest to run in the runner. For example, if the age of the monitor keeps increasing, this could indicate monitors are waiting longer than expected to run. You may want to add more runner instances in this scenario to allow more monitors to run in parallel.

If you’re a Team Admin on a Postman Enterprise plan, you can view all runner instances and their detailed metrics from [**Runner** settings](#get-runner-metrics-from-runner-settings) or [use the Postman API](#get-runner-metrics-using-the-postman-api).

You can also [autoscale your runners with the Postman API](#autoscale-runners-using-the-postman-api) using an orchestration system, such as Kubernetes, to maintain consistent performance in real time.

## Get runner metrics from Runner settings

## Get runner metrics using the Postman API

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Runners API is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) only.
</Info>

Use the Postman API's [Runners API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/i540q3m/runners) to list runner instances and get metrics you can use to scale runners. To learn more about the Postman API, see [Integrate Postman into your development toolchain](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/).

Use the GET `/runners/{runnerId}/instances` endpoint to list all instances for a runner. The response includes details for each instance, such as the last time it sent results to the Postman cloud.

Use the GET `/runners/{runnerId}/metrics` endpoint to get metrics to help you scale your runner. Metrics include the number (`queueDepth`) and age (`oldestQueuedRunAgeSecond`) of monitors waiting to run.

<Tip title="Tip">
  To learn how to get a runner ID, see [Manage runners for internal APIs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/manage-runners/).
</Tip>

## Autoscale runners using the Postman API

With the Postman API's [Runners API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/i540q3m/runners), you can use the `GET /metrics` endpoint to get metrics like the number and age of monitors waiting to run. You can use these metrics with an orchestration system, such as Kubernetes, to autoscale your runners appropriately and maintain consistent performance in real time.

<Note title="Note">
  Requests to this API aren't billed.
</Note>

By default, the `GET /metrics` endpoint returns the response in JSON format. You can add the `Accept: text/plain` header to return the response in the [Prometheus exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/om/open_metrics_spec/). This can be scraped by Prometheus and other monitoring systems that support this format.

Example `GET /metrics` endpoint response in Prometheus exposition format:

```plaintext
# HELP last_ping_at Timestamp of the last heartbeat received from any instance of this runner in seconds since Unix epoch
# TYPE last_ping_at gauge
last_ping_at{runnerId="<runner-id>"} 1767903119 1767903122
# HELP queue_depth Number of jobs (runs) currently queued for this runner
# TYPE queue_depth gauge
queue_depth{runnerId="<runner-id>"} 3 1767903122
# HELP oldest_queued_run_age_seconds Age in seconds of the oldest job (run) present in the queue for this runner
# TYPE oldest_queued_run_age_seconds gauge
oldest_queued_run_age_seconds{runnerId="<runner-id>"} 52 1767903122
```

In an orchestration system, use an autoscaling component to consume these metrics and scale your runners in real time. For example, if you're using Kubernetes as your orchestration system, you can use these metrics with [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) or [KEDA](https://keda.sh/docs/2.18/scalers/metrics-api/).


# Troubleshoot runners in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Private API Monitoring is available with [Postman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To enable Private API Monitoring in your Enterprise team, contact your Postman Customer Success Manager.
</Info>

If you experience an issue with a runner, the following troubleshooting steps may help you identify and resolve the issue.

## Authentication error in the Postman CLI

If the Postman CLI returns an authentication error, make sure you have the correct runner ID and key. Learn how to [view the runner ID](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/manage-runners/). You may need to [reset your runner key](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/manage-runners/#reset-a-runner-key) if you didn't store it in a secure location for later.

Learn more about using the Postman CLI to [set up a runner in your internal network](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/set-up-a-runner-in-your-network/).

## Firewall blocks outgoing connections

If your organization operates behind a firewall, your IT team may need to allowlist the `*.postman.com` domain.

To learn more, see [Use Postman behind a firewall](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-postman-behind-a-firewall).

## The runner doesn't start

If a runner doesn't start in your internal network, verify the following:

* Confirm that the runner is correctly [set up](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/set-up-a-runner-in-your-network/) and running in your internal network.
* [Check your monitor's configuration](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/) to verify that the monitor is linked to the correct runner.
* Check that the machine hosting the runner is online and accessible.
* Confirm that the runner ID and key are correct. You may need to [reset your runner key](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/manage-runners/#reset-a-runner-key) if you didn't store it in a secure location.

If this didn't resolve your issue, contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).


# Configure Postman Monitors to run from static IPs

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Static IP address monitoring is available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Postman's static IP feature enables you to use [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/) to monitor APIs that are behind a restricted firewall. This feature requires your IT team to allowlist certain static IP addresses. The IPs to allowlist will depend on whether you have a [US Professional or Enterprise plan](#static-ip-address-monitoring-for-us-professional-and-enterprise-plans) or an [EU Data Residency plan](#static-ip-address-monitoring-for-eu-data-residency-plans). Each IP address will be fixed to its specified region and shared by all customers who use this feature.

<Note title="Note">
  With [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/), you can use runners and the Postman CLI to monitor and test your organization's APIs from your internal network, without publicly exposing your endpoints. Once set up, monitors run in your internal network and the runner sends the results to the Postman cloud.
</Note>

## Static IP address monitoring for US Professional and Enterprise plans

You can set up static IP address monitoring if you have a US-based Postman Professional or Enterprise plan. You can choose either or both of two IPs, one from the US (East) region and the other from the US (West) region.

### Allowlisting static IP addresses

Static IP addresses are available for US (East) and US (West) regions. Contact your IT team to allowlist the following IP addresses:

* US (East): `34.201.186.27`
* US (West): `52.89.173.88`

### Creating a new monitor to run from a static IP address

When [creating a new monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#create-a-monitor), choose the **Manually select region** option. Select your desired static IP regions, and then click **Create**.

## Static IP address monitoring for EU Data Residency plans

You can set up static IP address monitoring if you have a [Postman EU Data Residency](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-eu-data-residency/) plan, with static IPs located in the EU (Central) region.

### Allowlisting static IP addresses

Contact your IT team to allowlist the following IP addresses:

* EU (Central): `63.179.82.81`, `3.71.240.166`, `3.124.150.113`

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To correctly configure static IP address monitoring, you must allowlist all three IP addresses listed here.
</Info>

### Creating a new monitor to run from a static IP address

When [creating a new monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#create-a-monitor), choose the **Manually select region** option. Select your desired static IP regions, and then click **Create**.

## Next steps

After setting up a monitor for APIs that are behind a restricted firewall, you can set up an integration with other tools in your development workflow.

To learn how to set up integrations for your monitor results, see [Integrating with Postman](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/).


# Troubleshoot monitors in Postman

If you encounter a problem with a monitor, the following troubleshooting steps may help you identify and resolve the issue.

## View failed monitors

The [Console Log](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/#console-log) can help you debug issues you might encounter with your monitors.

1. Go to your workspace and click **Monitors** in the sidebar.
2. Select a monitor, and then select a failed monitor run in the performance graph.
3. Click **Console Log** to view monitor run details, along with any `console.log()` statements you included in your pre-request and post-response scripts.
4. (Optional) Click **Search console logs** and enter a search term like "error" or "failed". Matches are highlighted in the log. You can also click <img alt="Down Large icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down-large.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Next match** and <img alt="Up Large icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-up-large.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Previous match** to cycle through them.

![Failed monitor run Console log](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/monitor-console-log-failed-run-v11-75-2.png)

For more information on debugging with the Postman Console, see [Troubleshooting API requests](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

## Debug local run attempts

* Run the failing monitor's collection with its environment in Postman, the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/), or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) to see if it's working.
* If a local run passes, check that [sync](/docs/getting-started/basics/syncing/) is working by looking for the sync symbol on the left side of Postman's footer. This will ensure any local changes persist.

  <img alt="In sync" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/syncing-understanding-sync-states-v10-18.jpg" width="280px" />

## Debug variable issues

* Ensure that the same environment is used across local runs and monitor runs. To confirm, add `console.log(environment);` to your request scripts and compare the results across monitoring and local runs.
* Ensure that any collection or environment variables that your collection run depends on have been [shared](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values). Because they run in the Postman cloud, monitors can only use variables whose values have been shared. (Sharing syncs variable values to the Postman cloud.)
* If your collection run depends on a saved global variable, change it to an environment variable, and [share](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values) its value. Saved global variables aren't supported in monitors.

## Log relevant information

* Unexpected response bodies or header values can be a source of monitor issues. You can log these with the following code:

  ```js
  console.log(JSON.stringify(responseBody, null, 2));
  console.log(JSON.stringify(responseHeaders, null, 2));
  ```

## Uncaught errors

* Wrap suspicious code in a `try - catch` block to ensure test and pre-request scripts in your collection run to completion.


# Postman Monitors frequently asked questions

Following are frequently asked questions about configuring, running, updating, securing, and troubleshooting Postman Monitors.

## Monitor settings

### What can I test with monitors?

You can [write post-response scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/) for monitors to check for proper behavior, business logic, and error handling.

### How many monitors can I create?

There is no limit to the number of monitors you can create. You can have any number of collections, each with any number of monitors, and each monitor can run on a different schedule.

### How many regions can my monitor run in?

With paid plans, you can select one or more geographic regions to run your monitor in, or have Postman automatically select a region for you. If you are on a free plan, Postman always selects a region for you. To turn on manual region selection, [upgrade your Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're interested in a region that's not available when creating a monitor, contact the [Postman support team](https://www.postman.com/support/).
</Info>

### What time zone is my monitor set to?

Your monitor's time zone is automatically set to the time zone of your computer when you create the monitor.

## Monitor runs

### How long can a monitor run?

Monitors are limited to a maximum of 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans) for each run. All HTTP requests, responses, pre-request scripts, and post-response scripts must complete within the time limit or the monitor will time out.

### How do I persist variables between monitor runs?

You can't import existing global variables into a monitor, but you can create new global variables during a run. Global and environment variables can be updated and subsequently used during a monitoring run, however they'll revert to their original values. You can change this behavior and persist variable values by using the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/#6517e0d6-3bc3-3da5-ab57-7a578a8504ce) to update your environment each time your monitor runs.

### How many HTTP requests can a monitor send?

For monitors, there is no limit to the number of requests, but the total runtime can't exceed 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans).

### Can I run a request multiple times?

Monitors only run one iteration by default, but you can use `setNextRequest()` to run multiple iterations.

## Data handling

### How much data can a monitor send or receive?

There is no specific limit to the amount of data that can be sent or received per request. However, large requests or responses take longer to send and receive. Make sure that all requests can be completed within the time limit of 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans).

### Can I upload data files or attach files to a monitor?

You can upload a data file with sets of values to use as variable inputs when running the monitor, similar to the [collection runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/). Data files are limited to 1 MB in size and a maximum of 50 data rows (CSV) or 50 objects (JSON). Learn more about [uploading a data file for a monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#upload-a-data-file).

Because scheduled collection runs and monitors run in the Postman cloud, you can't attach form data or binary files to requests like you can in the [request builder](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#send-body-data-with-requests). Instead, you can add [raw data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#raw-data) on the request's **Body** tab to send JSON or other text data with the request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A monitor can also use files that can be retrieved by an API from cloud services such as Google Docs or Dropbox.
</Info>

## Monitor updates

### Can I move a monitor?

Monitors can't be moved between workspaces. If you move a collection out of the workspace where its associated monitor is located, the monitor is paused. To learn more, see [Moving elements to workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces).

### Can I delete a monitor?

You can delete a monitor at any time. Once deleted, all run history for the monitor is deleted too. If you want to retain the history, pause the monitor instead of deleting it.

## Privacy and security

### Are static IP addresses dedicated to individual customers or shared?

The provided static IP addresses are fixed to their specified region and shared by all customers who enable this feature, which is available to Postman Professional and Enterprise teams. For more information, see [Configure Postman Monitors to run from static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/).

### Who can see my monitors?

A monitor is visible to all users who have access to the workspace the monitor was created in. To learn more, see [Move elements to workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces).

### Who can edit my monitors?

Monitors can be edited in their respective workspace by members who have been granted [Editor permissions](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) on the monitor. To review or manage which team members have Editor or Viewer permissions on a specific monitor, open your workspace and click **Monitors** in the sidebar. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a monitor, and then select **Manage Roles**.

### Where do monitors run?

Monitors run on Postman's cloud infrastructure, which is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). More information about Postman's cloud infrastructure is available on the [Security overview](https://www.postman.com/trust/security/).

### Can monitors access restricted networks?

Monitors can't access restricted networks by default. You can use runners with [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/) to monitor internal APIs from your restricted network, like a virtual private cloud.

By default, Postman supports monitoring public APIs. All endpoints must be publicly available on the internet because monitors run in the Postman cloud. This means monitors can't directly access your `localhost` or run requests behind a firewall. Also, you can't monitor APIs that run on private networks, VPNs, or corporate intranets.

With Private API Monitoring, you can use runners and the Postman CLI to monitor and test internal APIs from your restricted network, without publicly exposing your endpoints. Once set up, monitors run in your restricted network and the runner sends the results to the Postman cloud.

You can also [use static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/) to monitor APIs behind a restricted firewall if you're on a [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

## Performance and troubleshooting

### Will monitors impact my API performance?

To limit the impact of monitor activity on your API, you can configure which of your API endpoints are called and how often they're called. Postman also restricts each monitor's total runtime to 10 minutes (Postman Free plans) or 15 minutes (Postman paid plans). This limits the number of requests the monitor can perform.

### How do I troubleshoot problems?

For monitors, you can view the full Postman Console output for every monitor run, including any errors. You can also use methods such as `console.log()` and `console.warn()` to output your own debugging information. You can use the `console.clear()` method to clear information from the Console. To learn more, see [Troubleshooting monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/troubleshooting-monitors/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For your security and privacy, Postman doesn't log request or response bodies in the Console. Postman also doesn't log headers, as they may include items like cookies and authorization keys.
</Info>


# Collaborate in Postman

Postman has a variety of features that enable you to [collaborate with your team and API consumers](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/). You can design and implement an API lifecycle, organize your team and work, communicate changes, and share your work internally and with the world. With these features, you can tailor your collaboration strategy to each project's specific goals.

<Note title="Note">
  If you have [Postman Organizations](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-org/) enabled, you can set up multiple teams within your organization to more seamlessly share between these teams.
</Note>

## Understand how teams and workflows function in Postman

You can collaborate on your APIs within [one or more teams](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/), across the entire company, or with partner companies. Implement collaboration workflows across different phases of the API development lifecycle, including prototyping, iterating, building, testing, deploying, and integrating with partners. Learn more about [Postman collaboration concepts](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-concepts/).

## Learn about Postman's collaboration features

Postman enables you to collaborate with your teammates and the Postman community by organizing, sharing, and communicating work to your APIs. Learn about [Postman's collaboration features](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/api-collaboration-features/).

## Organize your projects using workspaces

Workspaces enable you to collaborate with teammates or anyone in the Postman community. When you create a workspace, you can choose an empty workspace or use a workspace template to help you get started. You can also view changelogs for collections, workspaces, and APIs, enabling you to review actions taken on elements in your workspaces. Learn how you can [organize your projects using workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).

## Share your workspaces and elements

You can share your workspaces and elements with specific [team members and users who aren't part of your team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/). You can share with internal team members to your team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/), and share with your API consumers on the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

You can also [start a live session](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/live-sessions/) in an HTTP request to collaborate with your team in real time as you test, develop, and troubleshoot.

Super Admins and Community Managers can use the [Manage public elements dashboard](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/) to control which public workspaces, documentation, and collections are shared with external users.

## Define roles and permissions

You can define the [roles and permissions](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) assigned to team members at the team, workspace, and element levels. You can also define roles and permissions that relate to Partner Workspaces and your Private API Network.

Postman enables you to [organize team members into groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) that reflect your organization. Add users to a group, then assign that group roles and access to the resources they'll be using across Postman. This also enables you to efficiently onboard new team members by adding them to existing groups assigned relevant roles.

You can also [manage access to workspaces and elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) in your team.

## Build APIs using Postman's version control

You can [use Postman's version control](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/) to collaboratively build APIs with your team. This enables you and your team to fork a new instance of an element, make updates to the fork, create a pull request, and merge your changes into the parent element.


# Collaboration concepts

Postman simplifies and brings together the mechanics of API collaboration to help you interactively plan, develop, publish, and maintain APIs within your team, company, and across the planet. In this topic, you'll learn about the types of teams and workflows for internal and external API collaboration in Postman.

## Teams and collaboration levels

You can [collaborate in Postman internally](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/internal-api-collaboration/) within a single team, multiple teams, or an entire company. You can also open up your collaboration to partners and consumers of your APIs around the world through the Postman API Network. How you decide to set up your teams and collaboration levels will depend on your API strategy.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're new to Postman, try the no-cost entry to [collaboration features](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/api-collaboration-features/) with a [free](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) team of up to three members. To collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, you can [upgrade](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) to a Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan. When you're ready to scale your work, select **Upgrade** in the upper-right corner.
</Info>

To define your API strategy, it's important to do the following:

* Decide and assign the right role and access in your API collaboration space, whether it's at a workspace, element, flow, or another level.
* Enable your team members, guest users, partners, and consumers to work on and interact with a single source of truth for your APIs.

Learn more about [function-based role types](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and how to set them up in Postman. You can arrange users into [groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) that reflect your organizational structure. Users can [request Editor access](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) to workspaces and elements they initially can only view or try to access from a shared link, enabling you to assess and scale teams as needed.

## Collaboration workflows

Postman enables you to collaborate in units from single teams to multiple companies in different phases of the API development lifecycle:

* Prototype and iterate
* Build, test, and deploy
* Onboard and integrate with partners

Collaboration workflows apply across all three types of workspaces: [internal, partner, and public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/).

### Prototype and iterate

To begin API development, an engineering team can create a prototype collection in an [internal workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) with requests to represent the API to be built.

To prepare the collection for further iterations, the engineering team can do the following:

* Add [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to clarify responses and status codes.
* Add [descriptions](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) to explain how the API and each API endpoint works.
* Add [tags](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#tag-a-collection) to enable easier search.
* Set up a [mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) to generate a mock URL and simulate the API before it's production ready, instead of waiting for the implementation.

The team can then [fork the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) into another internal workspace and invite potential consumers to provide feedback.

When interacting with a prototype collection, the consumer team can do the following:

* Review the collection and leave feedback in the form of [comments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/).
* Simulate integrating the new API using the mock URL.
* Fork the collection and propose changes by editing the requests and responses and creating a pull request.

The changes the consumer team makes can be pulled back by the engineering team to update the original collection and iterate on the API. The team can then share changes to the collections using [workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/).

### Build, test, and deploy

Engineers use the collection as a reference to implement the API in code. As they write code, they continuously test and debug the API to ensure the API is working as expected.

Consumers can simultaneously integrate the API into their front-end application or their own service using mock servers.

QA teams can fork the collection to their testing workspace and write scripts for functional, regression, and end-to-end [testing](/docs/tests-and-scripts/test-apis/test-apis/). Next, they can validate tests manually by sending an individual request or, once the testing collection is set up, by running the tests in the [Collection Runner](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-manually/). Then, you can check the run report for failures.

DevOps teams can select collections and environments to be run as a part of the build. They can connect Postman to their own API workflows using [integrations with popular third-party solutions](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/). Integrations enable automatic sharing of data between Postman and the other tools that DevOps relies on for API development, such as GitHub, Slack, CircleCI, Amazon API Gateway, and New Relic.

For publicly accessible APIs, DevOps teams can [schedule runs](/docs/tests-and-scripts/run-tests/run-tests-on-schedule/) in sync with nightly builds to continuously ensure quality over a period of time.

### Integrate with partners

[Partner Workspaces](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) in Postman allow for direct collaboration with external partners, facilitating API consumption and joint API project work. This type of workspace helps to establish a central source of truth and integrates partner projects into the Postman team for efficient partnerships.

With [multi-partner mode](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/), you don't have to manage a separate workspace for each partner. If you want to share the same collections and API resources with multiple partners, you can invite partners to test APIs at a moment's notice. This enables you to showcase real-world workflows and maintain a reference workspace for API endpoints and documentation. Explore [Postman Best Practices for Partner Collaboration](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/partner-api-collaboration/) for additional guidance.


# API collaboration features in Postman

Postman collaboration features enable you to build your APIs as a team and collaborate on APIs with business partners and developers across the planet. With Postman's many API collaboration capabilities, you can organize, share, comment on, announce, and publish your work.

## Organize your APIs in workspaces

In Postman, [organize your API projects using workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) to group together related APIs, collections, environments, flows, and other elements. Work on your project in an internal workspace where your teammates can share their feedback and contribute. You can start a project in your own workspace and then change permissions to collaborate with others.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can work on your API project in a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) to collaborate with your external partners.
</Info>

API requests are grouped into [collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) in Postman. This enables you to organize related requests and workflows together. To begin organizing your requests into collections, [create a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#create-a-new-collection), then [add requests to your collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/). You can also [create a collection from a predefined template](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#create-a-collection-from-a-template) if you want help getting started.

Use the [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) to create and collaborate on API definitions in Postman. The API Builder enables you to connect your various Postman elements, such as collections and documentation, to your API definition. To begin organizing your API definition and Postman elements in your API, [create an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/creating-an-api/#create-an-api), [create](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-an-example-api-definition) or [import](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/) an API definition, then [add elements to your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/).

With [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/), you can add more details to your HTTP request parameters, headers, and body data to design your API with the Postman Collection format. Define types, such as data type and possible values, that describe your API. Types display in the collection's documentation. Adding more details to your collection can help others better understand your API and send valid API requests. You can also generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification in Spec Hub from a collection and keep them in sync.

[Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) enables you to create and collaborate on API specifications in Postman. Design your API's structure in an OpenAPI 3.0 or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification. To get started, create a new API specification or import an existing API specification. Then you can generate a collection from the API specification. When you make changes to the API specification, you can update the generated collection with your latest changes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about the [Postman elements](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/) you can use to organize and document an API project in your workspace.
</Info>

## Share your work with team members

You can [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces) team members or [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to your workspace and assign them [workspace roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles). If your teammates don't need Admin or Editor access for all elements in your workspace, you can assign them elevated permissions for [element-based roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles) only, such as collection or environment roles. Learn more about [managing access to workspaces and elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/).

You can [share Postman elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-postman-collections-and-other-elements) with team members in Postman or by sending team members a link to the element. You can also [share collections with guest users](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests) who aren't in your Postman team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [sharing collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#share-a-collection) and [sharing APIs](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/#share-apis) in Postman.
</Info>

## Comment on APIs

To enhance your team's collaboration, [use comments to collaborate](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/) on API projects in Postman. Discuss your work with teammates in comments to improve your API's design. Report issues with comments and fix issues others have encountered while using your APIs.

Use [global comments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/#global-comments) to share general feedback about a Postman element. Use [inline comments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/#inline-comments) to share feedback about specific items, such as text within a query parameter or code in a pre-request script.

You can reply to comments, and resolve comments that have been addressed. You can also mention a teammate in a comment to share questions or feedback with them.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn about [commenting on APIs](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/#commenting-on-apis) in the Postman API Builder.
</Info>

## Announce changes to your APIs

You can [post workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/) to keep your team aware of changes to your APIs. Workspace updates enable team members to respond and react to your posts, encouraging engagement in your workspace. In your update, you can add a title, a detailed description, links to related Postman elements, and more.

You can view changelogs for [collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/#use-the-changelog) and [APIs](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/#use-the-changelog) in your team. This enables you to view all the changes made by team members as you collaborate on your API projects. You can use the changelog to revert changes to a collection, and restore it to an earlier point in time.

To track who's making changes to your team and its elements, you can view and filter your team's [workspace activity feed](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#view-workspace-activity). If you'd like to automatically share activity feed updates through your organization's communication tool, you can integrate Postman with [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) or [Microsoft Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/).

## Publish your APIs to teammates or consumers

Publish APIs internally to your team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/) to collaborate with your Postman teammates. This enables your teammates to discover and contribute to your team's workspaces, APIs, and collections all in one place. Learn how to [add elements to your team's Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/).

Publish APIs to the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/) to share and collaborate with the Postman community. Learn more about the [benefits of the Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/#benefits-of-the-postman-api-network). To publish to the Postman API Network, [create a public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#create-a-public-workspace) with the elements you want to share. You can also [convert an existing workspace to a public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#convert-an-existing-workspace-to-a-public-workspace).

Your teammates and API consumers can build on and contribute to your APIs using [Postman's version control](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/). Collaborators can [fork collections and environments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) to their own workspace. They can also [clone flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/clone-flows/) to their own workspace. They can build on forked elements in their own workspace, or [create a pull request](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/) to contribute to your public collections and environments.


# Collaborate with your team in Postman

Collaborate with others in Postman using internal workspaces. You can [find a team](#find-teams-within-your-organization) within your organization or [join by other means](#join-a-team) enabled by your organization. If you sign up for a Postman free plan as an individual user, you can create a team during Postman onboarding or later, where up to three users can work together at no cost.

<Note title="Note">
  For more information about creating teams, see [Sign up for Postman](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/) and [Create a team in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/).
</Note>

When you join a team in Postman, you can either move your workspaces and transfer ownership to the team or keep your workspaces separate and maintain ownership in your account.

The decision to join a team affects your account in the following ways:

* When you move your workspaces to a team, your account will no longer exist. You'll have the option to switch between teams, rather than work in an account.
* When you keep your workspaces, you'll retain your account. You can switch between the team and your account at any time.

In certain cases, your workspaces and the data within them automatically transfer when you join a team. For more information, see [Join a team](#join-a-team).

When you [leave a team](#leave-a-team), a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/account/overview/) is created for you, if you don't already have one. If you're deactivated through [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) but are a member of other teams, you'll keep access to your account and other teams to which you belong. If you aren't a member of any other team and don't have an account, you won't be able to authenticate and will need to [contact support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

## Find teams within your organization

When you first join Postman using your company email address on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan, Postman lists the teams you can join within your organization. Select **Show More** to see the full list of teams.

![Join a team from your organization](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/join-team-discovery-v10.15.jpg)

Thereafter, your Postman homepage will show discoverable teams you can join. Select **View all teams** to see the full list of teams.

<img alt="Join a team from your homepage" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/join-team-discovery-homepage-v11.28.jpg" width="298" />

You can also view all discoverable teams from your profile settings, under **Teams**.

<img alt="Discover teams in your profile settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/discoverable-teams-v11.28.jpg" />

Select **Join** next to a team. If an Admin has set a mandatory question, answer the question and select **Submit**.

<img alt="Request to join team" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/request-to-join-team-team-discovery-v11.28.jpg" />

When the Admins approve your request, you'll be able to access the team and collaborate on API projects within it.

## Join a team

There are several ways you can join a Postman team:

* **Email invite** - Select **Join Team** in the email invite. Create a new Postman account or sign in to an existing one. After signing in, you'll be redirected to your new team.
* **Invite link** - Open the link and select **Accept Invite**. Create a new Postman account or sign in to an existing one. After signing in, you'll be redirected to your new team.
* **Team discovery** - You can [find teams to join within your organization](#find-teams-within-your-organization).
* **Team Request for Access (RFA)** - If you access a link to a resource (for example, a collection or request) from a team you aren't a member of, you can select to request access to that team. An Admin will need to approve your request. If enabled in the team settings on Free, Basic, and Professional plans, you can automatically join a team using a shared link. For more information, see [Manage team access through shared resources](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/#manage-team-access-through-shared-resources).
* **SSO automatic provisioning** - If a team in your organization has [automatic provisioning](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/#automatically-add-new-users) enabled in their SSO configuration, you can join the team by [signing in to Postman with SSO](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/).
* **SCIM provisioning** - If your organization has enabled [SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), you may be added to your organization's Postman team and receive an email invite. Select **Join Team** in the email and [sign in to Postman with SSO](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/).
* **Domain capture** - If your organization has configured [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) and you use or create an account associated with a verified domain, Postman will [notify](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/#user-experience) you when you next sign in that your account is managed by your organization.

You can be a member of up to ten Postman teams, regardless of whether they're on the free, Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan. However, if an Enterprise team within your organization implements domain capture, you won't be able to remain on or join extra Postman teams with your captured accounts.

If you have an account and join a team, you can choose to transfer your workspaces and the data within them to the team or keep them separate. In the following cases, your workspaces and the data within them automatically transfer when you join a team:

* If you [request to join a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team) and are approved by an Admin.
* If the team has [SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) enabled.
* If the team has [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) enabled.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you join an Enterprise team, [Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) have access to all workspaces you transfer over and any you create within the team moving forward.
</Info>

When you leave a team, your workspaces within the team and their data will remain with the team and no longer be available to you in some situations. See [Leave a team](#leave-a-team) for details. Workspaces in a team refers to workspace visibility and not data ownership.

## Switch between teams

If you belong to multiple teams, you can sign in to them at the same time with your Postman account. To switch between teams, select your avatar in the top right. Select a team to open.

<img alt="Switch teams" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/team-account-switcher-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

If you're a member of two or more teams, you can also select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create Team** to create a new team.

If you have an account, switch to it by selecting your avatar in the top right. Then select your avatar and username labeled **Individual**.

<img alt="Switch accounts" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/individual-account-switcher-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

## Leave a team

You can leave a Postman team by selecting your avatar in the top right, then **Settings**. Select **Teams** on the left.

Select **Leave** to the right of a team to leave it. If you're a member of an Enterprise team that has [SCIM configured](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), you must contact an Admin to remove you from the team.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/dashboard-teams-leave-team-v11.67.png" alt="Leave team" width="505" />

When you leave a team, you no longer have access to the team's workspaces or any of the elements in them. However, you can keep any workspaces you created for your access only in a new team that'll be created for you. If you don't have an individual non-team account, then an individual non-team account is created for you.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/leave-team-personal-v11.67.png" alt="Keep personal workspaces after you leave team" width="505" />

If you're a member of an Enterprise team, you must reassign your team workspaces to a remaining team member before leaving.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  An account isn't associated with a team, and only you can access it. To access your account, see [Switch between teams](#switch-between-teams).
</Info>

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/leave-team-confirmation-v11.67.png" alt="Leave and reassign personal workspaces" width="280" />

If you were on a Free, Basic, or Professional team, and you don't have an account, when you leave a team, you can choose to move your workspaces and the associated data to a new account.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/leave-team-keep-personal-data-confirmation-v11.67.png" alt="Leave team and keep personal data" width="280" />

If you're the last member to leave a team, the team will be deleted. You'll no longer have access to the team's workspaces, including workspaces set to be accessed by you only, or any elements in them. Admins or Super Admins can [export a data dump](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) prior to leaving the team to retain the data.


# Request and approve access to Postman resources

This topic provides an overview of managing access to Postman workspaces, the elements they contain, and team membership when links to resources are shared outside the team. It covers requesting access and managing permissions within internal workspaces. Using this guide, both users and workspace administrators can control access to workspaces for secure collaboration across teams.

## Request Editor access

To edit a workspace or its elements, users can request Editor access from a team member with Admin access for the workspace or Editor access for an element. If they have the [Slack integration enabled](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/), users can request access through a Slack message they receive when an element is shared with them.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Slack request for access** If the users request access to an element that resides in a workspace from a team they aren't part of, they'll need to request access twice: the first time they'll be directed to request team access, and the second time to request workspace access.
</Info>

To learn more about the roles and types of access, see [Define roles and permissions within a Postman team](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/). You can also learn more about [viewing a collection as a Guest](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Roles and permissions depend on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

### Request Editor access to a workspace

To request Editor access to a workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace overview, then select **Request to Edit** in the upper-right corner. You can also request access when you try to create an element in the workspace by selecting <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new** in the left sidebar.

2. Add a note to the Workspace Admins.

3. Select **Request Access**.

   <img alt="Request workspace editor role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/request-workspace-editor-role-v11.jpg" width="100px" />

Workspace Admins receive an in-app and email notification detailing your request. If team [auto-join](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#enable-automatic-joining-for-team-discovery) is enabled, users will automatically get access to the workspace. When your request is [approved or denied](#approve-requests-for-access), you're notified in-app and by email of their response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you have [personal notifications enabled for Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/slack-notifications/).
</Info>

### Request access to a restricted workspace

A *restricted workspace* is a workspace that's only visible to the user who created it and team members who've been invited to join it. Restricted workspaces enable teams to restrict access to elements that are relevant only to a particular group.

To collaborate in a restricted workspace, a workspace Editor or Admin must [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces) you. You can also request access to a workspace and get approved. If you're using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app), you can navigate to a link a teammate has shared to a restricted workspace or an element within one. There, you'll have the option to request access to the workspace.

<img alt="Request access to restricted workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/user-rfa-private-workspace-v9.16.jpg" />

You can add a note and select **Request Access** to submit the request. All Workspace Admins will receive a notification to review your request, and you'll be alerted in <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-notification-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notifications** and by email when your request is approved or denied.

  If your request isn't reviewed within 15 days, it'll expire, and you'll be notified in Postman and by email to resubmit your request for access.
</Info>

### Request Editor access to a collection as a Guest

You can request Editor access to a collection if you're a [Guest who is allowed to view the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests). When you get Editor access to a collection, your [team role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) also changes from the Guest role to the Developer role. This team role change adds you to the team and gives you access to all team resources and workspaces.

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Select the collection.
3. Select **Request to Edit**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to give a Guest user Editor access to a collection.
</Info>

Postman sends in-app and email notifications to team members with Editor access to the collection.

## Approve requests for access

If you're a workspace Admin or an Editor of an element, you receive access requests.

### Approve Editor access

When a teammate requests Editor access for an API, collection, environment, mock server, or monitor, you'll receive an in-app and email notification that details the request. Select **Approve Request** if you want to give your teammate Editor access to the collection, API, environment, mock server, or monitor. If you don't want to give Editor access, you can ignore the request. The request will expire after 30 days.

When a teammate requests Editor access for a workspace, you'll receive an in-app and email notification detailing the request. Select **Respond to Request** to open the workspace settings. You can select the role you'd like to give the user, then **Approve** or **Deny** the request.

### Approve requests for access to restricted workspaces

Team members can request access to a restricted workspace if another user with access provides them with a link to it. All workspace Admins are notified of requests for access in <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-notification-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notifications** and by email. Select **Respond to Request** to review requests for access.

<img alt="Respond to request for access to restricted workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-admin-respond-rfa-private-workspace-v11.jpg" />

You can assign a [workspace role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to define a user's permissions within the workspace, then select **Approve** to grant them access. You can also choose to reject a request for access by selecting **Deny**. Team members who have requested access are notified of your decision in Postman and by email.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Requests for access to restricted workspaces expire if they aren't reviewed within 15 days. If this occurs, Postman alerts the affected users to resubmit their request for access.
</Info>

## Manage team access through shared resources

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can invite collaborators, remove existing team members, and update user roles at any time in your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). For more information, see [Manage team members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/overview/) and [Configure team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/).
</Info>

You can share collections and other elements with your team and users who aren't part of your team. By default, when you share a link with someone who isn't part of their team, they're prompted to request to join the team.

Upon approval, the new team member is assigned a Developer role.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have available seats or Auto-Flex enabled to invite more team members. If your team has SSO enabled, users who aren't part of your team will be required to sign in using your team's SSO.

# Share your work in Postman

Postman enables you to [collaboratively iterate on your APIs](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-collaboration/) with developers, testers, architects, and other business stakeholders. You can share your work in Postman by sharing your workspace. You can also share individual Postman elements including collections, requests, examples, and [flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/).

## Share your Postman workspace

You can share a workspace using the **Invite** option or copying a link to your workspace. For more information, go to [Share workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces).

To share your work with external partners, use a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/). If you want to share your work with developers globally, use a [public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/).

## Share Postman collections and other elements

You can share your collections, APIs, flows, and environments with and outside your team and enable [Guests who are part of your organization](#share-collections-with-guests) to view your collections.

Other Postman elements are shared differently:

* To share a flow, refer to [Share links to flows and embed flows in websites](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/organize/share-and-embed-flows/).
* To share a collection run, refer to [Test your API using the Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

## Share a request with its response

[Share a link](#share-a-request-and-its-response-with-collaborators) to an HTTP request and its response with your team members or external partners. You can also share a previous response from the request's history. To share a response, open a request and send it, then copy the link to the response. Others can use the link to [view the same response you're getting](#view-a-shared-request-and-its-response), along with the request configuration. If collaborators no longer need access to the shared response, you can [stop sharing the link](#manage-a-shared-request-and-its-response).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can share responses for HTTP requests that were created on October 7, 2024, and later. You can't share responses for HTTP requests created before this date.
</Info>

Response sharing is useful for sharing a working example with your collaborators and debugging your request with help from others. You can also share an unexpected response with collaborators to report issues you experience.

To share a response, the HTTP request must be in an internal or a Partner Workspace that collaborators you're sharing with can access. Postman doesn't support sharing a request and its response from public workspaces. Also, partners in [Partner Workspaces with multi-partner mode enabled](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/) won't be able to share a request and its response.

If you install the [Postman app for Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/slack-app/) or [Postman app in Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/), links for HTTP responses you share in Slack or Teams will display extra information such as the request URL and response code. Only HTTP responses shared from unrestricted workspaces will display the response body.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Notes:**

  * If the response returns sensitive data, it will be visible to collaborators you share with. Make sure to consider the sensitivity of data returned in a response when deciding which collaborators you share with. Postman recommends checking your organization's policies to understand what qualifies as sensitive data.

  * By default, responses in your request's history are only visible to you. Collaborators in an internal or a Partner Workspace can only view [responses you've shared](#share-a-request-and-its-response-with-collaborators) with them.
</Info>

### Share a request and its response with collaborators

After sending an HTTP request, you can share the current response with others, along with the request configuration. If the request isn't already saved to a collection, you'll be prompted to do so. You can also share a previous response from the request's history, as long as [saving responses](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#saving-responses-in-history) was turned on at the time the request was sent.

To share the current response from the request, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar, and open an HTTP request.

2. Select **Send** to send the request, then view its response.

3. Select <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy link** in the response area. This copies the link to your clipboard, and the **Shared** tag displays.

   ![Share the current request and response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/share-current-request-v11.23b.jpg)

4. Share the link with a collaborator who has permission to access the request.

To share a previous response from the request's history, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar, and open an HTTP request.

2. Select <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **History** in the response area. This displays a dropdown list of each date and time you previously sent the request and the response status code that was returned. Hover over each item to view the request method and URL.

3. Select a response from the dropdown list to view it and the request configuration.

## Share collections with Guests

Collection Editors can enable Guests who aren't in your Postman team to view a collection and send requests. You must have the Editor role in the collection you want to share with Guests. Guests must be able to SSO into the team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on an Enterprise team, [Admins and Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can enable or prohibit Collection Editors from [sharing collections with Guests](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#manage-collections) in internal workspaces.
</Info>

Once you enable Guests to view a specific collection, send them the collection URL to sign in to Postman and view the collection. Guest users who sign in to Postman using the collection URL are assigned the [Guest role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) at the team level and a limited [Viewer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) at the collection level.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Assigning a user the Guest role doesn't consume paid seats.
</Info>

To enable a Guest to view a collection, do the following:

1. From the collection you want to share, select **Share**.

2. Select **Guests can view collection via link**.

3. Select **Copy Link** to copy the collection URL.

   <img alt="Copy collection URL" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/copy-guest-link-collection-v11.62.png" />

4. Send the collection URL to Guests who you want to view the collection. Postman requires Guests to sign in to Postman before they can view the collection.

### Rules of sharing with Guests

Anyone with access to the collection URL can view it if **Allow guests to view collection via link** is enabled.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to invite more team members. If your team has [SSO enabled](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), users who aren't part of your team will be required to sign in using your team's SSO.
</Info>

The following permissions by role apply when sharing a collection with Guests:

| Role                                                                                                                    | Permissions                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles)                                          | Users who aren't on your Postman team will receive an invitation to join your team.                                            |
| [Developer](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) on your team on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan | Users you share an element with are added to your team as Developers automatically, without the need for approval by an Admin. |
| Not a Developer on a Free, Basic or Professional plan or an Admin on any plan                                           | An Admin must approve your request to share an element with a user who isn't part of the team.                                 |

### Change Guest access to collections

You can change the Guest role at the team and collection levels. You can also revoke access to viewing collections for new and existing Guests.

To learn how to change a Guest's team role, view [Manage Guests](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-guests). To learn how a Guest can request a role change, visit [Request Editor role access for a collection as a Guest](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/#request-editor-access-to-a-collection-as-a-guest).

You can turn off **Allow Guests to join your team and view this collection with the link**. When you turn this off, new Guests can't be assigned the Guest role. Guest users already assigned the Guest role will continue to have access to the collection.

To remove Guests at the team level, view [Remove members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/scale-team/#remove-members). In certain cases, Guests with access to only one collection are automatically removed from the team:

* If the Workspace Admin removes them from the collection.

* If the Workspace Admin removes the Guest from the workspace the collection is in.

* If the Workspace Admin deletes the workspace the collection is in.

To remove Guests at the collection level, do the following:

1. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the collection name, then select **Share**.
2. From the dropdown next to the user's name, select **Remove**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Removing Guests from collections doesn't revoke their access to the workspace the collection is in. To revoke their entire access to the team, view [Remove members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/scale-team/#remove-members).

# Collaborate in Postman with Live Sessions

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Live Sessions is a beta feature available with [Postman Free, Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

With Live Sessions, you can collaborate with your teammates and external partners in all HTTP collections in your workspace in real time. Your team can collaborate throughout the API lifecycle during a live session, viewing each other's changes live from the same collection, folder, and request. Your collaborators can interactively write API tests, debug a failed request, test and debug APIs running on a collaborator's local machine, and much more.

You can start a live session from an [internal workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/). If you're on a [Postman Professional or Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also start a live session from a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/), enabling you to onboard external partners to your private APIs. Live Sessions doesn't support Partner Workspaces with [multi-partner mode](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/) enabled.

## Start a live session

You can start a live session from an internal workspace or Partner Workspace. You need at least Viewer permissions on the collection to start a live session. Collaborators must have at least Viewer permissions on a collection to participate in a live session. The user who starts the live session is the host for the duration of the session. Requests are sent from the host's local machine, regardless of which user sends it.

![Start a live session](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/live-sessions-v11.png)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:**
  Everyone who participates in a live session can view the API response on the host's local machine. Make sure to consider the sensitivity of data shown in a response when deciding who to include in a live session. Learn more about [collaborating in a live session](#collaborate-during-a-live-session).
</Info>

To start a live session, do the following:

1. Open your workspace.

2. From the Postman header, next to <img alt="Invite icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-invite-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Invite**, click the workspace members.

3. Click **Start Live Session**. Postman copies a link to your live session to your clipboard.

4. Share the link with your teammates or partners. To collaborate, the person you share the link with must have at least Viewer permissions.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Tip:** You can also start a live session from a collection, folder, or request. To start a live session, open an HTTP collection, folder, or request and, in the upper right, click **Share**. Then, next to **Live Session**, click **Start**.
</Info>

Postman adds a <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live** indicator to the Postman header. You're ready to [collaborate in real time](#collaborate-during-a-live-session). When you're done, [end the session](#end-a-live-session).

If you need the live session link again, [copy the live session link](#share-a-link-to-a-live-session) and share it with your team and partners.

## Collaborate during a live session

After the host [starts the live session](#start-a-live-session), your team can collaborate from the same HTTP collections, folders, and requests in your workspace. You can view your collaborators' changes during a live session, enabling everyone to collaborate in real time. Collaborate on tasks you'd typically complete in a collection, like changing the request method, adding request parameters, viewing the response, and more. The live session ends for all participants when [the host closes the workspace or ends the live session](#end-a-live-session).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Edits made to [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/) features aren't shared during a live session.
</Info>

Postman sends requests from the host's local machine. If you're the host and a participant wants to send a request, keep that request open on your local machine. This is helpful for distributed collaborators who want to test and debug APIs running locally on a collaborator's machine. Variables and vault secrets resolve from the host's local machine when the request is sent. Collaborators can't view the values associated with the host's variables and vault secrets.

During a live session, Postman displays a pulsing blue dot <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> in the Postman header. Click <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live** to view which collaborators are in the live session and take more actions, like [share a link to the live session](#share-a-link-to-a-live-session) or [leave the live session](#leave-a-live-session). Postman displays a blue underline at the bottom of open tabs that are shared during a live session, such as a folder in an HTTP collection.

Each user's presence is represented by a color and their initials that display when they're actively making edits. A user's color outlines the area they're editing or their cursor in an editor. Their initials display next to the area they're editing. To view which color a user is associated with during the live session, click <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live** and view the color that outlines their avatar.

## Share a link to a live session

During a live session, you can share a link to the session with your collaborators who have at least Viewer permissions.

To share a link to a live session, from the Postman header, click <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live**. Then, click <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy Live Link**.

## End or leave a session

A live session host can end a session. A participant can leave.

### End a live session

If you're the host, you can end a live session for all participants. A live session automatically ends when the host closes the workspace or the Postman app.

To end a live session, from the Postman header, click <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live**. Then, click **End Session**.

### Leave a live session

If you're a participant, you can leave the session.

To leave a live session, from the Postman header, click <img alt="Live session icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-live-session-v11.jpg#icon" width="17px" /> **Live**. Then, click **Leave Session**.


# Collaborate in Postman using comments

Commenting is one of Postman's most practical collaborative tools that can be used on both the publisher and consumer sides of APIs. Through interactive communication, commenting removes ambiguity, improves user experience, and helps to increase the adoption of API-driven services.

API publishers can use commenting throughout the API lifecycle to improve the API design and resolve API consumers' issues. API consumers can use commenting to ask API publishers questions and receive support about the APIs they use.

Comments aggregate at the collection level so that you can check all communication about various elements of the collection in one place. Click the comment header to jump to the commented element.

<img alt="Aggregated comments" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/comment-aggregate-v11.64.png" width="514" />

## Use comments in Postman

Postman provides two types of commenting: [global](#global-comments) and [inline](#inline-comments). When you add a comment, Postman notifies other collection contributors about your comment. To specify a teammate, use `@`, then select the person from the list. They'll receive an email and an in-app notification. Select the notifications icon <img alt="Notifications icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-notification-bell-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> in the Postman header to view in-app notifications. You can also copy a link to the comment and paste it in your team channels.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your teammate doesn't have access to the collection they've been mentioned in, they'll need to [request access](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) before they can read the comment.
</Info>

For general questions about a collection and its elements, you can use global comments in the right sidebar.

<img alt="Global comments" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/comments-global-v11.64.png" />

You can add inline comments on the following items:

* Parameters, the request body, and scripts that are part of a request or example response

* Pull requests in forked collections

The following example shows an inline comment on an example response.

<img alt="Inline comments" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/comments-inline-v11.64b.png" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also add comments to APIs and API definitions in the Postman API Builder. Learn more about commenting on [APIs](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/#commenting-on-apis).
</Info>

## Commenting best practices

Use comments to discuss your work with your teammates in Postman. Reply to a comment to keep the discussion going, or resolve a comment if it's been addressed. If you have questions or feedback, you can let your teammates know by mentioning them in your comments.

Encourage users in your public workspace or Partner Workspace to use comments if they get errors or have any questions. Doing so will help establish a rapport with your users and help to resolve their errors faster. For example, your users might get a `400` response and wonder why or have questions about how to enter an API key.

Avoid using comments to document your APIs. Postman automatically generates [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) for your collection. To access it, select your collection in the sidebar, then select **View complete documentation** in the workbench. You can edit and build upon your documentation to make it better for your users.

## Global comments

You can add global comments to a collection, folder, request, example, manual collection run, or pull request in Postman.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You must have access to a collection to add comments to it.
</Info>

To add a comment to a collection, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection, folder, request, example, manual collection run, or pull request you want to comment on.

2. Select <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-comments-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Comments** in the right sidebar and enter your comment.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Postman supports Markdown in comments. See the [Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for tips on formatting.

   <img alt="Commenting on a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/comment-collection-v11.56.png" width="440" />

### Format comments

Comments (including [inline comments](#inline-comments)) support the same formatting features as the [Postman editor](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor). Use common keyboard shortcuts to format text, like **⌘+B** or **Ctrl+B** to make text bold, or paste formatted text and tables from a word processor or other source. You can also drag or paste an image into your comment, or add and edit links.

Postman supports [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in comments. For example, enter `#` followed by a space to start a new heading, or enter `---` to add a horizontal line. You can also copy existing Markdown code, including lists and tables, and paste it into the editor to instantly format it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about formatting content, go to [Write descriptions in the Postman editor](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor).

# Document your APIs in Postman

[Documentation](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-documentation/) is an important part of your API. You can add documentation to any Postman Collection and its API requests. You can also use Postman to create API documentation and share it with your API's consumers, so they know what endpoints are available and how to interact with them.

Postman automatically generates documentation for your collections and APIs. To give your users more help and context, use Postman's built-in editing tools to add descriptions, images, videos, and more to your documentation.

## Document collections and APIs

Postman automatically creates documentation for your collections, including request details, authorization type, and sample code. You can [add descriptions to the items in your collection](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) to provide more information for users. With types in collections, you can [add details about your API with the Postman Collection format](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/).

Postman also generates documentation based on your API definition (for OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs). To create more detailed API documentation, [add one or more collections to the Postman API Builder](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/), and then add descriptions to the collections. You can add an existing collection or generate a collection based on your API definition.

## Write your documentation

Add descriptions to your collections to [enhance your documentation and provide more detail](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/). You can use the Postman editor to view how your content will look as you write it, or use standard Markdown syntax to write content. With either editor, you can format text, add links, and insert images and videos.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Postbot can write documentation for you.** Use Postman's AI assistant, Postbot, to automatically add descriptions to your API requests, including parameters and response examples. Learn more about [writing documentation with Postbot](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-documentation-with-postbot).
</Info>

## Publish and view documentation

To learn more about how to use a collection or an API, you can [view documentation in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/viewing-documentation/). Collection documentation provides details for each request, along with sample code. To view API documentation, open an API in Postman, or search for APIs on your [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private) or [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/apis/).

[Publishing a collection](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) makes your documentation publicly available on getpostman.com or your own [custom domain](/docs/publishing-your-api/custom-doc-domains/). As you update your collection, the published documentation automatically syncs with your latest changes.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't publish a collection that's linked to an API. Instead, you can [publish a version of an API in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/) to make your API and its documentation available to consumers.
</Info>

## Create a Run in Postman button

You can [create a **Run in Postman** button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/) to share a collection and its documentation with users. When users select the button, they have the option to fork the collection to their workspace, view the collection in a public workspace, or import the collection into Postman.


# Document a collection in Postman

Postman automatically generates basic documentation for any collection you create. The documentation includes details about all of the requests in your collection, along with sample code in various client languages. Request details include the method, authorization type, URL, headers, request and response structures, and examples. In addition, the documentation displays all key-value pairs for request parameters, headers, and bodies.

To make your documentation even more valuable to users, [add descriptions](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#add-descriptions-to-your-documentation) to the items in your collection. Any descriptions you add are automatically included in the documentation for your collection.

## Add descriptions to a collection

Add descriptions to your collections (including [collections linked to an API](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/)) to enhance your documentation and add more detail. You can use the Postman editor to view how your content will look as you write it, or use standard Markdown syntax to write content. With either editor, you can format text, add links, and insert images and videos in your documentation.

To add a description to a collection or folder, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, and then select a collection or a folder.
2. Enter a description in the **Overview** tab. To learn more about using Postman's built-in editing tools, see [Write your docs](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/).
3. Click outside of the editor to save your new content.

<img alt="Documenting a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-overview-tab-v11.jpg" />

To add a description to a request, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, and then select a request.
2. Click the documentation icon <img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> in the right sidebar.
3. Enter a description in the right sidebar. To learn more about using Postman's built-in editing tools, see [Write your docs](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/).
4. Click outside of the editor to save your new content.

<img alt="Documenting a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-pane-v11-b.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also edit descriptions when viewing the complete documentation for a collection. Select a collection in the sidebar, then click **View complete documentation** in the **Overview** tab. From here, you can add a description to any item in the collection.
</Info>

## Document gRPC and WebSocket collections

Collections with gRPC or WebSocket requests use a different format than collections with HTTP requests. You can view documentation and add descriptions for gRPC or WebSocket requests. You can also add a description on the collection's **Overview** tab, but you can't view or edit documentation for the full collection. Learn more about [documenting gRPC requests](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-request-interface/#the-right-sidebar) or [documenting WebSocket requests](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/document-websocket-requests/).

## Associate environments with documentation

An [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) is a set of related [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) you can use in Postman requests. You can also refer to variables when [writing descriptions](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) in a collection. In each case, the shared value of the variable is automatically populated in the documentation.

Anyone using your collection can view the variables in the documentation if the associated environment is also shared with them. For public documentation, you can select an environment during the [publishing process](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/). Publishing an environment makes it available to anyone [viewing public documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/viewing-documentation/).

To use an environment variable in your documentation, do the following:

1. [Create a new environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) if one doesn't already exist.
2. Make the environment active by selecting it in the [environment dropdown list](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#switch-between-environments).
3. If needed, [add a new variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#add-environment-variables) to the environment.
4. Add a [reference to the variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#using-variables) to requests or descriptions in your collection.

<img alt="Referencing a variable" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-add-variable-v11-b.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If someone imports a collection using the **Run in Postman** button from your documentation, they also import the environment and any associated variables. The shared values for variables are published in your documentation, so make sure they don't contain any sensitive data.
</Info>

## Next steps

After documenting a collection in Postman, you can edit and format the docs and publish them.

# Add API documentation in Postman

You can view, create, and manage your API's documentation either with collections or the Postman API Builder. You can add detailed API documentation to a collection with types. This enables you to add more details to request parameters, headers, and bodies in an HTTP collection. With the API Builder, you can also add detailed documentation for any OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 definition. You can then generate a collection from the API or add a copy of an existing collection.

The API documentation includes complete API, path, and operation information, such as authentication methods, parameters, request bodies, response bodies and headers, and examples. The documentation also includes information for various data models, such as required attributes, default values, minimum and maximum values, and other constraints.

## Add API documentation with collections

Postman automatically creates [documentation for a collection](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) you create. With [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/), you can build out this documentation by designing your API with the Postman Collection format. You can add more details to request parameters, headers, and bodies in the collection, such as data type and possible values. Details you add appear in your collection's documentation.

To get started, [add types to parameters and headers](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-parameters-and-headers/). You can also [add types to body data](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-body-data/) in your requests.

To view the documentation for a collection with types, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, then select a collection with types.
2. Click the collection's **Overview** tab and click **View complete documentation**.

![View documentation for a collection with types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-view-docs-v11-12.jpg)

## Add API documentation with the API Builder

If you are [designing an API in the API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/) based on the OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 specification, Postman automatically creates documentation based on your API definition.

With the API Builder, you can create documentation from a [new collection](#create-new-documentation-for-an-api) or an [existing collection](#add-existing-documentation-to-an-api). You can also [edit a collection's documentation](#edit-api-documentation) and [delete a collection and its documentation](#delete-api-documentation) if you no longer need it.

To view the documentation for an OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 API from the Postman API Builder, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. On the API's overview, under **Definition**, click **View schema documentation**.

<img alt="Viewing schema documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/documentation-view-schema-docs-v10-16.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also view schema documentation while editing your OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 definition. Postman displays a live preview of the documentation as you work on your API. Learn more about [previewing schema documentation](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#preview-schema-documentation).
</Info>

## Create new documentation for an API

To generate a new collection for API documentation from the Postman API Builder, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

3. Select the checkbox if you want Postman to suggest updates for the collection when the API definition changes. This checkbox is selected by default. Learn more about [keeping a collection in sync with an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#keep-a-collection-in-sync-with-your-api).
4. Change any settings to customize the new collection.
5. Click **Generate Collection**.

The new collection displays on your API's overview and under your API in the sidebar. To view documentation for the collection, select the collection and click **View complete documentation**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also [generate a collection from Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/). Postman automatically creates a collection with folders, requests, and response examples based on the specification.
</Info>

## Add existing documentation to an API

Copy an existing collection with API documentation to an API.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you copy a [collection with types](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/), types won't be copied to the new collection linked to the API.

# Write documentation in Postman

Postman [automatically generates documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/) for every collection you create, including [collections linked to an API](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/). All descriptions you write are included in your collection's complete documentation, including all requests in your collection, along with examples, authorization details, and example code.

To help your teammates ([or the world](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/)) better understand what you're building, add detailed descriptions to your collection and its [requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/). Use the Postman editor to view how your content will look as you write it. Or use the Markdown editor to structure and format your descriptions using Markdown syntax. Both are compatible, so you can switch between both editors as you work.

![Switching editors](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-switch-editor-menu-v11-1.png)

## Add descriptions to your documentation

Use descriptions to inform your collection's users about what it does and the purpose of each request. Structure your descriptions with headings and add content such as text, tables, images, and links.

To add a description to a collection or folder, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar and select a collection.
2. Enter a description in the **Overview** tab using the visual [Postman editor](#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor) or the [Markdown editor](#write-descriptions-in-markdown).
3. Click outside of the editor to save your new content.

To add a description to a request, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, select a collection, then select a request.
2. For public workspaces, click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Documentation** in the right sidebar. For all other workspace types, click <img alt="Align left icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-alignLeft-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Docs** in the workbench.
3. Enter a description using the visual [Postman editor](#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor) or the [Markdown editor](#write-descriptions-in-markdown).
4. Click outside of the editor to save your new content.

<Tip title="Tip">
  To give users more details about requests in your collection, add descriptions to the request [parameters and headers](#add-descriptions-to-parameters-and-headers).
</Tip>

### Write descriptions in the Postman editor

To write a description using rich text editing tools, select the **Postman editor**. You can use the Postman editor to write a description without having to write any Markdown code. Use the tools on the toolbar to work with text and other content, as you would in a typical word processor. Or, use common keyboard shortcuts to format text, like **⌘+B** or **Ctrl+B** to make text bold.

![Postman editor](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-use-postman-editor-v11-1.png)

**View the tooltips to get help as you work.** Hold your cursor over an item on the toolbar to see a description of the tool and the associated keyboard shortcut.

**Create tables without Markdown.** No need to fuss with Markdown code to get your tables to work. To add a table, click <img alt="Table icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-table-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Table**. To add or remove columns or rows, or to delete the table, select a cell and then click the shortcut menu.

**The Postman editor understands Markdown syntax.** If you're comfortable using Markdown, enter any standard Markdown code to format text. For example, enter `#` followed by a space to start a new heading, or enter `---` to add a horizontal line. To reuse documentation that's already written in Markdown, copy the existing Markdown code and paste it into the editor to instantly format it.

<Note title="Note">
  If you copy content from the Postman editor, the content retains its formatting when you paste it into another application, such as a word processor or an email.
</Note>

### Write descriptions in Markdown

To write a description using Markdown, select the **Markdown editor** option. Use standard Markdown syntax to create your content:

* Structure content with headings, lists, and tables.
* Format text with bold, emphasis, and block quotes.
* Add images, links, and code blocks.

As you work, click the **Preview** tab to review how your documentation will appear and to ensure the formatting is correct. To continue editing, click the **Markdown** tab.

<Tip title="Tip">
  Leave a blank line before and after block elements (like headings, paragraphs, and lists) to avoid formatting issues.
</Tip>

![Markdown editor](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-use-markdown-editor-v11-1.png)

### Select a default documentation editor

You can choose the default editor you want to use for editing documentation descriptions in Postman. When you edit a description, Postman switches to your preferred editor. You can still switch between the Postman and Markdown editors while editing a description.

To switch your default editor, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Settings**.
2. In the <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" role="img" /> **General** tab, scroll down to **User Interface**.
3. Select **Postman editor** or **Markdown editor** for the **Default documentation editor** setting.

### Add descriptions to parameters and headers

Add descriptions to parameters and headers to help others understand and use your collection's requests. Open a request and enter the description in the box next to the key-value pair. Add [types](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-parameters-and-headers/) to your request's [parameters](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) and [headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/#configure-request-headers), such as data type, format, and default values, to further define them.

![Parameter descriptions](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-add-properties-v11-59.jpg)

The parameter and header descriptions are visible to people with access to your collection or anyone viewing your [published documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/). The descriptions appear in the documentation along with the request, next to the parameter or header name.

All key-value pairs are included in your documentation. Use [types](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-parameters-and-headers/) to define required parameters and headers. Anyone using your collection can choose which key-value pairs to include when sending requests or [generating code snippets](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/).

## Include authorization details

Your documentation automatically includes the type of authorization required to access your endpoints. Authorization details appear below the collection description and also below each request in your documentation.

If you [specify authorization details](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/) for the collection, those authorization requirements are inherited by every request in the collection. If one of your endpoints requires a different authorization type, open the request and [change the authorization details](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/#inherit-authorization). The changes are reflected in your documentation.

## Including examples

Examples are paired requests and responses that your endpoints in action. Any [examples you add to a collection](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/#add-an-example) are included in the documentation. For each request, your documentation shows the example code snippets, as well the example response body and headers.

<Note title="Note">
  Examples display when you [view the complete documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/viewing-documentation/#viewing-documentation-for-a-collection) for a collection, or when you [view published documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/viewing-documentation/#viewing-public-documentation).
</Note>

## Add links

Use links to direct users to your repository, website, or other online resources.

To add a link using the Postman editor, click <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Link**. Paste or enter the URL and the link text, then click **Add**. If you need to change the link later, select it, then click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Edit link**.

To add a link using the Markdown editor, use the following syntax:

```md
[link text to display](https://your-link-url.com)
```

## Add images

Images liven up your documentation and help your ideas come across with more clarity. You can upload an image file from your computer or embed an image that's hosted online.

### Upload an image

To upload an image using the Postman editor, click <img alt="Image icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-image-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Image** and select **Browse**. Select the image you want to upload and click **Open**. You can also upload an image by copying and pasting an image into the Postman editor, or by dragging an image file into the Postman editor.

The Postman editor supports PNG, JPG, SVG, and GIF formats. The maximum supported image size is 5 MB.

### Embed an image

# Publish documentation in Postman

Publishing your documentation makes it publicly available to anyone with the link to the documentation. Publish your documentation to help people around the world learn how to use your collection or interact with your public API.

Public documentation automatically includes details for each request or endpoint in the published collection, along with sample code in various client languages. As you update your collection, the published documentation automatically stays in sync with your latest changes. There's no need to publish the documentation again after making changes.

<Tip title="Tip">
  Your public documentation also includes the [**Run in Postman** button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/) so users can interact with your collection or API directly in Postman. For an example, check out the [Postman API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12959542/UV5XjJV8) which was published from a Postman Collection.
</Tip>

## Make your documentation public

To publish [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/), it must be part of a collection. You can publish documentation for any collections you've created or have permission to edit.

<Note title="Note">
  Publishing is only supported for collections with HTTP requests.
</Note>

To publish the documentation for a collection, do the following:

1. Click **Collections** in the sidebar, and then select a collection.
2. In the collection's **Overview** tab, click **View complete documentation**.
3. Click **Publish** to navigate to the **Publish Documentation** interface.

   <img alt="Publish documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/documentation-publish-button-v11.jpg" />

<Tip title="Tip">
  To publish documentation for an API created in the API Builder, [publish a version of the API in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/). A published version includes the API's definition and collections.
</Tip>

## Update publication settings

In the **Publish Documentation** interface, change any publication settings as needed.

### Content

Select the content that you want to publish with your docs:

* **Version** --- This defaults to **CURRENT**. You can't create versions or releases for collections in Postman v10 and later, but you can [publish versions of an API in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).
* **Environment** --- Select an [environment](/docs/publishing-your-api/document-a-collection/#associate-environments-with-documentation) to publish environment variables with your documentation.

  <Error title="Caution">
    The shared values of all variables are published with your documentation, so make sure they don't contain sensitive information such as passwords or tokens.
  </Error>

### URL

Select a [custom domain](/docs/publishing-your-api/custom-doc-domains/) from the **Custom domain** dropdown list where you want to publish your documentation.

### Appearance

Select the appearance settings for your published docs. You can preview any changes you make in the sample layouts in this section before you publish your docs.

* **Default layout** --- Select a default layout style for your documentation. **Double column** displays sample code in a column next to the documentation. **Single column** displays sample code inline beneath each request. Your documentation uses the selected layout by default, but users can select their preferred layout style when viewing your published documentation.

* **Default Theme** --- Select a light or dark theme for your documentation. You can also choose to use the system theme. Your documentation uses the selected theme by default, but users can switch between themes.

* **Logo** --- By default, public documentation uses your [team logo](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#customize-your-branding). You can use different logos for each collection you publish. Logos must be 2 MB or less in size and must be in JPEG or PNG format. The logo can be any aspect ratio (square or rectangle). You can also select a custom logo for each theme (light and dark).
  * To add a logo, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" />, then select **Upload**. Drag and drop an image file, or select an image file. Drag the handles to adjust the part of the image you want to display, then click **Upload**.
  * To delete a logo, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> and select **Delete**.

* **Colors** --- You can customize the colors (in hex format) for the light and dark themes:
  * **Header background** --- Specify a color for the header at the top of the documentation window.
  * **Code background** --- Specify a color for sample code blocks.
  * **Highlight** --- Specify a color for hyperlinks.

### SEO

Add metadata to your documentation to make it more discoverable on the web.

* **Title** --- Add a title for your documentation (60 characters or less). The title appears in web searches and in browser tabs.
* **Description** --- Add a brief description to let users know what your documentation is about (160 characters or less). You can also add relevant keywords to help users find your documentation when searching the web.

### Preview your documentation

To preview your documentation using the current settings, click **Preview Documentation**. The preview automatically updates as you change settings.

<Note title="Note">
  If Postman detects a possibly sensitive token or other secret, a warning appears at the top of the preview window. Postman also highlights the token so you can remove it from the documentation before publishing.
</Note>

### Publish your documentation

When you're finished changing your documentation's settings, click **Publish** to publish.

* **Postman Free, Basic, and Professional plans** --- You can optionally select a [public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) to move the collection to. This makes the collection discoverable on the [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore). When you're ready, click **Publish**. You can view your public documentation at the provided URL.

* **Postman Enterprise plans** --- Your [Community Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) controls the Postman elements your team makes public.

# View documentation in Postman

[Documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) helps you get more out of the collections and APIs that you work with in Postman. View documentation to learn more about the requests in a collection or how to interact with an API's endpoints.

By default, documentation for a collection or API is private. You can view the documentation for any collections or APIs that have been shared with you directly or through an internal workspace.

Documentation writers can also choose to [publish their documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) to make it publicly available. Anyone in the world can view the public documentation using a browser. If the associated collection is in a public workspace, people can also view the collection in Postman.

## Viewing documentation for a collection

You can view the documentation for any collection that you created or for collections that have been [shared with you](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">

# Host API documentation with a custom domain

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Custom documentation domains are available with Postman paid plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

You can host your [published API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) on a custom domain instead of on `getpostman.com`. After you add and verify a custom domain, users can access your API documentation using the custom domain.

## Add a custom domain

Access [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/custom-domains) by selecting **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header.

Click **Custom domains** to view the custom domains added for your team and each domain's verification status. Click **View Details** next to a domain get the verification records needed to [verify your domain](#verify-your-domain).

![Viewing custom domains](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/custom-domains-view-v11-1.jpg)

To add a new domain, click **Add custom domain** and enter your domain's URL. You can enter a subdomain (like `docs.example.com`), but you can't enter your main domain (like `example.com`).

Click **Proceed** to verify the custom domain.

## Verify your domain

After you add a custom domain, Postman displays the DNS records required to verify domain ownership. To verify that you control the domain you're attempting to add, copy the provided tokens and use them to add TXT and CNAME records to your domain. After adding the records to your domain, you can complete the verification in Postman's [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/custom-domains).

![Custom domain TXT and CNAM records](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/custom-domains-dns-records-v10-21.jpg)

### Add DNS records

To add DNS records to your domain, open another browser tab and sign in to your domain registrar or DNS provider. Add a TXT record and a CNAME record to your domain using the tokens provided by Postman.

* **TXT record** - Add a new TXT record to your domain. For **Name**, enter "@" to add the record to the root domain. For **Value**, use the TXT token copied from Postman.

  ![Adding a TXT record](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/custom-domains-add-txt.jpg)

* **CNAME record** - Add a new CNAME record to your domain. For **Name**, enter the subdomain where you want to host your public documentation (for example, `docs.example.com`). For value, enter `phs.getpostman.com`.

  ![Adding a CNAME record](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/custom-domains-cname-record.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The steps for adding TXT and CNAME records can vary depending on the domain registrar or DNS provider, and may look different than what's shown. Check your provider's documentation if you need more help.
</Info>

### Complete the verification

To complete the verification, return to Team Settings in Postman. Select the checkbox next to **The TXT and CNAME records have been added** and click **Verify Domain**. Postman displays a message confirming the domain has been verified.

![Completing domain verification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/custom-domains-verify-v10.jpg)

If you don't want to verify the domain at this time, click **Verify Later**. To copy the TXT and CNAME tokens again, click **View Details** next to a domain. To remove a custom domain, click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** next to the domain.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman uses [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as an SSL certificate provider to enable hosting public documentation on your domain. Let's Encrypt generates a certificate implicitly if your domain has no CAA records. If your domain already has CAA records, then Let's Encrypt needs an explicit CAA record to issue a certificate for that domain. To enable Let's Encrypt to issue the certificate, refer to the [Let's Encrypt documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  It may take up to 24 hours for the new DNS settings to take effect. Until then, you may get an error message when accessing your custom domain. To check the status of the DNS change, visit [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).
</Info>

## Troubleshoot DNS issues

If you get an error message when trying to add a TXT or CNAME record to your domain, check the following requirements:

* **CNAME records can't co-exist with other records for the same domain.** If you already have a record for the subdomain where you want to host your public documentation, you need to change the record type to CNAME or add a new subdomain.

* **You can't add the CNAME record to the root domain.** The TXT record "@" verifies the ownership of the root domain. Instead, add the CNAME record to the subdomain where you want to host your public documentation (such as `docs.example.com`) and set the value to `phs.getpostman.com`.

* **Your domain registrar or DNS provider uses a DNS proxy.** Some domain registrars and DNS providers (such as Cloudflare) enable a DNS proxy by default. If you can't verify your domain, turn off the DNS proxy. See your provider's documentation for details or contact them for help.

## Publish documentation to your custom domain

After you verify your custom domain, you can use it to [publish your API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/#make-your-documentation-public). If you have a collection that's already published, you can [edit the publication settings](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/#change-publication-settings) to use the new domain.

# Set up Guided Auth for public APIs in Postman

You can onboard your API consumers by setting up Guided Auth for your public APIs in Postman. This feature enables you to communicate the steps users need to take make their first request to your API, such as registering for a developer account or creating an app on your dashboard. When a user creates a request to your API, Postman automatically recognizes that it requires authentication and prompts them with your provided steps to set it up.

Once users set up their authentication credentials, they can use Guided Auth to securely store them in their [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) as encrypted vault secrets. Postman Vault enables users to reuse stored credentials throughout their local instance of Postman. Also, vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud. Learn more about [using Guided Auth to store credentials as vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/).

## API authentication setup

Guided Auth enables Postman to recognize requests to your API's base URL and prompt your API's consumers with steps to set up authentication. Your API's consumers can use it to set up authentication to your API whether they've forked your public collection or created a request to your API from scratch.

To set up authentication for your public APIs, go to the [Guided Auth dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/api-authentication). Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Guided Auth** in the left sidebar.

Postman supports [Bearer Token](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#bearer-token), [Basic Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#basic-auth), [API Key](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#api-key), and [OAuth 2.0](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/) authorization.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  It's recommended that you configure OAuth 2.0 authorization for your public APIs because it requires less setup for your API consumers.

If you're setting up Guided Auth for the first time, you'll find the **Set up guided authorization** form. For separate authentication on different endpoints with the same base URL, click **Add Guided Auth** to set up multiple Guided Auth configurations for your APIs using the form. It's recommended that you describe when to use each authentication scheme, enabling your consumers to select the right option. You can also [edit or delete configurations](#edit-or-delete-guided-auth-configurations) based on your requirements.

## Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication

The following example shows you how to configure Guided Auth for an API that uses OAuth 2.0:

1. Enter the API name. Use this field to help consumers make the right choice if you decide to set up multiple authentication schemes.

2. Enter the base URL of your API. You'll need to [verify it](#verify-your-domain) later to enable authorization.

   Optionally, you can use [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) in your base URL to represent values that consumers replace with their own values. For example, you can add a variable that represents the region, product, or organization they must substitute in the URL to make a successful call to your API: `https://{{org-name}}.example.com`.

3. Select the **OAuth 2.0** authorization type.

4. Select **Authorization code** from the **Grant type** menu. You can learn more about [specifying an authorization code](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/oauth-20/#specifying-an-authorization-code).

5. Select **Generate Callback URL**. Copy the URL and add it to the allow list in your application's settings.

   ![Generate callback URL](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/generate-callback-url-v10.16.jpg)

6. Enter the access token URL. This URL is the endpoint for your authentication server and is used to obtain an access token.

7. Enter the authorization URL. This is where users are sent to authenticate with your API.

8. Enter the application client ID for the application you created for this integration.

9. Enter the application client secret for the application you created for this integration. Secrets are stored encrypted at rest and in transit, and are never visible to consumers.

10. (Optional) Enter a comma-separated list of authentication scopes to restrict what Postman users can access. For example, `read:public_key, write:org`.

11. Select **As a Basic Auth header** in the **How should client credentials be sent?** section.

12. (Optional) Select **Advanced settings** to customize the authorization type:

    * Enter the refresh token URL. This is the endpoint for the refresh server that exchanges the refresh token for an access token. If the refresh token URL is empty, the access token URL is used instead.
    * Enter custom parameters to send with auth requests, token requests, or refresh requests. For each key-value pair you define in token requests or refresh requests, choose whether you'd like to send the parameter in the request body, request URL, or request headers. Key-value pairs you define in auth requests are sent in the request URL. If you add multiple keys with same key name, they're sent with the request as an array.

    ![Enter advanced settings](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-auth-advanced-settings-v11.jpg)

13. Add any prerequisite steps users must take to make a request to your API. This includes steps like registering for a developer account, creating an integration, or copying a token. This displays to users when they create a request to your API and guides them through setting up authentication.

    ![Describe steps for users to take](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/describe-prereq-steps-for-users-v10.16.jpg)

    <Info class="iconless-callout">
      You can use basic Markdown syntax for bold, italics, underline, bullet points, and links to structure your content.
    </Info>

14. [Verify your domain](#verify-your-domain) to complete adding authorization.

15. Click **Save** to save your API authorization settings.

Select **Try it out** to preview your configuration. You can test and validate your configuration by making an API call to this endpoint.

## Edit or delete Guided Auth configurations

After you've set up Guided Auth, you can edit or delete configurations based on your requirements.

To edit or delete a configuration, do the following:

1. Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Guided Auth** in the left sidebar.
2. In the table, hover over the row with the configuration you want to change and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit** or <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete**.

## Verify your domain

Verify your domain to prove that you're the owner, enabling Postman to trust your team and its connection to your public API. This way, you'll prevent others from impersonating your API, ensuring the safety of your consumers. Postman requires that you verify the domain for your API authentication configuration before you can share it with the Postman community.

After your domain is verified, Postman recognizes newly created requests to your API and prompt your API consumers to authenticate using the steps you've provided.

To verify your domain, do the following:

1. Click **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header, then click **Authorization**.
2. Select the [**Domains**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/domain-capture/) tab, then click **Verify** next to the domain that you want to verify.
3. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy** to copy the domain's TXT Record.
4. Add the copied value to your domain as a DNS TXT record.
5. In Postman, select the checkbox next to **I have added the text record to the DNS tool**, then click **Verify Domain** in Postman to confirm.

# Share elements on your Postman Private API Network

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Your Private API Network is available with Postman Enterprise plans. Adding and managing APIs on your Private API Network requires the API Builder add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Your *Private API Network* provides a [central directory](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-catalog/) of workspaces, collections, and APIs your team uses internally. Your Postman team can access these resources and start using them right away. By using your team's Private API Network, you can enable developers across your organization to discover, consume, and track API development in one place.

[Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and [API Network Managers](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) can manage all folders, workspaces, and collections in your Private API Network. Team members can be assigned the [Folder Manager role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) at the folder level, giving them permission to manage specific folders and the workspaces and collections in them.

If your team has [the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), your teammates can access APIs on your team's Private API Network. Super Admins, API Network Managers, and Folder Managers added to the API Builder add-on can manage APIs in your Private API Network based on their permission level.

## Use your Private API Network

Team members can search for and discover elements, such as workspaces and APIs, in your Private API Network. Your teammates can review details about elements and take actions from them, such as watch and fork a collection.

Workspaces and collections in your team's Private API Network are visible to logged-in users who are on your Postman team. If your team has [the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), APIs in your Private API Network are also visible to logged-in users. Users who aren't on your team can't find or access these resources.

Learn more about [using your team's Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/use-private-network/).

## Manage your Private API Network

Super Admins and API Network Managers can add and view requests to add workspaces, collections, and APIs to your team's Private API Network. Users assigned these roles can also organize all elements on your Private API Network into folders. Assign users the Folder Manager role to add, view requests to add, and organize elements in specific folders. To learn more, see [Add elements to your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/).

You can manage folders, workspaces, collections, and APIs on your Private API Network. This includes moving and deleting folders and elements from your team's Private API Network. To learn more, see [Manage folders and elements in your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/managing-private-network/).

Users with the Editor role for a workspace, collection, or API can request to add them to your Private API Network. Learn how to [request to add elements to your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/).

You can also [use the Postman API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/publish-private-network-elements-with-api/) to programmatically manage folders and elements in your team's Private API Network

#### Publish specific API versions

Publishing a version creates a static representation of your API that consumers can view on your Private API Network. If your API in the Postman API Builder is connected to a Git repository, publish an API version to update your team or public workspace with the latest changes. When you publish a version, the API's definition and collections are synced to the Postman cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you publish an API with an API definition that has syntax errors, your API documentation might not display as expected. To learn more about viewing syntax errors, see [Viewing syntax errors in your API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/#viewing-syntax-errors-in-your-api-definition).

# Automate publishing to your Private API Network using the Postman API

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Your Private API Network is available with Postman Enterprise plans. Adding APIs to your Private API Network requires the API Builder add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

You can use the Postman API to programmatically manage your Private API Network's resources. With it, you can automate the publication of your team's Private API Network.

## Getting started

You can get started by [forking the Postman API collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a/postman-api/fork?origin=sidebar) in the Postman Public Workspace. This collection has all the available [Private API Network endpoints](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/2guzk9z/private-api-network/).

You will also need an API key to use the Postman API. For information, see [Generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Access rate limits for your Postman account depend on your Postman plan. For more information, see [Postman API rate limits](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).
</Info>

## Create a Private API Network folder

This HTTP request [creates a folder](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-22a2c7a4-aa34-4501-9eca-d22ea620f07f) in your Private API Network. A folder can contain multiple elements, such as [workspaces](#add-a-workspace-to-a-folder), [collections](#add-a-collection-to-a-folder), or [APIs](#add-an-api-to-a-folder).

It's recommended that you use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data, such as API keys, as vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud. If you want to share sensitive data with collaborators, you can store it in an environment as a [variable set as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).

By default, this API creates the folder in the root Home folder of your Private API Network:

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman.com
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 94

{
    "folder": {
        "name": "Billing",
        "description": "The Billing API."
    }
}
```

The same HTTP request in Postman:

![The API call in Postman](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-private-network-folder-api-v11.jpg)

On success, your request's response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "parentFolderId": 0,
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "updatedBy": 12345678,
    "createdBy": 12345678,
    "createdAt": "2023-08-03T13:18:25.000Z",
    "name": "Billing",
    "description": "The Billing API.",
    "type": "folder"
}
```

You can also find your new folder in your Private API Network's root Home directory:

<img alt="New folder in Private Network" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/private-api-network-organize-folders-v10-3.jpg" />

Save the `id` value in the response. For example, save it as a collection [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) called `{{folderId}}`. You can then use it as the `parentFolderId` value in other requests, such as adding elements to the folder or subfolders.

## Add elements to your Private API Network folder

Your Private API Network folder's elements (collections, APIs, and workspaces) are links to the original element. If that source element changes, then your Private API Network automatically reflects these changes.

In the following examples, the `{{folderId}}` variable references the `id` value returned when you created your Private API Network folder (for example, `1`).

### Add a collection to a folder

This HTTP request [adds a collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-c3766325-01d8-4f71-963f-a95892451acc) to your Private API Network folder.

```http
POST /network/private HTTP/1.1
Host: api.getpostman.com
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: {{postman-api-key}}
Content-Length: 131

{

        "parentFolderId": {{folderId}}
    }
}
```

The response to this request will look similar to the following:

```json

    "parentFolderId": 1
}
```

### Add an API to a folder

Before you add an API to your Private API Network folder, first make sure it's published. Private API Network APIs must have a published version associated with it.

Then, use the following HTTP request to [add an API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/example/12959542-66c2f1f2-0532-4c65-8508-2392935b82ce) to your Private API Network folder:

# Version control for Postman collections and environments

Postman provides version control for your API collections and environments so you can iteratively and collaboratively build your APIs in Postman. Learn how to fork a collection or environment, make updates to the fork, create a pull request, and merge your changes into the parent element.

* You can fork collections and environments from a parent element. Forking enables you to contribute to an element without having Editor access to that element. Learn more about [forking Postman elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/).

* Create a pull request when you're ready to merge changes you made in your forked element into the parent element. Learn more about [creating pull requests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/).

* You can view the changes, comment, approve or decline the request, and merge the forked collection or environment into the parent element. Learn more about [reviewing pull requests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/).

* Watch a pull request to receive in-app notifications when a team member modifies a pull request. Learn more about [watching pull requests](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/watching-pull-requests/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Version control for collections and environments is different from API versioning. For information on managing multiple versions of APIs in the Postman API Builder, see [Manage changes with Git in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/).

# Fork collections and environments in Postman

A *fork* is a new instance of an element. When you modify a fork, its parent element remains unchanged. In Postman, you can fork collections and environments. Forking enables you to contribute to an element without having [Editor access](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles) for that element.

## Create a fork

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To fork an element within a public workspace, you must make your profile public in Postman [Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/). For more information, see [Making your profile public](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-profile/#make-your-profile-public).
</Info>

When you fork a collection or an environment, you create a copy of it in a different workspace. You must sign in to Postman to create a fork.

To fork an element, do the following:

1. Select the element in the sidebar.

2. Select <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-fork-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Fork** in the upper right.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also create a fork by hovering over the element in the sidebar and selecting <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to its name, then selecting **Fork**.
   </Info>

3. Enter a label for your fork, and select a workspace to save it to.

4. (Optional) If you are forking a collection, you can select one or more environments to include with the fork.

5. Select **Fork Collection** or **Fork Environment**.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/fork-collection-v11.jpg" alt="Create fork tab" />

Postman creates your fork in the selected workspace.

If there are any [mocks](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) or [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) associated with the parent element, they aren't linked to the forked element. You must create mocks and monitors specifically for the fork if you need them.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If a collection is in a public workspace that you haven't been added to, you won't be able to send a request within that workspace. To send requests or make changes to a collection, you must fork the collection into an internal workspace that belongs to you.
</Info>

## Edit a fork's name or label

To change a forked element's name or label, do the following:

1. Select the fork in the sidebar.
2. In the tab labeled with the names of the parent element and the fork, select the fork's name.
3. Edit the fork's name.
4. Select anywhere outside the name or label to save your changes.

## View fork information

Fork information shows details about forks and the users who have created them. You will be able to identify the users who are actively consuming and contributing to your APIs.

To view a list of users who have forked a collection or environment, select the number next to <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-fork-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Fork**.

<img alt="View the fork information count" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/fork-information-count-v11.jpg" />

To access the list of forks for a collection or environment, do the following:

1. Select <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-fork-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Forks** in the right sidebar.
2. Select the fork name.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also select the user's avatar under **Forks** to view the user's public profile.
   </Info>

   <img alt="View the list of forks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/fork-information-list-v10.jpg" width="280px" />

## Pull updates from a parent element

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Forked multi-protocol collections don't support pulling updates, merging changes, or resolving conflicts.
</Info>

You can pull updates from a parent element into a fork without going through the [pull request process](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/).

1. Hover over the fork in the sidebar.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to its name.
3. Select **Pull changes**.
4. Review the diff and select **Pull changes**.

   <img alt="Pull changes into fork" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/pull-changes-v10.jpg" />

To pull updates from a parent element during the pull request process, see [Pulling updates during a pull request](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#pull-updates-during-a-pull-request).

## Merge changes from a fork

If you have Editor access on the element, you can *merge* a fork into the parent element without going through the [pull request process](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/). For example, if you're using forks to organize the work in your workspace, you can merge changes in a fork directly back into the parent element. If you're collaborating with others, merging directly lacks the safeguards built into the pull request process. Many teams require pull requests as part of their [version control workflow](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/).

To merge changes from a fork without opening a pull request, do the following:

1. Hover over the fork in the sidebar.

2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to its name.

3. Select **Merge changes**.

4. Review the diff and select **Merge All Changes**.

   ![Merge Fork](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/merge-fork-collection-change-v10.jpg)

5. Select one of the following merge options:

   * **Merge changes** - Merge the changes into the parent element. This doesn't make any changes to the fork. You must have Editor access to the parent element.
   * **Merge changes and update source** - Merge the changes into the parent element. Any differences in the parent element are also made to the fork. You must have Editor access to both the parent and forked elements.
   * **Merge changes and delete source** - Merge the changes into the parent element. After the merge process is complete, Postman deletes the fork. You must have Editor access to both the parent and forked elements.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/merge-fork-options-v9.12.jpg" alt="Merge Fork Options" />

6. Select **Merge**.

To merge changes during the pull request process, see [Merge changes from a pull request](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#merge-changes-from-a-pull-request).

## Resolve conflicts from a fork

A merge conflict happens when you try to merge changes into an updated parent element and Postman isn't able to automatically resolve the differences between the two. If there's a conflict when you try to merge a fork, you'll need to decide how you want to resolve it before continuing.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Merge conflicts can involve changes in more than one workspace.
</Info>

To resolve a merge conflict from a fork, do the following:

1. Begin the merge process described in [Merge changes from a fork](#merge-changes-from-a-fork).

2. Select **Pull the changes** for any conflict.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/conflicts-pull-changes-v10-2.jpg" alt="Pull Changes" />

3. For each conflict, choose the version you want to include when you merge. Select **Keep Source** to keep the change on the parent element. Select **Keep Destination** to keep the change on your fork. You can also select the version you want to keep for each conflict.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/conflicts-keep-source-or-destination-v10-2.jpg" alt="Pull Changes" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To keep all changes on your fork, select **Keep all changes to source**. To keep all changes on the parent element, select **Keep all changes to destination**.
</Info>

After you resolve the conflicts, select **Pull changes** to [pull the updates](#pull-updates-from-a-parent-element).


# Create a pull request to contribute to an element you forked

You can contribute to a collection or environment you forked with a *pull request* (Postman Flows doesn't support this feature). When you create a pull request, you ask others to review your changes to the element you forked. These reviewers can add comments to the request and approve your changes before your merge them. This is an example of version control.

By default, approvals are optional. If you're on the Postman Professional or Enterprise plan, you can make approvals required.

## Create pull requests

You can create a pull request to merge changes made in a forked collection or environment.

Reviewers must be able to access the source element to review your pull request. If the parent element is in a public workspace that's not in your Postman team, you must [move the source element](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces) to a public workspace. You'll be notified if reviewers can't access the source element when you create a pull request. In the notification, you can select **Move Collection** or **Move Environment** to move the source element to a public workspace.

To create a pull request, do the following:

1. Hover over the element in the sidebar.

2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to its name.

3. Select **Create pull request**.

4. Select **Changes** to review the changes in the pull request.

   ![Pull Request Changes](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pull-request-changes-v11.jpg)

   * If the parent element has any changes since you last updated your fork, you can [pull those changes](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#pull-updates-during-a-pull-request) into your fork before merging.

   * If there are any conflicts between the fork and the parent element, Postman highlights them so you can [resolve them](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#resolve-conflicts-from-a-pull-request).

5. Select **Overview**, and enter a title and description for your pull request.

6. Select up to 50 reviewers or [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) from the dropdown list. Reviewers and user groups must have [Editor access](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles) for the parent element to merge your changes.

7. Select **Create Pull Request**.

   <img alt="Create Pull Request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pull-request-overview-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

[Postman notifies the reviewers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#review-pull-requests) you selected about your pull request. You will receive a notification if the reviewers [comment on](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/#comment-on-a-pull-request), [approve](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#approve-a-pull-request), or [merge](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/reviewing-pull-requests/#merge-changes-from-a-pull-request) the pull request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A reviewer or group must have the Editor role for the element to merge changes. If you add a user or group that doesn't have Editor access as a reviewer, there will be a warning icon next to the name. Reviewers and groups with the Viewer role can approve PRs, but can't merge PRs.

  <img alt="Reviewer permission" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/pull-request-reviewer-permission.jpg" width="280px" />
</Info>

## Pull request settings

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Pull request settings are available with [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can you manage permissions for reviewers and assign merge checks from the pull request settings.

### Manage reviewer permissions

1. Hover over the element in the sidebar.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to its name.
3. Select **Share**.
4. (Optional) Enter the names of team members and [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) in the workspace to add to the element.
5. Select **Editor** role next to the name. Select **Invite** if you're adding for the first time. Otherwise, update the role. You can also select **Remove** to remove a team member or user group from the element.

   <img alt="Manage Roles" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/manage-roles-collection-v11.33.jpg" />

### Assign merge checks

For collections, you can assign merge checks before approving changes.

There are two different types of checks that you can enable for a pull request:

* **Approved once** - You need at least one approval to merge the pull request.
* **Approved by a collection editor** - You need the approval of a user who has [Editor access for the collection](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) to merge the pull request.

To set merge checks for pull requests on a specific collection, do the following:

1. Select the collection.
2. Select <img alt="Merge icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-merge-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Pull Requests** in the right sidebar.
3. Select <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View merge conditions**.
4. Select the merge checks that you want to set for the collection.

   <img alt="Merge Check" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/manage-roles-set-merge-checks-v11.jpg" />

If the merge conditions for a pull request aren't met, the option to **Merge** it into the parent collection will be inactive.

<img alt="Merge option isn't active" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/view-merge-conditions-v9.12.jpg" width="280px" />

For information about the pull request's merge conditions, select **View Merge Conditions**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Sharing collection JSON files using a public link has been deprecated. No new links can be generated, and existing links can't be modified or edited. Users can still access any existing collection JSON links.

  To share a collection in JSON format, you can use the Postman API. To learn more, see [Share using the Postman API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-using-the-postman-api).
</Info>

The dashboard's **Collection JSON Links** tab displays all the collections with existing JSON links.

A Community Manager or Super Admin can view or delete a collection JSON link. In addition to the collection name, the dashboard displays more information about the date the link was updated on, who updated the link, and the JSON link.


# Workspaces overview

Workspaces enable you to organize your Postman work and collaborate with teammates. You can group your projects together, with workspace acting as the single source of truth for related APIs, collections, environments, mocks, monitors, and other linked elements. By collaborating in a workspace, your edits sync with your team in real time.

## Workspace types

With a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/account/overview/) you can create the following types of workspaces:

* **Internal** - [Internal workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/overview/) are visible to you and your team. [Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) enable you to add specific team members. If you're on an Enterprise team, [Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) also have access to any internal workspaces created within the team.
* **Partner** - Invited team users and [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) can access Partner Workspaces ([Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).
* **Public** - [Public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) enable you to collaborate on elements with anyone across the world and leverage the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

You can change the type of your workspace at any time, by going to the workspace settings and selecting **Workspace type > Change**. Explore [Postman Best Practices for different types of workspaces](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/) for guidance on setting up workspaces for internal, partner, and public API collaboration.

<img alt="Change workspace visibility" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/change-workspace-visibility-v11.jpg" />

To add more users to your workspace, select **Invite** in the Postman header.

Learn more about [creating workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/). To learn how workspace permissions are managed, see [Manage internal workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/).


# Create a workspace in Postman

When you first sign in to Postman, an [internal workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/) is automatically created for you. You can create a blank workspace or populate your new workspace with the files from your local Git repository. If you consent to Postman's Terms of Service, you can use AI to create your API content. Later on, you can [apply a template](#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) to add sample collections and environments for API development, API testing, and other use cases.

## Create a new workspace

You can start a new Postman workspace in the following ways:

* Select **Workspaces** in the header, then click **Create Workspace**.

  ![Start a new workspace](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-workspace-from-dropdown-v11.74.png)

* Click **New** in the sidebar, then select **Workspace**.

  ![Create a new workspace from the sidebar](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-workspace-v11.74.png)

* Click **Create Workspace** in the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard).

  ![Create new workspace dashboard](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-workspace-dashboard-v11.74.png)

Then, follow these steps to configure a workspace:

1. Enter a **Name** for your workspace.

2. Select an **Internal**, **Partner**, or **Public** workspace type. Learn more about [workspace types](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/#workspace-types).

   <Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
     * ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) If your [team is restricting creation of internal workspaces with team access](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#manage-team-workspaces), users who don't have permission can raise a request to create an internal workspace with team access, which goes for approval to [users who have access to approve such requests](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
     * If you choose to create a public workspace and you don't have an admin role, you'll be prompted to request access.
   </Warning>

3. Select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace, or **From a Git repository** to sync and version control your existing local files. You can also use natural language to populate your workspace. For example, you can ask it to create an API based on an existing public collection. Learn more about Postman's [Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/).

   <Note title="Note">
     If you create a blank workspace, you can [apply a template](#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) or [connect it to your Git project](/docs/agent-mode/native-git/) later.
   </Note>

4. Select who has access to your workspace: everyone in your team or only you and the people you invite.

5. Select **Create Workspace**.

You can add new elements and invite other people to your workspace.

## Apply a template to a workspace

You can apply a template to an existing workspace. Workspace templates are available for a variety of common use cases, including API demos, engineering onboarding, and API testing.

When you apply a workspace template, it populates the workspace description with an introduction and information to help you get started. Each workspace template also includes sample collections and environments that you can use and change as needed. To use a template, [create a new workspace](#create-a-new-workspace) or open a newly created workspace.

To use a template in a newly created blank workspace, do the following:

1. In the workspace overview, select **Explore workspace templates**.
2. Select a template from the list in the sidebar, then select **Apply Template**.

You can also enhance your workspace with other templates. Go to **Collections** in the sidebar, then select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Create new collection > <img alt="Template icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-template-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> Collection template**.

After you create a workspace, you can use the workspace to collaborate with your team.

* To learn more about what you and your team can do with workspaces, see [Use Postman workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/) and [Manage Postman workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/). You can also learn more about [public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) and [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/).
* You can also use your workspace [activity feed](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#view-workspace-activity) to keep up to date with progress on the projects within it.


# Collaborate with your team in Postman

Internal workspaces let you organize your work in Postman and collaborate privately with your team. You can set them to be visible by you only or your team. Once you're ready, you can share them with your [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) or [the world](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/).

Learn the basics about [using workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/), such as tagging, watching, and checking who's in your workspace. [Customize](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/) your workspace and decide how you'd like them to be shared.

You can also learn how to [share workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/) to keep your team and your users aware of your API changes.


# Use Postman workspaces

When you first open Postman, you'll land in your default internal workspace. You can [create more workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) for your use and to work with teammates. To create more workspaces, you need to sign in to your [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/account/overview/).

After you access your workspace, you can [tag](#tag-a-workspace), [favorite](#favorite-and-discover-a-workspace), and [connect](#connect-your-workspace-to-internal-team-channels) your workspace to team channels. You can also select to [watch](#watch-a-workspace) a workspace, [pin collections](#pin-collections-to-workspaces), check your [workspace activity](#view-workspace-activity), and more.

## Access a workspace

To open a workspace, select **Workspaces** in the Postman header. Select a workspace to open it, or select **View all workspaces** for a list of all available workspaces. This will only display workspaces that you have access to, based on the [workspace visibility](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) and your [workspace role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles).

<img alt="New Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/view-workspaces-v11.74.png" />

The workspace's **Overview** tab displays a description and summary of the workspace, and any [pinned](#pin-collections-to-workspaces) collections. On the right, you’ll find a list of workspace contributors and the option to [view workspace activity](#view-workspace-activity). If you decide to make your workspace public, you can add [featured](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#feature-collections-in-public-workspaces) collections.

<img alt="Workspace overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-overview-v11-19.jpg" />

To learn more about access management, go to [Request and approve access to Postman resources](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/).

## Tag a workspace

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Tagging workspaces is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can apply shared tags to workspaces, collections, and APIs. Tags must be between two and 64 alphanumeric characters, starting with an alphabetical character, and contain only dashes and no spaces. You can add up to five tags. Adding shared tags to workspaces enables you to organize and search for workspaces.

Once you add tags to the workspace, you can select a tag to open search results associated with the tag in a new tab.

To learn more about searching using tag names in Postman, see [Search Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#search-postman). You can use tags when searching [elements in your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/use-private-network/#search-filter-and-sort). You can also use tags to search for [elements to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/#add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) and [elements to request to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#request-to-add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) to your Private API Network.

To add tags to a workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the Postman header, and then select a workspace.

2. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select the **Tags** field to edit it.

   <img alt="Add tags to a workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/add-tags-workspace-v11-19.jpg" />

3. Select an existing tag or enter a new tag. If you're adding a new tag, enter the new tag name and press **Return** or **Enter**.

   <img alt="Add new tags to a workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-new-tags-workspace-v11-19.jpg" />

Repeat these steps to add more tags.

To remove tags from a collection, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the Postman header, and then select a workspace.

2. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select the **Tags** field to edit it.

3. Select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> on the tag.

   <img alt="Remove tags from a workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/remove-tags-workspace-v11-19.jpg" />

4. Select the area outside the **Tags** field to save your changes.

## Favorite and discover a workspace

Postman enables you to star and discover workspaces you care about the most. You can preview each workspace from the workspaces dropdown and get the following metadata and options:

* Author name, owner, and elapsed activity time
* Ability to copy workspace ID, get the workspace link, and star the workspace for easier discovery

<img alt="Discover a workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-discoverability-v11.74.png" />

You can star the workspace from the workspace preview, the top right of the workspace, and the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard).

Starred workspaces appear in the top of the list of workspaces in the sidebar and workspace dropdown.

## Connect your workspace to internal team channels

Postman integrations for [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) and [Microsoft Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/) enable you to bring your API development workflow into your team channels. Learn how to connect a Postman workspace to [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/slack-app/#connect-a-postman-workspace-to-slack) or [Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/teams/teams-app/#connect-a-postman-workspace-to-teams).

To subscribe to a channel, click <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" /> <img alt="Teams icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Connect** in the workspace overview.

## Watch a workspace

Watch a workspace to receive an email or in-app notification when a team member modifies the workspace. This includes changing the workspace visibility or updating an element in the workspace.

To start watching a workspace, select <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Watch** in the workspace's **Overview** tab. Select the count next to **Watch** to access the list of people who are watching the workspace.

To access your notifications, select <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-notification-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notifications** in the Postman header. The notification list shows details about changes to workspaces you are watching. You will also receive an email with information about the change, who made it, and when.

To stop watching a workspace, select **Unwatch** in the workspace's **Overview** tab.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  By default, you are a watcher for any workspace you create. You won't receive notifications for changes you make to a workspace you're watching.
</Info>

You can also watch a [collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#watch-a-collection) and an [API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/#watching-apis) within a workspace to receive a notification when it's modified.

## Pin collections to workspaces

You can pin collections to an internal or Partner Workspace for quick access on a workspace's **Overview** tab. If you don't have any collections pinned to your workspace, select <img alt="Pin icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pin-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" /> **Pin Collections**. Otherwise, select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" /> **Add** under **Pinned collections**. Then select the collection you'd like to pin.

![Pinned collection in a workspace](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pinned-collections-v11-12.jpg)

You can choose an environment for each pinned collection you'd like to be active when it's opened from the **Overview** tab. The environment will be active in the [environment selector](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#switch-between-environments).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your workspace has pinned collections and you [convert the workspace to a public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#convert-an-existing-workspace-to-a-public-workspace), the pinned collections will be publicly [featured](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#feature-collections-in-public-workspaces) in the public workspace's **Overview** tab.
</Info>

To remove a pinned collection, hover over the collection and select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" />, then select **Remove**.

## Get the workspace ID

Sometimes you'll need your workspace ID to perform different actions like copying a workspace or setting up an environment.

To copy a workspace ID, do the following:

1. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Options** and then select **Workspace info**.
2. Select <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy workspace ID**. You can also view who created the workspace and when the workspace was last updated.

   <img alt="Workspace ID" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/find-workspace-id-v11.jpg" />

You can also hover over a workspace in the workspace dropdown and copy the workspace ID from the workspace preview. See [Favorite and discover your workspace](#favorite-and-discover-a-workspace) for more information.

## View workspace activity

Postman maintains activity feeds for workspaces. You can use it to review create, update, transfer, and delete actions made by you and your team on private and shared elements.

You can [access the activity feed in Postman](#access-the-activity-feed-from-postman). The activity feed shows information about who added or removed collections, environments, or elements from the workspace, and users that join or leave the workspace. You can [filter this information](#filter-the-activity-feed) directly within the activity feed. You can also [view who's active in your workspace](#view-who-is-in-your-workspace).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can programmatically access workspace activity feeds with the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/qq0dqop/get-a-workspace-s-activity-feed).
</Info>

### Access the activity feed from Postman

To access the activity feed in Postman, select the workspace name in the upper left. On the right, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** > **Activity log** to review the events that have occurred in the workspace.

### Filter the activity feed

Filtering the activity feed enables you to display information directly instead of having to scroll through the feed. You can choose to filter by user or by the Postman element. Select **Reset filters** to clear the filters from the activity feed.

* Filtering by a user displays the actions that user carried out. To filter by user, select **People** in the activity feed and select users. You can search for a specific user by entering their name in the search field.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    The user list only shows users that are part of the workspace, not all team members.
  </Info>

* Filtering by element displays the actions carried out on the selected element type. The available elements are **Workspace**, **API**, **Collection**, **Environment**, **Monitor**, **Mock servers**, **Specification**, and **Flows**. To filter by element, select **Elements** at the top of the activity feed and select elements. You can search for an element by entering its name in the search field.

### Export team activity to other platforms

With a Postman Basic, Professional, or Enterprise account, you can send team activity feeds to external communication channels:

* [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/)
* [Microsoft Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/)

## View who is in your workspace

The list of avatars in the Postman header shows you who's active in your workspace. If you're in an internal workspace, this list includes all active team members. The list also includes all team members who are inactive, but have visited the workspace before.

If you're in a public workspace, this list includes all active users with [public profiles](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-profile/#make-your-profile-public). It also includes users who've chosen to remain anonymous by not enabling their public profile.

<img alt="Active users in public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/presence-public-workspace-v11.jpg" width="280px" />


# Manage Postman workspaces

Whether you're a team or admin user of Postman workspaces, you have many options to establish and enhance collaboration in your workspaces. Learn more about managing the workspace roles, editing and sharing workspaces, responding to requests to create workspaces, and moving elements and whole workspaces.

To learn how to make a new workspace, go to [Create a workspace in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/). For more information about workspace usage, see [Use Postman workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, see [Create an Organization in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-org/) for slight differences in the user experience of creating workspaces in organizations.
</Info>

## Edit workspace details

A summary and description help others understand what your workspace is for. You must be a [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to edit workspace details.

On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select the workspace name and enter a new name. You can also select the summary, description, or tags ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) to edit it. You can add Markdown to the description. Select the area outside each section to save your changes.

![Edit Workspace Summary & Description](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/edit-workspace-summary-description-v11-19a.jpg)

## Change workspace visibility

The visibility setting for a workspace determines who can access it. You must be a [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles) to change the visibility for a workspace.

1. Select **Workspaces** in the Postman header, and then select a workspace.

2. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select **Settings**.

3. Select the type of the workspace:

   * **Internal** - Visible to you, your team, or specific team members you select.
   * **Partner** - Only invited team members and [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) can access ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).
   * **Public** - Everyone can view.

4. Change who can access your workspace:

   * Everyone in your company
   * Only you and invited people

   <img alt="Changing workspace visibility" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-settings-visibility-v11.33.jpg" width="439" />

5. Select **Save Changes**.

## Change workspace themes

You can customize the visual experience for your workspace members in order to:

* Denote the sensitivity level of data handled within your team's workspaces.
* Reflect team branding or corporate identity in public workspaces.
* Distinguish Partner Workspaces integrated with different third-party services or clients.
* Represent different stages of a workflow in workspaces, such as planning, development, testing, and deployment.

To change the theme, in your workspace's **Overview** tab, select the **Settings** tab and navigate to **Workspace theme**.

For **Accent color**, select a hex value to style the color of buttons and highlights for all primary actions. You can also select a **Theme color** using a color picker. Select **Apply Theme** to set the selection.

<img alt="Select a workspace theme" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-theme-v11.jpg" />

The version of the theme that your workspace members see depends on the current app theme they set. If a member selects a dark theme in the [Postman app settings](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#themes), they see a dark variant of your workspace theme. Toggle the preview to visualize both the light and dark variants of your custom workspace theme.

To restore the default theme, select **Reset to Default**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Changing the colors of the workspace theme sets the workspace user experience for all workspace visitors and overrides the colors of the [application theme](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#themes) set by workspace members. Their application theme colors are restored when they leave the workspace.
</Info>

## Share workspaces

You can invite team members, [groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/), and external users to collaborate in a workspace by navigating to the workspace and selecting **Invite** in the Postman header.

<img alt="Share workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/share-workspace-v11.62.png" />

Your ability to share workspaces with teammates depends on your [workspace role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles):

* **Workspace Admin** - Can invite Postman teammates or external users to internal and public workspaces, and assign them a workspace role. If a Workspace Admin invites an external user to a workspace, Postman shares this request with [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). Once approved, an invite to join the team is sent to the individual.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    Workspace Admins can also use the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) to invite Postman teammates to workspaces, and assign them a workspace role.
  </Info>

* **Workspace Editor** - Can invite external users to internal and public workspaces, but can't assign them workspace roles. For internal workspaces, Workspace Editors using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) can copy and share a link to the workspace with a teammate, who can then [request access to the workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/).

* **Workspace Viewer** - Can't invite teammates to internal workspaces. For internal workspaces not set to be accessed by everyone, Workspace Viewers using the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) can copy and share a link to the workspace with a teammate, who can then [request access to the workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/).

Individual team members and groups you invite are notified of your request to collaborate.

External users who aren't on your Postman team will receive an invitation to join if you're an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or [Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). On Free, Basic, and Professional plans, team members with the Developer role can invite external users as Developers automatically, without the need for approval by an Admin.

You can also invite collaborators by selecting <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy Invite Link** and sharing the link with them outside of Postman. When individuals select the link, Postman prompts them to sign in or sign up.

If you're an Admin or a Developer inviting another Developer on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan, they'll be automatically added to your team. If you aren't an Admin or a Developer, your request to add external users to your Postman team is shared with your Admins for approval.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Inviting collaborators to [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) is different from inviting them to other types of workspaces.

</Info>

## Move elements to workspaces

Workspaces can contain elements such as collections, APIs, environments, mock servers, and flows. An element can exist only in a single workspace. If needed, you can move elements to a different workspace.

You must be a Super Admin or Workspace Admin to move an API, collection, environment, mock server, or flow to a workspace.

An API's collections move with the API to the new workspace. Some items related to the element you're moving won't automatically move. You must manually move or reconfigure the following in the new workspace:

* Monitors can't be moved to a new workspace. If you move a collection that has an active monitor, the associated monitor is paused and stays in the original workspace.
* If you move an environment that's associated with an element or integration, the element or integration using the environment may no longer work.

To move an element to a different workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Collections**, **APIs**, **Environments**, **Mock Servers**, or **Flows** in the sidebar.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to an element and then select **Move**.
3. Select the workspace where you want to move the element. Then select **Move** (**Collection**, **API**, **Environment**, **Mock Server**, or **Flow**).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can move elements to partner and public workspaces you have access to. You can't move elements from a partner or public workspace to an internal workspace.
   </Info>

   <img alt="Move collection to workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/move-collection-to-selected-workspace-v11.jpg" width="440" />

## Add workspaces to your Private API Network

You can also share workspaces with your teammates by adding them to your team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/). To learn more, see [Request to add a workspace from the workbench](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#request-to-add-a-workspace-from-the-workbench).

## Delete a workspace

Deleting a workspace removes the workspace and all data in it from Postman. Use caution, as once you delete a workspace it's gone forever. You must be a [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to delete a workspace.

1. Select **Workspaces** in the Postman header, and then select a workspace.
2. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select **Settings**.
3. At the bottom of the **Workspace settings** screen, select **Delete Workspace**.

   <img alt="Delete workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/delete-a-workspace-v11.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To delete a [public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/), you must first change the [workspace visibility](#change-workspace-visibility) to internal.
</Info>


# Communicate API changes using workspace updates

Workspace updates keep your team and your users aware of your API changes. API publishers can share updates across multiple collections, with links to the resources that changed. API consumers who fork or watch a workspace get notified and can engage with these updates by visiting, commenting, and reacting.

Workspace updates are available in internal, public, and partner workspaces. Users with the [Workspace Admin or Workspace Editor](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) role can post and edit workspace updates.

Find the **Updates** tab at the workspace level, between the **Overview** and the **Settings** tabs.

<img alt="Workspace updates" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-updates-v11-19.jpg" />

When you create a workspace update, give it a title and description. Then, add a tag for the type of change you've made. It's optional but recommended that you include links to updated collections, requests, or saved examples, and a change summary.

If you have a [Microsoft Teams](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/microsoft-teams/) or [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) integration configured, you can post your update to a channel.

## Post a workspace update

<Tip title="Tip">
  If you opt in to use Postman's AI features, you can click **Write with AI** to autogenerate your update based on your workspace changes.
</Tip>

To post a workspace update, do the following:

1. Open a workspace and select **Updates**.

2. If this is the first update, select **Post an Update**. Otherwise, you'll see a **Post an update** field above other updates.

   <img alt="Post an update" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-update-post-v11.80.png" />

4. Select a tag from the dropdown list: **Improvement**, **New Feature**, **Bug Fix**, **Breaking Change**, or **Announcement**.

5. (Optional but recommended) Select **Link Resource** to include links to collections, requests, and saved examples in your update.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     When you add links to collections or requests, the watchers of the collections, who may not be watching the workspace, also get notified about the update alongside workspace watchers.
   </Info>

6. (Optional) Add a summary describing the change.

7. If you've integrated Postman with Slack or Teams, you can post a team or public workspace update to a channel on one or both of those apps. Select **Post Update**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If a social channel is already subscribed to workspace updates, the checkbox next to **Share on Slack (or Teams)** on the bottom right of the post will be checked. If not, select <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" /> <img alt="Teams icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Connect** in the workspace overview to subscribe to a channel.

# Collaborate with external partners in Postman using Partner Workspaces

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Partner Workspaces are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Partner APIs are privately available APIs used for collaboration among strategic partners. They can be used to integrate data processing and syndication, in industries such as banking, healthcare, and media. [Partner Workspaces](https://www.postman.com/product/partner-workspaces/) enable you to collaborate with external partners directly in Postman.

You can use Partner Workspaces to help your partners consume your team's APIs and work together on API projects. With Partner Workspaces, you can build a single source of truth and integrate your partner projects into your Postman team, establishing the foundation for an efficient and productive partnership.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  From May 2025, you'll be able to create *team-to-team Partner Workspaces*. This update enhances security and authentication for Postman API partnerships and enables access to a Partner Workspace from one's own team. In addition to supporting SSO login for partners, Partner Managers can verify which partners use SSO from a new [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page in **Team Settings**. See the [FAQ](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/faq/) about team-to-team partnerships.
</Info>

Learn more about working in Partner Workspaces in the following pages:

* To start working in a Partner Workspace, go to [Set up a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/).
* For more information about Partner roles and managing Partner Workspaces, see [Manage Partner Workspaces in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/).
* You can also learn more about how to [collaborate in Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/collaborate/).
* For more information on using a public workspace to help increase adoption of your API, see [Postman Best Practices for Public API collaboration](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/public-api-collaboration/).

As your Partner programs grow, you need to create, maintain, and update separate workspaces with the same content for each partner. Instead, you could use *multi-partner mode*. Learn more about [collaborating with multiple partners using multi-partner mode](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/).

# Set up a Partner Workspace

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  From May 2025, you can begin creating *team-to-team Partner Workspaces*, which ensures easier and more secure collaboration between you and your partners. Your partners can use domain capture and SSO to authenticate to your Partner Workspaces and you can track your partnerships in a new team setting called [**Partnerships**](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/#manage-your-partnerships). That means no switching between teams and more control over partnerships. If you have older Partner Workspaces, they'll continue to work as-is. See the [FAQ](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/faq/) and take advantage of the [new capabilities](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/postman-app/#11-46-2).
</Info>

Learn how to create, configure, and invite collaborators to your Partner Workspace. Start by using a template or by moving your collections to a Partner Workspace. Explore the roles that enable you to invite third parties to your organization.

## Create a Partner Workspace

1. Click **Workspaces** from the header, then click **Create Workspace**.

   <img alt="Create new workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-workspace-from-dropdown-v10.23.0.jpg" />

2. You can use [workspace templates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) to help you set up a new workspace. Select a [Partner Collaboration template](https://www.postman.com/workspace/create) to populate the workspace with helpful information and sample collections, or select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace. Then click **Next**.

   <img alt="Create new Partner Workspace with a template" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-workspace-partner-template-full-screen-v11.33.jpg" width="280" />

3. Select a name for your workspace.

4. Select **Partner** as your workspace type.

5. If you're not an admin, add a note for the workspace creation approval.

6. Click **Create**.

   <img alt="Create Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-partner-workspace-v11.33.jpg" width="280px" />

Anyone with permissions to create workspaces can request to create a Partner Workspace, but it must be approved by a [Partner Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles). If no Partner Manager role is assigned, the Admin is auto-assigned the Partner Manager role when they create their first Partner Workspace.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  On Professional plans, anyone can create a Partner Workspace and the Partner Manager role isn't available.
</Info>

If you're not a [Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or Partner Manager, you must submit your request for approval. You can also add an optional note to your request. The workspace type will be set to [internal](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) until your request is approved. Postman will notify you when a Partner Manager reviews your request and approves or denies it.

To convert an existing workspace to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace. In the **Overview** tab, click **Settings**.
2. Under **Workspace types**, select **Partner**.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

Anyone with permissions to change workspace visibility can request to convert a workspace into a Partner Workspace, but it must be approved by a [Partner Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles). If you're not a [Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or Partner Manager, Postman will mention this, and you can add an optional note to your request. Postman will notify you when a Partner Manager reviews your request and approves or denies it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When a workspace is converted to a Partner Workspace, Postman sends in-app and email notifications to all workspace members.
</Info>

## Configure a Partner Workspace

Before sharing a Partner Workspace with external collaborators, you can set your partnership up for success by moving or forking relevant elements into it.

You can also use workspace templates to help set up a new Partner Workspace. For more information, see [Apply a template to a workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace).

### Move elements to a Partner Workspace

You must be a Super Admin, Workspace Admin, or Partner Manager to move an API, collection, environment, mock server, or flow to a Partner Workspace.

To move an element to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the element you want to move, then select **Move**.

2. Use the search bar to find the workspace you'd like to move the element to, or use <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Filter by visibility**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can move elements to Partner Workspaces that you have access to.
   </Info>

3. Select the workspace, then select **Move** (**Collection**, **API**, **Flow**, **Environment**, or **Mock Server**).

   <img alt="Move element Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/move-collection-to-partner-workspace-v10.jpg" />

Items related to what you're moving, such as monitors and mock servers, won't move with the element automatically. For more information, see [Move elements to workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces).

If you'd like to keep certain elements in other workspaces, you can [fork them into Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork) to help [keep them up to date](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#pull-updates-from-a-parent-element) with any changes to the parent element.

## Invite collaborators to a Partner Workspace

Workspace Admins, Partner Managers, and Partner Leads can invite Partners to Partner Workspaces. Partners must be external, third parties to your organization. When you assign a Partner the Workspace Editor role, they can edit all workspace resources in the Partner Workspace, including collections. A paid seat is consumed when you assign partners the Workspace Editor or Collection Editor roles. Learn about [adding paid seats](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/#add-partner-licenses).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[The Partner Editor role is available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans with the Partner Editor add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**

### Invite Partners to a Partner Workspace

To invite Partners to a Partner Workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace, click **Settings** in the workspace's **Overview** tab, and then click **Invite**. You can also click **Invite** in the Postman header.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Alternatively, you can copy and share the link to the Partner Workspace by clicking <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy partner link**. Invite links give Partners the Viewer role. Once the Partner accesses the workspace, you can change the role.
   </Info>

   <img alt="Invite partners via link" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/copy-partner-link-v11.73.png" />

2. (Workspace Admins and Partner Managers only) Select **Partners**, then click **Continue**.

3. Enter the name, email, or group name of the Partners.

4. Set the [workspace role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to invite a Partner as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the Partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the Partner permission to view all workspace resources. Assigning a Partner the Workspace Viewer role doesn't consume paid seats.
   </Info>

5. (Workspace Admins and Partner Managers only) Select **Make them Partner Lead** if you'd like them to also be able to manage and invite Partners within the workspace.

6. Click **Invite**.

   <img alt="Invite partners" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/invite-partner-v11.73.png" />

Partner invites must be accepted through the Postman account associated with the invited email address. If a Partner wants to use a different email address, or if an invite was sent to the wrong email, you can [revoke the invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/#manage-invites) and send a new one. An invite can't be forwarded to someone else.

The partner invite link will work for both single and multi-partner workspaces.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Pro-tip:** If you have a partner developer portal and want your Partners to test their APIs easily using Postman collections, create a multi-partner workspace, add the collections and environments, then add the Partner invite link to the portal. This will help any Partner who onboards to the developer portal to switch to Postman to try out the APIs fast.

   <img alt="Invite team members to a Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/invite-team-member-to-pw-v11.73.png" />

## Accept a Partner invite

When a Partner selects **Accept Invite** from their email, they can select a team they're part of:

* If they're part of paid Postman teams, they can choose one of those teams.
* If they're only part of free Postman teams, then they need to choose one of those teams.
* If they're an individual user, they can join as an individual Partner.
* If they don't have a Postman account, invited Partners are prompted to create one and sign up as a Partner.

If the users don't see any teams in the list, or if some teams are inaccessible, the admins of those teams have blocked the members of those teams from accepting Partner invites.


# Collaborate in a Partner Workspace

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Partner Workspaces are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

The collaborative experience that Partner Workspaces offer depends on your role and access as a Team Member or external Partner. Team Members can access Partner Workspaces they're invited to from the [**Workspaces**](https://go.postman.co/workspaces) menu by selecting **Only invited partners** from the **Access** filter. Partner Workspaces from other teams have an **External** tag. To access external workspaces, navigate to the [**Workspaces**](https://go.postman.co/workspaces) menu, select **All workspaces**, then go to the **External Workspaces** tab.

Learn how to collaborate, [keep your Partners informed](#keep-your-partners-informed-about-api-changes) about the API changes, and [fork](#fork-and-create-your-own-collection) Partner Workspace collections.

You can also learn more about [managing team-to-team partnerships](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/#manage-your-partnerships).

## Collaborate as a Team Member

Partner Workspaces are only visible to invited Team Members. Users can be assigned the team-level Partner Manager role. Partner Managers can view all Partner Workspaces within an organization, and can control their settings, visibility, and Partner invites.

## Collaborate as a Partner

*Partners* are trusted external developers and other stakeholders with whom you want to share your APIs. When an external partner is [invited to a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/#invite-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) by a team they're working with, they only have access to that Partner Workspace and can't access any other workspaces or resources within the team. Partners don't have internal workspaces within the team they're partnering with.

When Partners from domain-captured teams accept a Partner invite, they can choose their team and accept the invite. The Partner Workspace will show up in their team as an **External** workspace. To see the list of partners, go to [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners).

Partners can be assigned the following roles:

* **Partner Lead** --- Partner Leads can only invite people who are part of their own Postman team as Partners.

* **Partner Editor** --- A Partner Editor is a Partner who has Editor permissions on one or more Partner workspaces. The Partner Editor role is an add-on. For more information, see [Postman API Platform plans and pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

* **Partner Viewer** --- Workspace Admins can invite Partners as Viewers to the Partner Workspace. When you're collaborating with people who aren't part of your team, you'll recognize them by a diamond symbol over their avatar.

  <img alt="Partner Viewer options" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/partner-viewer-options-v11-2.jpg" width="280px" />

For more information about Partner roles and permissions, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

## Keep your Partners informed about API changes

API publishers can use workspace updates to communicate API changes. Suppose you set up a single Partner Workspace to work with your highly valued API consumer. When you save a change, for example, to a request, you're prompted to post a workspace update. Select **Post an update** and the **Updates** tab opens.

<img alt="Post an update nudge" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/partner-workspace-update-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

You can access workspace updates at any time by selecting the **Updates** tab on the workspace overview page. Select the workspace name on the top left, and select the **Updates** tab. To create an update, follow the instructions in [Communicate API changes using workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/).

<img alt="Post a workspace update in a Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pw-update-post-v11.73.png" />

When your Partner accesses your workspace, a notification badge appears on the **Updates** tab, signaling that there are new updates since the last visit. Your Partner can then respond with comments, questions, and other types of feedback.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Slack and Team integrations aren't available for Partner Workspaces.
</Info>

In [multi-partner mode](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/multipartner-workspaces/), API publishers can use workspace updates to broadcast API changes to multiple partners.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Commenting and replying to workspace updates is turned off in multi-partner workspaces to keep collaboration private.
</Info>

## Fork and create your own collection

When you set up a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) and collaborate with Partners, your Partners can create a [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) and take a copy to their own team. This helps Partners edit the collection privately and also collaborate with their colleagues in the Partner organization. Your Partners can then construct their own real-world API workflows using the forked collection.

Any Partner, whether they're a Viewer and Editor, can fork to their own team as long as they're on a paid Postman plan (Basic, Professional, or Enterprise). If your Partner isn't on a paid plan, and you want to provide them the ability to fork, you can assign them the Editor role in the Partner Workspace or the collection. Learn more about [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

To fork a collection as a Partner Editor, you can follow the same steps as a Partner Viewer. Partner Editors can fork to any workspace in their team where they have Editor access. Otherwise, they can as click **Request to fork** in the collection and send a request for access to the collection publisher. Workspace Admins receive the request through email. The request also displays in the workspace settings.

The email communicates that approving the request will do the following:

* Create a forked version of the collection in the same Partner Workspace.
* Assign the Partner an Editor role on the collection, which consumes a paid seat charged using [Auto-Flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) from the next billing cycle.

The Partner receives an email confirming or denying the request.

## Switch Partner Editor to Viewer role

To downgrade a Partner Editor to Partner Viewer on a collection, the Workspace Admin or Collection Editor can click **Share** <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> in the collection and update the role.

  **[Partner Workspaces are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

[Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) enable you to collaborate with your external partners and customers. You can use Partner Workspaces to demo your API products to external API partners and customers, onboard external developers faster, and reduce the time-to-first-call for your consumers.

As your partner programs grow, you need to create, maintain, and update multiple workspaces, one for each partner. *Multi-partner mode* make this workflow simpler by enabling you to use the same workspace and collaborate with multiple partners.

## Multi-partner mode

Multi-partner mode enables you to:

* Share and update Postman Collections with multiple partners without having to update a separate workspace for each partner.
* Invite your API partners and customers to understand the value and try out your APIs before going deeper into integration.
* Showcase real-world workflows and demos using your APIs.
* Maintain a reference workspace for all your API endpoints and documentation that can be shared with all your partners.

By enabling multi-partner mode in a Partner Workspace, you can create an invite-only Partner Workspace that's designed for sharing Postman Collections with multiple partners. Partners can be invited to this workspace as Viewers. They can see all the workspace content, send API requests, run collections, and generate code snippets. Team members can make edits to the workspace, which are then available to the partners in real time.

The goal of this workspace is to provide a shared space where your partners can evaluate, onboard, and integrate your APIs. A Partner user can't see other Partners and their activities in the workspace. They can see only your team members, while comments are turned off to maintain isolation between Partners.

## Enable multi-partner mode in a Partner Workspace

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Once multi-partner mode is turned on, this action can't be undone.
</Info>

To enable multi-partner mode, do the following:

1. Open an existing Partner Workspace or create a new one.

2. In the Workspace overview, select the **Settings** tab.

3. Select **Enable multi-partner mode**. The confirmation describes the key capabilities of multi-partner mode.

   <img alt="Enable multi-partner mode" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/multipartner-mode-enable-v11.50.png" />

4. Select **Enable multi-partner mode** again.

   The partners in this workspace can't see each other or make any edits. They can view all workspace resources, send API requests, run collections, and see responses.

   <img alt="Workspace shared" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/multipartner-workspace-shared-v10-22.jpg" width="280" />

The workspace **Overview** and **Settings** pages update to display that multi-partner mode is turned on. You are ready to add collections, set up the workspace, and invite partners as you would in any other Partner Workspace.

To share your work, Postman recommends that you fork collections and environments from your internal workspace to the Partner Workspace.

## Invite partners to your multi-partner workspace

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Partners can only be invited as Viewers to a multi-partner workspace. However, team members can be invited as Viewers, Editors, or Admins.
</Info>

Because Partner Viewers are free, you can invite as many partners as you want to the workspace. Partners must be external, third parties to your organization.

To invite partners to your multi-partner workspace, do the following:

1. Open the workspace and select **Invite** in the Postman header.

2. Select **Partners**. Then, select **Continue**.

3. Enter the names or emails of your partners. Alternatively, you can select **Add from file** to insert a CSV or TXT file containing contact information.

4. Select **Viewer** role.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can optionally select **Make them Partner Lead** to enable the partner to invite other partners to the workspace. However, Partner Leads can only invite other partners from their domain.
   </Info>

5. Select **Invite Partners**.

## Multi-partner workspace experience in Postman

Once you add partners to your multi-partner workspace, they'll be grouped by domain in the **Workspace settings**.

<img alt="Multi-partner view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/multipartner-workspace-partner-list-v11.50.png" />

Partners in a multi-partner workspace can only see their team members and no other partners in the avatar list and **Workspace settings**. Because they have the Viewer role, partners can only view collections and send requests. They can rediscover their activity in the sidebar **History** tab, which is kept private to them only.

## Keep your partners informed about API changes

When saving a collection, you're prompted to share an update with your partners, but even if you dismiss the nudge, you can use workspace updates to broadcast your API changes to your partners at any time.

Select **Post an update** and the **Updates** tab opens.

<img alt="Post an update nudge" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/partner-workspace-update-v11.jpg" width="352" />

You can access workspace updates at any time by selecting the **Updates** tab on the workspace overview page. Select the workspace name on the top left, and select the **Updates** tab. To create an update, follow the instructions in [Communicate API changes using workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/).

<img alt="Post a workspace update in a Partner Workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/pw-update-post-v11.35.jpg" />

When your partner accesses your workspace, a notification badge appears on the **Updates** tab, signaling that there are new updates since the last visit.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Commenting and replying to workspace updates is turned off in multi-partner workspaces to keep collaboration private.

# Manage Partner Workspaces in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Partner Workspaces are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers manage workspace settings, users, and roles within a Partner Workspace. Partner Leads also manage users and roles of partners in Partner Workspaces. Learn how to manage users and roles in a Partner Workspace and scale your collaboration by adding and updating Partner licenses and Partner Workspaces.

From May 2025, you can begin creating *team-to-team Partner Workspaces*, which ensures easier and more secure collaboration between you and your partners. Your partners can use domain capture and SSO to authenticate to your Partner Workspaces and you can track your partnerships in a new team setting called [**Partnerships**](#manage-your-partnerships). That means no switching between teams and more control over partnerships.

See the [FAQ](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/faq/) about team-to-team partnerships.

## Manage users and roles

You can assign team and Partner Workspace roles based on the functions team members and partners require. You can assign team roles for Partner Workspace roles at the [team level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/), and you can assign Partner Workspace roles at the [workspace level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles) and [collection level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-element-based-roles). Learn more about [team and Partner Workspace roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

To learn more about collaborating as a team member or partner, see [Collaborate in a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/collaborate/).

## Add Partner licenses

A paid seat is consumed when a Partner is assigned at least one Editor role (at the workspace or collection level) in at least one Partner Workspace. Assigning a Partner the Workspace Viewer or Collection Viewer role doesn't consume paid seats.

To purchase more Partner licenses, contact your Postman Account Manager or [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to [invite a partner](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/#invite-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the Partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the Partner permission to view all workspace resources. Also, your team must have available seats to assign a Partner as a Collection Editor.
</Info>

## Manage workspace elements

To move elements to a Partner Workspace, see [Move elements to a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/#move-elements-to-a-partner-workspace).

To remove elements from a Partner Workspace, see [Remove elements from a Partner Workspace](#remove-elements-from-a-partner-workspace).

## Edit workspace details

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can edit Partner Workspace details. On the workspace's Overview tab, select the workspace name, summary, or description to edit it. You can add Markdown to the description. Select **Save** when you're done.

## Manage your partnerships

API publishers [invite partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/#invite-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) using their email. When accepting the invite to collaborate, the Partner selects an existing team or creates a new one. This team is then listed on the API publisher's [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page.

To collaborate within the Partner Workspace, the Partner authenticates using their team's login method: username and password, or SSO.

From the **Partnerships** page, [Partner Managers](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles) can verify which partners use or don't use <img alt="Sso icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-sso-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **SSO** to authenticate. They can also see individual partners, who access the Partner Workspace using a Postman account.

In the header, select **Team > Team Settings**. Then, select **Partnerships**.

<img alt="Partnerships" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/partnerships-v11.45.jpg" />

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can view and control whether their members of their team can accept Partner invites from other teams.

<img alt="Partner invites" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/partner-view-v11.45.jpg" />

Use the **As a publisher** tab to view and manage the partnerships you own as a publisher. You can see all the partners invited by your team to collaborate.

The **As a partner** tab contains the list of the teams who have invited your team members as Partners to collaborate in their Partner Workspaces.

## View resources a Partner can access

A [Partner Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles) can view the Partner Workspaces and collections a Partner can access. A Partner Manager can also view the Workspace role partners are assigned in each workspace, and the Collection role partners are assigned in each collection. Open your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members) and select **View resources** next to a partner. Select a Partner Workspace or collection name to open it in a new tab.

<img alt="View Partner Workspaces and roles" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/view-partner-workspaces-and-roles-v10-3.jpg" />

## Remove elements from a Partner Workspace

You must be at least an Editor on an API, collection, or environment to remove an element from a Partner Workspace. You can also be a Workspace Admin, Partner Manager, or Super Admin to remove any element from a Partner Workspace.

To remove an element by moving it to another workspace, do the following:

1. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the element you want to move, then select **Move**.

2. Use the search bar to find the workspace you'd like to move the element to, or use <img alt="Filter icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-filter-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Filter by visibility**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can only move elements to workspaces that you have access to.
   </Info>

3. Select the workspace, then select **Move** (**Collection**, **API**, **Flow**, **Environment**, or **Mock Server**).

While not recommended, you can choose to delete an element entirely. To do so, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the element you want to remove, then select **Delete**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Deleted APIs and environments aren't recoverable. You can recover collections smaller than 30 MB for up to 90 days on an Enterprise plan. To do so, select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Trash** from the Postman footer.
</Info>

## Remove partners from a Partner Workspace

You can remove partners from individual Partner Workspaces. To remove a Partner from a Partner Workspace, see [Manage workspace roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles).

You can remove partners from a team. Removing a Partner from a team removes them from all Partner Workspaces. If you remove the last Admin from the team, users assigned the Partner Manager role will be assigned the Admin role. Also, if you remove a Partner from their last Partner Workspace, they'll be removed from the team. To remove a Partner from a team, see [Remove members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/scale-team/#remove-members).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **NEW** From May 2025, if a Partner leaves or is removed from their own team, they lose access to the Partner Workspace.
</Info>

## Delete a Partner Workspace

Workspace Admins and Partner Managers can delete Partner Workspaces.

1. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, select **Settings**.
2. [Change the type of the workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) to **Internal**.
3. Select **Remove all partners**, then select **Update**.
4. Select **Delete Workspace**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">

# Team-to-team Partner Workspaces FAQ

Starting in May 2025, you can create *team-to-team Partner Workspaces*. This update enhances security and authentication for Postman API partnerships and enables access to a Partner Workspace from one's own team. In addition to supporting SSO login for partners, Partner Managers can verify which partners use SSO from a new [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page in **Team Settings**.

Postman is automatically migrating all pre-existing Partner Workspaces to the newer team-to-team model so that you get all the latest features and security enhancements.

## FAQ about migration to team-to-team partnerships

### What happens to the legacy Partner Workspaces created before May 2025?

We are migrating these workspaces automatically to the newer team-to-team model. Once your Partner Workspaces are upgraded, both Publishers and Partners in each workspace will receive an email. No action is required from you.

### Who will receive these migration emails?

All impacted Partner Managers, Admins, and Workspace Admins will receive an email stating “Your Partner Workspaces have been migrated”. All impacted Partners will receive an email titled “Your Partner Workspace with \[Publisher Name] has been upgraded”

### When are you completing the migration?

If your team is on the Professional plan, we will migrate your workspaces mid-December. All Enterprise teams will be upgraded after the holidays in January.

### I am a Partner and I can’t access my Partner Workspace. What should I do?

You should have received an email with a link to your Partner Workspace. The email subject will be “Your Partner Workspace with \[Publisher Name] is now upgraded”. Click **Go to workspace** in the email to navigate directly to the Partner Workspace. Alternatively, you can navigate to [**Workspaces > View All Workspaces > External Workspaces**](https://www.postman.com/workspaces?tab=shared_partner) to see your Partner Workspace.

### I host a Partner Workspace and my Partner informed me that they can't access my Partner Workspace anymore

Please see the above question.

## FAQ about team-to-team partnerships

### How can I create a Partnership using Postman?

Users who want to create new team-to-team Partner Workspaces should do one of the following:

* If using the Postman desktop app, update to the [latest version](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
* Use the Postman web app, which always has the latest version.

Partners also need to access the Partner Workspace using a web browser or the latest version of the Postman app.

### How does this feature affect my team?

All new Partner Workspaces you create are team-to-team Partner Workspaces. Your existing Partner Workspaces aren't affected, and you can continue to use them and invite new Partners. Postman can help you migrate existing Partner Workspaces, but this isn't required. If you partner with developers from another Postman team, those partnerships will become more secure and seamless if you migrate your workspaces.

Partner management has been relocated in Team settings from the Members page to a new [Partnerships](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page. When access to a Partner Workspace is requested, Partner Managers and Admins receive one email per team, while Partners receive one email per workspace containing a direct link to navigate to their workspace.

Partners can now access workspaces directly from their team without switching to a partner-specific team.

### Are there any pricing changes?

There are no changes to pricing. Partner Viewers are free, and Partner Editor add-ons are charged based on the [Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#partner-editor).

### Do team-to-team Partner Workspaces support both single-partner and multi-partner configurations?

You can use a team-to-team Partner Workspace as a single or multi-partner workspace. Workspace Admins can go to the **Workspace Settings** page and turn on multi-partner mode, which prevents partners from seeing each other in the workspace. However, the Publisher team members can see all partners in the workspace.

### How does this feature make partner collaboration more secure?

In the new [**Partnerships**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/partnerships/external-partners) page under **Team > Team Settings**, Postman gives you visibility into SSO-enabled Partner access. SSO-enabled Partners log in to their own company’s Postman team using SSO authentication, ensuring secure collaboration. If at any point, this Partner leaves their organization and their Postman team, they lose access to the Partner Workspace. Therefore, access to the Partner Workspace is tied to their Postman team, not the individual.

## What if I need help or have questions?

For help or questions, you can use the following contacts:

* If you are on an Enterprise contact your Postman Customer Success Manager.
* If you are on free, Basic or Professional plans, contact [Postman Support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
* If you have questions or feedback on Partner Workspaces that you would like to share with the product team, you can email [Partner Workspaces Support](mailto:partnerapi@postman.com).


# Collaborate with the Postman community using public workspaces

Anyone in the Postman community can access a *public workspace*. A public workspace can enhance a new user's onboarding experience with your API, inspire your existing users with new use cases and resources, increase your API's discovery in Postman search results, and enable you to work publicly with partners.

## Make your team profile public

Before other Postman users can work with your team in a public workspace, your team needs to have a public team profile. A public team profile encourages other users to collaborate with you in a public workspace, enables you to ask for contributions and gather feedback, and increases your API's discovery in search results. A public team profile also shows up on the [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) manage the team profile and other team settings.
</Info>

To make your [team profile](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) public, do the following:

1. In the upper-right corner of Postman next to your avatar, select **Team > Team settings**.
2. Select **Team profile**.
3. Select **Make team profile public** to set the profile to public.

For information on how to create a public profile, see [Edit your publisher team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#edit-your-public-profile).

## Create a public workspace

You can create a public workspace to share your workspace and its elements with the Postman community on the Postman API Network.

Make sure to never expose secrets, such as API keys, in your public workspaces. The [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/) scans your public workspaces to detect any exposed secrets.

To create a public workspace, do the following:

1. Select **Workspaces** from the header, then select **Create Workspace**.

   <img alt="Create new workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-workspace-from-dropdown-v10.23.0.jpg" />

2. You can use [workspace templates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) to help you set up a new workspace. Select a workspace template to populate the workspace with helpful information and sample collections, or select **Blank workspace** to create an empty workspace. Then select **Next**.

   <img alt="Create new workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-workspace-and-apply-template-full-screen-v10-2.jpg" />

3. Select a unique name for your workspace. You can't have two public workspaces with the same name.

4. Select **Public** as your workspace type.

5. If you're not an admin, add a note for the workspace creation approval.

6. Select **Create**.

   <img alt="Create public workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/create-public-workspace-v11.33.jpg" width="280px" />

## Convert an existing workspace to a public workspace

As a [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles), you can convert an existing workspace to a public workspace. If you're on a [Postman Professional or Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), making a workspace public requires a [Community Manager's](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) approval. Once you make a workspace public, all elements within that workspace become publicly available on the Postman API Network.

Before you convert your workspace to a public workspace, make sure you aren't exposing any secrets. You can give your API consumers a placeholder [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope) or [vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#set-a-value-for-a-vault-secret-that-doesnt-exist) (recommended). Learn how [the Secret Scanner scans your public workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).

Postman sends in-app and email notifications to all workspace members when the workspace is made public. To view your in-app notifications, select the notification icon <img alt="Changelog icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-notification-bell-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> in the Postman header.

To convert an existing workspace to a public workspace with a Postman Free or Basic plan, do the following:

1. Open the workspace. In the **Overview** tab, select **Settings**.
2. Under **Workspace types**, select **Public**.
3. Select **Save Changes**.

To convert an existing workspace to a public workspace in a Postman Professional or Enterprise plan, do the following:

1. Open the workspace. In the **Overview** tab, select **Settings**.
2. Under **Workspace type**, select **Change**.
3. Select **Public**.
4. Enter a note for approval.
5. Select **Submit Request**.

   <img alt="Request visibility change" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/public-workspace-request-v11.33.jpg" />

   This sends a request to team members with the Community Manager role for their approval, and triggers the [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/). The workspace's visibility will be set to [internal](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) until it's [approved](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#approve-workspace-creation-requests).

   While you're waiting for the request to be reviewed, you can check the status of the secret scan or cancel the request from the workspace settings.

## Feature collections in public workspaces

You can feature collections in a public workspace to give API consumers quick access to specific collections. On a public workspace's **Overview** tab under **Featured collections**, select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" /> **Add**, then select the collection you'd like to feature.

![Featured collection in public workspace](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/featured-collections-v11-12.jpg)

You can choose an environment for each featured collection you'd like to be active when it's opened from the **Overview** tab. The environment will be active in the [environment selector](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#switch-between-environments).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you don't feature any collections in a public workspace, Postman will automatically feature popular collections in the public workspace.
</Info>

To remove a featured collection, hover over the collection and select <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" />, then select **Remove**.

## Invite collaboration on a public workspace

An informative and inviting public workspace can help increase adoption of your APIs. To invite collaboration from other users on your public workspace, you need to have:

* A complete [public team profile](#make-your-team-profile-public).
* A complete [workspace overview](#edit-public-workspace-details), including a name, summary, and description.
* Descriptive [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) for your APIs.

Signs of a public workspace that invites collaboration include:

* **Active forks of your workspace** - The number of people who [fork your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) and work on their forks shows strong collaborator engagement.
* **People watching your workspace** - The number of people who [watch your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#watch-a-workspace) for activity can reflect interest from potential collaborators.
* **Recent activity on the workspace** - A [workspace activity feed](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#view-workspace-activity) that shows ongoing work reassures potential collaborators that your team updates and maintains the workspace.

For more information on using a public workspace to help increase adoption of your API, see [Increasing adoption of an API with a public workspace](https://blog.postman.com/increasing-adoption-of-an-api-with-a-public-workspace/) on the Postman blog.

### Share a public workspace

You can share a public workspace by giving collaborators its **workspace URL** directly.

To access a workspace's URL, do the following:

1. Go to the workspace **Overview** page.

2. Select <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy link to workspace** next to the workspace name to copy the workspace's URL to your clipboard.

   <img alt="Copy link to workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/copy-workspace-link-v10.jpg" />

3. Share the workspace URL with others.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you share a workspace with Postman users who aren't team members, its visibility must be public. If the workspace is an internal workspace, users who don't have access won't be able to open it.
</Info>

## Announce your workspace updates

Keep the watchers of your workspace and collection informed about any changes to your APIs. You can share updates across multiple collections and link to the specific request, collection, or folder that changed. These watchers get notified and can engage with these updates by commenting and reacting.

### Post an update

To post a workspace update, do the following:

1. Open a workspace and select the **Updates** tab. If this is the first update, select **Post an Update**. Otherwise, you'll see a **Post an update** field above other updates.

2. Enter your update's title and description.

3. Select a tag from the dropdown list: **Improvement**, **New Feature**, **Bug Fix**, **Breaking Change**, or **Announcement**.

4. (Optional) Select **Link a Resource** to include links to collections, requests, and saved examples in your update.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     When you add links to collections or requests, the watchers of the collections, who may not be watching the workspace, are notified about the update alongside workspace watchers.
   </Info>

5. If you've integrated Postman with Slack, you can post a workspace update to a channel. Select **Post Update**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If a Slack channel is already subscribed to workspace updates, the checkbox next to **Share on Slack** on the bottom right of the post will be checked. If not, select <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Connect** in the workspace overview to subscribe to a channel. Ensure the box is checked to send notifications when someone posts a workspace update. To learn more, visit the [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/slack-app/) integrations page.
   </Info>

![Posting a public workspace update](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/workspace-post-update-v11-38.jpg)

Your API consumers can respond to a workspace update by adding a comment or reacting with an emoji response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Teams can connect up to 10 Slack channels to a single public workspace.

# Design and build your APIs in Postman

Postman offers a variety of ways to [design and develop your APIs](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-lifecycle/). Use Postman Collections to add types to your HTTP requests that define parameters, headers, and body data. You can define your API's structure with Spec Hub in an API specification, and generate a collection from the specification to share with your consumers. Use the API Builder to define your API's structure in an API definition, linking Postman elements that help you design and test your API. You can also create a mock server that simulates your API's requests and responses before it's production ready.

## Design APIs with collections

You can use types to design and test your APIs with the Postman Collection format. Types help your team and API consumers send valid API requests, so they get successful responses instead of errors. Define types, such as data type and possible values, for your request parameters, headers, and body data in an HTTP collection. Postman then validates your requests using the defined types and identifies possible issues. Types also display in the collection's documentation.

You can generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification from an HTTP collection. Postman automatically creates a specification with paths, components, and more based on the collection. You can keep the specification in sync with your latest changes to the collection.

Learn more at [Design your APIs with Postman Collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/).

## Design APIs with specifications

With Spec Hub, you can design your API's structure in an OpenAPI 3.0 or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification. Postman identifies syntax errors and API governance issues as you edit your API specification. You can also view a live preview of the documentation that's generated from the API specification in the right sidebar.

You can generate an HTTP collection from an API specification. Postman automatically creates a collection with folders, requests, and response examples based on the specification. If the collection was generated from an OpenAPI 3.0 specification, you can keep the collection in sync with your latest changes to the specification.

Learn more at [Design API specifications in Postman](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/).

## Develop APIs with the API Builder

You can use the API Builder to design your API's structure in an API definition. Build out your API by connecting various Postman elements, such as collections, documentation, and tests. Postman validates requests in linked collections using your API definition. Postman also identifies syntax errors as you edit your API definition. You can also use Git-based version control for developing and managing changes to your API, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps.

Integrate Postman with an API gateway to track your API deployment status and history, such as Amazon API Gateway, Apigee X, and Azure API Management. You can also integrate your API with observability tools to view application performance management (APM) metrics from New Relic or Datadog inside Postman.

Learn more at [Develop APIs with the API Builder in Postman](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/).

## Configure and use a Postman mock server

Use a mock server to simulate your API's endpoints without having to configure a real API server. Make calls to the mock server that return responses to test your API or test new functionality before it's production ready. By default, mock servers return status responses defined in saved examples, but you can also configure a mock server to generate dynamic responses.

Learn more at [Simulate your API in Postman with a mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/overview/).


# Design your APIs with Postman Collections

Define types in your collection to add more details to request parameters, headers, and bodies in an HTTP collection. Define types such as data type, format, and possible values. You can also specify if a component is required. Before you send a request, Postman checks it using the defined types and identifies possible issues. All the details appear in the collection's documentation for both API developers and consumers.

Types are available for HTTP collections with `application/json` type request and response bodies. It isn't available for other request protocols or body types.

When you're ready to verify the quality of your APIs and deploy to an API gateway, generate an API specification from your collection and keep them in sync.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Types aren't supported in collections [connected to Git repository](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/collections/overview/).
</Info>

## Define types in your collections

You can define types in your requests that describe your API. This enables you to design and test your APIs using the Postman Collection format you're familiar with. Types can help your team and API consumers understand your API and send valid requests. Learn how to [add types to parameters and headers](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-parameters-and-headers/).

You can also add body data to a request or saved example and generate a schema from the body data. The schema includes types based on the body data. Optionally, you can add descriptions or specify required types. Learn how to [add types to body data](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-body-data/).

## View types and documentation

Your team and API consumers with access to a collection with defined types can view them in the collection and its documentation. Postman notifies you if the request parameter, header, or type in the body data is required to send the request. You can also hover over a parameter, header, or type in the body data to learn more.

Before you send a request, Postman checks the value against the defined types and notifies you if the value isn't valid. Also, anyone with access to the collection can view details associated with your parameters, headers, and bodies in your collection's documentation.

Learn how to [view types and documentation in a collection](/docs/design-apis/collections/view-properties-and-documentation/).

## Generate a specification from a collection

Once you've designed and tested your APIs in a collection, automatically generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification in [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). You can use the specification to check your APIs' quality and deploy to an API gateway. Generated specifications have paths, components, and more based on your collection. Postman recommends that you add types to the collection to generate a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

When you make changes to the collection, update the generated specification with your latest changes. This ensures team members relying on the specification can access the latest iteration of your APIs.

Learn how to [generate a specification from a collection and keep them in sync](/docs/design-apis/collections/generate-specifications/).


# Add types to parameters and headers with an API collection

You can add types to [parameters](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) and [headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/#configure-request-headers). Types can include data type, format, default value, and possible values. You can also specify if a component is required. Details you add will appear in the [collection's documentation](/docs/design-apis/collections/view-properties-and-documentation/#view-documentation-for-a-collection-with-types).

To add types to a parameter or header, do the following:

1. Open a request and click the **Params** or **Headers** tab. Add any [parameters](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/) or [headers](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/#configure-request-headers) as needed.

2. Hover over a query or path parameter or a header and click <img alt="Manage icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-manage-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Type**.

   ![Add types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-add-properties-v11-59.jpg)

3. Specify details for the parameter or header:

   * **Type** - Select the component's data type (string, integer, number, or boolean).
   * **Required** - Turn on if the component is required, or turn off if it's optional.
   * **Deprecated** - Turn on if the component is deprecated. A deprecated parameter or header is still functional, but its usage is discouraged because support may be discontinued.
   * **Default value** - Specify the default value for the component.
   * **Possible enum values** - (All data types except boolean) Enter the allowed values for the component (enumerations), and press **Return** or **Enter** after each item. You can also paste in a comma-separated list, such as "red,green,blue", and Postman adds each value.

   <img alt="Define types for a component" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-define-properties-v11-59.jpg" width="280px" />

4. Specify optional details depending on the component type:

   * Type **string**:

     * **Format** - Select the data format for the string (for example, date, time, or email).
     * **Pattern** - Enter allowed data patterns for the component using regex (regular expressions). You can't enter a pattern if you selected a format for the string.
     * **Min length** - Enter the minimum length for the component.
     * **Max length** - Enter the maximum length for the component.

   * Type **integer** or **number**:

     * **Min value** - Enter the minimum value for the component.
     * **Max value** - Enter the maximum value for the component.

5. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save** to save the changes to your request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you [generated a specification](/docs/design-apis/collections/generate-specifications/#generate-openapi-specifications-from-a-collection) from a collection, make sure to [update the specification](/docs/design-apis/collections/generate-specifications/#keep-openapi-specifications-in-sync-with-a-collection) once you're done making changes.
</Info>


# Add types to body data with an API collection

You can add [body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#send-body-data-with-requests) to your API requests to send a data payload along with the request. You can also add a response body to [saved request examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to show valid responses for different use cases. Generate a schema from the raw (JSON) body for a request or from the response body for a saved example. Then add more details to the schema using types, like a default value or description. Details appear in the [collection's documentation](/docs/design-apis/collections/view-properties-and-documentation/#view-documentation-for-a-collection-with-types).

As you work on requests, Postman [suggests and autocompletes values](#edit-and-validate-body-data) based on the body schema. Postman also identifies any issues and possible fixes.

## Add body data types

You can generate a schema from request body data. You can also generate a schema from response body data in a saved example.

To generate a schema from body data, do the following:

1. Choose one of the following options:

   * Open a request and click the **Body** tab, then select the **raw** option. Make sure **JSON** is selected in the format dropdown list.
   * Open a saved example and, in the response pane, click the **Body** tab and make sure **JSON** is selected in the format dropdown list.

2. Add JSON body data to [the request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/#raw-data) or add a JSON response body to [the saved example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/#edit-an-example) as needed.

3. Click <img alt="Sliders icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/icon-sliders-v11.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> **Schema** in the workbench to show the schema pane.

</Info>

## Edit and validate body data

After generating a schema from body data, Postman offers autocomplete suggestions as you edit body data. Postman suggests properties and valid values based on the body schema.

Postman also checks keys and values you enter in the body data against the body schema. If the value isn't valid, Postman flags the issue in the body data with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip about the issue and a possible fix. This enables you to fix any issues before you send the request.

![Body data autocomplete](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-body-autocomplete-v11-57.jpg)

Add more types to the body schema to add more autocomplete suggestions and flag more issues:

* [Data type](#add-data-type)
* [Format](#add-format)
* [Description](#add-descriptions)
* [Required](#add-required-data)
* [Deprecated](#add-deprecated-data)
* [Default](#add-default-values)
* [Enum](#add-enums)
* [Pattern](#add-a-data-pattern)
* [Min and max length](#add-minimum-and-maximum-lengths)
* [Min and max value](#add-minimum-and-maximum-values)

## Add data type

You can add the data type in the schema. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `type` as the key and the data type as the value.

Accepts the following values: `array`, `boolean`, `integer`, `null`, `number`, `object`, and `string`.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri"
}
```

If a type doesn't match the specified data type, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip with the allowed values.

## Add format

You can add the data format for a string in the schema. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `format` as the key and the data format as the value.

Accepts the following values: `date`, `date-time`, `time`, `duration`, `email`, `hostname`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `uri`, `uuid`, `regex`, `json-pointer`, and `relative-json-pointer`.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri"
}
```

If a property doesn't match the specified data format, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip with the allowed values.

## Add descriptions

You can add descriptions to properties in the schema. Descriptions help others understand the purpose and usage of each property. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `description` as the key and the description as the value.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri",
    "description": "The base URL of the service"
}
```

When you hover over a property in the body of the request or saved example, the description appears as a tooltip.

![View type tooltip](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/type-definition-body-tooltip-v11-57.jpg)

## Add required data

You can specify in the generated schema whether one or more properties in the body are required. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `required` as the key and a comma-separated list of the required properties as the value.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "enabled": {
            "type": "boolean",
            "description": "The status of the service"
        },
        "baseUrl": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uri",
            "description": "The base URL of the service"
        },
    },
    "required": ["enabled", "baseUrl"]
}
```

If a required property is missing from the body data, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip about the issue.

## Add deprecated data

If a property is deprecated, you can specify this in the generated schema. A deprecated property is still functional, but its usage is discouraged because support may be discontinued. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `deprecated` as the key and a boolean value ("true" or "false").

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri",
    "deprecated": true
}
```

## Add default values

If a property has a default value, you can specify this in the generated schema.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri",
    "default": "https://wwww.example.com"
}
```

When you click the autocomplete suggestion for a property, the default value is automatically added to the request body.

## Add enums

If a property has one or more allowed values, you can specify this in the generated schema. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `enum` as the key and a comma-separated list of the allowed values as the value.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri",
    "enum": ["http://wwww.example.com", "www.example.com"]
}
```

If a property isn't using one of the allowed values in the body data, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip with the allowed values.

## Add a data pattern

You can add allowed data patterns for a string using regex (regular expressions). In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `pattern` as the key and a regular expression as the value.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^https"
}
```

If a property doesn't match the format specified in the regular expression, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip about the issue.

## Add minimum and maximum lengths

You can add the minimum and maximum amount of characters for a string in the schema. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `minLength` or `maxLength` as the key and a non-negative integer as the value.

```json
"baseUrl": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": "uri",
    "minLength": 15,
    "maxLength": 25
}
```

If a property has too many or too few characters according to the specified length, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip about the issue.

## Add minimum and maximum values

You can add the minimum and maximum values for an integer or number in the schema. In the schema pane, add a new key-value pair with `minimum` or `maximum` as the key and a number as the value.

```json
"age": {
    "type": "number",
    "minimum": 0,
    "maximum": 45
}
```

If a property is greater than or less than the specified value, Postman flags the issue with an orange underline. Hover over the underlined code to view a tooltip about the issue.


# View types and documentation for an API collection

Anyone with access to a collection with types can view them for parameters, headers, and body data. They can also view types in [the collection's documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/viewing-documentation/#viewing-documentation-for-a-collection).

Knowing more details about a requests in a collection, such as a parameter's type or if a header is required, can help others better understand your API. It can also help consumers send valid API requests, so they get successful responses instead of errors.

## View types for parameters, headers, and body data

You can view types for parameters, headers, and body data in a collection. If you enter a value that isn't valid, Postman flags it with an orange underline. Hover over the text or variable with the orange underline to view a tooltip about the issue. This enables you to fix any issues before you send the request.

Open a request and click the **Params** or **Headers** tab. Click an empty value for a query or path parameter or a header to view more details. For example, more details may include the accepted values and default value. A red asterisk next to the key indicates that it's required. The component type, like **string**, also displays next to the key.

You can [generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification from a collection](#generate-openapi-specifications-from-a-collection) in [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). Generated specifications enable you to complete the API lifecycle by integrating your API with downstream systems, such as API gateways or security scanners. You can also [keep the specification in sync](#keep-openapi-specifications-in-sync-with-a-collection) with its collection.

Add types to [parameters and headers](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-parameters-and-headers/) and [body data](/docs/design-apis/collections/add-properties-to-body-data/) that describe your APIs. This way Postman can generate a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification in Spec Hub. Learn more about [types in collections](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/).

To learn more about generating and syncing specifications, see [Sync collections and specifications reference](/docs/design-apis/sync-specifications-reference/).

## Generate OpenAPI specifications from a collection

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't generate OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.1 specifications from a collection.
</Info>

You can generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification from your collection. Postman automatically creates a specification with paths, components, and more based on your collection. The specification will also have types associated with parameters, headers, and body data if types are defined in the collection.

To generate a specification from a collection, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-collection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collections** in the sidebar.
2. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a collection, then select **More > Generate specification**.
3. Enter a name for the specification.
4. Select **YAML** or **JSON** as the file format in the generated specification.
5. Click **Generate Specification**.

To view the generated specification, open the collection's overview, and then click the specification's name under **Specification**. You can also click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar and select the specification.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of specifications in your team's internal workspaces. Learn more about [resource usage in Postman](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#specifications).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can only generate one API specification from the same collection. To generate a new specification from the collection, [delete the generated specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/create-a-specification/#delete-a-specification) from Spec Hub.
</Info>

## Keep OpenAPI specifications in sync with a collection

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Syncing isn't available for collections generated from AsyncAPI specifications.
</Info>

When you [generate an OpenAPI 3.0 specification](#generate-openapi-specifications-from-a-collection) from a collection, Postman creates a specification that matches the requests in the collection. If you update the collection or specification, such as by adding a new request, Postman alerts you that the generated specification isn't in sync with the collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman doesn't delete elements from a collection when you sync it with the specification. For example, if you change the name of an existing path in your specification, Postman creates a new path in your collection when it's updated. The existing path still exists with the previous name in your generated collection, and you can choose to delete the path.
</Info>

### Sync changes to a specification

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Syncing collections to [multi-file OpenAPI specifications](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/) isn't supported.
</Info>

To sync changes made in a generated collection to your OpenAPI specification, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-collection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collections**, then select the collection you want to sync.
2. In the collection's **Overview** tab, navigate to **Specifications**. An orange dot next to **Specifications** indicates that the collection isn't in sync with the specification.
3. Click **Specifications**, then click **Update** to update the generated specification.

### Sync settings

You can configure the following sync settings between collections and Open API 3.0 specifications:

* **Sync example values between Spec and Collection** - Turn this on to keep examples in the specification and values in the collection in sync.


# Design API specifications in Postman

Take an API-first approach to development with *Spec Hub* in Postman. You can create OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specifications or AsyncAPI 2.0 specifications, and you can import existing OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications into Spec Hub. Navigate using the outline view, and add new sections with snippets. Tools such as autocomplete, syntax checking, and live documentation preview help you as you work.

When you're ready to share your API, use Spec Hub to generate a Postman Collection from your API specification. You can keep the generated collection in sync with an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Team members and consumers can use these collections to explore or test your API.

## Design your API in a specification

In Spec Hub, you can [create a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/create-a-specification/) in OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 format or AsyncAPI 2.0 format. You can also [import a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/import-a-specification/) from your computer or a repository to continue building it out in Spec Hub.

[Edit your specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/edit-a-specification/) by adding new sections with pre-formatted snippets, generating a schema from a JSON body, or autocomplete suggestions. You can also organize your OpenAPI specifications into [multiple files and folders](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/). As you build out your specification, Postman identifies [syntax errors and API governance issues](/docs/design-apis/specifications/validate-a-specification/) based on your team's configured rules.

Postman also displays a [live preview of your API's documentation](/docs/design-apis/specifications/view-live-documentation/) to help you visualize your changes.

If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, you can [create reusable components](/docs/design-apis/specifications/component-library/) for OpenAPI specifications in your team's Component Library. This enables your team to maintain and standardize components in a single place. Your teammates can reuse published components in their specifications.

## Generate a collection from a specification

Once you've designed and tested your API's structure in a specification, automatically generate a collection to share with your team members and consumers. Generate a collection from your API specification to create a collection with folders, requests, and response examples based on the specification.

You can keep a collection and its specification [in sync](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections#keep-collections-in-sync-with-an-openapi-specification) if it was generated from an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. When you make changes to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, update the generated collection with your latest changes. If you make changes to the generated collection, you can update the specification to include the collection's changes. This ensures team members and consumers can explore, test, and collaborate on the latest iteration of your API.

Learn how to [generate a collection from a specification and keep them in sync](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/).


# Create a new API specification

  Note the following when using snippets with OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specifications:

  * You can't add sections using snippets if Postman identifies syntax errors in your specification. Learn how to [view and fix syntax errors in your specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/validate-a-specification/#view-syntax-errors-in-your-specification).
  * You can't use snippets to add more sections than are needed to complete the specification. For example, if an operation already has a request body, Postman prevents you from adding another request body using snippets.
</Info>

## Generate a schema from a JSON body

You can generate a new schema from a request or response body in JSON format, instead of adding a new schema using a snippet.

To generate a new schema using a JSON body, do the following:

1. Choose one of the following based on your specification's OpenAPI version:

   * **OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1** - Click **Components**, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add Schema**, then select **Generate from JSON body**.
   * **OpenAPI 2.0** - Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add Definition** then select **Generate from JSON body**.

2. In the **Enter JSON body** pane, enter a request or response body in JSON format that represents the schema you'd like to add to your specification. The JSON body will be converted into the specification's language and format in the **Generated Schema Preview** pane.

3. Click **Insert** to add the generated schema to your specification.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Note that if you're adding a generated schema to an OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specification with [multiple files and folders](#add-files-and-folders), Postman identifies the correct file to add the schema.
   </Info>

4. Add a name for your schema.

![Generate schema from JSON body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-generate-schema-from-json-v11-23.jpg)

## Add files and folders

You can add files and folders to an OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specification file to turn it into a multi-file specification. This enables you to better organize and manage your specification. Learn how to [create and manage a multi-file specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/).

## Edit your specification using autocomplete

Postman offers autocomplete suggestions as you edit your specification. Postman suggests properties and valid values based on the specification type and existing content. Postman also identifies [syntax errors and API governance issues](/docs/design-apis/specifications/validate-a-specification/), and shows details so you can fix them.

![Edit a specification with autocomplete](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-autocomplete-v11-31.jpg)


# Manage a multi-file API specification

With a *multi-file API specification* in Spec Hub, your specification can span across multiple files and folders, improving its organization and management. Multi-file specifications are supported for OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 specifications.

## About multi-file specifications

All files in a multi-file specification are considered the full API specification. Each multi-file specification has a root file that's the top-level file in your specification where the root OpenAPI object is defined. The root file hosts the operations defined by the API and it can reference other files in your specification.

When you [create a multi-file specification](#create-a-multi-file-specification) or [import a multi-file specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/import-a-specification/), Postman determines the root file based on the references across the files. Your specification can only have one root file.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) to bundle all files in your multi-file specification into a single OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 file. Provide the specification ID to get the bundled specification in the response. Learn how to [bundle a multi-file specification with the Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/3da633u/get-a-spec-s-definition).

Add one or more files to an OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 specification to turn it into a multi-file specification. Then you can [add more files and folders](#add-files-and-folders) to your specification from the file manager.

To create a multi-file specification, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar.
2. If you don't have a specification, select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new specification** and select a specification type. You can also [import a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/import-a-specification/).
3. Next to your specification, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Add File**. This adds a new file to the file manager in the sidebar, which is located below the outline.

![Multi-file OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/multi-file-specification-v11-54.jpg)

## Add files and folders

Once you've created or imported a multi-file OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specification, you can add more files and folders and even search them by name, all from the file manager. You can also rename and delete your files and folders.

To add more files and folders to your specification, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar.

2. Click a multi-file specification in the sidebar.

3. In the file manager, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add Files and Folders** and then select one of the following:

   * **New File** - Adds a new file at the top level of your specification.
   * **New Folder** - Adds a new folder at the top level of your specification.

4. Next to a folder, you can also click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** and then select one of the following:

   * **Add File** - Adds a new file to the folder.
   * **Add Folder** - Adds a new folder within the folder.

<img alt="Add files and folders to a multi-file OpenAPI 3.0 specification" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-add-files-and-folders-v11.jpg" />

You can also take the following actions from the file manager:

* To search files and folders by name, click <img alt="Search icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-search-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Search Files and Folders** and enter a name.
* To rename files and folders, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Rename**. Update the name then press **Return** or **Enter**.
* To delete files and folders, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Delete**. Then click **Delete** to confirm.

## Change the root file

Your multi-file specification can only have one [root file](#about-multi-file-specifications) that's used to reference other files in your specification. You can change the root file in your OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 multi-file specification at any time.

To change the root file in a multi-file specification, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar.

2. Click a multi-file specification in the sidebar.

3. Next to a file in the file manager, select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Mark as Root file**.

   <img alt="Change root file in multi-file OpenAPI 3.0 specification" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-mark-root-file-v11.jpg" />

4. Click **Confirm**.

Make sure to update the new root file with the root OpenAPI object and references to other files in your specification. Otherwise, Postman can't parse your specification.


# Validate an API specification

As you [edit your specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/edit-a-specification/), Postman identifies [syntax errors](#view-syntax-errors-in-your-specification), such as wrong data types and nesting, and shows details about the errors so you can correct them. Postman also identifies [API governance issues](#view-rule-violations-in-your-specification) in OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 specifications, based on the rules configured for your team.

## View syntax errors in your specification

Postman automatically identifies syntax errors as you edit your API specification. Errors can include missing fields, malformed field names, wrong data types, wrong nesting, or other issues. For Postman to be able to check your specification elements, you must use valid JSON or YAML.

To view any syntax errors, click **Syntax** below the specification editor. Each syntax error shows the number of times Postman found it in the specification, details about the error, and the severity.

Click the number next to each syntax error to view more details. Every instance of the syntax error has a brief description and the line where the error occurs. Click an instance of the syntax error to navigate to it in the specification. You can also get details about the syntax error by hovering over it in the specification.

If your specification is organized into [multiple files and folders](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/), every instance of the syntax error will also have the path to its respective file. Click an instance of the syntax error to navigate to the file.

![View syntax errors in a specification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-syntax-errors-v11-47.jpg)

## View rule violations in your specification

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  API Governance rule validation is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

As you edit your OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specification, Postman automatically checks it against the [Postman API Governance](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rules configured for your team.

To view any rule violations, click **Governance** below the specification editor. Each rule violation shows the number of times Postman found it in the specification, details about the rule violation, and the severity.

Click the number next to each rule violation to view more details. Every instance of the rule violation has a brief description and the line where the violation occurs. Click an instance of the rule violation to navigate to it in the specification. You can also get details about the rule violation by hovering over it in the specification.

If your specification is organized into [multiple files and folders](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/), every instance of the rule violation will also have the path to its respective file. Click an instance of the rule violation to navigate to its file.

API Governance Managers can [view detailed metrics](/docs/reports/api-governance-specifications-reports/) on API Governance rule compliance in your specifications.


# View live documentation for your API specification

Postman displays a live preview of your API's documentation if you're editing an OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specification or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification. The documentation preview is updated as you edit the specification. You can use the preview to help you visualize your changes as you work.

As you edit an OpenAPI specification with [multiple files and folders](/docs/design-apis/specifications/add-files-to-a-specification/), a live preview also displays for your the root and non-root files.

To show the documentation preview, click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Live preview** in the right sidebar. Click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Close** to hide the documentation preview.

You can view live documentation for the following types of sections:

* **OpenAPI** - The live preview shows documentation for `Info`, `Servers`, and `Paths` sections of your specification. Live preview also shows documentation for the following `Components` (OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1) and `Definitions` (OpenAPI 2.0) sections: `Schemas`, `Responses`, and `Request Bodies`. The preview doesn't show documentation for other sections such as `Security`.
* **AsyncAPI 2.0** - The live preview shows documentation for the `Info`, `Servers`, and `Channels` sections of your specification. The preview doesn't show documentation for other sections such as `Components`.

# Reuse specification components with the Component Library in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Postman Component Library is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

With the Postman Component Library, you can manage reusable components for your team's OpenAPI specifications in [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). Maintain and standardize commonly used components in a central location, without having to redefine them in each specification. Reusable components can include schemas, responses, parameters, and more. Publish a new version when you're ready to share changes with your team, maintaining support for earlier versions. Anyone on your team can reuse published components and choose the version they'd like to reference in their specifications.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  The Postman Component Library doesn't support AsyncAPI specifications.
</Warning>

## Create a component file

Create a component file in your team's component library. Name the file and specify the OpenAPI specification format the components will be used in. In the file, define components that your teammates can reuse in their specifications.

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar, and open a specification.

### Validate a component file

Postman identifies syntax errors as you edit your component file. Syntax errors can include missing fields, malformed field names, wrong data types, wrong nesting, or other issues.

<Note title="Note">
  Postman also identifies governance issues for components, but only once they're [referenced in your specification](#reference-a-component-in-a-specification).
</Note>

## Version and publish a component file

Publish a version of a component file to share the latest changes to your reusable components with your team. Versioning component files is useful for publishing a new version of your reusable components, while still supporting earlier versions. You can't edit versions once they're published.

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar, and open a specification.

2. Click <img alt="Library icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-library-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Components** in the lower right of the specification.

3. Click **Open Component Library**.

4. Click a component in the left sidebar that you'd like to version and publish.

5. Click **Version & Publish** in the upper right corner.

   ![Version and publish a component file](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/component-library-publish-v11.png)

6. Enter a version number. The version number must be unique to the component file. The version number can only contain alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, dashes, plus signs, and no spaces.

7. Click **Create Version & Publish**.

Once the component is published, your teammates can [reference the file's components](#reference-a-component-in-a-specification) in their specifications.

To publish a new version of your component, select **Draft** in the version dropdown list. [Edit the component file](#edit-a-component-file) and then publish a new version.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  You can't delete published versions of component files.
</Warning>

## Reference a component in a specification

Reference reusable components in your OpenAPI specifications using the URL to the component and its version. A component file must have a [published version](#version-and-publish-a-component-file) before you can reference its components in your specification.

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar, and open a specification.
2. Click <img alt="Library icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-library-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Components** in the lower right of a specification
3. Click **Open Component Library**
4. Search for a component file and select it in the left sidebar.
5. Choose a published version of the component file using the version dropdown list.
6. In the left sidebar, click <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Copy component link** next to a component. This copies the URL to the version of the component you select in the dropdown list.
7. Add the URL to a reference (`$ref`) in your specification.

<Tip title="Tip">
  From a specification, you can also copy the URL to the latest version of a component. Click <img alt="Library icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-library-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Components** in the lower right of the specification. Then hover over a component and click <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Copy link**.
</Tip>

As you edit your specification, Postman displays autocomplete suggestions for published components in your team's component library. Enter a component name as the value of a reference (`$ref`) and select it from the suggestions list. The URL to the latest version is added as the value.

Postman identifies governance issues for components referenced in your specification. Governance issues are violations of the [Postman API Governance](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rules configured for your team. Learn more about [viewing rule violations in your specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/validate-a-specification/#view-rule-violations-in-your-specification).

The Postman CLI also supports running governance rule checks against components referenced in your specification. To learn more, see the [`postman spec lint` command](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#postman-spec-lint).

## Sync components between collections and specifications

Consider the following behavior when syncing changes to reusable components between collections and OpenAPI specifications.

* When you [generate a collection from a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/), Postman uses referenced components from your team's component library to populate relevant parts of the collection.
* When you [sync changes](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/#sync-changes-to-a-specification) from the collection back to the specification, Postman preserves the original reference URL if the values are unchanged. If you change values in the collection that originated from a referenced component, syncing those updates causes Postman to replace the reference URL with the updated inline values.


# Generate collections from your API specification

You can [generate a collection from a specification](#generate-collections-from-a-specification) to share it with your team members and consumers. With the generated collection, they can test your API or explore its capabilities. You can also [keep a collection in sync](#keep-collections-in-sync-with-an-openapi-specification) with its specification if it was generated from an OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

To learn more about generating and syncing collections, see [Sync collections and specifications reference](/docs/design-apis/sync-specifications-reference/).

## Generate collections from a specification

You can generate a [Postman Collection](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) from your OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specifications and AsyncAPI 2.0 specifications that use the WebSocket protocol. Postman automatically creates a collection with folders, requests, and response examples based on the specification. You can generate more than one collection from the same specification.

To generate a collection from a specification, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar and select a supported specification.

2. Click <img alt="New collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-newCollection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Generate Collection** in the upper right. You can also click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to the specification and then select **Generate Collection**.

   ![Generate a collection from a specification](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/specs-generate-collection-v11-42.jpg)

3. Enter a name for your collection.

4. (OpenAPI specifications only) Change any settings to customize the new collection:

   * **Naming requests** - Determines how request names in the generated collection. Select **Fallback** (default) to name the requests based on one of the following schema values: `summary`, `operationId`, `description`, or `url`. Select **URL** to name the requests based on the path parameter.

   * **Folder organization** - Choose whether to create folders based on the specification's **Paths** (default) or **Tags**.

   * **Nested folder organization using tags** - If you created folders based on the specification's tags, turn this on to create a nested folder structure based on the order of tags used to group operations.

   * **Set indent character** - Set character indentation to **Space** (default) or **Tab**.

   * **Include auth info in example requests** - Turn this on to include authentication parameters from example requests.

   * **Enable optional parameters** - Turn this on to enable optional parameters in the generated collection and its requests.

   * **Keep implicit headers** - Turn this on to include implicit headers in the generated collection and its requests. This is turned off by default.

   * **Include deprecated properties** - Turn this on to include deprecated operations, parameters, and properties in the generated collection.

   * **Always inherit authentication** - Turn this on to include authentication details in every request and inherit authentication details from the parent collection. This is turned off by default.

   <Note title="Note">
     The **Parameter generation** setting is deprecated. Generated collections will use examples for parameter generation by default. Any existing collections generated using the schema parameter generation will continue to sync using their existing strategy.
   </Note>

5. Click **Generate Collection**.

To view the generated collection, click <img alt="New collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-newCollection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Collections**, then click the generated collection's name. You can also click **Collections** in the sidebar to navigate to your generated collection.

## Keep collections in sync with an OpenAPI specification

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Syncing isn't available for collections generated from AsyncAPI specifications.
</Info>

When you [generate a collection](#generate-collections-from-a-specification) from your OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, or 3.1 specifications, Postman creates a collection with requests that match what's defined in the specification. If you update the collection or specification, such as by adding a new request or path, Postman alerts you that the generated collection isn't in sync with the specification.

Postman doesn't delete elements from a collection when you sync it with the specification. For example, if you change the name of an existing path in your specification, Postman creates a new path in your collection when it's updated. The existing path still exists with the previous name in your generated collection, and you can choose to delete the path.

### Sync changes to a collection

To sync changes made in an OpenAPI specification to a generated collection, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Specs** in the sidebar and select an OpenAPI specification.

* **Sync example values between Spec and Collection** - Turn this on to keep examples in the specification and values in the collection in sync.


# Sync collections and specifications reference

The following are frequently asked questions about Postman's [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) feature. Use these questions to learn about different behavior when generating and syncing between collections and specifications in Spec Hub.

## Sync from a collection to specification

This section includes behavior when generating an API specification from a collection, or syncing changes from a collection to a specification. Learn more about [generating a specification from a collection](/docs/design-apis/collections/generate-specifications/) and keeping them in sync.

### What happens when multiple methods in the same path of a collection share the same path parameters?

The parameters are consolidated into path-level parameters. If any updates, like changes to descriptions or data type schemas, are made to the shared parameters in the collection, users must ensure these updates are applied consistently across all methods under that path.

If inconsistencies are detected in the path parameters across methods, the system defaults to using the last defined instance of the path parameter within that path.

### What if multiple requests in a collection share the same method and path but have different query parameters?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you generate a specification from a collection.
</Info>

Query parameters from the first request in the collection are prioritized and added as operation-level parameters in the specification.

### What if examples or example fields exist in a specification but not a collection?

Examples or example values explicitly defined in the specification remain unchanged and preserved, even when related schemas or components are updated. By default, the system doesn't generate or sync values from collections to specifications.

<Tip title="Tip">
  To sync values from a collection to specification, you can enable this option in [sync settings](/docs/design-apis/collections/generate-specifications/#configure-sync-settings).
</Tip>

### What if a request exists in a specification but not a collection?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you sync changes from a collection to a specification.
</Info>

The request is preserved in the specification to prevent accidental or unintentional data loss.

### What if requests in the collection have automatically added headers, such as Accept or Content-Type?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you generate a specification from a collection.
</Info>

Only user-defined headers are included in the specification. This helps ensure that the generated specifications are clear and accurate.

### Can collection requests have body payloads with non-JSON formats?

Postman doesn't support non-JSON body types, like `form-data` or `multipart`. These request bodies are excluded from the specification.

### What if a specification has references to reusable components?

When you generate a collection from a specification with reusable components, the entire reference object is copied to requests in the generated collection. If you make changes to the requests and then sync the changes back to the specification, references are converted into inline components in the specification. This ensures that any detected updates are accurately reflected in the output.

### What happens if users make changes in a collection and specification at the same time?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you sync changes from a collection to a specification.
</Info>

Changes in a collection may overwrite the changes in a specification. All changes to the specification are lost in this scenario. It's recommended that you don't apply changes to the specification and collection at the same time to prevent data loss.

The following exceptions apply:

* Changes to vendor extensions won't be overwritten.
* Changes to endpoints and operations won't be overwritten.

### Are vendor extensions retained in a specification?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you sync changes from a collection to a specification.
</Info>

All `x-` vendor extensions are preserved in the specification. Vendor extensions aren't removed or modified, ensuring that any organization-specific metadata remains complete.

### What if requests or responses in a collection have non-JSON bodies?

The system only generates and syncs request bodies in JSON format (`application/json` content type). If a path in the collection has a request body in a format other than JSON (such as `text/plain` or `application/xml` content types), the request body isn't included in the specification. All non-JSON request bodies are preserved in the collection.

## Sync from a specification to collection

This section includes behavior when generating a collection from an API specification, or syncing changes from a specification to a collection. Learn more about [generating a collection from a specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/) and keeping them in sync.

### What if a parameter is missing a description at the operation level in a specification?

The parameter in the collection inherits the description from the common path-level parameter in the specification.

### What if a request exists in a collection but not a specification?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you sync changes from a specification to a collection.
</Info>

The request is preserved in the collection to prevent accidental or unintentional data loss.

### What happens if users make changes in a specification and collection at the same time?

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only applies when you sync changes from a specification to a collection.
</Info>

Changes in a specification may overwrite the changes in a collection. All changes to the collection are lost in this scenario. It's recommended that you don't apply changes to the specification and collection at the same time to prevent data loss.

The following exceptions apply:

* Changes to vendor extensions won't be overwritten.
* Changes to endpoints and operations won't be overwritten.


# Develop APIs with the API Builder in Postman

With the API Builder, you can connect various Postman elements of your [API development lifecycle](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-lifecycle/) to your API definition, such as collections, documentation, and tests. You can also [integrate your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/) in Postman with a Git repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **The maximum number of API objects you can create in the API Builder is determined by your Postman plan. [Learn more about what's included with each plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).**
</Info>

## Designing and developing your API

The following are the high-level steps involved when designing and developing your APIs in the Postman API Builder:

* [Create an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/creating-an-api/) - Create a new API in Postman or [import an existing API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/).
* [Manage changes with Git](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/) - Sync your changes between Postman and a remote Git repository. When you're ready to share your changes with consumers, [publish a version](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).
* [Develop your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/) - Build out your API by [editing your API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#edit-an-api-definition-file) and [adding collections](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/). You can also [generate server-side code](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/generating-server-code/) from your OpenAPI 3 specification and [validate your API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/) and linked elements.
* [Test your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/testing-an-api/) - [Add tests](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/testing-an-api/#adding-api-tests) to your API, and use [CI integration](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/testing-an-api/#adding-ci-integration) to build and automate testing.
* [Deploy your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/deploy-apis/overview/) - Connect your API gateway to track your API deployment status and history.
* [Observe your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/observe-apis/overview/) - Integrate your API with application performance management (APM) tools.
* [Share and collaborate on your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/managing-apis/) - Share your API with other team members, add comments, view the changelog, and watch for changes.
* [View API reports](/docs/reports/reports-overview/) - Use reports to view statistics on how APIs are being used, developed, and improved by your team.

## Navigating the API Builder

To view and work with APIs, click **APIs** in the sidebar. From here, you can open and edit any existing APIs, or create or import new APIs. Use the arrows to expand an API in the sidebar and view the API's definition files and linked elements.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-sidebar-v10-21-1.jpg" alt="API Builder sidebar" width="280px" />

When you select an API in the sidebar, the workbench displays an overview of the API. The overview displays a description of the API, tags associated with the API ([Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)), any linked collections, and the API's published versions. The overview also provides quick access to tasks, such as connecting to a Git repository, adding tests, observing API performance, and viewing deployments.

![API Builder overview](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-builder-overview-v11-1.jpg)

The right sidebar offers more options for working with your API. You can view comments, generate server code from your API definition, and view the API's changelog.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-changelog-v10.jpg" alt="API Builder changelog" />

For APIs in the Postman API Builder connected to a Git repository, the changelog is replaced by the [**Source Control**](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/#push-and-pull-changes) pane. You can use this to sync your changes with a remote Git repository.


# Create an API in the Postman API Builder

Go to one of your workspaces and use the Postman API Builder to create an API. Postman supports version control and a variety of API definition types such as protobuf (protocol buffers), OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), WSDL, RAML, and GraphQL.

## Create an API

You can use the API Builder to create a new API and optionally connect it to a repository for version control. You can then build your API from scratch or import a definition or collection to get started.

To create an API, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click **APIs**.

2. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new API**.

   <img alt="Create an API" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-builder-create-v11-56-1.png" width="377px" />

3. Enter your API's name.

4. Choose whether to connect a repository or continue without one. To learn more about repositories and version control, see [Manage changes with Git in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     **Git integrations are available with Postman team plans.** If you are on a Free individual plan, [create a new team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/) to connect to a remote repository. [Learn more about what's included with each plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
   </Info>

5. Define or import a definition:
   * [Create a new API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-an-example-api-definition) for your API.
   * [Use a collection as a starting point for your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/). Select a collection in your workspace you want to use and add a copy of it to your API. You can also create new collections in your API.
   * [Import an existing API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/) from a file, a folder, a code repository, or an API gateway.

## Rename your API

1. From the Postman sidebar, click **APIs**.
2. Next to your API, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**.
3. Click **Rename**.
4. Enter your API's new name.

## Delete your API

To delete an API, you must have the [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) or [API Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#api-roles) role. You can't undo this action.

When you delete an API, you delete the API and all its elements, such as its collections, environments, and definition. This extends to anything you published.

To delete your API, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click **APIs**.
2. Next to your API, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. To confirm, enter your API's name.
5. Click **Delete**.

## Upgrade your API

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Postman recommends upgrading your APIs to the latest format.** The Postman v9 API format has been deprecated. If you have v9 APIs, you can upgrade them to the new format. After upgrading, you can continue working with your APIs in Postman. In the future, all APIs that are still in v9 format will be automatically upgraded.

  The Postman API v9 endpoints have also been deprecated. Any workflows that use the v9 endpoints will no longer work with an API that's been upgraded to the new format. Instead, use the new Postman API endpoints for your workflows.
</Info>

Postman can display APIs created in previous versions of Postman. To work with the API in Postman v10 and later, you need to upgrade the API to the new format. You'll be prompted to upgrade the API when you make changes to it, for example, adding a collection, adding a definition, or connecting to a Git repository. Click **Upgrade this API** to complete the upgrade.

<img alt="Upgrading an API to v10" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-upgrade-v10.jpg" width="618px" />

There are some differences in the way API versions work in Postman v10 and later compared to v9:

* In Postman v9, versions were major iterations of your API you could work on at the same time. In Postman v10 and later, [published versions](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/) are static representations of your API that consumers can reference (like releases in Postman v9).
* If you need to work on more than one major iteration of your API in Postman v10 and later, create separate APIs.
* If an API created in Postman v9 had multiple versions, each version will appear as a separate API in Postman v10 and later. For example, if you had an API named `sample-api` with two versions `v1` and `v2`, they would appear as `sample-api:v1` and `sample-api:v2`.


# Import an API into the Postman API Builder

You can import an existing API specification into the Postman API Builder. API specifications can be imported from a local file or directory, a URL, raw text, or an API gateway.

## Import API specifications from Amazon API Gateway

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) enables developers to publish and manage APIs that access AWS and other web services and data sources. You can import APIs directly from AWS Gateway to Postman. This creates an integration with API Gateway. Once connected, you can view your API deployment status and history from within Postman. You can also view [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metrics for each stage to get operational insight into your API.

This integration supports importing OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for both HTTP and REST APIs. Importing a specification will create a new API in Postman and will also configure an integration with AWS API Gateway.

To import an API from AWS API Gateway, click **Import** in the sidebar, then select **Other Sources > AWS API Gateway**. When importing an API from AWS API Gateway, you can choose to authenticate by creating an AWS IAM role or by using an AWS access key. Follow the steps for your chosen method:

* [Authenticate with an AWS IAM role](#authenticate-with-an-aws-iam-role)
* [Authenticate with an AWS access key](#authenticate-with-an-aws-access-key)

### Authenticate with an AWS IAM role

To set up a connection to Amazon API Gateway using an AWS IAM role, do the following:

1. Select **IAM** under **AWS Authentication Method**.

   <img alt="Connecting with AWS IAM role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/import-from-api-gateway-with-iam-role-v11.jpg" width="534x" />

2. Select the **AWS API Type** (HTTP or REST).

To create an IAM role for Postman in AWS, do the following:

1. Sign in to the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) and select **Create role**.

2. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, select **AWS account**.

3. Under **An AWS account**, select **Another AWS account** and enter Postman's **AWS Account ID**: `258201882842`

4. Under **Options**, select the **Require external ID** checkbox and enter the **External ID** from Postman. You can find the external ID in Postman's **Connect to AWS API Gateway** procedure under **Step 1: Create an IAM role**, as shown in [Authenticating with an AWS IAM role](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/deploying-an-api-aws/#authenticate-with-an-aws-iam-role).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     For more information, refer to the [AWS IAM guide on using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).
   </Info>

5. Click **Next: Permissions**.

6. Select an existing IAM policy or click **Create policy**. If you are creating a policy, use the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Stmt909923626743",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "apigateway:GET",
                   "apigateway:PUT",
                   "apigateway:POST",
                   "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   This policy will enable exporting and deploying for HTTP API specifications. (Exporting and deploying aren't supported for REST API specifications.) You can customize the `Action` section in the IAM policy based on your needs:

   * `"apigateway:GET"` - (Required) Enables viewing API Gateway deployments for HTTP and REST APIs in Postman.
   * `"apigateway:PUT"` - Enables [exporting](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/deploying-an-api-aws/#export-and-deploy-your-api) HTTP API specifications to the API Gateway.
   * `"apigateway:POST"` - Enables [deploying](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/deploying-an-api-aws/#export-and-deploy-your-api) HTTP API specifications to a stage on the API Gateway.
   * `"apigateway:*"` - Assigns all GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE permissions to the IAM role.
   * `"cloudwatch:GetMetricData"` - Enables [viewing CloudWatch metrics](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/deploying-an-api-aws/#view-cloudwatch-metrics) in Postman.

7. Click **Next: Tags**.

8. Click **Next: Review**.

9. Add a **Role name** and **Role description**, then click **Create role**.

Copy the **Role ARN** from AWS and paste it in Postman under **Step 2: Enter role ARN and region**. Next, enter the **AWS Region** where the API Gateway is located and select the **API Gateway**. Then, enter an **API Name** for the imported API. When you're ready, click **Connect**.

### Authenticate with an AWS access key

To set up a connection to Amazon API Gateway using an AWS access key, select **Access Key** under **AWS Authentication Method**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS access key" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/import-from-api-gateway-with-access-key-v11.jpg" />

Next, enter information about the connection:

* Select the **AWS API Type** (HTTP or REST).
* Enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for your AWS account. (Learn how to [find your credentials in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html).)
* Enter the **AWS Region** where the API Gateway is located and select the **API Gateway**.
* Enter an **API Name** for the imported API.

When you're ready, click **Import**. After importing your API specification, you can [view API deployments in Postman](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/aws-api-gateway/deploying-an-api-aws/).

## Import API specifications from Azure API Management

You can import a specification from a connected Azure API Management service to an API in Postman. Importing a specification will create a new API in Postman and will also configure an integration with Azure API Management. Learn more about [integrating with Azure API Management](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/azure-api-management/deploying-an-api-azure/).

To import an API specification from Azure API Management, do the following:

1. Click **Import** in the sidebar, then select **Other Sources > Azure API Management**.

2. You'll be prompted to authorize Postman to access your Microsoft Azure account. After you grant access, you can close the browser tab and return to Postman.

3. Enter information about the Azure API Management service you want to import a specification from:

   * **Subscription** - The [subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions) where the service was created.
   * **Resource Group** - The [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) that has the service.
   * **Service** - The Azure API Management [service instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) used for deploying your API.
   * **Azure API Version** - The Azure API [version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-versions) you want to import.
   * **Definition type** - Select the specification for the specification you want to import (OpenAPI 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0).
   * **API name** - The name to use for the new API that will be created in Postman using the imported specification.

4. Click **Import**.

## Supported API specifications formats

Postman directly supports importing the following formats:

* [OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman)
* Swagger [1.2](https://github.com/postmanlabs/swagger1-to-postman) and [2.0](https://github.com/postmanlabs/swagger2-postman2-lambda)
* Protobuf 2 and 3
* [GraphQL](https://github.com/postmanlabs/graphql-to-postman)
* [cURL](https://github.com/postmanlabs/curl-to-postman)
* RAML [0.8](https://github.com/postmanlabs/raml-to-postman) and [1.0](https://github.com/postmanlabs/raml1-to-postman)

* [DHC-to-postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/dhc-to-postman)


# Manage changes with Git in the Postman API Builder

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Git integrations are available with Postman team plans.** If you are on a Free individual plan, [create a new team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/) to connect to a remote repository. GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, and Azure DevOps Server (hosted on-premises) integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on. [Learn more about what's included with each plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

Postman enables you to use Git-based version control for developing and managing changes to your API. You can connect your API to a remote [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) repository. The remote repository can be hosted in the cloud or on-premises.

Once your API is connected to a repository, you can switch branches, pull changes from the repository, and push changes to the repository, all from within Postman. When you're ready to share your changes with consumers, you can publish a version of your API to your team's Private API Network.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  API version control with Git is different than using version control for collections in Postman. Learn more about [using version control for collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/).
</Info>

## API version control workflow

Here's a typical workflow for API-first development with a connected repository:

1. Create an API in Postman.

2. Connect the API to a remote Git repository.

3. In Postman, select an active branch. Make changes to the API definition and associated collections, then commit and push the changes to the remote repository.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can also make changes in the Git repository using other tools or editors. For example, developers can follow a Git workflow by working on feature branches, then creating pull requests to merge them into the default branch.
   </Info>

4. Periodically pull from the remote repository to bring changes others have made into Postman and resolve conflicts if there are any issues.

5. In Postman, publish a new version to make the changes available to your API's consumers.

## Connecting to a remote Git repository

You can connect your API to a GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or Azure DevOps repository. Once connected, you can sync your API definition and associated collections in Postman with the remote repository.

* To connect your API to the cloud-hosted versions of GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab SaaS, or Azure DevOps, go to [Connect to a cloud-hosted Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-cloud-git-repo/).
* To connect your API to the on-premises versions of GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server, go to [Connect to an on-premises Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-on-prem-git-repo/). (You must be on a [Postman Enterprise plan with the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) to connect to an on-premises or self-hosted repository.)
* You can connect an API to more than one Git repository. Learn more about [Connecting an API to multiple repositories](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/connecting-multiple-apis/).

## Managing changes using Git

After you've connected your API to a remote repository, you can perform common Git actions from within Postman. You can work on several branches, and Postman tracks the changes you make to your API definition and associated collections. At any time you can push your changes to the repository or pull changes into Postman.

Learn more about [managing changes using Git](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/).

## Publishing an API version

When you're ready to share the latest changes to your API with consumers, you can publish a version. Publishing a version creates a static representation of your API that consumers can view on your Private API Network.

Learn more about [publishing an API version in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).


# Connect to a cloud-hosted Git repository in the Postman API Builder

You can connect your API to a cloud-hosted Git repository to sync your API definition and collections between Postman and the repository. Postman supports connecting to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab SaaS](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/) repositories.

After connecting, you can push and pull changes between Postman and branches in the remote repository. When it's time to release, you can publish an API version to make your changes available to consumers.

  The steps below are for connecting to the cloud-hosted versions of GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab SaaS, or Azure DevOps. If you need to connect to an on-premises repository, go to [Connect to an on-premises Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-on-prem-git-repo/).
</Info>

## Using a cloud-hosted repository overview

You can connect an API in Postman to your cloud-hosted Git repository. This enables you to sync changes between the repository and Postman.

Keep in mind the following when connecting to a cloud-hosted Git repository:

* **The user account used for authentication requires full access to repositories.** To contribute to the API, each user must authenticate with their own account.

* **For GitHub connections, there's a limit of ten auth tokens per user per application imposed by GitHub.** If you create more than ten connections with the same user, tokens beyond this limit will be revoked in the order that they were created. Teams can use other Postman accounts to create more than ten integration.

* **For Azure DevOps connections, make sure to enable third-party application access for your organization.** If you don't enable third-party access, Postman won't be able to connect to your repository. In Azure DevOps, go to your [organization settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies?view=azure-devops), select **Policies**, and turn on the toggle next to **Third-party application access via OAuth**.

* **You can connect one or more APIs to a remote repository.** You can keep your APIs separate in the repository using files or branches. Learn more about [connecting more than one API to the same repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/connecting-multiple-apis/).

## Connecting to a cloud-hosted repository

You can connect your API to a GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab SaaS, or Azure DevOps repository hosted in the cloud.

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

2. Under **Connect repository**, click **Connect** and select the type of repository you want to connect to (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab SaaS, or Azure DevOps).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you want to connect to GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server, see [Connect to an on-premises Git repository in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-on-prem-git-repo/).
   </Info>

3. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to your repository. Follow the onscreen instructions. When you're finished, close the browser tab and return to Postman.

4. On the **Connect your repository** page, select the **Organization** or **Workspace** and the **Repository** where the API will be stored. (For GitLab, enter the **Group** and **Project** for your API.)

5. Select the **Initial branch** for the API. Any changes you make in Postman are stored in the initial active branch. (You can switch to another branch to make it the active branch at any time.)

6. (Optional) Select an **API schema file** to add to your API. If you're working on a [multi-file API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#work-with-multi-file-api-definitions), make sure to select the [root definition file](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#about-root-files) in your repository. The root file is the base file that references other files in the API definition. If you leave this field blank, no definition files are added to your API. You can [manually add a definition file](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-an-api-definition-from-a-connected-repository) from your repository later.

7. Select a **Collection directory** where the collections linked to your API will be stored in the repository. If you leave this field blank, a `postman/collections` directory is created in the root of the repository.

8. Click **Connect Repository**.

The root definition file you selected is added to your API. For OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs, Postman scans for any dependent files referenced in the root definition file and automatically adds them to your API. You can also [manually add more definition files](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-files-from-a-connected-repository) from your repository as needed.

## Managing connected accounts for remote repositories

After you connect an API to a remote repository, other editors of the API must authenticate to be able to contribute to the API. Postman will prompt editors to authenticate the next time they open the API.

Postman stores the accounts you've authorized with. After connecting to one repository, you can connect to other repositories that use the same Git provider without having to reauthenticate.

* Publish an API version to a workspace or your team's Private API Network. Learn more about [publishing an API version](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).


# Connect to an on-premises Git repository in the Postman API Builder

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, and Azure DevOps Server (hosted on-premises) integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

You can connect your API to an on-premises Git repository to sync your API definition and collections between Postman and the repository. Postman supports connecting to GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server repositories.

After connecting, you can push and pull changes between Postman and branches in the remote repository. When it's time to release, you can publish an API version to make your changes available to consumers.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The steps below are for connecting to the on-premises versions of GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, and Azure DevOps Server. If you need to connect to a cloud-hosted repository, go to [Connect to a cloud-hosted Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-cloud-git-repo/).
</Info>

## Using an on-premises repository overview

If you are on a [Postman Enterprise plan with the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can connect an API in Postman to your on-premises Git repository. This enables you to sync changes between the repository and Postman.

To connect to [GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed](#connecting-to-github-enterprise-server-or-gitlab-self-managed), create a new installed app in Postman. To connect to [Azure DevOps server](#connecting-to-azure-devops-server), use a personal access token.

Keep in mind the following when connecting to an on-premises repository:

* **You must be on a [Postman Enterprise plan with the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) to connect to a repository hosted on-premises.** If you're not on a Postman Enterprise plan with the API Builder add-on, you won't be able to connect to GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server. You can still [connect to a cloud-hosted repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-cloud-git-repo/).

* **You must use the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to connect to GitHub Enterprise Server, GitLab Self-Managed, or Azure DevOps Server.** You can't use the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) to connect to an on-premises GitHub repository.

* **All communication is between the Postman desktop app on your computer and the on-premises repository.** Your computer must be able to access the repository. No Git requests go through Postman's cloud servers. The Postman desktop app connects directly to your Git server, and you don't need to allow any Postman IP addresses for your repository. The repository will show the IP address of your computer as the source for all Git requests.

* **You can connect one or more APIs to a remote repository.** You can keep your APIs separate in the repository using files or branches. Learn more about [connecting more than one API to the same repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/connecting-multiple-apis/).

## Connecting to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed

To connect to a repository hosted in GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed, [create an installed app](#creating-an-installed-app) in Postman. To complete this process, you'll also need to create an OAuth app in GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed. You need to complete this process once for a domain URL. After you create the installed app, anyone on the team can use it to [connect to repositories using the same domain URL](#connecting-an-api-using-an-installed-app).

### Creating an installed app

[Installed apps](/docs/integrations/installed-apps/) streamline the process of adding integrations by enabling all members of a team to use the same stored authorization details. To create an installed app, you must have the [Admin role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).

To create an installed app for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed, do the following:

1. In Postman, open [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) by selecting **Team > Team Settings**.

2. Click **Installed apps**.

3. Select the repository provider you want to add an installed app for (**GitHub Enterprise Server** or **GitLab Self-Managed**).

4. Enter a **Name** to help you recognize the installed app later.

5. Enter the domain URL of your repository. Format the domain URL as follows:

   * **GitHub Enterprise Server** - Use the base URL of your Git server, for example: `https://my-github-server.example.com`
   * **GitLab Self-Managed** - Use the base URL of your Git server, for example: `https://gitlab.example.com`

6. Create an OAuth app by following the instructions for your Git provider ([GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) or [GitLab Self-Managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)). Use the following values:

   * **Homepage URL** - Enter the Postman homepage URL: `https://www.postman.com`
   * **Authorization callback URL** or **Redirect URI** - Enter the authorization callback URL provided in Postman: `https://integration-oauth.pstmn.io/v1/api-git-callback.html`
   * **Scopes** - Make sure to select the appropriate scopes when creating the OAuth app to enable Postman to read and write to your repository. For GitHub, select the `repo` and `user` scopes. For GitLab Self-Managed, select the `api` scope.

7. After registering the OAuth app, copy the app's **Client ID** and **Client secret** and enter them in Postman.

8. Click **Save** to finish creating the installed app.

<img alt="Creating an installed app" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-add-installed-app-v10-12b.jpg" width="562px" />

### Connecting an API using an installed app

After you [create an installed app](#creating-an-installed-app), any API editor on the team can use it to connect an API to GitHub Enterprise Server or GitLab Self-Managed.

To connect an API using an installed app, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

2. Under **Connect repository**, click **Connect** and select **GitHub Enterprise Server** or **GitLab Self-Managed**.

4. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to your repository. Follow the onscreen instructions. When you're finished, close the browser tab and return to Postman.

5. For GitHub, enter the **Organization** and the **Repository** where the API will be stored. For GitLab, enter the **Group** and **Project** for your API.

6. Select the **Initial branch** for the API. Any changes you make in Postman are stored in the initial active branch. (You can switch to another branch to make it the active branch at any time.)

7. Select an **API schema file** to add to your API. If you're working on a [multi-file API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#work-with-multi-file-api-definitions), make sure to select the [root definition file](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#about-root-files) in your repository. The root file is the base file that has references to other files in the API definition. If you leave this field blank, no definition files are added to your API. You can [manually add a definition file](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-an-api-definition-from-a-connected-repository) from your repository later.

8. Select a **Collection directory** where the collections linked to your API will be stored in the repository. If you leave this field blank, a `postman/collections` directory will be created in the root of the repository.

9. Click **Connect Repository**.

   The root definition file you selected is added to your API. For OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs, Postman scans for any dependent files referenced in the root definition file and automatically adds them to your API. You can also [manually add more definition files](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-files-from-a-connected-repository) from your repository as needed.

## Connecting to Azure DevOps Server

4. Enter the name of the API to confirm, then click **Disconnect**.

## Next steps

After you've connected a remote repository to your API, you can:

* Work with branches, push and pull changes, and resolve conflicts. Learn more about [managing changes using Git](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/).
* Publish an API version to a workspace or your team's Private API Network. Learn more about [publishing an API version](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).


# Manage multiple APIs in the Postman API Builder

You can connect more than one API in Postman to the same Git repository. For each API you want to connect, repeat the process to set up the Git integration. For complete steps, see [Connect to a cloud-hosted Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-cloud-git-repo/) or [Connect to an on-premises Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-on-prem-git-repo/).

It's important to make sure your APIs remain separated in the repository to avoid changes from one API getting applied to another API. You can separate your APIs in the repository using either files or branches.

## Separate APIs with files

You can keep your APIs separate by [adding different definition files](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-an-api-definition-from-a-connected-repository) to each API. Definition files can exist at the root level of the repository or in any subdirectory. Also, when setting up the Git integrations, make sure to select a different collections folder for each API. This will keep your collection files separated.

For example, if you have an `emails` API and an `sms` API, you could have the following file structure for the `main` branch in your repository:

* `emails-api.yaml` - Root definition file for the `emails` API
* `emails/postman/collections` - Collections directory for the `emails` API
* `sms-api.yaml` - Root definition file for the `sms` API
* `sms/postman/collections` - Collections directory for the `sms` API

If you're working on a [multi-file API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#work-with-multi-file-api-definitions), you can choose which files to add to each API. Make sure to select the correct definition files when [adding files to an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-files-from-a-connected-repository).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs, when you add definition files to your API, Postman scans for any referenced files in the same repository and automatically adds them to your API. If two APIs are in the same repository, and each API's root definition files reference the same file, that file will be added to both APIs. In this case, changes made in one API may affect the other API.
</Info>

### Reuse components in multiple APIs

If there are common components referenced by multiple APIs, you can keep them in separate directories (such as `schemas` or `responses`). You can then [add the common component files](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#add-files-from-a-connected-repository) to each API as needed. This enables you to reuse the same component file in more than one API definition. Keep in mind that if you push changes to a component file from one API, other APIs that use the same component will also be affected.

## Separate APIs with branches

You can keep your APIs separate by using a different branch for each API in the repository. For example, if you have a `notifications-v1` API and a `notifications-v2` API, you could have the following branch and directory structure in your repository:

* `notifications-v1` branch
  * `notifications.yaml` - Root definition file for the `notifications-v1` API
  * `postman/collections` - Collections directory for the `notifications-v1` API
* `notifications-v2` branch
  * `notifications.yaml` - Root definition file for the `notifications-v2` API
  * `postman/collections` - Collections directory for the `notifications-v2` API

As you work on your APIs, you can switch branches and push or pull changes for any branch. To keep your APIs separate, always make sure you are on the correct branch before pushing or pulling changes.


# Push and pull changes in the Postman API Builder

After you connect to a remote Git repository, you can use Postman to make changes to your API and collaborate with others. Any changes you make to your API definition or collections always happen on a branch. You can work on any branch in your repository.

If you [configured a remote repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/), Postman stores your changes in a local cache. When you're ready to share your work with others, push your changes to the remote repository.

## Work with branches

Git branches help you organize your work and collaborate with others. As an API producer, you always work on a branch.

### Switch branches

If your Git repository has multiple branches (such as `main`, `develop`, and feature branches) you can switch between branches in Postman. Switching to a branch makes it the active branch.

To switch branches, select the Git branch dropdown menu in the Postman footer, then select the branch you want to make active. After switching to a branch, you can use Postman to make changes to your API definition and collections. Any changes you make are stored in the active branch.

<img alt="Switching branches" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-switch-branches-footer-v10-18.jpg" width="280px" />

The Git branch dropdown menu shows both remote branches and local branches. Remote branches exist in the repository but not locally in Postman. When you switch to a remote branch, Postman pulls the branch to your local system.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman displays a limited set of branches in the list. If a branch isn't listed, enter a branch name in the **Search** box of the dropdown and select the branch to switch to it.
</Info>

### Create a new branch

Feature branches enable you to work on changes to your API without affecting the default branch in your repository. When you create a new branch, Postman automatically makes it the active branch.

To create a new branch in the remote repository, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. Select the Git branch dropdown menu in the Postman footer and click **+ Create new branch**.
3. Enter the name of the new branch and press **Return** or **Enter**.

### Delete a local branch

To delete a local branch, select the Git branch dropdown menu in the Postman footer, then select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** next to the local branch. Deleting a local branch removes the branch from your local system but doesn't remove the branch from the remote repository. If you delete the active branch, Postman automatically switches to another branch.

If there are changes on the local branch you want to keep, make sure to [commit and push](#commit-and-push-changes) them before deleting the branch. You can't recover a local branch after deleting it, but you can switch to the associated remote branch to pull it to your local system again.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Deleting a remote branch from the repository doesn't remove the associated local branch in Postman. You can delete any local branches that are no longer needed.
</Info>

## Push and pull changes

As you work on your API, Postman tracks the changes you make to the active branch. Use the **Source Control** pane to view and manage your change history. You can commit and push your changes to the remote repository to make your work available to others. You can also pull changes to keep your working files up to date with the remote repository.

To show or hide the commit history, click **Commits**. Expand a commit to see details about the changes. When viewing file diffs, you can use the dropdown menu next to **Commits** to show file history or show all commits.

<img alt="Source control pane" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-source-control-remote-v10-18.jpg" />

### Commit and push changes

The **Source Control** pane displays the number of changes in the active branch in Postman.

To commit and push the changes to the remote repository, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

2. Click <img alt="Branch icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-branch-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Source Control** in the right sidebar.

3. If you want to review the changes before committing and pushing them, hover over a file and click <img alt="Diff icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-diff-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View Diff**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can discard changes in a file by clicking <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** next to it.
   </Info>

4. To commit the saved changes to the active branch, enter a commit message and click **Commit and Push**.

   You can also commit the changes to a new feature branch instead of the active branch. Click **Create a new branch to commit and push** and enter a new branch name before committing.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If there are changes in the remote repository, you need to [pull the changes](#pull-changes) before you can commit and push.
   </Info>

After you push a change, other producers on your team can switch to the branch, pull the changes, and view the updates you made.

### Pull changes

Pulling brings changes from the remote (origin) branch into your active branch.

To pull changes from the remote branch, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. Click <img alt="Branch icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-branch-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Source Control** in the right sidebar. The pull icon <img alt="Pull icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-pull-v10-18.jpg#icon" width="40px" /> indicates the number of commits your active branch is behind the remote branch.
3. Click the pull icon <img alt="Descend Small icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-descend-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> to bring the changes into your active branch.

If there are any conflicts, you'll need to [resolve the conflicts](#resolve-conflicts) before you can finish pulling the changes.

### Resolve conflicts

If a change in your active branch conflicts with a change in the remote (origin) branch, you must resolve the conflict before you can pull changes.

To resolve a conflict, do the following:

1. Next to each affected file, select either **Keep remote file** or **Keep local file**.
2. When you're finished, click **Pull Changes**.

![Resolving conflicts](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-pull-changes-conflict-v10-18.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If the file with the conflict isn't in a format Postman supports, you'll need to resolve the conflict in your preferred Git client.
</Info>

### Create a pull request

After you push changes to a branch, you can create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into another branch. For example, if you are working on a feature branch, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the repository's main branch.

To create a pull request, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. Click <img alt="Branch icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-branch-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Source Control** in the right sidebar.
3. Click **Create PR**. A browser tab opens where you can finish creating the PR.

After the PR is merged, make sure to [switch to the branch](#switch-branches) you merged the changes into and [pull the changes](#pull-changes).

<img alt="Source control pane" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-create-pr-v10-18.jpg" />

## Make your changes available to others

Any branches and changes you push to your remote repository are visible to other API producers on your team. You can also [create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request) to ask others on your team to review your changes.

To make your changes available to your API consumers, publish a new version of your API. When you publish a version, the API definition and collections are synced to your workspace in the Postman cloud. Consumers can view the version in your workspace. You can also choose to add the version to your Private API Network. Learn more about [publishing an API version](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).


# Publish a version of your API for consumers in the Postman API Builder

When you're ready to share the latest changes to your API with consumers, you can publish a *version*. Publishing a version creates a static representation of your API's current state. Consumers can view the API version in your workspace. You can also choose to add the version to your [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/).

You can select the elements to publish with your API, such as the definition and collections, to help consumers test and evaluate your API. After you publish a version, you can keep working on your API and make more changes. Your consumers will continue to see the published version of your API until you publish a new version.

You can also publish an API version programmatically with [the Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#publish-an-api-version).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **How are versions and releases different in Postman v10 and v11?** In Postman v9, versions were major iterations of your API you could work on at the same time. Starting in Postman v10, published versions are static representations of your API that consumers can reference (like releases in Postman v9). If you need to work on more than one major iteration of your API in Postman v10 or v11, create separate APIs.
</Info>

## Publishing an API to consumers

Publish an API version to share the current state of your API with consumers. You can select the elements (definition and collections) to include with your published API.

If your API is connected to a Git repository, publishing a version syncs the selected elements (definition and collections) to your workspace in the Postman cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You must have the [Admin role for an API](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#api-roles) or the [Workspace Admin role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to publish an API.
</Info>

To publish an API version, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

2. If you connected your API to a Git repository, make sure the branch you want to publish is the active branch. Select the branch menu from the Postman footer, then select the branch you want to make active.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You must be in sync with the remote repository to publish an API version. [Push or pull any changes](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/#push-and-pull-changes) as needed.
   </Info>

3. On the API's overview, under **Publish your API to consumers**, click **Publish API**. (If you've published a version before, click **Publish** under **Published Versions**.)

4. Enter a **Version label** and, if you want, add any **Release notes** describing this version.

5. Select the elements you want to publish with this version (API definition and collections). If your API definition has [syntax errors](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/#viewing-syntax-errors-in-your-api-definition), a notification under **Definition** will explain that your API definition file has errors. Postman recommends fixing the errors because your [API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/) might not display as expected.

6. To make this version available on your team's Private API Network, click **Add to API Network** (or **Request to Add**, depending on your [role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles)). You can attach an environment to this API. Alternatively, you can click **Add to API network** to open the **Add API to the Private API Network** modal, where you can select the relevant environment from the dropdown. You can also select a folder to place the API version in, or create a new folder.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can only add APIs to your team's Private API Network from team or public workspaces. Your team must also have [the API Builder add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) to view and add APIs to your Private API Network.
   </Info>

7. Click **Publish API**.

8. If you're publishing an API definition file with syntax errors, click **Review Definition** to review the API definition file and fix the errors, or click **Publish API Anyway** to publish the API definition file with errors.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you aren't assigned the API Network Manager or Folder Manager role, you can [request to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#request-to-add-elements) the published API to your Private API Network.

# Define and develop your API in the Postman API Builder

Use Postman's API-first tools to develop your API definition and build out your API with tests, documentation, and server-side code. Create or import common API definition types, including OpenAPI, GraphQL, Protobuf, RAML, and WSDL. Postman automatically validates requests and checks for errors as you work on your API.

## Edit your API definition

Your API definition is the blueprint for your API's structure. To get started, create a new API definition or import an existing definition into the API Builder. Then use Postman's built-in tools to edit your API and preview API documentation as you work. Postman supports API definitions with multiple files, so you can add new files to a definition or import them from a connected Git repository.

Learn more about [working with API definitions in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/).

## Add collections to your API

Postman Collections enable you to add API documentation and write API tests that you can automate. You can add a new collection or copy an existing collection to an API. You can also generate a collection from your API definition. Postman alerts you when there are differences between the generated collection and your definition, so you can keep them in sync.

Learn more about [adding elements to an API in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/).

## Generate code from your API definition

You can use Postman to generate server code from your OpenAPI 3.0 definition. Supported languages and frameworks include Go, NodeJS, Java, and Python. Use the generated code to run a server based on your API specification and jump-start development of your business logic.

Learn more about [generating server-side code in the Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/generating-server-code/).

## Validate your API

With request validation, Postman can detect inconsistencies between the requests in a collection and your API definition. This helps you make sure your API implementation is consistent with the API definition. Postman also automatically detects any syntax errors and governance rule violations as you work on your API definition.

Learn more about [ensuring consistency between a collection and an API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/).


# Work with API definitions in the Postman API Builder

You create the structure of your API using the *API definition*. The API definition can consist of one or multiple files. If your API doesn't have a definition, you can add an example definition, import a definition, or add a definition from a connected repository.

## Supported API definition formats

Postman supports the following API definition formats:

* OpenAPI versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1
* RAML 0.8 and 1.0
* protobuf (protocol buffer) 2.0 and 3.0
* GraphQL
* WSDL 1.0 and 2.0

OpenAPI definitions can be JSON or YAML. RAML definitions must be YAML. Protobuf definitions are `.proto` files. GraphQL definitions can be JSON or GraphQL SDL. WSDL definitions must be XML.

## Add an example API definition

If your API doesn't have a definition, you can add an example definition that you can edit.

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. Next to the API, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**. Then select **Add definition > Author from scratch**. You can also select **create** under the API.

1) Select a definition type from the **Definition type** menu, then select a format from the **Definition format** menu.
2) To start with a sample definition, click **Use a boilerplate**.
3) Click **Create Definition**.

## Import an API definition

You can import a file into your API to define your API.

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API to expand it.

</Info>

### Preview schema documentation

If you are editing an OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 definition, Postman displays a live preview of your API's schema documentation in the right sidebar. The documentation preview is updated as you edit the definition. You can use the preview to help you visualize your changes as you work.

The live preview shows documentation for the `General`, `Servers`, and `Paths` sections of your API definition. The preview doesn't show documentation for other sections such as `Components` and `Security`. Learn more about [viewing schema documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/#add-api-documentation-with-the-api-builder) for your API.

## Work with multi-file API definitions

Your API definition can span multiple files and folders. This is called a *multi-file API definition*. Multi-file API definitions are supported in OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs and protobuf 2.0 and 3.0 APIs.

A multi-file API definition consists of the following components:

* **API Definition** - The entire definition of the API, combining all files within it.
* **Files** - One or more files that specify the API definition.
* **Root file** - The top-level file that hosts the operations defined by the API. See below for more information on root files.
* **Folders** - You can create folders within an API definition to organize files. You can also add folders within folders.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Multi-file API definitions don't support the schema sync integration. Instead, use [API version control](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/) to sync with a repository.
</Info>

### About root files

An API definition's root file can reference other files in the API definition. If you made a tree diagram of the relationships between all files in an API definition, the root file would be the file at the top of the tree. When you [create a new API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/creating-an-api/) or [import an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/), Postman determines the root file based on the references across the files. API definitions don't support references which are external links or present within a separate API.

For OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 API definitions, Postman detects root files based on the content and references within files while importing or creating an API definition. You can't set a file as root for OpenAPI definitions. OpenAPI definitions can have one root file. If you delete the root file, Postman will recalculate the next candidate for the root file automatically.

For protobuf API definitions, while importing the API, Postman detects all files which have service definitions present in them and marks one as the root. You can set another file as root if there's more than one candidate for root file. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a `.proto` file in the sidebar and select **Mark as root**.

### Edit a multi-file API definition

To edit a multi-file API definition, select an API in the sidebar to expand it, then select **Definition**. If your definition has folders, select a folder in the sidebar to expand it and see its contents. Select a file to open it for editing.

### Add files and folders

You can add new files and folders to a multi-file API definition. In the sidebar, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to **Definition**, then select **Add file** or **Add folder**. If your API is [connected to a Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/#connecting-to-a-remote-git-repository), select **Add file > Create new** to add a new file.

To add a new file or subfolder to a folder, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a folder, then select **Add file** or **Add folder**. You can rearrange files and folders by dragging them in the sidebar. You can also rename or delete a file or folder by clicking <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you add a file to a single-file OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 definition, or to a protobuf 2.0 or 3.0 definition, it's converted to a multi-file API definition. The existing definition file becomes the root file.
</Info>

### Add files from a connected repository

If your API is [connected to a Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/#connecting-to-a-remote-git-repository), you can add files from your repository.

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.

2. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to **Definition** and select **Add file > Add from connected repository**.

3. Enter the file path (in the repository) of the definition file you want to add and click **Select**. You can select more than one file to add from the repository.

   <img alt="Selecting a definition file" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-builder-select-files-from-git-v11.jpg" />

4. Click **Add Files**.

   The definition files you selected are added to your API. For OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 APIs, Postman scans for any dependent files referenced in the definition files and automatically adds them to your API.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **Add file > Add from connected repository** option isn't available for Git integrations added using Postman v10.17 or earlier. Instead, add the definition files to the schema directory in the repository. Alternately, you can [remove the Git integration](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/using-cloud-git-repo/#disconnecting-a-cloud-hosted-repository) and then [reconnect your API to the Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/#connecting-to-a-remote-git-repository).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **About definition IDs.** When you add a definition to an API, Postman assigns a definition ID to the API. You can view the definition ID by opening an API and clicking <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the right sidebar. The definition ID acts as a container for all the definition files in the API. If you delete all the definition files, the definition ID itself isn't deleted. If you then add a new definition file, the definition ID remains the same as before.
</Info>


# Add elements to an API in the Postman API Builder

Your API in Postman can include more than an API definition. You can add elements such as collections to help you document and test your API.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you add a collection, an independent copy of the collection is added to the API. The copy in the API will no longer be in sync with the original. If you move or delete an API, any collections contained in the API are moved or deleted with it.
</Info>

## Add a collection to your API

Add a collection to document your API or help others test your API's endpoints. You can add an existing collection or generate a new collection from your API definition.

Note that you can't use [types in a collection](/docs/design-apis/collections/overview/) that's linked to an API. If you copy an existing collection to your API, types won't be available from the copied collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also add a test suite to your API. Learn more about [testing an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/testing-an-api/).
</Info>

### Copy an existing collection to your API

To copy an existing collection to your API, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add a collection** and select **Copy existing collection**.
3. Select an available collection and click **Copy Collection**.

The copy of the collection displays on your API's overview and under your API in the sidebar. To view documentation for the collection, select the collection and click **View complete documentation**.

### Generate a new collection from your API definition

To generate a new collection from your API definition, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add a collection** and select **Generate from definition**.
3. Name your collection.
4. Select the checkbox if you want Postman to suggest updates for the collection when the API definition changes. This checkbox is selected by default. Learn more about [keeping a collection in sync with your API](#keep-a-collection-in-sync-with-your-api).
5. Change any settings to customize the new collection.
6. Click **Generate Collection**.

The collection displays on your API's overview and under your API in the sidebar. To view documentation for the collection, select the collection and select **View complete documentation**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also generate a collection when you import an API. For more information, see [importing an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/).
</Info>

### Add a new collection to your API

To add a new collection to your API, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add a collection** and select **Add new collection**.
3. Enter a new name for the collection.

## Keep a collection in sync with your API

When you [generate a new collection from your API definition](#generate-a-new-collection-from-your-api-definition), Postman creates a collection with requests that match what's defined in the API. If you update the API definition, for example by adding a path, those changes won't be reflected in the generated collection.

In this case, you could repeat the process of generating a collection from the API definition. However, this new collection wouldn't include any changes you might have made to the first collection you generated. For example, you might have added documentation content or endpoints for test setup that you want to keep. Instead, Postman can offer suggestions for updating the collection based on the changes to the API definition.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Collection update suggestions are supported for OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 definitions.
</Info>

### Enable update suggestions for your collection

You can enable update suggestions for any collection that's been added to an API. When suggestions are enabled, Postman will detect when there are differences between the API definition and the collection and will offer suggestions for updating the collection.

To enable update suggestions for your collection, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. On the API's overview, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a collection and select **Enable update suggestions from definition**.

</Info>

### Update your collection based on your API definition

When suggestions are enabled, <img alt="Update icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-update-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Update collection** appears next to a collection if Postman detects differences between the collection and the API definition. Differences can occur if the API definition is changed, for example by adding, removing, or modifying endpoints. Differences can also occur if requests are added, removed, or modified in the collection. You can review the differences and, if you choose, update the collection with the suggested changes.

To update your collection based on your API definition, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Update icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-update-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Update collection** next to the collection on the API's overview.

# Generate server-side code in the Postman API Builder

With server code generation, you can generate server-side boilerplate code from your OpenAPI 3.0 specification. This enables you to run a server based on your API specification and use it as a starting point for developing your business logic.&#x20;

Supported languages and frameworks include:

* **Go** - Chi server
* **NodeJS** - express
* **Java** - JAX-RS
* **Python** - Flask

## Generating server code

To generate server-side boilerplate from your OpenAPI 3.0 definition, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API with an OpenAPI 3.0 definition.
2. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Code Generation**.
3. In the **Code Generation** pane, select the language and framework for the boilerplate code.
4. (Optional) Select **Only generate routes and interfaces** to reduce the number of files that are generated. Learn more about [generating only routes and interfaces](#generating-only-routes-and-interfaces).
5. Click **Generate Code**.

The generated code is automatically downloaded as a ZIP archive. The file name includes the name of the API and the language and framework selected.

## Using the generated code

The generated code structure depends on the language you select. Each of the supported languages covers some of the major features from your OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Here are some features that you can expect from the generated code:

* All operations are generated as routes in your server boilerplate with a stubbed section of code for each endpoint where you can add your business logic. This stub may include a default response taken from the API definition **Response** section of the associated endpoint.
* You can access request bodies, parameters, path parameters, and headers in each of these routes when applicable and use them in your business logic.
* You can start a server from the generated code. There is a `README.md` file describing prerequisites and instructions to start the server.
* Read the framework's relevant documentation for more details on configuring or customizing the generated code.

## Generating only routes and interfaces

The generated code also includes other files like `README.md`, a list of dependencies, server setup code, and other items required by the selected framework. These files are often edited and customized after code generation.

You can select the **Only generate routes and interfaces** option when generating code. This will generate code relevant to the paths and components in the OpenAPI schema and leave out other files. This enables you to update files relevant to new or changed endpoints, and avoid overwriting your customized files with generated boilerplate code.


# Check for validation and syntax errors in the Postman API Builder

You can validate collections that are linked to an API to make sure the API implementation is consistent with the API definition. Postman automatically compares requests and saved examples in the collection to the API definition and alerts you to any inconsistencies. Postman also validates responses when you send a request from the collection.

To help keep your API well defined, you can check your API definition as you work on it in Postman. As you edit your API definition, Postman lists any syntax errors based on the definition type. Postman also identifies any API governance and security issues based on the rules configured for your team.

## Validating requests and responses

For [collections linked to an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#add-a-collection-to-your-api), Postman can automatically detect any inconsistencies between the [requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/) and [saved examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) in the collection and the [API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/). Postman can also compare [responses](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/) received from the server to the API definition to make sure the API implementation aligns with the API design. Postman displays a warning for each detected issue. Select a warning to view the source of the issue so you can resolve it.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Request validation is supported for OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 definitions.
</Info>

### Enabling request validation

When request validation is enabled, Postman automatically checks for validation issues whenever you open a request, change a request or a saved example, or change the API definition. Postman also checks for issues when you send a request, and the response is considered as a saved example.

To enable request validation, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Settings** in the header, then select **Settings**.
2. In the **General** tab, turn on the toggle next to **Request Validation**.

### Viewing validation issues

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To validate requests, saved examples, and responses, your collection must be linked to an API. Learn more about [adding a collection to an API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#add-a-collection-to-your-api).
</Info>

If Postman detects validation issues, an orange dot displays in the sidebar next to the collection, folder, request, or saved example with the issue. Click the element to open it. A warning icon <img alt="Warning icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-warning-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> displays in the tab next to the element's name showing the number of issues found in the element.

To view the list of validation issues, click the warning icon in the tab of the collection, folder, request, or saved example. Postman provides details for each issue, including the element with the issue and details about the problem.

Select an issue to view the element where the issue was detected. To resolve the issue, you can change the [request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/create-requests/) or [saved example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/#edit-an-example), or you can change the [API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/#edit-an-api-definition-file). After you save your changes, if the problem is corrected, the issue disappears.

## Viewing syntax errors in your API definition

Postman automatically identifies syntax errors as you [edit your API definition in the API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/defining-an-api/). Errors can include missing fields, malformed field names, wrong data types, invalid nesting, or other API definition issues.

Postman can identify syntax errors for OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1 and WSDL 1.1 and 2.0 definitions. For Postman to be able to check your definition elements, the JSON or YAML must be well formed.

To view any syntax errors, click **Syntax** next to **Violations found in definition**. Each error shows the error type, the line on which it occurs, and details about the issue. Select an error to highlight it in the editor. You can also get more information by hovering over the error in the editor.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Sometimes a single error in your definition will cause more than one issue to appear in the list. As you fix the errors, the issues disappear.
</Info>

## Viewing rule violations in your API definition

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[This feature is available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

As you create your API definition in the editor, Postman automatically checks it against the [Postman API Governance and API Security](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rules configured for your team. Postman displays any rule violations below the editor. Resolving these issues enables you to improve your API definition.

To learn more about the supported API description formats, the rules preconfigured in Postman, and how to create new rules, see [Rule violations in the API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/).

To view any rule violations, click **Rule** next to **Violations found in definition**. Each rule violation is on its own line and includes the violation **Name** and the rule type (**Governance** or **Security**). The number next to the rule name tells you how many times Postman found the rule violation in your API definition.

Click the number to inspect each rule violation. Every instance of the rule violation has a brief description of the issue and the line in the file where the rule violation occurs. When you select a rule violation, Postman highlights the section of the definition that triggered it.

<img alt="Several occurrences of the same rule violation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-definition-multiple-violations-v11-1.jpg" />

To learn more about the rule violation and get information about how to fix it, click **Possible fix** next to the rule description. This will open the relevant Postman Docs page.

<img alt="Select Possible fix to open the Postman Docs page" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-violations-possible-fix-v10.jpg" />

When you make updates to your API definition, Postman re-checks it. If your changes resolve the issue, Postman removes the rule violation from the list.

### Hiding rule violations

To hide a rule violation for the API definition, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Hide icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-hide-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Hide** next to the rule violation.

   <img alt="Hide a rule violation in your API definition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-hide-rule-violation-v10.1.jpg" />

2. Select a reason that you want to hide it, then click **Hide**.

   <img alt="" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-hide-rule-violation-choose-reason-v10.jpg" width="280px" />

This will hide the rule violation for the current API. If there is more than one violation of a specific rule, you can hide each instance individually.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To hide a rule violation globally, you can use [configurable API Governance and Security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/).
</Info>

When you or another member of your team hides a rule violation, Postman displays a message in the editor's **Rule** tab to show how many are hidden.

To turn a rule back on later, do the following:

1. Click **Review**.
2. Review your hidden rules and click <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Unhide** next to the rule you want to turn back on.

  **Want to send Postman Monitor results to Datadog?** Sending Postman Monitor results to Datadog is a separate integration from viewing APM metrics in Postman. The integration in the API Builder has two tabs that cover both integrations. Learn more about [configuring a Postman Monitor integration with Datadog](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/datadog/).
</Info>

## Connecting to Datadog APM

Before you begin, you must configure your application to send traces to Datadog. See [the Datadog APM documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/) for more details.

To connect an API to Datadog APM, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
2. Click **API Performance**.
3. Under **Connect Postman to your monitoring workflows**, select **Datadog**.
4. Select your Datadog region (**US** or **EU**).
5. Enter your **Datadog API Key** and **Datadog Application Key**. To learn more, see the Datadog documentation for [adding API and application keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/).

## Tagging APIs

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Tagging APIs is available with Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).**
</Info>

You can use shared tags to organize and search for APIs. Once you add tags to an API, you can select a tag to search for APIs and other elements with the same tag.

You can apply up to five shared tags to workspaces, collections, and APIs. Tags can be 2 to 64 alphanumeric characters in length and must start with an alphabetical character. Tags can contain dashes but no other special characters or spaces.

To learn more about searching using tag names in Postman, see [Search Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#search-postman). You can use tags when searching [elements in your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/use-private-network/#search-filter-and-sort). You can also use tags to search for [elements to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/#add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) and [elements to request to add](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#request-to-add-elements-in-your-private-api-network) to your Private API Network.

To add tags to an API, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar.

2. Select an API.

3. Click the **Tags** section to edit it.

4. Select an existing tag or enter a new tag. If you're adding a new tag, enter the new tag name and then click **Create "tag-name"**.

5. Click the area outside the **Tags** section to save your changes.

To remove tags from an API, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar.
2. Select an API.
3. Click the **Tags** section to edit it.
4. Click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to a tag.
5. Click the area outside the **Tags** section to save your changes.

## Watching APIs

The watch option enables you to receive an email or in-app notification when a team member belonging to the same workspace modifies the API. For example, you'll receive a notification when a team member updates the API's definition, adds an element to the API, or adds a comment to the API.

Click **Watch** to start watching the API.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/watch-api-v11.jpg" alt="Watch Option" width="280px" />

For more information about the changes to the API, click <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-notification-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Notifications** in the Postman header.

You will also receive an email with the information regarding who made the change, what the change was, and when it was made.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You won't receive notifications for changes that you made.
</Info>

## Commenting on APIs

You can add one or more comments to an API. Use comments to discuss your APIs with collaborators in Postman, keeping the conversation in context and available to other stakeholders.

API producers ([Admin role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#api-roles) or [Editor role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#api-roles)) can add comments to an API. API consumers ([Viewer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#api-roles)) can't add comments to an API and won't see comments made by API producers. However, API consumers can comment on [published versions](#commenting-on-published-apis) of an API.

To add a new comment to an API, do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar and select the API you want to comment on.
2. Click <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-comments-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Comments** in the right sidebar.

### Formatting API comments

Comments (including inline comments) support the same formatting features as the [Postman editor](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor). Use common keyboard shortcuts to format text, like **⌘+B** or **Ctrl+B** to make text bold, or paste formatted text and tables from a word processor or other source. You can also drag or paste an image into your comment, or add and edit links.

Postman supports [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in comments. For example, enter `#` followed by a space to start a new heading, or enter `---` to add a horizontal line. You can also copy existing Markdown code, including lists and tables, and paste it into the editor to instantly format it.

To mention a collaborator in a comment, type `@` followed by their name, then choose the person from the auto-suggested list. When you mention a teammate in a comment, Postman sends them a notification.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about formatting content, go to [Write descriptions in the Postman editor](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#write-descriptions-in-the-postman-editor).

</Info>

### Commenting on published APIs

You can [publish your API](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/api-versions/) to share the current state of your API with consumers. Keep in mind the following when publishing an API:

* When you publish an API version, comments made by API producers aren't published with the API.
* API consumers can't add comments to an API, but they can add comments to a published API version.

### Commenting on Git-linked APIs

You can [connect a Git repository](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/) to your API to sync your API between Postman and the repository. Keep in mind the following differences when commenting on Git-linked APIs:

* Comments are associated with a branch. If you add a comment while working on one branch, those comments won't be visible when you [switch to another branch](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/#switch-branches).
* You must [commit and push changes](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/#commit-and-push-changes) on a branch before you can add a new comment on that branch. (You can reply to an existing comment without committing and pushing changes.)
* When you [merge a branch](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/managing-git-changes/#create-a-pull-request), comments remain on the branch being merged and aren't merged to the target branch.

## Use the changelog

You can view a history of changes to your API definitions and all linked collections. To access the changelog, open an API, then click <img alt="History icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-history-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Changelog** in the right sidebar.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you connect your API to a Git repository, the changelog is replaced by the **Source Control** pane. Learn more about [API version control](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/versioning-an-api/overview/).
</Info>

The changelog shows a list of changes made to the definition and associated elements. Select each entry for more details.

# Simulate your API in Postman with a mock server

Use a *mock server* to simulate a server for your API requests without having to configure one. You can use any HTTP collection to set up a mock server. When you send a request, Postman returns a real-world response using data from your collection.

## Get started with mock servers in Postman

To set up a mock server you can [create a new one](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#create-a-mock-server), create one from an [existing collection](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#create-a-mock-server), or build one from your [request history](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#create-a-mock-server-from-history).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can only add mock servers to HTTP collections. You can't mock servers for APIs in Postman's [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/) or [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/).
</Info>

After setting up your mock server, you can then [make calls](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/mock-server-calls/) to it from Postman or from a client application. The mock server simulates your API's behavior, so you can test your API or develop new functionality before your API is production ready.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If needed, the mock server can [generate dynamic responses](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/create-dynamic-responses/) using variables and templates to better simulate real-world behavior.
</Info>

## Level up with step-by-step guides

If you need more help setting up a mock server, follow the step-by-step guide to [mock your API using saved response examples](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-examples/). You'll learn how to add requests and examples to your collection, then use the collection to configure and use a mock server.

If you want to automate your mock servers, follow the step-by-step guide to [set up mock servers using the Postman API](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-api/). You'll learn how to use the Postman API to mock a collection and get the mock server URL.

## Learn how Postman mock servers work

When you send a request to a mock server, Postman uses an algorithm to choose the saved example that best matches the request. The mock server then returns a response using the data in the saved example.

[Dive deeper into the matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/) and learn how to create examples so you always get the responses you expect from the mock server.


# Set up a Postman mock server

Create *mock servers* in Postman to help with API development and testing. A mock server simulates a real API server by accepting requests and returning responses. By configuring a mock server for your [collection](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) and adding [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to your requests, you can simulate the behavior of a real API.

When you send a request to a mock server, Postman matches the request to a saved example in your collection. Postman then responds with the data in the example. To view existing mock servers in your workspace, click **Mock servers** in the sidebar.

Mock servers can be private or public. Private mock servers require a Postman API key in the request header. Public mock servers can receive requests from anyone and anywhere (such as a browser, application code, or a curl command). New mock servers are public by default. [Super Admins and Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can enable or prohibit users from creating public mock servers. See [Manage mock server privacy](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#manage-mock-server-privacy) to learn more.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman mock servers only support HTTP collections. You can't use mock servers with multi-protocol collections.
</Info>

## Create mock servers

You can create a mock server in the following ways:

* Create a [new mock server](#create-a-mock-server) from scratch.
* Create a mock server from an [API call](#create-a-mock-server-from-an-api-call).
* Create a mock server from [your request history](#create-a-mock-server-from-history).

### Create a mock server

1. Click **Mock servers** in the sidebar, then click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create mock server**.

3. [Configure](#configure-mock-server-details) the mock server's details. Enter a server name, (optionally) select an environment, choose whether to enable **Make this mock server private** and **Save the mock server URL as an environment variable**, and select a response delay or enter a custom delay.
4. Click **Create Mock Server**.

## Configure mock server details

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Some configuration options may be different, depending on the method you used to [create the mock server](#create-mock-servers).
</Info>

1. To finish creating a mock server, specify the following details:

   * **Mock Server Name** - Enter a name for your mock server.
   * **Collection** - The collection used for the mock server. To choose a different collection, click **Back**.
   * **Environment** - (Optional) Select an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) to use environment variables with your mock server.
   * **Simulate a fixed network delay** - Select a response delay or enter a custom delay. The mock server waits the specified time before sending the response.
   * **Save the mock server URL as a new environment variable** - Select this option to save the mock server URL as a variable in a new environment. You can then reference the variable in your requests. Learn more about [using variables with mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/create-dynamic-responses/#use-postman-variables-with-mock-servers).
   * **Make mock server private** - Select this option to make your mock server private. You must specify an API key in the request header when sending requests to a private mock server. Learn more about [making calls to a private mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/mock-server-calls/#make-calls-to-a-private-mock-server).

     <Info class="iconless-callout">
       If the **Make mock server private** option is unavailable, it may be turned off in [Team resources](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/team-resources). An [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can turn it back on.
     </Info>

2. Click **Create Mock Server**.

   Postman displays the details you need to use the mock server. You can get these details at any time by clicking **Mock servers** in the sidebar and selecting the mock server.

3. Make any changes to the mock server configuration. You can change the mock server's name, environment, network delay, and privacy setting. You can also [specify options for response matching](#match-request-body-and-headers).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can't change the mock server's collection. If you need to mock a different collection, [create a new mock server](#create-mock-servers).
   </Info>

4. When you are done making configuration changes, click **Update Mock Server**.

### Match request body and headers

When you send a request to the mock server, Postman uses a [matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/#6-check-for-header-and-body-matching) to decide which example to return in a response.

By default, the matching algorithm doesn't consider the request's body or headers when selecting the best response to return. You can change this behavior in the mock server's configuration. Using body or header matching, you can specify the exact response you want the mock server to return by matching the body or headers of the saved example.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you enable request body matching, you must add the `Content-Type` header to your examples and use the same value as your request, such as `application/json`.

# Make calls to mock servers

After [setting up a mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/), you can begin making calls to its URL. When you send a request to a mock server, the mock server sends back a response based on an example with the same path and method. [You can provide multiple examples](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-examples/), and Postman returns the one that [best matches your request](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/).

If you configured a delay for your mock server, Postman waits the specified period of time before sending the response.

If you save the URL of a mock server to a [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/), you can reference it across requests. For example, if you have a production server and a mock server, you can have an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) for each server. In each environment, create a variable with the same name (for example, `{{url}}`) for the mock URL. By using the variable in your requests, you can switch between the two environments to call the production server or the mock server.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of free mock server calls per month. Learn more about [resource usage in Postman](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#mock-server-usage).
</Info>

## Call a mock server

To make a call to a mock server, do the following:

1. Click **Mock servers** in the sidebar, select the server, and click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy URL**.

2. Open a new collection request (or edit the address in an existing request), then add the mock server's URL. The URL includes the mock server's ID and the path to the request you want to mock. For example, `https://4bb57fc2-219e-421e-86b4-4ffda6bf1b3b.mock.pstmn.io/get`.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Make sure the request you want to mock has at least one saved example. Learn more about [adding examples to a request](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/#add-an-example).
   </Info>

3. If your mock server is private, add your Postman API key to the request as an `x-api-key` header. See [Make calls to a private mock server](#make-calls-to-a-private-mock-server) to learn more.

4. Click **Send** to send the request.

   <img alt="Sending a mock request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-send-request-v11-8.jpg" />

## Make calls to a private mock server

To make calls to a private mock server, you need to add a [Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/) in the request header when sending requests to the mock server (for example, `x-api-key:<Your-Postman-API-key>`). If you [share the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/), others can use their Postman API keys to make calls to the mock server.

## Use HTTP access control for a mock server

In addition to using Postman to call mock endpoints, you can also make requests to a mock server using a web browser.

A web browser makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource from a domain, protocol, or port that's different from its own. [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a standard that defines a way in which a browser and server can interact securely. In this case, CORS refers to how a web browser interacts with the mock endpoints hosted on the Postman mock server.

CORS is enabled for Postman mock servers, so you can stub your web apps with mocked data using the mock endpoints. Development or production web apps can then make requests to your Postman mock endpoint and receive example responses.

## View the mock server call log

You can view and search the details of calls to your mock servers using the mock call log. To view the call log, click **Mock servers** in the sidebar and select a mock server.

<img alt="Viewing mock calls" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-call-log-v11-8.jpg" />

The call log displays a list of calls made to the mock server URL. Each entry shows the time the request was sent, the request method and path, and a response overview.

With mock server call logs, you can:

* Enter text in the search box to find specific requests.
* Click <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-refresh-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Refresh Logs** to view the most recent requests.
* Select an entry for more details about the request headers and body or the response headers and body.
* Click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** to remove a call log entry.
* Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy URL** to copy the mock server's URL. You can use it to make calls to the mock server.
* Click <img alt="Docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-docs-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View Collection Docs** to view the mocked collection's documentation.

## Troubleshoot mock calls

You can use the mock call log to troubleshoot your requests to mock servers.

If `No matching requests` displays in the **Response** column, this might mean there's a problem with your mock server configuration. Make sure there's an [example saved for the request](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-examples/) in the collection you're mocking.

<img alt="Troubleshooting mock calls" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-no-match-v11-8a.jpg" />

In the case of a service outage, you will get an HTTP 502, 503, or 504 response. Check the Postman [status page](https://status.postman.com/) for updates.


# Generate dynamic mock server responses with variables

Postman [mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) return static responses defined in [saved examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/). To return responses that use random data, or that vary based on the request, you can generate dynamic responses. With dynamic mock responses, you can simulate various scenarios without having to create a saved example for each one.

## Use Postman variables with mock servers

You can store values in [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/) and use them in your collection's requests and responses. If you change the value of a variable, the new value is used wherever the variable occurs. Postman mock servers support [environment variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-environment-variables) and [collection variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-collection-variables).

* To use environment variables, select the environment in the [mock server's configuration](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#edit-the-mock-server-configuration).
* To use collection variables, define them in the **Variables** tab in your mocked [collection](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-collection-variables).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Mock servers don't support [global variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-global-variables) or [vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/).
</Info>

When you use an environment or collection variable in an example, the mock server resolves the variable and replaces it with the variable's shared value. If an environment variable and a collection variable have the same name, Postman uses the environment variable. Learn more about [variable scopes](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-scopes).

### Dynamic variables

You can use [dynamic variables](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/) in your example's response body to return randomized data. Dynamic variables are resolved as part of the mock server response and replaced with random data from the [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library. They're are useful for generating random data when mocking an API. Use them for exploratory testing and writing rich, data-driven tests.

For example, your collection's example response body might contain the following dynamic variables:

```json
{
    "name": "{{$randomFullName}}",
    "userName": "{{$randomUserName}}",
    "location": "{{$randomCity}}",
    "company": "{{$randomCompanyName}}",
    "jobTitle": "{{$randomJobTitle}}",
    "updatedAt": "{{$timestamp}}"
}
```

When you call the mock server endpoint, the response data returns a response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "name": "Cielo McClure",
    "userName": "Aurelie.Lockman",
    "location": "Kubhaven",
    "company": "Runolfsdottir, Bernhard and Hodkiewicz",
    "jobTitle": "Direct Branding Liaison",
    "updatedAt": "1565088856"
}
```

## Use contextual mock responses in templates

A *template* is a set format that's used to create responses that change based on the request sent to the mock server. Template *helpers* give you access to data from the incoming request, such as the body, query parameters, path segments, and headers. You can include this data in the response sent by the mock server.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To generate contextual responses on a mock server with [response matching for the request body enabled](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#match-request-body-and-headers), set the `x-mock-match-request-body` header to `false`. Otherwise you'll get a `mockRequestNotFoundError` error.
</Info>

To create contextual responses, add one or more helpers to an example in the mocked collection, such as:

* `$body` - Access the body of the incoming request.
* `$queryParams` - Access the query parameters of the incoming request.
* `$pathSegments` - Access the path segments of the incoming request (such as `/product/id/details`).
* `$headers` - Access the headers of the incoming request.

Use [object-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-path) syntax to access specific helper values or define a helper's default value. The following are some of the ways you can use helpers in your examples:

* `{{$body}}` - Return the full request body.
* `{{$body 'path.to.property'}}` - Return the value of a specific property from the request body.
* `{{$headers 'header-key'}}` - Return the value of a specific request header.
* `{{$queryParams 'parameter-key'}}` - Return the value of a specific query parameter.
* `{{$pathSegments '1'}}` - Return the second segment of the request path (for example, if the request path is `/product/12345/details`, return `12345`).
* `{{$body 'property' 'default value'}}` - Define a default value for a property.
* `{{$body 'a\.a'}}` - Return the value of the property `a.a` which has a dot (`.`) in the key name.

### Contextual response example

This example shows how to use a template helper to access data from the body of the incoming request and return that data in the response from the mock server.

1. In the mocked collection, [create a new request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/#create-a-new-request), then select the **raw** option in the **Body** tab. Select **JSON** from the dropdown list, then enter the following:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "postman",
       "password": "12345"
   }
   ```

   ![Creating a new request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-template-request-v11-16.jpg)

2. [Add an example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to the request and enter the following response body data to the example:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "{{$body 'username' 'postman'}}",
       "id": "{{$randomUUID}}"
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `{{$body}}` template helper accesses the `username` value.

   ![Adding a template helper to an example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-template-example-v11-17.jpg)

3. [Send the request to the mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/mock-server-calls/) using different values for `username` in the request body. For example, if you send the following request body:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "s-morgenstern",
       "password": "12345"
   }
   ```

   The mock server returns a response with the request body's `username` value:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "s-morgenstern",
       "id": "1ad6b425-5ebf-4864-98e0-7bb44c318bac"
   }
   ```


# How a Postman mock server matches requests to saved examples

When you create a mock server, Postman associates a collection (and optionally an environment) with the new mock server. When you call it using its URL (for example, `https://M1.mock.pstmn.io`), the mock service retrieves all saved examples (responses) for the associated collection before it begins the matching process.

After the mock service gets the collection's examples, it iteratively pairs the incoming request with the closest matching example.

Incoming requests can have configurable variables, such as `requestMethod`, `requestPath`,  `requestHeaders`, `requestBody`, and `requestParams`. The `requestMethod` variable corresponds to any valid HTTP request method, and the `requestPath` refers to any valid string path (such as `/` or `/test`).

You can also use optional headers, like `x-mock-response-name` or `x-mock-response-id`, to further specify the example returned, based on the example's name or UID respectively. You can use the Postman API to [get a collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/ypuwpio/get-a-collection), then find your example's UID (in `<userId>-<responseId>` format) in the response.

<img alt="Mock request configurable elements" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-configurable-elements-v11.jpg" />

## How it works

To match an incoming request with the closest matching example, Postman uses the following algorithm:

### 1. Fetch all examples

The mock service fetches all examples in the associated collection and converts them into Postman response objects using the [Postman Collection SDK](/docs/developer/collection-sdk/). If process fails, resulting in a response that isn't in the expected format, the example is removed from the matching process.

The mock service also fetches the environment associated with the mock server (if there is one). Collection variables and environment variables in the examples are then populated with data.

### 2. Filter by HTTP method

Any responses that aren't the same HTTP method type as the incoming request are removed from the matching process. For example, if the mock request was a POST to `https://M1.mock.pstmn.io/test`, all examples that aren't the POST method are disregarded.

### 3. Filter by custom headers

The matching algorithm checks any custom headers passed in the incoming request in the following order:

1. If the `x-mock-response-code` header is provided, the algorithm filters out all examples that don't have a matching response status code.
2. If the `x-mock-response-id` header is provided, the algorithm selects the example with the matching response ID and returns the example as the response. If no example is found with a matching ID, the matching process stops and Postman returns an error.
3. If the `x-mock-response-name` header is provided, the algorithm selects the example with the matching name and returns the example as the response.

   * If more than one example in the mocked collection has the same name, Postman sorts the examples by ID and returns the first example in the list with a `200` response status code.
   * If none of the matching examples has a `200` response status code, Postman returns the first example in the sorted list.
   * If no example is found with a matching name, the matching process stops and Postman returns an error.

### 4. Filter by URL

The matching algorithm compares the incoming request's path with each saved example's path. The algorithm then assigns a score to each example based on how close the paths match.

An example starts with a score of 100. The algorithm goes through the matching process, stopping only when a match is made. The score is then adjusted based on the step that resulted in a match. If a match can't be made, the example is removed from the matching process.

<Accordion title="Click to view details about the matching algorithm process.">
  | URL matching step                                                                | Matching score change |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
  | URL match is perfect                                                             | No change             |
  | URLs match after removing trailing slashes (/)                                   | Reduced by 5          |
  | URL match is case insensitive                                                    | Reduced by 10         |
  | URLs match after removing trailing slashes (/) and the match is case insensitive | Reduced by 15         |
  | URLs match after removing wildcard variables                                     | Reduced by 20         |
  | URLs match after removing alphanumeric IDs                                       | Reduced by 21         |
  | URLs match after removing trailing slashes (/) and alphanumeric IDs              | Reduced by 25         |
  | URLs match based on a document distance algorithm                                | Reduced by 30         |
</Accordion>

For example, if the incoming request's URL is `https://M1.mock.pstmn.io/test` and the example's URL is `https://postman.com/about`, the algorithm compares the `/test` path with the `/about` path. In this case they don't match, so the corresponding example is skipped, and the algorithm moves to the next example.

### 5. Filter by parameters

After matching URLs, the algorithm examines the parameters for each example (for example, `{{url}}/path?status=pass`). The matching score is further adjusted based on the number of parameter matches, partial parameter matches, and missing parameters.

* **Parameter match** - A key-value pair in the example matches a key-value pair in the incoming request.
* **Partial parameter match** - A key in the example matches a key in the incoming request, but the values for the keys don't match.
* **Missing parameter** - A key is present in the example or the incoming request but not in both.

The number of matching parameters is used to calculate the matching percentage. The percentage equals the number of parameter matches divided by the sum of all parameter matches, partial parameter matches, and missing parameters.

### 6. Check for header and body matching

You can [enable header and request body matching](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#match-request-body-and-headers) in the mock server configuration. You can also enable header and body matching by passing the `x-mock-match-request-body` or `x-mock-match-request-headers` custom header with the request. These custom headers have higher precedence than header or body matching values specified in the mock server configuration.

If you enable request body matching, you must add the `Content-Type` header to your examples and use the same value as your request, such as `application/json`.

When header and body matching are enabled, the algorithm:

1. Filters out all examples that don't match the specified request headers. Header matching is case insensitive.
2. Filters out all examples that don't match the request body.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **When body matching isn't explicitly enabled, the matching algorithm still considers the request body.** If an example's body matches the request body, the example's matching score increases. If the example's body doesn't match, the example's score isn't adjusted, and the example isn't removed from the matching process.
</Info>

### 7. Select the highest matching score

The matching algorithm checks the matching scores of the remaining examples and returns the example with the highest score.

* If more than one example has the highest score, Postman sorts the examples by ID and returns the first example in the list with a `200` response status code.
* If none of the highest-scoring examples has a `200` response status code, Postman returns the first example in the sorted list.

## Use wildcard variables

All variables in an example's request that don't exist in the mock server's associated collection or environment are treated as *wildcard variables*. Wildcard variables act as capture groups for dynamic URL segments and applies to entire URL path segments. This is useful if some segments of the API's URL map to resource identifiers, like user IDs, user names, or file names.

For example, you can mock an endpoint that returns a user profile by ID. The endpoint takes in the user ID from the URL and returns the user ID in the response. On calling the GET `{{url}}/users/{{userId}}` endpoint, it returns:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Carol"
}
```

### Wildcard variables in responses

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Wildcards in response bodies aren't part of the matching algorithm.
</Info>

You can add the same variables in the example's response to use their captured values. For example, you can add a request body for the previous example:

```js
{
  "id": {{userId}},
  "name": "Carol"
}
```

This passes the value captured from the wildcard segment to the same variable name into the response.

## Troubleshooting mock server responses

If the mock server isn't returning the example you expect for a request, try the following:

* **Add different path variables to your examples.** Two examples with the same path variables are assigned the same matching score. In this case, Postman returns one of the examples. To make sure more than one example isn't assigned the same matching score, use different path variables for each of your examples.
* **Use request body matching to return a specific example.** When you [enable request body matching](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#match-request-body-and-headers), Postman returns the example that has the same body as your request. Your request uses the `Content-Type` header with a value like `application/json`, if the body is in JSON format. For Postman to return the correct example, you must use the `Content-Type` header in your example with the same value as your request.
* **Use optional headers to return a specific example.** You can make sure the mock server returns a specific example by using the `x-mock-response-name` or `x-mock-response-id` header in your request. Postman returns the example with the matching name or UID.
* **Make sure to use unique names for all saved examples in the mocked collection.** If more than one example in the collection has the same name, you may not get the expected response when using the `x-mock-response-name` header. Optionally, use the `x-mock-response-id` header to get the correct response. To find the ID of a saved example, select it in the sidebar, then click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the right sidebar.
* **Filter out examples by response status code.** You can use the `x-mock-response-code` header in your request to specify the response status code you want. Any examples that don't have the matching response status code are removed from the matching process.


# Learn how to use mock servers with tutorials

These tutorials show you how to get started with Postman’s mock servers and make the most of their features. You'll learn how to use examples to set up custom responses and how to create mock servers using the [Postman API](https://api.postman.com). This makes it easier to test your API and can help you automate your workflow during development.

[*Mock servers*](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/overview/) enable you to simulate how your API works, without needing a live server. In Postman, you can create a collection with sample requests and examples of the responses you expect. When you send a request to the mock server, Postman replies with the example response you set up so you can test and share your API during development.

## Tutorials

* [Mock APIs with response examples](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-examples/)
* [Create and use a mock server using the Postman API](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-api/)


# Mock APIs with response examples

[Mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) simulate an API server by returning predefined data, so you can develop or test an API before it's ready for production. In Postman, mock servers use [examples](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) saved in an HTTP collection to return mock data.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how mock servers and examples work together and how to integrate them into your API workflow.

## Create a new collection and request

To get started, you'll need to create a collection and an example response.

1. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> in the sidebar. Select **Blank collection** and give it the "C1" name.
2. In the collection, click **Add a request** to create a request. Optionally, you can rename the request.
3. Select the **GET** method, then enter `https://postman-echo.com/get?test=123` as the request URL.
4. Click **Send**, then click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save** to save the request in the **C1** collection.

<img alt="Send a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step1-v11-43.jpg" />

## Save a response as an example

Save the response you received from the Postman Echo service as an example.

1. Click <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save Response** to save the example in the request.
2. (Optional) Rename the example (for example, "E1"). The request method, URL, and status code are all saved as part of the example. Postman uses these items to decide which responses the mock server returns.

## Send a request to the mock server

Next, create a mock server for the **C1** collection.

1. Click **Mock servers** in the sidebar.

2. [Create a mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#create-a-mock-server) for the **C1** collection. For this tutorial, name the mock server "M1".

3. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save** to save the mock server.

4. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy URL** to copy the "M1" mock server's URL.

   <img alt="Copy mock URL" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step5a-v11.23.jpg" />

5. In the **C1** collection, create a new request.

6. Paste the mock URL as the request's URL, then click **Send**.

   <img alt="Mock server error response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step5b-v11-42.jpg" />

   The request returns an error because the mock server's URL doesn't have a defined path. The path appended to the end of the mock server URL must match the path in the example's request URL (`/get`). The method selected in the mock server and example must also match. Responses returned by the mock service depend on the URL and method in your saved examples.

7. To send a request to the mock server, add `/get` to the end of the mock server's URL, then click **Send**.

   <img alt="Mock server correct response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step5c-v11-42.jpg" />

### Add another example

You can add another example to test how responses from the mock service depend on saved examples.

1. [Create and send a request](#send-a-request-to-the-mock-server). Select the **GET** method, then enter `https://postman-echo.com/test` as the request URL.

   The GET request to `https://postman-echo.com/test` returns an HTTP 404 Not Found status code.

2. Save the request to the **C1** collection.

3. [Save the response as an example](#save-a-response-as-an-example). Rename the example to "E2".

   <img alt="Add a second example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step6a-v11.23.jpg" />

4. [Send a request to the mock server](#send-a-request-to-the-mock-server). Update the path at the end of the mock server URL to `/test` and click **Send**. The mock server returns the expected HTTP 404 Not Found status code.

   <img alt="Send another request to the mock server" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-step6b-v11-42.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Your examples can vary depending on the URL endpoint, request method, or status code.** If you have multiple examples, you can choose to save each example under a unique endpoint URL, like you saw in this demonstration with `/get` and `/test`. If you've saved examples with different response status codes, you can send an authenticated request to the mock server along with the `x-mock-response-code` header specifying which integer response code your returned response needs to match.
</Info>

## Use query parameters

Postman's mock service uses a [matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/) to select the best saved example to return in response to a request. As part of this algorithm, the mock server looks at the request's path and query parameters, and then matches the request to a saved example. If you have examples with the same request path but different query parameters, you can mock different responses for different query parameters on the same request path.

The following scenario demonstrates how the matching algorithm selects the best saved example:

* A mocked collection has one request named **Request1** with two examples named **Example1** and **Example2**.

* In **Example1**, the `id` parameter has a `1` value.

  <img alt="Query parameters example 1" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-params1-v11.23.jpg" />

* In **Example2**, the `id` parameter has a `5` value.

  <img alt="Query parameters example 2" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-params2-v11.23.jpg" />

* In this scenario, **Example1** and **Example2** have the same request path (`/get`), but they each have an `id` query parameter with different values. When you send a request to the mock server URL and pass these different query parameters, Postman returns the exact response that matches both the path and the query parameters.

  <img alt="Query parameters mock response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-params3-v11-42.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If no exact match is found, Postman returns the best response based on its [matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/).
</Info>

## Mock GraphQL queries

Postman's mock service enables you to mock GraphQL queries. To mock GraphQL queries, make a request to the mock server using the request path and request body saved in the examples in the mocked collection.

Make sure to set the `Content-type: application/json` header to in your examples.

<img alt="Query parameters example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-examples-graphql1-v11.23.jpg" />


# Create and use a mock server using the Postman API

Set up a [mock server](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) to simulate the behavior of a real API for development or testing purposes. In Postman, you [mock a collection](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/tutorials/mock-with-examples/) by adding examples and creating a mock server. You can automate the process of setting up a mock server using the [Postman API](https://api.postman.com/).

Follow the steps below to get a hands-on demonstration of how to mock a collection with the Postman API.

## Set up a collection for mocking

To set up a mock server for calling the collection's endpoints, do the following:

1. [Create a new collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#create-a-new-collection) called "testAPI". Optionally, you can also [create a new environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) called "testAPI" to store variables for your collection.
2. [Add an HTTP request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/#create-a-new-request) to the collection. For this example, the collection uses a **Request 1** request that sends a GET request to `https://postman-echo.com/get?test=123`.
3. Open the request in the collection and click **Send**.
4. In the response pane, click <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save Response**. Your mock server uses this [saved example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/) to return mock data.

   You can [edit your example](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/#edit-an-example) to include the specific response body, header, or status code that you want the mocked endpoint to return. A request can have more than one example, in which case the mock server follows a [matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/) to decide which example to return.

   ![Response saved as an example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-api-saved-example-v11.24.jpg)

## Get the collection and environment ID

To get the **testAPI** collection's ID, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the right sidebar of the **testAPI** collection.
2. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy collection ID** to copy the ID, then save it for later.

To get the environment's ID, do the following:

1. Click **Environments** in the sidebar, then select the environment you want.
2. Click <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Info** in the right sidebar to access the environment ID.
3. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy environment ID** to copy it, then save it for later.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also use the Postman API's [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/9b3bkoy/get-all-collections) `/collections` and [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/bqbz8iw/get-all-environments) `/environments` endpoints to get the IDs.
</Info>

## Create a mock server with the Postman API

After getting the collection ID and environment ID, you'll use the [POST](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/5y0q4k4/create-a-mock-server) `/mocks` endpoint to create a mock server.

1. Create a new request in Postman and select the **POST** method.

2. Enter the `https://api.getpostman.com/mocks` endpoint URL.

3. In the **Authorization** tab, select **Postman API** for the **Auth Type**. Then, enter a valid [Postman API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys/) in the **Auth credentials** text box.

4. In the request's **Body** tab, select **raw** and enter the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
       "mock": {
           "name": "testAPImock",
           "collection": "{{collectionId}}",
           "environment": "{{environmentId}}" // Optional
       }
   }
   ```

5. Update the request body's variables with the copied collection and environment IDs.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you aren't using an environment, comment out or remove the `environment` property.
   </Info>

6. Click **Send**.

By default, this creates a public mock server. Public mock servers can receive requests from anyone and anywhere (such as a browser, application code, or a curl command). Private mock servers require a Postman API key in an `x-api-key` header. To create a private mock server, include `"private": true` in the request body.

![Creating a mock server](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-api-create-mock-v11-43.jpg)

## Get the mock server URL

To send a request to your mock server, you'll need to know its URL.

1. Click **Mock servers** in the sidebar. Then, select the **testAPI** mock server.
2. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy URL**.

You can also use the Postman API to get the mock server's URL. The [POST](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/5y0q4k4/create-a-mock-server) `/mocks` endpoint returns the URL in the response when it [creates the mock server](#create-a-mock-server-with-the-postman-api). If you need to get the URL, make a request to the [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/6v89u2r/get-all-mock-servers) `/mocks` endpoint and copy the `mockUrl` value.

## Send a request to the mock server

You're ready to simulate requests using your **testAPI** collection.

1. In the **Request 1** request, append the `{{mockUrl}}` variable to the URL: `https://{{mockUrl}}/get?test=123`.

2. Update the `{{mockUrl}}` variable with your mock server's URL.
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Because this is a public mock server, you don't need to include an `x-api-key` header in the request.
   </Info>

3. Click **Send**. The response pane displays the mock server's response.

![Sending a request to the mock server](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-api-mock-response-v11-43.jpg)

Notice that the response is the same as the example you saved for **Request 1**. That's because the mock server uses the example to create its response. If you added more requests and examples to the collection, send them to the mock server using the mock server URL and the request path.

## Add optional request headers

Postman mock servers accept optional headers that you can use to customize how the mock server responds to requests. Using these headers, you can specify which saved examples the mock server returns. Without these headers, the mock server follows a [matching algorithm](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/matching-algorithm/) to decide which example to return in a response.

To add a custom header to a request, do the following:

1. Open the collection's request and select the **Headers** tab.
2. Enter a custom header in the **Key** field, then enter a **Value** for the header. You can enter `x-mock` in the **Key** field to view a list of the available mock server headers.

   <img alt="Sending a request to the mock server" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/mock-server-custom-headers-v11.01.jpg" width="400px" />

### Match a specific response code

Use the `x-mock-response-code` header to specify an HTTP response code the response will match. For example, `500` returns an example with the HTTP 500 response.

### Match a response name or ID

Use the `x-mock-response-name` or `x-mock-response-id` headers to specify the exact response you want the mock server to return by matching the `id` or `name` of the saved example. You can get the example response `id` or `name` using the Postman API's [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/ypuwpio/get-a-collection) `/collections/{collectionId}` endpoint, then find your example in the response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Make sure to use unique names for all saved examples in the mocked collection.** If more than one example in the collection has the same name, you may not get the expected response when using the `x-mock-response-name` header. Optionally, use the `x-mock-response-id` header to get the correct response.
</Info>

### Match a request body or header

Use the `x-mock-match-request-body` or `x-mock-match-request-headers` headers to specify the exact response you want the mock server to return by matching the headers or body of the saved example.

* To enable request body matching, set the `x-mock-match-request-body` value to `true`. You must also add the `Content-Type` header to your examples and use the same value as your request.
* To enable request header matching, include the `x-mock-match-request-headers` header and set its value to a comma-separated string of header keys that you want to match in the saved examples. Header matching isn't case-sensitive.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also enable body and header matching in the [mock server configuration](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#match-request-body-and-headers).
</Info>

### Set a custom response delay

Use the `x-mock-response-delay` header to add a delay to the response from the mock server. You can specify a value range of `1` to `180000` milliseconds. After receiving the request, the mock server waits the specified period of time before sending the response.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also specify a delay in the [mock server configuration](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/#edit-the-mock-server-configuration). The delay value set by the `x-mock-response-delay` header takes precedence over the value set in the mock server configuration.
</Info>


# Administer Postman

Postman has a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your Postman organization and teams. Whether you're setting up a new organization and teams or managing an existing one, you can customize your team experience to align with your organization's goals.

Depending on your plan, you must be an [Organization Manager, Team Manager, Admin, or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to set up, manage, and secure your Postman organization and teams.

To set up a new Postman organization and teams, you can follow the steps in Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/).

## Set up and manage your Postman team or organization

You can [invite and manage collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) in your Postman team, and update their assigned roles. You can also [adjust your team's Postman plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes) as needed.

[Configure your team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) to further customize the experience for both your Postman team and your API's consumers. This includes managing your organization's public profile and making your teams discoverable.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To set up a new Postman team, you can follow the steps in Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/).
</Info>

If you're setting up an [Enterprise organization and teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), more features are available to you with [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/). Enterprise features include advanced organization-level settings, identity management, reports, a Private API Network, API governance and security controls, and features that enhance collaboration and administration customization.

## Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can secure your team's user accounts by setting up and using the following:

* [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/)
* [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/)
* [Domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/)

## Admin FAQs

To learn more about managing Postman teams, see [Admin FAQs](/docs/administration/admin-faqs/).


# Onboarding checklist

To get started using Postman within your organization, you can walk through the following tasks to set your Postman teams up for success. It's recommended that you first collaborate with your identified Admins and your organization's IT team to set up, secure, and manage Postman in your organization. Then you can set up your Postman teams by configuring relevant settings, inviting people to your teams and assigning them roles, and creating workspace resources related to your projects.

If you have a Postman Enterprise plan with Postman Organizations enabled, you can replicate your internal organization structure by creating independent teams, each with its own set of managers and members. This setup prevents sharing sensitive information and gives each team better control over its membership. By default, a given organization team's content is shared with the entire organization, or limited to just the team or specific members, reducing clutter and oversharing in the organization.

You can [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also [access Postman on the web](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) with the [Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

## Set up Postman in your organization

To begin setting up Postman, assign the Admin role to one or more users. This role gives them permission to set up Postman and your organization or team. Admins can then contact your IT team for help with setting up, managing, and securing Postman in your organization. After you set up Postman, you can [set up your Postman](#set-up-your-postman-collaboration).

If you have Postman Organizations enabled, assign the Organization Manager role to one or more users. Organization Managers can then create teams and assign Team Managers to those teams.

### Manage Admins and support users

Define [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to manage members and collaboration settings. [Create a Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/) for these users, and [assign them the Admin role](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/).

Admins can [assign the Super Admin role](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-super-admins) to members and [groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/), giving them permission to manage everything with a team. It's recommended that you create a user account that isn't tied to an individual team member, and assign the Super Admin role to that user account.

Admins can [assign the Admin and Billing roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to members and groups. Members who have only Admin or Billing roles (or both) become support users and don't consume paid seats. Each team can have two support users.

If you have a Postman Organization, identify the Team Managers who will manage the teams created by the Organization Managers. Team Managers can edit their team settings and manage all users and resources within their teams.

### Contact your IT team

Contact your IT team to establish the procedure for adding a new piece of software, which varies from organization to organization. The following topics are common:

* Your IT team may need to add an exception to device policy allowing for Postman to be installed on employee workstations. Provide a [Postman download link​](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to the IT team to help establish this exception.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    If you're on a [Postman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), your IT team can choose to deploy the Postman Enterprise app across your organization. For more information, see [Manage the Enterprise app](#manage-the-enterprise-app).
  </Info>

* If your organization's network connection is behind a proxy, you may need to configure Postman appropriately. Retrieve proxy connection details from your IT team and [​set them up within Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/proxy/)​.

* If your organization operates behind a firewall, your IT team may need to [configure allowlists for Postman's domains](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-postman-behind-a-firewall). This ensures Postman data is synced with the cloud and all functionality works as expected.

* Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you may be able to obtain static IP addresses for Postman Monitors, enabling you to monitor APIs behind a restricted firewall. Your IT team must [allowlist static IPs for monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/#allowlisting-static-ip-addresses).

### Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can secure your Postman team by setting up [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/), [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), and [domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/). You must first configure SSO before you can configure SCIM provisioning and domain capture.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You might need to contact your IT team for help with configuring SSO, SCIM, and domain verification and capture.
</Info>

Admins can [configure domain verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/#add-and-verify-a-domain) to verify your organization's domain or subdomain. This enables you to instantly onboard users who created Postman accounts with your verified domain or subdomain. You must verify your domain or subdomain before you can configure domain capture. It's recommended that you begin the domain verification process early because the time to complete this task varies by organization.

Admins can [configure single sign-on (SSO) for your team](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) to configure an authentication method for your team with an identity provider (IdP). Postman supports several IdPs you can use to configure SSO for your team. After you configure SSO for your team, it's recommended that you internally document how to [sign in to Postman with SSO](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/), such as your Postman team's domain and steps for signing in with SSO details.

Admins can [configure SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) for your team](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-provisioning) to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning using your IdP, such as Okta or OneLogin.

Admins can [configure domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/) to consolidate Postman user accounts in your organization into a single team. Before you configure domain capture, it's recommended that you notify users that their accounts will be merged, and [enable Auto-flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to ensure your team can automatically accommodate all added users.

### Merge teams into a single account

You can merge one or more Postman teams into a single, company-authorized Postman account. This enables users in your organization to collaborate in the same Postman team. To merge Postman teams, you must [migrate team data into the company-authorized account](/docs/administration/team-merge/).

<Tip title="Tip">
  Contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support) to discuss the best team migration plan for your organization.
</Tip>

### Manage the Enterprise app

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you may be able to manage Postman app versioning for your team, or download and install Postman's Enterprise app. Admins can [set a team-wide version of Postman](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#managing-postman-app-versioning) with help from Postman support, or [download and install the Postman Enterprise app](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#deploying-the-postman-enterprise-app) to their organization. Postman's Enterprise app is a variant of Postman's Desktop app that offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy Postman at an enterprise level.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You might need to contact your IT team for help with configuring the Enterprise app in your organization. This might include adding the Postman Enterprise app installer to your organization's internal app store for employees to install.
</Info>

After you configure the Postman Enterprise app in your organization, it's recommended that you internally document how employees can install the app on their workstations.

## Set up your Postman collaboration

After you [set up Postman](#set-up-postman-in-your-organization), enable your teammates to find and join your teams. You can also share invites with them directly. Once you add members to your team, you can begin assigning them roles based on their permissions. Then you can begin collaborating with your teammates in workspaces, collections, and other workspace resources.

### Configure organization or team settings

Super Admins and Admins can [configure your organization or team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) to ensure people in your organization can find and join your team. You can also keep your team profile updated for your API's consumers.

You can [make your organization or team discoverable](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-member-access) to enable people in your organization to find and join your team. When team discovery is enabled, Postman displays a list of teams to join when users in your organization access their Postman accounts. Anyone signing in with a company email address is presented with available teams and can make a request to join each one.

You can also [manage your public profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-your-publisher-profile) to share information about your organization with other Postman users. This ensures your API's consumers have important details about your public resources.

### Manage members

Admins can [manage members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/overview/) by adding, removing, and assigning roles to users. You can also organize members into groups, and assign roles to groups instead of individual users, enabling you to efficiently onboard new members.

You can [invite users to your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) by generating a shareable link or by inviting them through a direct email.

You can [assign team-level roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/) to individual members, enabling them to perform different actions within your team. You can also [organize members into groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/), and assign roles to groups.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
</Info>

### Create workspaces and collections

[Organize your projects in workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/), including collections, APIs, and more. You can also use workspaces to collaborate with teammates, and [share APIs with your API consumers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/). If you're not sure how to set up your workspace based on your project's use case, you can [apply a template to a workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace) to help you get started. Once your workspace is set up, you can [add members and groups to your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces).

In your workspaces, you can [group your requests and examples into collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/). This enables you to keep your workspaces organized by project, collaborate with teammates, run tests on related requests, and more. If you're not sure how to set up your collection, you can [create a collection from a template](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#create-a-collection-from-a-template). Postman has a variety of collection templates you can use for your projects.

You can assign [workspace roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) to members and groups at the [workspace level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles). You can also assign [element-based roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles) at the [element level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-element-based-roles), such as collections and APIs.

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you may also be able to [manage who can create internal workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/#manage-team-workspaces) in your team.

### Configure integrations

Postman has multiple integrations for popular third-party solutions. You can [add integrations](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/) to automatically share data between Postman and other tools, sync your collections and API definitions, and more.

## Questions

If you have any questions or run into any issues setting up Postman, check out the [Postman support center](https://www.postman.com/support) or explore the [Postman Community](https://community.postman.com/).


# Define roles and permissions within Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Certain team options are only available with **[paid plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**. To learn which roles are available with your plan, go to your **[web dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/roles)**.
</Info>

Roles define user permissions within Postman and levels of access to a Postman element, like a collection or an API.

## Organization roles

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Organizations is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**.
</Info>

Each team within an [organization](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-org/) has its own set of independent roles:

| Team role                          | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization Manager (Super Admin) | <ul><li>Has edit access to all elements within the organization or team and can edit the settings.</li><li>Manages the entire organization or team, including its users (add/remove/invite/assign) and resources (view/edit/manage).</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Member                             | <ul><li>Can have edit access to all elements on the organization or team, but doesn't automatically have access to workspaces, collections, and other elements unless given a role on that element.</li><li>Can view all shared resources and can have Editor or Viewer access to any workspace or resource within the team.</li><li>Automatically has access to all workspaces that are shared to the team when the workspace is set to **Everyone in \[TeamName]**.</li></ul>                                  |
| Collaborator                       | <ul><li>Can have a Developer or Viewer role. Developers can directly edit the element they're assigned, while Viewers can only view or fork the element they're assigned. Additionally, workspaces shared with the Team in the **Workspace Access** settings aren't automatically shared with Collaborators.</li><li>Must be granted access to workspaces either by setting the workspace to **Everyone in \[OrgName]** or by being invited directly through a user or a team or group they belong to.</li></ul> |

<Note title="Note">
  * Only a Team Member can create workspaces in the team.
  * Sharing an element with a new user triggers the process of adding that user to the Team's user list.
  * Any time a Team Member or Collaborator is removed from the Team's user list, they lose access to everything in the Team (until they're added back).
</Note>

## Team roles

With the Admin role, you have the power to define Postman access at the team level. You can use Postman's role-based access control system to limit visibility of team resources, define your development workflow, and give access to administrative and billing personnel. Each user on a team must have at least one role attached to them, and can hold multiple roles simultaneously.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/) one or more role types to team members, based on the functions those team members require:

* **Super Admin** ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Manages everything within a team, including team settings, members, roles, and resources. This role can view and manage all elements in [internal and public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility). Super Admins can perform all actions that other roles can perform. For information on assigning this role, see [Manage Super Admins](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-super-admins).
* **Admin** - Manages team members and team settings. Can also view monitor metadata and pause and resume monitors.
* **Billing** - Manages team plan and payments. Billing roles can be granted by a Super Admin, Admin, or by a fellow team member with a Billing role.
* **Developer** - Has access to all team resources and workspaces.
* **Community Manager** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Manages the public visibility of workspaces and team profile.
* **Partner Manager** (Internal, [Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Manages all [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/) within an organization. Controls Partner Workspace settings and visibility, and can invite, remove, and manage partners. To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

- **Partner** (External, [Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - All partners are automatically granted the Partner role at the team level. Partners can only access the [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/) they've been invited to. To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).
- **Guest** (Internal) - Views collections and sends requests in collections that have been shared with them. This role can't be directly assigned to a user. To learn more, see [Share collections with guest users](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you are on a [Postman Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also assign roles at the [group level](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).
</Info>

Team roles offer high-level access control:

There are additional specialized roles for [Enterprise](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) teams:

* **API Network Manager** - Manages a team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/). To learn more, see [Network roles](#network-roles).
* **API Governance Manager** - Manages [API governance](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) within a team, including governance [rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/), [functions](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/), and [workspace groups](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/#turn-configured-rules-on-and-off).

\* On Basic and Free plans, any developer can change the visibility of workspaces.

\*\* On Enterprise and Professional plans, only Super Admins and Community Managers can change and approve requests to change the visibility of a workspace to internal or public.

\*\*\* Enterprise plans only. Teams can allow users with the [Folder Manager role](#network-roles) to manage elements in specific folders in your team's Private API Network.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  Team members with a Developer or Super Admin role consume a paid seat on your team. Team members who have only Admin or Billing roles become support users and don't consume paid seats. Each team can have two support users.
</Warning>

### Managing team roles

To learn how to manage team roles in Postman, see [Manage your team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/).

## Workspace roles

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles) three role types in Postman workspaces: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**. Partner Workspaces offer an additional role type: **Partner Lead**.

* **Admin** - Can manage workspace resources and settings.
* **Editor** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Can create and edit workspace resources.
* **Viewer** ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Can view, fork, and export workspace resources.
* **Partner Lead** (External, [Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) - Can invite other partners from their organization to join a [Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

Partners have different permissions for Workspace Editor and Viewer roles in Partner Workspaces ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use the Postman API to programmatically manage users and user groups for workspaces. For more information, see the [Postman API collection](https://api.postman.com/).
</Info>

The following roles control access at a workspace level:

| Action                                                         | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Join and leave workspaces                                      | ✔     | ✔      | ✔      |
| Send requests                                                  | ✔     | ✔      | ✔      |
| Add APIs, collections, environments, flows, and specifications | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Edit and delete specifications                                 | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Move and delete APIs, collections, environments, and flows     | ✔     | ✔\*    |        |
| Restore and permanently delete collections                     | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Manage integrations                                            | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Add and delete monitors and mock servers                       | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Move mock servers                                              | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Create and delete workspaces                                   | ✔     |        |        |
| Edit workspace details                                         | ✔     |        |        |
| Add and remove members                                         | ✔     |        |        |
| Manage workspace roles                                         | ✔     |        |        |
| Manage workspace visibility                                    | ✔\*\* |        |        |

\* Workspace Editors can't move or delete any API. They must have the API Admin role on APIs they want to move or delete.

\*\* On Professional and Enterprise plans, an Admin for a workspace must request to change its visibility to public. This request will go to the [Community Manager](#team-roles). On Basic and Free plans, or if a team has no Community Manager assigned, an Admin for a workspace can control its visibility.

## Element-based roles

At the [element](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/) level, you can assign roles to team members that decide their level of access to the following elements:

* [Collections](#collection-roles)
* [APIs](#api-roles)
* [Environments](#environment-roles)
* [Mock servers](#mock-server-roles)
* [Monitors](#monitor-roles)

## Collection roles

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-element-based-roles) two role types in Postman collections: **Editor** and **Viewer**.

* **Editor** - Can edit collections directly
* **Viewer** - Can view, fork, and export collections

Partners have different permissions for Collection Editor and Viewer roles in Partner Workspaces ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)). To learn more, see [Partner team and Partner Workspace roles](#partner-team-and-partner-workspace-roles).

You can assign a limited Viewer role to a coworker who isn't in your Postman team by [allowing them to view specific collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-collections-with-guests). Users with this role can only view specific collections and send requests in the collections that have been shared with them.

The following roles control access at a collection level:

| Collections                                             | Editor | Viewer |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Edit, delete, and restore collections                   | ✔      |        |
| View deleted collections                                | ✔      | ✔      |
| Manage roles on collections                             | ✔      |        |
| Export collections                                      | ✔      | ✔      |
| Fork collections                                        | ✔      | ✔      |
| Merge forks on collections                              | ✔      |        |
| Publish collection documentation and add to API Network | ✔      |        |
| Share collection variables                              | ✔      |        |
| Share collections to a different workspace              | ✔      | ✔      |
| Tag collections                                         | ✔      |        |
| Add, edit, and delete mock servers                      | ✔      |        |

## API roles

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-element-based-roles) three role types in Postman APIs: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**.

* **Admin** - Can publish, move, and delete APIs
* **Editor** - Can edit APIs and API definitions
* **Viewer** - Can view published API versions

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you have the [Workspace Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) role, you will automatically inherit Admin permissions for all APIs in the workspace, even if you are assigned the Editor or Viewer role for an API.
</Info>

The following roles control access at an API level:

| APIs                                         | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Edit APIs and API definitions                | ✔     | ✔      |        |

| Move and delete APIs                         | ✔     |        |        |
| Manage roles on APIs                         | ✔     | ✔\*    |        |
| Comment on APIs                              | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Comment on published API versions            | ✔     | ✔      | ✔      |
| Share APIs                                   | ✔     | ✔      | ✔      |
| Generate collections from the API definition | ✔     | ✔      |        |
| Add and remove API documentation collections | ✔     | ✔      |        |

## Partner team and Partner Workspace roles

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Partner team and Partner Workspace roles are available with Postman Enterprise plans. The Partner Editor role is available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans with the Partner Editor add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Partner team and Partner Workspace roles relate to [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/) and are applied at the team, workspace, and collection levels. There are different team and Partner Workspace roles you can assign to team members and external partners:

|                      |    For team members   | For partners                                  |
| -------------------- | :-------------------: | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Team level**       |    Partner Manager    | Partner                                       |
| **Workspace level**  | Admin, Viewer, Editor | Viewer, Editor <br /> Partner Lead (optional) |
| **Collection level** |     Viewer, Editor    | Viewer, Editor                                |

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/) the Partner Manager role to team members at the team level, and [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/setup/#invite-collaborators-to-a-partner-workspace) partners with the Partner role:

* **Partner Manager** - Manages all Partner Workspaces within an organization. Controls Partner Workspace settings and visibility, and can send invites to partners. If no Partner Manager role is assigned, the Admin is auto-assigned the Partner Manager role when they create their first Partner Workspace.
* **Partner** - Can only access the Partner Workspaces they've been invited to. All partners are assigned [Workspace Editor or Viewer](#workspace-roles) roles when invited to a Partner Workspace. You can edit Partner Workspace permissions for partners at the workspace and collection levels.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-workspace-roles) Partner Workspace roles to partners at the workspace level:

* **Partner Lead** - Can invite other partners from their organization to join a Partner Workspace.
* **Editor** - Partners can create and edit Partner Workspace resources, [import and export](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/) elements, and [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) elements to Partner Workspaces within the same team.
* **Viewer** - Partners can view Partner Workspace resources and [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) elements to another Partner Workspace within the same team where they're assigned the Workspace Editor role.

You can also [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-element-based-roles) Partner Workspace roles to partners at the collection level:

* **Editor** - Partners can [export collections](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-collections). They can also [fork collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) within the same Partner Workspace or to another Partner Workspace within the same team. They can't fork collections outside the team.
* **Viewer** - Partners can [fork collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) to another Partner Workspace within the same team where they're assigned the Workspace Editor role. They can't fork elements outside the team. Also, they can't export collections.

To learn more about collaborating as a team member or partner, see [Collaborate in a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/collaborate/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to invite a partner as a Workspace Editor. Otherwise, the partner will be assigned the Workspace Viewer role, giving the partner permission to view all workspace resources. Also, your team must have available seats to assign a partner as a Collection Editor. Assigning a partner the Workspace Viewer or Collection Viewer roles doesn't consume paid seats.
</Info>

## Network roles

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Network roles are available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Network roles related to your [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/) are applied at the team and folder level.

You can [assign](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/) network roles at the team level:

* **API Network Manager** - Manages a team's Private API Network, including adding elements and reviewing requests to add them.

You can also [assign](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/organizing-private-network/#edit-folder-managers) network roles at the folder level:

* **Folder Manager** - Manages specific folders and the elements in them in a team's Private API Network. Team members with this role can perform all actions that API Network Manager role can perform but only in folders they have permission to manage.

## Next steps

After learning about the roles available to team members, you can manage your team's level of access and control more effectively.

# Migrate data between teams

Team migration is required when you merge one or more Postman teams into a single (typically company-authorized) account. There are several reasons for having a company-authorized Postman account (or team) including security, the ability for a company to better oversee its intellectual property, and to give users the benefit of a robust paid plan.

Team migration can occur in different ways depending on your needs and preferred outcomes.

## Who can perform team migration

* All plan types (Free and paid)
* [Team members with the Admin or Developer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles)
* Information Technology or System Administrator for [single sign-on provisioning](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/) (available with [Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/))

## Before you start migrating

* Make sure you understand [role-based access control](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) at a [team](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), [workspace](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles), and [collection](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) level.
* Decide what type of [export option](#migrating-your-data) is right for your company.
* Understand [what data is and isn't exported](/docs/administration/team-merge/#migration-faqs) in a [data-dump](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps).
* [Read the migration FAQs](#migration-faqs).

## Migrating your data

You can choose either [centralized](#choosing-centralized-migration) or [distributed](#choosing-distributed-migration) migration to export your team data.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  As a precautionary measure prior to migrating data, Admins are strongly encouraged to perform a [JSON data dump backup through a bulk export](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps).
</Info>

### Choosing centralized migration

Centralized migration must be performed by an Admin.

With centralized migration, you will export a large JSON file of collections, environments, globals, and header presets.

You can bulk export your internal workspaces.

Choose centralized migration if the following conditions apply:

* Your organization prefers to have one person perform the migration.

Don't choose centralized migration if your organization relies on the following:

* Postman-published documentation–URLs would need to be republished from your new team instance.
* Mocks and monitors—you would need to recreate these.
* Team members have a lot of important content in their workspaces that must be transferred.

See [performing centralized migration](#performing-centralized-migration) to choose this option.

### Choosing distributed migration

You can carry out distributed migration with any type of Postman account.

Admins and Super Admins can bulk export data. See [Export data from Postman](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) for more information.

If you have an account and aren't part of a team yet, but want to keep an independent workspace after joining one, see [Join a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team). When migrating company data to an authorized team, you can [export specific data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) or [export a dump of all data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps).

If you have an account and want to deactivate it and join an authorized team, you can accept the team invite and choose to transfer your Postman data to the new team.

Choose distributed migration if the following conditions apply:

* Your organization has workspaces that have dedicated [Workspace Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) with many collections.
  * Workspace Admins can export any relevant collections and environments into the new workspace.
* You are a single user and want to deactivate your existing account or move company data from your account to the authorized team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Recreating mocks, monitors, and documentation on the new team may be carried out by those who are responsible for maintaining it.
</Info>

Don't choose distributed migration if your organization is unable to do the following:

* Confirm ownership of workspaces, collections, and other data that may be important and would otherwise be lost if no one takes responsibility for migrating it.
* Create the necessary communication channels so you know when everyone has migrated.

See [performing distributed migration](#performing-distributed-migration) to choose this option.

### Performing centralized migration

1. The Super Admin or appointed Admin on the original team inherits ownership of all shared and unshared data. The appointed Admin is the last person on the team who will inherit the content ownership once all team members are removed.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     **Notes:**

     * Data from workspaces you haven't joined won't be present in the export.
     * By default, the person who imports a collection or environment is automatically assigned the Editor role (learn more about [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/)). Everyone else on the team will be assigned the Viewer role.
   </Info>

2. [Export all data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) at once with a [JSON data dump](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps).

3. The appointed Admin can then [re-import into the new team](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/).
   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     All collections included in the data dump will be imported into your selected workspace.
   </Info>

4. When your new team is ready for users to join, the Admin on the new team can send invitations to all other team members. The invite link will prompt them to join the new team. Once they've joined the new team, you can [remove them from the original team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/scale-team/#remove-members).

5. At this point, you can [re-share and organize collections into internal workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).

6. Once the last team member from your previous team has migrated to your new one, the original team will be deleted along with all of the data within it. You can then begin [collaborating](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/) in your new team. To learn more about collaborating in Postman, watch [Working with your team in Postman](https://youtu.be/5lscUV-Exac).

### Performing distributed migration

1. Team members need to [export](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) their Postman data prior to moving to your new team. You can use this as an opportunity to clean up and reorganize your workspaces.

2. Team members can [leave the previous team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#leave-a-team) and [join your new team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team). They can then re-import Postman data into their respective internal workspaces, creating new workspaces where necessary.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     By default, the person who imports a collection or environment is automatically assigned the Editor role (learn more about [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/)). Everyone else on the team will be assigned the Viewer role.
   </Info>

3. Once the last team member from your previous team has migrated to your new one, the original team will be deleted along with all of the data within it. You can then begin [collaborating](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/) in your new team. To learn more about collaborating in Postman, watch [Working with your team in Postman](https://youtu.be/5lscUV-Exac).

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     **Notes:**

     * If you change your team email to a non-company domain email (for example, Gmail or Yahoo), your original team continues to exist indefinitely. You can keep an account with your current data and use a work email for a work account. Keeping both accounts in use can help when you migrate data.
     * Keep in mind items that will need to be recreated (such as monitors and mocks).
   </Info>

## Migration FAQs

* **I'm on a free account, what happens to my collections when I join a team?**

  If you're an individual Postman user and join a team, you can choose to transfer your workspaces and the data within them to the team or keep them separate. In the following cases, your workspaces and the data within them automatically transfer when you join a team, with caveats as noted:

  * If you [request to join a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#find-teams-within-your-organization) and are approved by an Admin. However, if you're joining a team no one else has joined, you'll be prompted to transfer your data.
  * If the team has [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) enabled.
  * If the team has [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) enabled.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    **Notes:**

    * If you already belong to a team and are switching to another team, your data won't be automatically transferred. Instead, you can export and import your data. An Admin can perform a bulk export. See [Export data from Postman](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) for more information.
    * If you leave a team on a non-Enterprise plan, you can move your work back to your own workspace.
  </Info>

  For more information about data handling related to joining and leaving a team, see [Join a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team).

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    If you experience any issues when joining a new team, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).
  </Info>

* **Can I be on two teams at once?**

  Yes, each account can be on multiple Postman teams at a time.

* **Will my monitors / mocks transfer over?**

  No, you will need to [recreate any monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/) and [mocks](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) in your new team.

* **What data is exported in a large JSON file data-dump?**

  All collections in your workspace and any workspaces that you have joined, in addition to environments, globals, and header presets, are included when you [export a data dump](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/#export-data-dumps).

* **What data doesn't get exported?**

  You will need to [reassign roles (workspace, collection, and environment level)](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/), [recreate workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#create-a-new-workspace), [recreate monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/), [recreate mocks](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/), [re-import API schemas](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/), and [republish documentation from your new team pages](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/).

* **What happens to published documentation from my previous team?**

  Your documentation links will break since the previous team is no longer active. New documentation URLs will need to be generated when collections are [republished from your new team pages](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/). If you are [publishing to a custom domain](/docs/publishing-your-api/custom-doc-domains/), unpublish and remove the domain from your previous team to add it to your new team and republish.

* **What happens to the previous team once everyone leaves?**

  If it's a free team, the team is deleted after the last team member leaves the team. Previous users of the deleted team will no longer have access to the team's workspaces, including your own workspaces, or any elements in them. Users can [export their Postman data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/exporting-data/) prior to leaving the team to ensure it stays with them.

  If it's a paid team, you must contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) to cancel the plan subscription before you can leave the team.

# Organization and team management overview

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Some team options are only available on [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

Postman provides tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your team. As an [Organization Manager, Admin, or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can streamline the onboarding process, manage access to workspaces and products, and customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're setting up your Postman team, check out Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to get started.
</Info>

## Create organizations and teams

If you're on an Enterprise plan, you can [create an organization](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-org/) in Postman to streamline API collaboration, reduce clutter in teams, maintain tighter access controls, and prevent the unwanted exposure of work and secrets. Then you can hand off your individual teams to [Team Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). Regardless of your plan type, you can [create your team in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/) and have teams of up to three work at no cost.

## Manage members

You can [invite collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) to your Postman team, including Developers, Admins, Collaborators, external partners, and Guests. You can [update users' assigned roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/) and manage their access to resources as needed.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can use [Postman groups](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to assign roles and manage access to elements at scale.

## Manage team resources

As a Team or Super Admin, you can [manage settings for specific team resources](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/) as follows:

* Permission to create internal workspaces
* Sharing collections with guest users
* Public mock servers
* External packages allowed in scripts

## Manage product access

You can [manage access](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/) to add-ons that you've purchased for your team. This enables you to provide additional permissions and features to team members as needed.

## Configure team settings

You can manage a variety of settings in your [team settings dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/). From the dashboard, you can configure items such as your team's [publisher profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-your-publisher-profile), [discoverability](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-member-access), [custom domains](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#add-custom-domains), and [authentication methods](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#edit-authentication-methods).

## Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can secure your team's data and user accounts by using the following:

* [Postman API key management](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/)
* [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/)
* [Audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/)
* [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/)
* [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/)

# Create an Organization in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Organizations is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**.
</Info>

*Postman Organizations* streamline API collaboration, reduce clutter in teams, maintain tighter access controls, and prevent the unwanted exposure of work and secrets. Organizations enable you to replicate your internal structure by creating independent teams, each with its own set of managers and members. This setup prevents sharing sensitive information and gives each team better control over its membership.

Learn how to plan and set up your organization teams and workspaces. To manage your publisher profile, discoverability, custom domains, authentication, and active invite links, see [Configure team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/).

## Plan your organization setup

Before you set up your organization teams, consider the following:

* How many teams do you need and for which specific step in your API lifecycle?
* How will you name your teams and workspaces?
* Who will be on each team, and who will manage it?
* How many workspaces will each team need to begin collaborating?
* If you have Slack or Teams workspaces, which channels do you need to connect each workspace to post workspace updates?

5. Select the team for which to create a workspace. Otherwise, your team will be prepopulated.

6. Select **Internal** for workspace type. You can update the workspace visibility at any time. As a best practice, workspaces need to remain internal until all the work has been completed and approved.

7. Select **Everyone in \[TeamName]** to allow all Team Members with access to the workspace, whether invited or shared, to edit the workspace elements. Collaborators will still have to be added to the workspace roles to enable their access. For stricter access, select **Only you and invited people**. If there's a specific need to open the workspaces to all people in the Organization, select **Everyone in \[OrgName]**.

8. Click **Create**.

After you create one or more workspaces, you can add workspace details, connect the workspace to a Slack or Teams channel, and post a workspace update announcing the workspace is ready for collaboration.

## Edit workspace details

Postman recommends adding a useful workspace description and other details to help organization teams start collaborating.

To identify workspaces further, do the following:

1. Under **Workspace description**, add a description.
2. Under **About**, add a summary.
3. Under **Tags**, add tags.

Your teams can continue to edit workspace details as their workspaces, collections, and APIs evolve.

To learn more, see [Edit workspace details](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#edit-workspace-details).

## Announce your team and workspace setup

To post a workspace update, do the following:

1. From the workspace, select **Updates**.
2. Select **Post an Update**.
3. Enter a title and a description of your update.
4. Select **Announcement** from the dropdown list.
5. (Optional) Add a summary describing the change.
6. If you've integrated Postman with Slack or Teams, you can post a team workspace update to a channel on one or both of those apps. Click **Post Update**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If a social channel is already subscribed to workspace updates the checkbox next to **Share on Slack (or Teams)** on the bottom right of the post is checked. If not, click <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" /> <img alt="Teams icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Connect** in the workspace overview to subscribe to a channel.

# Organize users into Postman groups

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Groups are available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

With Postman groups, you can arrange users into groups that reflect your organizational structure. You can add users to a group, then assign that group roles and access to the resources they'll be using across Postman. You can also efficiently onboard new team members by adding them to existing groups in your organization, instantly giving them access to the elements they'll be working on. Groups enable you to control access from a single dashboard in Postman and manage it at scale across your Enterprise team.

[Admins and Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can create, manage, and delete groups. [Developers](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can also create, manage, and delete Developer-only groups.

## Creating a group

To create a group, select **Team** in the Postman header, then select **Manage Team**. Select **Groups** on the left, then **Create Group**.

<img alt="Create group" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/team-dashboard-manage-groups-v10.15.jpg" />

Give your group a name and description, and add your group members. If you're an Admin or Super Admin, you'll also have the option to select the team roles you'd like to assign to the group. If you're a Developer, you'll only have the option to create Developer-only groups.

<img alt="Create a group" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-a-group-v10.15.jpg" />

When you're ready, select **Create Group**.

Team members will receive an email and in-app notification when added to a group.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you add a user with a support-only role (Admin or Billing) to a group that gives them a Developer role, they will automatically take up an available paid seat on your Postman team. If no seats are available, you won't be able to grant access to the group with that user.
</Info>

## Managing a group

You can manage a group's members, roles, and access to Postman elements.

### Managing members of a group

[Admins and Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can add and remove members for all groups, but [Developers](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can only add and remove members if they're a [group manager](#managing-group-managers).

To manage the members of a group, select **Team** in the Postman header, then select **Manage Team**. Select **Groups** on the left. Locate the group you'd like to update and select it to edit.

# Manage roles in Postman

Each team member must have one or more team roles assigned to them, which will enable them to perform different actions within your team. Roles can be granted to team members individually, or to members of a [group](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).

You can change a team member's roles at any time in the [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members).

Search for a specific user by typing their name or email address in the search field. You can also filter users by role type. Select the roles next to the user you'd like to update, then select the roles you'd like to assign or remove. Click **Update Roles** to confirm your changes.

<img alt="Edit team roles" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/team-dashboard-manage-member-roles-v11-1.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Some team roles are only available with [Postman Professional and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

Teams can have two support accounts at no extra cost. Support accounts are team members with only Admin or Billing roles. Team members with a Super Admin or Developer role will consume a paid seat on your team.

To learn more about the team roles that you can assign as an Admin, see [Team roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).

## Manage workspace roles

[Workspace roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) control access to elements within a workspace. Roles can be assigned to an individual user or to a [user group](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).

To change the role of users in a workspace, or to remove a user from a workspace, do the following:

1. Click **Workspaces** in the Postman header, and then select a workspace.
2. On the workspace's **Overview** tab, click **Settings**.
3. Select a different workspace **Role** for a user or group:

   * **Admin** - Can manage workspace resources and settings.
   * **Editor** - Can create and edit workspace resources.
   * **Viewer** - Can view, fork, and export workspace resources.
   * **Remove from workspace** - Removes the user from the workspace. (You can [invite the user](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#share-workspaces) again in the future.)

## Manage element-based roles

Team members with Admin access for the workspace or Editor access for an element in it can manage element-based roles assigned to team members. Learn more about [roles you can assign at the element level](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles).

1. Hover over the element in the sidebar.
2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Share**.
3. (Optional) Search for team members and [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) in the workspace to add to the element.
4. Select the role next to the name. Click **Invite** if you're adding for the first time. Otherwise, update the role. You can also click **Remove** to remove a team member or user group from the element.

   <img alt="Manage Roles" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/manage-roles-collection-v11.33.jpg" />

Team members inherit permissions from the workspace role they're assigned. Team members can be individually assigned a workspace role, and the user group they're a member of can be assigned a workspace role. For example, a team member assigned the Workspace Editor role and Collection Viewer role will have Editor access to all collections in the workspace.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're managing roles for a collection, you can learn more about [setting merge checks](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/#assign-merge-checks).
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also use the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/overview/) to manage collection and environment roles assigned to team members.
</Info>

## Manage Super Admins

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Super Admins are available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

If your team doesn't have a [Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) yet, an Admin can assign the role to anyone in the team. Once your team has at least one Super Admin, only a Super Admin can assign this role to another user.

Super Admins can assign the Super Admin role to a user in the [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members), while [inviting a new team member](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/), and to a [group](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#managing-a-group). If your team is using [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), a Super Admin must create the [SCIM credentials](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-provisioning) in order for SCIM to change the membership of a group that's been assigned the Super Admin role.

Regular Admins can't remove Super Admins from a team or remove their Super Admin role assignment.

It's recommended that you create a service user, such as `postman-admin@example.com`, that isn't tied to any individual and assign that user the Super Admin role. By doing so, your team can avoid the risk of a disruption in services due to an actual user leaving your company. This ensures that your team's management is able to sign in to the service account when needed. Learn more about [assigning the Super Admin role to a service account](/docs/administration/enterprise/enterprise-onboarding/#the-super-admin-role).

## Manage Partners

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Partners are available with Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

You can manage external partners similarly to internal team members. Learn more about [managing a Partner Workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/manage/).

## Manage Guests

You can manage [Guests](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) in your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). To remove Guests, select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Remove guest** next to the user. To upgrade a Guest user to a Developer, select **Convert**. When a Guest becomes a Developer, they get access to all internal workspaces and can collaborate with other team members.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on an Enterprise team, only [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can assign a Guest user the Developer role.
</Info>

<img alt="Convert Guest role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-guests-v10.15.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your team must have [available seats](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) or [Auto-Flex enabled](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to change a user's role from the Guest role to the Developer role.
</Info>

To review the workspaces and collections a Guest has access to, open your [team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). Locate the Guest user and click **View resources**. You can select the workspace name or collection name to open it in a new tab, or click the user's name to go to their Postman profile.

<img alt="View resources a Guest can view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/view-resources-guests-v10.15.jpg" />

</Info>

You can assign roles and provide access to team resources at scale with Postman groups. To learn how to create and manage groups, see [Organize users into Postman groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).


# Manage your organization in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Organizations is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**.
</Info>

With Postman Organizations, you can set up a centralized or delegated control of teams. A user with the Organization Manager role manages the organization's team list and assigns the Team Manager role to users on different teams. Team Managers can take over team management and be responsible for creating workspaces for the team.

## Organization and team roles

*Organization Managers* are responsible for creating teams in the organization and can manage any team. They're also responsible for assigning individual Team Managers to the teams they create.

*Team Managers* can approve the adding of Members and the sharing of content from the teams they manage.

*Collaborators* can be brought into the team as secondary contributors or consumers. For example, Collaborators can be QA teams supporting the team's activities, consumers of the team's APIs, or an entire organization. On teams that don't require approval, Collaborators can be added automatically. On teams that require approval, an Admin must approve the addition of Collaborators to keep parts of the team private while others are shared. Learn more about [Organization roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#organization-roles).

## Manage teams in a Postman organization

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you've not set up an organization, see [Create an organization in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-org/).
</Info>

To manage organization teams, do the following:

1. From the [Home](https://go.postman.co/home) page, select [Teams](https://go.postman.co/teams).

2. Select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** on the team you wish to update. Then, select **Manage team**.

   <img alt="Manage Organization Teams" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/manage-org-v.11.48.png" />

From here you can perform the following actions:

* Add or remove members and update their roles.
* Move, delete, or copy a link to a workspace.
* Review pending requests to join.
* Review how team membership is controlled in the **Settings** tab.

  <img alt="Manage Organization team settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/org-workspace-settings-v.11.48.png" />

  You can restrict or automatically approve adding members and collaborators. When these options are enabled, requests to join the team or update a person's role appear in the **Pending requests** tab.

To learn how to manage user groups, see [Organize users into Postman groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).

As you set up and scale your organization, you can choose to manage your organization teams in a centralized or delegated way. To manage your publisher profile, discoverability, custom domains, authentication, and active invite links, see [Configure team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/).

### Centralized control of teams

With centralized team control, the Organization Manager is automatically assigned the Team Manager Role. As an Organization Manager, you can do the following:

* View and edit the organization settings.

* Assign the Team Manager role to a user on any team.

* Add a new member to the team with the Team Manager role.

### Delegated control of teams

With delegated team control, the Team Manager gets notified that they have access to a new team. As a Team Manager, you'll navigate to the team and configure it according to your specific requirements.


# Scale your Postman organization or team

You can change your team size to accommodate more collaborators at any time in your billing cycle. You can also remove members as needed. Learn more about the [workspace and data management dependencies](#remove-members) of member removal.

## Change organization or team size

To make changes to your organization or team size, you need to have the [Billing role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) or request help from a member with the Billing role.

To change your team size, you have two different options:

* **Change the number of paid seats** - Change your number of paid seats in the [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview).
* **Turn on Auto-Flex** - Enable [Auto-Flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) to let your organization or team invite more users without having to pay in advance for more seats.

For more information, see [Team and plan changes](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Remove members

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're on a Postman Enterprise plan, you can set up and use [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) to automate de-provisioning through your identity provider (IdP).
</Info>

To remove a member from your organization or team, go to your [dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). Click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Remove member** next to the member's name. Then to confirm, click **Remove Member**. When you remove a member, you'll still keep access to any data they shared.

<img alt="Remove a team member" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/team-dashboard-members-remove-v11.3.jpg" />

Reassign workspaces to another member to ensure the organization or team continues to have access to any unshared work done by the user being removed. You must reassign workspaces if one of the following is true:

* The user is on an Enterprise plan.
* The user is on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan, and they have an account.

<Note title="Note">
  An account isn't associated with an organization or team, and only the user can access it. To access an account, see [Switch between teams](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#switch-between-teams).
</Note>

When you remove a member, their workspaces and the data within them move to an account if the following is true: they're on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan, and they don't have an account.

For help with removing members and transferring data based on your configuration, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

<Tip title="Tip">
  When you remove a member, this doesn't automatically reduce the number of your paid seats unless the member was added by [Auto-Flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) during the current Auto-Flex cycle. If you want to reduce the number of paid seats, a member with the [Billing role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can [edit your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan).
</Tip>


# Manage team resources in Postman

Manage which team members can create team workspaces and share collections with guest users, export collections, manage mock server privacy settings, and decide which external packages are allowed in scripts.

## Manage team workspaces

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Team workspace management is available on [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

As a [Super Admin or Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can limit or prohibit creation of new team-visible [internal workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/overview/) by users on your teams.

You can specify which users and [groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) have permission to [create team-visible workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Unassigned team members can always create their own internal workspaces.
</Info>

If you specify users and groups, unassigned team members will have to request approval to create internal team workspaces. A Super Admin, Admin, or user with permission to create internal team workspaces can approve a request. The workspace type will be set to [**Internal**](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) and workspace access will be **Only you and invited people** until the request is approved.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends that you set up your users and groups through SSO and SCIM. For more information, see [SCIM provisioning overview](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).
</Info>

If you give all team members permission to create team workspaces, team members won't need approval to create them.

When you allow this, Collection Editors can choose whether Guests can view a specific collection and send requests in that collection. Guest users are assigned the [Guest role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) at the team level and a limited [Viewer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) at the collection level.

When you prohibit this, Collection Editors don't have the option to choose whether Guests can view a specific collection. Guest users already assigned the Guest role will continue to have access to collections previously shared with them. New Guests can no longer be assigned the Guest role.

### Block collection exports

Turn on this toggle to prevent Editors and Viewers from exporting collections. When a user with the Editor or Viewer role tries to export a collection, the **Export collection** dialog displays a message that says exporting has been turned off by their organization. Users can then use the **Export collection** dialog to invite other users to the workspace.

Anyone who requests to join the team will be prompted with the question. If you don't specify a question, team members can still add a note when they request to join the team.

All [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) will receive a notification when someone requests to join your team after verifying their email address. This includes their answer to any question you set, or an optional note.

### Enable automatic joining for team discovery

You can allow users with verified emails to automatically join your organization's team without requiring admin approval. Automatic joining reduces friction in collaboration and accelerates the time it takes for new members to begin working within teams.

<Note title="Note">
  Admins receive an email notification when users automatically join and can manage memberships by removing users if necessary.
</Note>

In **Organization settings** or **Team settings**, click **Organization access** or **Team access** on the left, then turn on **Allow people to automatically join this team**. Anyone from your domain can find and join your team.

As a result of this action, the **Make this organization (team) discoverable** setting will also be turned on.

## Manage your publisher profile

Your publisher profile gives you a way to publicly share important information about your organization or team with other Postman users. The publisher profile brings together all your organization or team's public resources in one place, and can serve as a developer portal for your API's consumers.

[Super Admins, Admins, and Community Managers](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can edit your publisher profile, customize your organization or team's branding, and manage the public visibility of your publisher profile.

Your publisher profile includes:

* A banner with your logo and a sentence describing the work you do.
* A [verified organization or team badge](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/) that, if approved, shows your organization or team is authentic.
* An **About us** section that contains a brief summary about your organization or team and the work you do.
* A **Get to know us** panel with links to your members' profiles.
* A **Social link** panel with links to your social media like your GitHub profile.
* An **Our content** section with your featured public workspaces.
* A **View Contents** link in each featured public workspace to your public collections, APIs, and flows.

### Edit your public profile

Click the name of your organization or team in the header, then click **Organization settings** or **Team settings**. Click **Edit Your Public Profile** to edit your organization or team's summary, description, social media links, and featured public workspaces.

* **About your team** - Click **Get started** to add a brief summary about your organization and the work you do. The editor supports Markdown, or you can use the built-in text formatting tools. To update your team description, hover over the section and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit team description**.

To edit these links, hover over the section and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit social links**.

* **Get to know us** - Hover over this section and click **Manage team** to manage your team members.

* **Edit featured content** - Manage your public Workspaces that appear as featured content. You can select up to three workspaces to display as featured content. The default is the top two workspaces by number of forks. If you have more public workspaces to add, they're available when a user clicks **View all**. The **View content** link under each public workspace displays the Collections, APIs, and Flows in that workspace.

### Customize your branding

You can add a logo, cover photo, and favicon to your team profile. These assets help you establish your team identity and ensure consistent branding.

To add these assets, click the name of your organization or team in the header and then click **Organization settings** or **Team settings**.

* To add a cover photo, hover over the section and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Upload cover photo**, then upload the image you want to use. To remove it, click **Delete cover photo**.
* To add a team logo, hover over the section and select <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Upload profile photo**, then upload the image you want to use. To remove it, click **Delete profile photo**.
* To add a favicon, click **Upload** under the **Favicon** section.

Keep the following in mind when you upload a logo, cover photo, or favicon:

* Logos and cover photos must be 500 KB or less in size and must be in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
* Logos must have a 1:1 aspect ratio (height:width), and cover photos must have a 1:7.5 aspect ratio. If your image has a different aspect ratio, Postman prompts you to select a part of your image to display.
* Favicons must be in ICO format, no larger than 32x32 pixels, and 500 KB or less in size. Your favicon appears on the browser tab of your team's published documentation site.

### Make your publisher profile public

A public publisher profile encourages other users to collaborate with you in a public workspace. You can ask for contributions, gather feedback, and increase your API's discovery in search results.

If you make your publisher profile public, your team is visible on [the Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/), along with your public workspaces, collections, APIs, and flows. Learn more about [the Postman API Network and best practices for sharing elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).

To make your [publisher profile](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) public, do the following:

1. In **Organization settings** or **Team settings**, click **Organization profile** or **Team profile**.
2. Select **Make my organization's (team's) profile public** to set the profile to public.

# Manage API keys

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Postman API key management is available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

The [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) enables you to integrate Postman into your development toolchain, but requires [API keys](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/) to do so. Admins can manage the Postman API keys your team creates at scale, ensuring you maintain compliance and security across your organization. Teams can control the creation of API keys, their expiration dates, and revoke keys when needed.

You must be an [Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to use the Postman API key management dashboard.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) API keys can be managed in [Team Settings](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/auth).
</Info>

## Managing Postman API keys

To open the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys), click **Team > Manage Postman Keys** in the Postman header.

<img alt="Manage Postman keys dashboard" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-postman-api-keys-dashboard-v10.19.jpg" />

The dashboard lists all of the Postman API keys created by your team. To filter the list by enabled, disabled, or revoked keys, select or clear the checkboxes next to **View**.

You can review the key's creator, date of creation, expiration date, and when it was last used. You can also search by key value to locate a specific key, filter by user by selecting them in the **Created by** dropdown list, and sort by newest, oldest, and recently used.

Tags next to the API key's name specify when it's disabled or revoked. You can hover over a revoked tag to see if an Admin revoked it, if it was due to inactivity past its expiration date, or automatically revoked. Revoked API keys also display their revocation date under its creation date.

## Exposed API keys

If the [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/) detects exposed Postman API keys in public Postman workspaces, public Postman documentation, or [GitHub](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#protect-postman-api-keys-in-github) and [GitLab](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#protect-postman-api-keys-in-gitlab) repositories, they appear in the **Exposed API keys** section. This section provides details about the exposed key, such as the exposure detection date, the last time used, and location.

<img alt="Exposed keys section" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-postman-exposed-api-keys-v10.19.jpg" />

You can manage how Postman automatically handles exposed API keys in the [API key settings](#revoking) section of the Postman API key management dashboard.

## Revoking API keys

You can revoke an API key in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys) by hovering over it and clicking **Revoke**. To revoke multiple API keys at once, select the checkboxes next to each key, then click **Revoke** above the list.

<img alt="Revoke multiple keys" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-postman-api-keys-revoke-v10.19.jpg" />

Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked. For exposed keys, revoking also resolves the Secret Scanner finding in the [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/).

## API key settings

You can manage your team's API key settings and permissions by clicking **API Key Settings** in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys).

<img alt="API keys settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-api-keys-settings-v10.18.jpg" />

### Key generation and expiration

By default, anyone in your team can generate Postman API keys. You can turn off the **Allow anyone in your team to generate API keys** setting to prevent users from creating new Postman API keys.

You can specify the expiration settings for all API keys that your team creates with the **Set expiry for API keys** setting. This overrides any expirations already set by users. It also applies to any Postman API keys your team creates in the future.

### Revoking

The **Auto revoke exposed Postman API keys** setting enables Postman to automatically revoke any publicly exposed API keys found in publicly available Postman resources, [GitHub repositories](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#protect-postman-api-keys-in-github), and [GitLab repositories](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#protect-postman-api-keys-in-gitlab). When the Postman Secret Scanner detects exposed keys in public GitHub or GitLab repositories or public Postman resources, it revokes the key and notifies the key's owner by email.

If there are any exposed API keys present when you enable this setting, a warning appears.

<img alt="Enable auto revoke setting" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/manage-postman-api-keys-settings-auto-revoke-confirm-v10.18.jpg" />

You can choose to revoke or ignore the exposed keys when you enable this setting. Any publicly exposed keys detected by the Secret Scanner after you enable this setting will be automatically revoked.

If you need to revoke all of the Postman API keys generated by your team, click **Revoke All**. Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked.


# Postman Secret Scanner

The Postman Secret Scanner scans public workspaces and published documentation to detect exposed secrets on all Postman plans. It monitors the collections, global variables, environment variables, API specifications, and documentation in public workspaces. Secret Scanner helps safeguard your organization from potential threats and malicious users attempting to access any exposed secrets. It also scans the documentation your team has [published](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/), regardless of the type of workspace it's found in.

You can also set up Postman's [integration for Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) to alert you in Slack if the Secret Scanner detects exposed secrets in your workspaces.

## Benefits of Postman Secret Scanner

Secret Scanner helps protect your team's sensitive information from accidental exposure, no matter which Postman plan you're on. By scanning your team's resources, it ensures that your data stays secure.

For Enterprise plans with the [Advanced Security Administration add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#advanced-security-administration-add-on), Secret Scanner also delivers results for public workspace, internal workspace, and Partner Workspace scans in [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/). It also includes access to reporting and analytics on exposed secrets in Team and Public workspaces.

To learn more, see [How the Postman Secret Scanner works](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/).

## Manage your secrets with the Secret Scanner dashboard

The Secret Scanner dashboard enables Admins and Super Admins review and manage your team's detected secrets and view reports. It also lets your team customize and manage secret patterns that best fit your team's specific needs.

To learn more, see [The Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/). For information about Secret Scanner patterns, see [Secret Scanner patterns](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-patterns/).

## Manage Secret Scanner findings with the Postman API

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Secret Scanner Postman API endpoints are available with the Postman Enterprise plan with the [Advanced Security Administration add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#advanced-security-administration).
</Info>

Admins, Super Admins, and Workspace Admins can access Secret Scanner findings through the Postman API. Using the Postman API enables you to create custom automated workflows to retrieve and resolve identified secrets. To learn more, see the [Postman API documentation](https://go.pstmn.io/live-docs-api).


# How the Secret Scanner works

The Secret Scanner [scans public workspaces](#automatically-replace-secrets-detected-in-public-workspaces) and published documentation to detect exposed secrets on all Postman plans. Secret Scanner is turned on by default for public workspaces with all Postman plans and scans for:

* Exposed [supported secrets](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-patterns/) in all HTTP and [multi-protocol collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections), including their requests and responses.
* The [shared values](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values) of [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) variables and global variables.
* API specifications in the [Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/).
* Documentation [published](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/), regardless of the [type of workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) it's found in.

[Postman automatically replaces exposed secrets with placeholders](#automatically-replace-secrets-detected-in-public-workspaces) if the Secret Scanner detects exposed supported secrets in your public workspaces. [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and [Workspace Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles) are notified by email, [Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) (if configured), and in-app notification if exposed secrets are automatically replaced.

Postman recommends using a [vault secret as a placeholder](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#set-a-value-for-a-vault-secret-that-doesnt-exist) for a real secret because each user can only access and use their own vault secrets. Vault secrets aren't synced to the Postman cloud. You can also use a [variable as a placeholder](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#setting-values-for-variables-without-a-scope) if you'd like.

With Postman's [Enterprise plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you gain access to the [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/), where you can view scan results. With the [Advanced Security Administration add-on](#advanced-security-administration-add-on), you get access to scan all workspace types, in addition to greater support for secrets in your Postman elements.

## Automatically replace secrets detected in public workspaces

If the Secret Scanner detects exposed supported secrets in your public workspaces, Postman automatically replaces each secret with a placeholder. Postman notifies Admins and Workspace Admins by email and in-app notification that the secrets were detected and replaced with placeholders.

Exposed secrets are automatically replaced with placeholders as follows:

* For HTTP collections and requests, secrets are replaced with a [reference to a vault secret](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets/#use-vault-secrets) based on the detected key or token in lowercase, such as `{{vault:authorization-secret}}`.
* For all other [Postman elements](/docs/getting-started/basics/postman-elements/), secrets are replaced with the detected key or token in uppercase with angle brackets around the text, such as `<AUTHORIZATION_SECRET>`.

Secrets exposed in [multi-protocol collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections) aren't automatically replaced with placeholders. Secrets detected in multi-protocol collections must be removed or manually replaced with placeholders. Note that vault secrets aren't supported in multi-protocol collections.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  It's important that you also [revoke exposed secrets](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard#resolve-detected-secrets) the Secret Scanner detects.
</Info>

## Advanced Security Administration add-on

For [Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Admin add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), Secret Scanner scans all public workspaces, internal workspaces, and Partner Workspaces and delivers its results to the [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/). It also scans for exposed secrets in all HTTP and multi-protocol collections. It also scans API specifications in the [Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/).

For Partner Workspaces, the Secret Scanner also scans the [shared values](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#share-variable-values) of [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) and global variables.

## Protect Postman API keys in GitHub

Postman also works with GitHub to ensure that your Postman API keys are secure for free and paid Postman plans. If you commit a valid Postman API key to a public GitHub repository, Postman notifies you by email and in-app notification. You can also set up Postman's [integration for Slack](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) to alert you in Slack if this occurs.

It's recommended you delete the exposed API key in your [API keys dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys). You can then [generate a new API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) to continue working with the Postman API.

## Protect Postman API keys in GitLab

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This feature is available with GitLab Ultimate plans.
</Info>

Postman works with GitLab to protect your Postman API keys in GitLab public repositories for free and paid Postman plans. If you commit a valid Postman API key to a public GitLab repository, Postman notifies you by email and in-app notification.

It's recommended you delete the exposed API key in your [API keys dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys). You can then [generate a new API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) to continue working with the Postman API.


# The Secret Scanner dashboard

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The Secret Scanner dashboard is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

With the Secret Scanner dashboard, [Admins and Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can view secrets the Secret Scanner detects in your team's public workspaces. You can [resolve detected secrets](#resolve-detected-secrets) to let your team know if the secret is revoked, a false positive, or not relevant. You can also [change the status of a resolved secret](#change-the-status-of-resolved-detected-secrets). Admins can [subscribe to summary emails](#secret-scanner-summary-emails) to stay informed on detected secrets.

For Enterprise plans with the [Advanced Security Administration add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#advanced-security-administration-add-on), Secret Scanner also scans internal workspaces and Partner Workspaces and delivers results in the dashboard.

From there, you can select the box for either daily, weekly, monthly, or all summaries, and save your preferences.


# Secret Scanner patterns

Patterns help protect sensitive data and improve your team's security posture. By default, the Secret Scanner searches using a variety of [default secret patterns](#default-patterns). You can also add your team's proprietary third-party app tokens that aren't supported yet using [custom patterns](#custom-patterns) in the [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/).

![The Secret Scanner Patterns interface](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/secret-scanner-pattern-config-v11-2.jpg)

## Default patterns

The Secret Scanner checks for tokens issued by common service providers, including Amazon, Google, GitHub, Stripe, and Twilio for all Postman plans. To view the complete list of default patterns, open [Secret Scanner](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/secret-scanner/alerts) and click **Patterns**.

## Custom patterns

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Secret Scanner custom patterns are available with the Postman [Enterprise plan with the Advanced Security Admin add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#advanced-security-administration).
</Info>

You can use custom patterns to scan your team's proprietary tokens and any third-party app tokens that aren't scanned by default. You can also [dry run custom patterns](#dry-run-custom-patterns) before adding them to the Secret Scanner, enabling you to test the results that the custom pattern returns.

Your team can add a total of five patterns. You must be a Community Manager or team member with both the Developer and Admin roles to add custom patterns.

### Create a custom pattern

To add custom patterns, do the following:

1. Select **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header. Click **Secret Scanner** in the left sidebar, then click the **Patterns** tab.

2. In the **Custom patterns** section, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add**.

3. In the **Pattern details** section, enter the following details for the custom token:

   * **Name** - The name of your custom pattern.
   * **Regex** - The regular expression (regex) that defines the secret's pattern.
   * **Sample value** - A sample value used to validate the pattern.

4. In the **Scan activation** section, select one of the following:

* **Add pattern to secret scanner** - Add the discovered secrets to the **Secrets detected** tab in the [Secret Scanner dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-dashboard/). By default, the **Scan existing elements** checkbox is selected, meaning the Secret Scanner uses the custom pattern to scan existing elements. To only scan elements added after you create the pattern, clear the **Scan existing elements** checkbox.

- **Dry run the pattern first with select workspaces** - Dry run the custom pattern before adding it to the Secret Scanner. You can select up to 20 public workspaces, internal workspaces, or Partner Workspaces for the dry run. The results of the dry run won't be added to the **Secrets detected** tab in the dashboard. Learn more about [creating a custom pattern dry run](#dry-run-custom-patterns).

1. Click **Add Custom Pattern** or **Dry Run Pattern**, depending on the option you selected in the **Scan activation** section.

   ![Create custom pattern](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-custom-pattern-v10-21.jpg)

### Edit a custom pattern

To edit a custom pattern, click the pattern's name, or click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit** next to a custom pattern.

* **Remove Existing Leaks** - Remove detected secrets from the **Secrets detected** tab that are associated with earlier iterations of this custom pattern.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When you edit a regular expression in a custom pattern, the updated regular expression is used to scan new elements only. To scan existing elements with the changes to the pattern, create a new custom pattern and make sure the **Scan existing elements** checkbox is selected.
</Info>

To delete a custom pattern, click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete** next to a custom pattern. Then click **Delete** to confirm. When you delete a custom pattern, all detected secrets associated with this pattern are removed from the **Secrets detected** tab in the dashboard.

### Dry run custom patterns

When you create a custom pattern, you can choose to dry run the regular expression pattern before adding it to the Secret Scanner. This enables you to test the results that the regular expression pattern returns.

You can dry run the pattern on up to 20 public workspaces, internal workspaces, or Partner Workspaces. If the dry run works as expected, you can add the custom pattern to the Secret Scanner, enabling your team to review the results in your dashboard.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The results of the dry run won't be added to the **Secrets detected** tab in the dashboard. You must manually add the custom pattern to the Secret Scanner.
</Info>

To dry run a custom pattern, do the following:

1. [Add a custom pattern](#custom-patterns), and select **Dry run the pattern first with select workspaces** in the **Scan activation** section.
2. Select up to 20 workspaces to scan.
3. Click **Dry Run Pattern**.

# Audit logs

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Audit logs are available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Audit logs display events related to your team, team members, and billing. [Admins and Super Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can view which team member performed an action, and when they did so. Events include team members signing in to your team, creating a Postman API key, adding a team member, upgrading to a paid plan, and more.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman offers audit logs for 180 days.
</Info>

## View audit logs in the dashboard

Admins and Super Admins can view audit logs for your team in your [Audit Logs dashboard](https://go.postman.co/audit). To view audit logs, open Postman and select **Team > Audit Logs** in the Postman header.

Each audit log event includes the following information:

* The team member who performed the action, and their email address.
* The event type, and a description of the event.
* The team member's IP address.
* The date and time of the action, including the team member's time zone.

![Audit logs dashboard](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/audit-logs-dashboard-v9.jpg)

You can use filters to view audit log events by date range, event type, and team member. Select your filters, then click **Apply**.

## Export audit logs from the dashboard

You can filter the results of the audit logs, and export the results as a CSV file.

To export audit logs, do the following:

1. Filter your results by selecting a date range, event type, and team member, then click **Apply**. If you don't filter your results, Postman exports all data in your audit logs from the last seven days.
2. Click **Export Audit Logs**
3. Click **Export** to confirm. You'll receive an email with the CSV file.
4. In the email, click **Download Audit Logs** to download the CSV file. The link in the email is valid for one hour.

## Access audit logs with the Postman API

You can also [access audit logs with the Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/tl4rymv/audit-logs), enabling you to integrate Postman's audit logs with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

To get started with the Postman API, you must first [generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key). Learn more about the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/), and how to integrate it into your development toolchain.

Each audit log event has the following attributes in the response:

| <div>Name</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Postman provides several billing features that enable you to manage your team's payment methods, change your team's plan, and track your team's resource usage. With these billing features, you can ensure your team has access to the Postman features they need to be successful.

For help with any account or billing issues, [submit a request](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Postman's [Support Center team](https://www.postman.com/support/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Check out [Postman's Help Center](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) for [Postman billing and payment FAQs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000609205-Billing-and-Payment).
</Info>

## Manage your account, payment methods, and plan

To get started, you can learn how to [purchase and configure a paid Postman plan](/docs/billing/buying/).

You can use the Postman billing dashboard to [view and manage your team's billing](/docs/billing/billing/#billing-dashboard). This includes an overview of your Postman plan, past invoices, and billing-related activity. You can [manage your team's payment methods](/docs/billing/billing/#payments). You can also [make changes to your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes), such as adjust your team size, purchase add-ons, and upgrade your plan.

## Track your resource usage

The number of resources you can use each month depends on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). You can use the [**Resource usage** dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview) to [view the resources your team is using](/docs/billing/resource-usage/) and view your team's remaining limits for the month.


# Manage billing

Postman provides a self-serve billing process. Refer to the following sections for guidance on managing your account, plan, and payment.

For help with any account or billing issues, go to the Postman [support center](https://www.postman.com/support/) and select **Submit a request**. You can also browse the [Postman billing and payment FAQs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000609205-Billing-and-Payment) there.

## Billing dashboard

The Postman [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) enables you to manage your team's billing.

### Viewing billing overview

The billing overview is your billing dashboard's default view. You can view the details of your Postman plan, including your subscription cycle and a calculation of your expected cost upon renewal.

<img alt="Billing overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-plan-and-payments-dash-v9.14.jpg" />

### Managing resources

Open the [**Resource usage** dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview) to see your team's usage of resources such as mock servers and monitors, APIs created, collection runner runs, image and file storage, and other items. To open the **Resource usage** dashboard, do one of the following:

* **Free users** - In the Postman header, select the dropdown list next to **Upgrade** then select **Resource Usage**.
* **Paid users** - In the Postman header, select **Team > Resource Usage**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about the resources included with your Postman plan and what happens when you reach your usage limits, go to [About resource usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/).
</Info>

<img alt="Add-ons usage and purchase" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/resource-usage-9.13.jpg" />

Select **View detailed usage** next to **Monitoring Usage** to view your team's active monitors and their impact on your team's usage during the current billing period.

You can opt to activate or deactivate overages for mock server, Postman Monitor, and Postman Flows usage by activating **Pay-as-you-go** for each item. If activated, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Users with the [Billing role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/) can also [purchase add-ons](#purchasing-add-on-resources) in the **Resource usage** dashboard.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your API development pipeline is dependent on Postman Monitor, deactivating overages may cause unintended consequences for your bill. To avoid fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, consider adding [pre-paid Postman Monitor blocks](#purchasing-add-on-resources) to your team plan.
</Info>

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments**, then **History**.

<img alt="Account history view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-history-v9.1.jpg" />

Items such as updates to your Postman subscription, payment method changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order.

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments**, then **Invoices**. You can get a copy of your past invoices by selecting the download icon <img alt="Download icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-download-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> for the specific invoice you want to retrieve.

<img alt="Invoices view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-invoices-v9.1.jpg" />

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

## Payments

Postman offers various payment options dependent on your plan type.

### Managing payment methods

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments**, then **Payment methods**.

To add a new payment method, select **Add Payment Method**. Select the payment method you would like to use. Depending on your location, you can pay using credit card, [direct debit](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments), or other payment methods.

To remove a payment method, hover over the payment method in question and select **Delete Payment Method**.

To set a payment method as your primary, hover over it and select **Set as Primary**.

<img alt="Payment methods view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/payment-methods-page.jpg" />

#### Setting up direct debit payments

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The option to pay with direct debit is only available for customers in the United States.
</Info>

Postman accepts direct debit payments, in which payment funds are taken directly from a linked bank account using ACH.

To use direct debit as your payment method, do the following:

1. Select **Add payment method**, then select **ACH Direct Debit**.

2. Enter your email, your name, and either enter or search for your bank name.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     This process will verify your bank account immediately. If you want to use a manual verification process instead, see [Verifying your bank account manually](#verifying-your-bank-account-manually).
   </Info>

3. To accept the Terms and Privacy Policy,  select **Agree**. You can select **Learn more** to view the whole policy.

4. Stripe, the payment service Postman uses, will open a new window where you can sign in to your bank account. Select **Continue**.

5. Select the account you want to use, then select **Link account**. After Stripe verifies the account, select **Done**. Stripe will return you to the Postman billing dashboard.

6. Select **Add account**.

After account verification, Postman will send you a confirmation email. It can take up to four days to withdraw funds from your bank account using direct debit.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  * **Direct debit payment failures** - In the event of a direct debit payment failure, Postman will email you with information about how to fix the issue. The billing dashboard will also contain this information.
  * **Direct debit disputes** - If you believe there has been an error with your direct debit payment, contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) to resolve the issue. If you dispute the payment through your bank, Stripe removes your bank account's verified status and you won't be able to use the account for Postman payments until you [verify it](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments) again.
</Info>

#### Verifying your bank account manually

You can choose to verify your bank account manually instead of using the automatic process documented in [Setting up direct debit payments](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments). This manual process may take up to two days.

To verify your bank account manually, do the following:

1. Select **Add payment method**, then select **ACH Direct Debit**.
2. Enter your email and your name, then select **Enter bank details manually instead**.
3. Enter your routing number and bank account number. Confirm your account number, then select **Continue**.

In one to two business days, Stripe will make a small test deposit into your bank account that you will use to verify your bank account and will email you with further instructions.

To verify your bank account using the test deposit, do the following:

1. After the test deposit arrives in your bank account, go back to the Postman billing dashboard. Select **Plans and payments > Payment methods**.
2. Hover over the bank account and select **Verify**.
3. Under **Enter code**, paste the six digit transaction code from the test deposit. Select **Verify**.
4. Select **Confirm** to accept the Terms and Privacy Policy.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you don't verify your account within ten days, Postman will delete your bank account information. If you want to add a direct debit payment method later, you will need to re-enter your bank account information.
</Info>

After your bank account is verified, Postman will send you a confirmation email. It can take up to four days to withdraw funds from your bank account using direct debit.

### Using the Pay Now option

In some circumstances, including an overdue or [failed payment](#failed-payments), you may receive an invoice for your Postman payment. From the invoice, select **Pay Now** to pay immediately using your primary [payment method](#managing-payment-methods), or Apple Pay or Google Pay if supported.

### Paying by invoice

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Invoicing is available for Postman [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) only. If you are a new Enterprise customer, contact the [Postman Sales team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/get-started-postman-plans/) to get started. You will receive a response within three business days. If you are an existing Enterprise customer, submit a request to the [Postman Support team](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) to be invoiced instead of automatically charged.
</Info>

You can pay invoices online, with ACH, or with wire transfer. Postman sends invoices to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details). The invoice includes offline payment instructions. View your pending payments in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

### Adding custom information to invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments**, then **Invoices**. Select **Edit billing information**.

Add or update your company name, billing email, address, and your VAT ID if applicable, then select **Save**. All future [invoices](https://go.postman.co/billing/invoices) will have the updated copy. To change an existing invoice, submit a request to [Postman support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).

<img alt="Edit billing details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-billing-details-v9.jpg" />

### Failed payments

If you have a payment method on file, Postman will automatically try three times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, team members with the [Billing team role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) receive an email notification. Use the link in the email to access and pay for your [invoice](#using-the-pay-now-option).

If payment is unsuccessful, Postman offers a grace period of 21 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 21 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

In the event of non-payment and service deactivation, Postman sends an email notification to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details).

## Team and plan changes

You can change your team's plan and billing cycle in your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview).

### Changing your plan

To change your plan, billing frequency, team size, and add-ons, open your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and select **Edit plan**.

1. You can adjust your billing frequency and plan type.
2. Select **Next** to adjust your team size and add-on seats such as Postman Flows, Postbot, and Enterprise add-ons. You can opt to apply changes right away or on renewal.
3. Select **Next** to adjust your team's add-on resources, including Postman Monitor blocks, mock server blocks, and custom domains.
4. Select **Next** then **Confirm Changes**.

Certain changes, such as switching from an annual plan to a monthly plan or plan downgrade, can only be applied to your team upon renewal. If you make adjustments to your plan that can't be applied right away, and have **Immediately** selected, you will be prompted to switch your selection to **On renewal**.

The cost of your new plan and any new seats, if applicable, are prorated based on the time left in your team's billing cycle.

### Purchasing add-on resources

The base number of Postman Monitor requests, mock server calls, Postman Flows credits, and custom domains included with your plan depends on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). You can activate or deactivate overages for Postman Monitor, mock server calls, and Postman Flows by [managing your team's resources](#managing-resources). If activated, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Pay-as-you-go for Postman Flows isn't available with the Enterprise plan. If you're an Enterprise customer, please contact the Postman sales team when approaching your Flows credit limit.
</Info>

To purchase more blocks of Postman Monitor requests, mock server calls, and custom domains, navigate to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) and select **Resource usage**,  then **Purchase Add-ons**.

Update the number of Flows seats, Postman Monitor blocks, mock server blocks, and custom domains you would like to have included with your team plan. Select **Next** to confirm your changes.

### Purchasing add-on products

Several add-ons can be purchased to add features to your teams:

* All teams can purchase Postbot as an add-on. To learn more about Postman's AI assistant, see [About Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/).

* All teams and free users can purchase the [Collection Runner add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/#collection-runner-add-on).

* Professional and Enterprise teams can purchase the [Partner Editor add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/#partner-editor-add-on).

* Enterprise teams can purchase the [API Builder add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/#api-builder-add-on) and [Advanced Security Admin add-on](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/#advanced-security-admin-add-on). (To purchase the Advanced Security Admin add-on, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/).)

To purchase add-on licenses:

1. Navigate to your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and select **Edit plan**.

2. Select **Modify Plan** under the plan type for your team. You can also select **Add to Plan** next to the add-on you want to purchase more licenses for. Update the number of licenses in the **add-ons** section, then select **Next**. Select **Confirm Changes** to purchase more licenses.

You can manage which team members consume add-on seats from the [product access dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/products-access). Learn how to [manage your team's access to add-ons](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/#manage-access-to-add-ons).

If you are on a Free plan, you can purchase Postbot seats by selecting **Upgrade** in the Postman header and navigating to the bundle section to add Postbot. Update the number of Postbot seats and select from Annual or Monthly payment options, then select **Next**. Enter your billing information and payment method, then select **Confirm**.

To learn more about the added capabilities of each add-on, see [add-ons](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#add-ons).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Auto-Flex](#using-auto-flex) enables your team to add more Team members without having to pay upfront. Newly added members to the Team and the add-ons will be billed in the next Auto-Flex cycle.
</Info>

### Using Auto-Flex

[Auto-Flex](https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/) is a flexible billing feature available to Postman teams. Auto-Flex applies to both plan seats and any add-on seats such as Postman Flows, Postbot, Partner Editor, and other add-ons. With Auto-Flex activated, your team can [invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) users or provision add-on capabilities to your team members without having to pay in advance for more seats, then opt to retain or remove them before being [billed](#billing-for-auto-flex).

All [Postman Basic, Professional, and Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) have Auto-Flex activated automatically.

#### Billing for Auto-Flex

Your Auto-Flex billing cycle is dependent on your team's plan:

* Monthly plans are charged for newly added users on a monthly basis.

* Annual plans are charged for newly added users on a quarterly basis.

At any time during your Auto-Flex billing cycle, your team can [invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) users regardless of available seats.

Before your Auto-Flex billing cycle renews, all Billing and Admin team members receive a notification about any new users you added during that time period.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Shortly before the applicable billing date, users with Billing or Admin roles will receive a notification that reflects the number of added users during that monthly or quarterly cycle.
</Info>

You can use this reminder to make any necessary changes to your team before the end of your current Auto-Flex cycle, when you will be billed for any newly added users.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you have already been billed for the users you added and retained in an earlier Auto-Flex cycle, you can't remove those seats until your plan renews.
</Info>

You won't be billed if the number of users remains unchanged during your Auto-Flex cycle, or if you remove any added users prior to Auto-Flex billing.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your team incurs any overages and you have an Auto-Flex bill for that cycle, your invoice will combine your overage charges with your Auto-Flex charges.
</Info>

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), you can view:

* Your current number of additional team members and additional add-on seats
* How much you will be billed at the end of your cycle (unless you add or remove users in the interim)
* Additional information about your Auto-Flex and regular billing cycles

For customers on Postman plans who are paying by invoice, your account manager will share an invoice once per Auto-Flex cycle (quarterly) to settle any outstanding balances.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) with any questions about Auto-Flex.
</Info>

## Canceling your plan

To cancel your Postman plan, select **Cancel plan** at the bottom of your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

If you have canceled your Postman plan and want to reverse this action, select **Undo cancellation** next to the cancellation notice in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

If you are on a Free plan with Postbot subscription and want to cancel your Postbot subscription, select **Remove add-on** at the bottom of [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

## Next steps

After learning how to navigate the billing dashboard, you can learn more about the Billing role and managing your team.

* To learn more about the Billing team role, visit [Roles and permissions](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/).
* For information on team management, visit the [Team management overview](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/overview/).


# Purchase Postman

Visit the [pricing page](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) to purchase a Postman Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan. Select **Buy Now** for your chosen plan. If you're [upgrading from an existing paid account](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes), you can use the links in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

## Configure your plan

During the buying process you'll be prompted to supply the following details:

* Your billing cycle (monthly or annual).
* How many paid user seats you need (you'll need a paid seat for anyone who needs to access the relevant Postman features, but each team has two free seats you can use for account management or billing).
* Your account email and [role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) (Admin if you're going to use the paid Postman plan yourself, or Billing if you're only making the purchase).
  * If you choose the Billing role you can enter an admin email address. This address is where you'll receive your account activation email so that the administrator can set up your Postman plan.

Once your plan configuration is set you can enter your payment details. **Your saved payment method is automatically charged monthly or annually, depending on your billing cycle. Additional account charges, such as monitoring overages, are also charged to your saved payment method.**

* For security reasons, Postman doesn't store any payment method data. The data is stored only by payment provider Stripe, who are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1.
* Review the details of your plan to ensure they're correct before you submit your payment details.
* After payment, you'll receive a confirmation with the transaction ID. Use this ID for any communication with Postman.
* The assigned Admin will receive an activation link where you can begin inviting users. Billing-only users will receive a link to join the team in the Billing role.

## Next steps

After you've selected and purchased a paid plan, you can manage your billing, customize your team's experience, and collaborate with your team:

* You can manage your account in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing). For example, you could [change or upgrade](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes) your plan.
* To learn how to customize your team's Postman experience, visit the [Team management overview](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/overview/).
* To learn more about collaborating with your team, visit [Collaborate in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/).


# About resource usage

Postman provides you with a specified number of resources you can use each month, depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). Monthly resources include calls to the Postman API, requests made by monitors and scheduled collection runs, mock server requests, and Cloud Agent requests. Your Postman plan also has other limits, such as the number of integrations you can create, the number of custom domains, and storage for uploaded images.

To find out what the resource limits are for your plan, go to the [Postman Plans and Pricing page](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To view the resources you are using, go to your [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview). You can view how close you are to your limits and when your monthly limits will reset. If you need more resources, you can [purchase add-on resources](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources) or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

Refer to the following sections to understand what happens when your resource usage reaches the limits set by your Postman plan.

## Team usage limits

Your team's usage limits are based on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) and any [add-ons](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources) your team has purchased.

Open the [**Resource usage** dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview) to view your team's usage of mock servers and monitors, APIs created, collection runner runs, image and file storage, flows created by your team, performance tests, integrations, and the Postman Cloud Agent. To open the **Resource usage** dashboard, do one of the following:

* **Free users** - In the Postman header, select <img alt="Down Large icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down-large.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to **Upgrade**.
* **Paid users** - In the Postman header, select **Team**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn more about the resources included with your Postman plan and what happens when you reach your usage limits, go to [About resource usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/).
</Info>

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/team-dropdown-resource-usage-v10-22.jpg" alt="Team resource usage information" width="280px" />

Team members with the [Billing role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can [purchase extra blocks](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources) of monitoring requests, mock server calls, and custom domains in the [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

## Mock server usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of requests that can be sent to your [Postman mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) each month. Requests to all of your mock servers count toward this same limit. After the limit is reached, you will get a `Usage limit reached` error message in the response body when sending a request to one of your mock servers.

To make more requests to your mock servers before your monthly limit resets, you can [enable pay-as-you-go](/docs/billing/billing/#managing-resources), [purchase add-on resources](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources), or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Monitoring usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of requests that can be run by your [Postman Monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/) each month. Requests run by your [scheduled collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) and [Private API Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/runners/overview/) count toward this same limit. After the limit is reached, you will get a notification by email and in the Postman app letting you know that you've reached the usage limit for monitors.

Once you've reached your usage limit, your monitors and scheduled collection runs will no longer run on their configured schedules and can't be run manually. To resume running your monitors and scheduled collection runs before your monthly limit resets, you can [enable pay-as-you-go](/docs/billing/billing/#managing-resources), [purchase add-on resources](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources), or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [viewing and managing your monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).
</Info>

## Custom domains

Postman paid [plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) give you a limited number of [custom domains](/docs/publishing-your-api/custom-doc-domains/) you can use when publishing API documentation. After the limit is reached, you won't be able to add a new custom domain.

To add a new custom domain, delete one of your existing custom domains, [purchase add-on resources](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-resources), or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## API Builder resources

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of APIs you can create in the [API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/). After the limit is reached, you won't be able to create new APIs in API Builder. To create a new API, delete one of your existing API Builder APIs, or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Manual Collection Runner runs

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of [collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) you can use each month. This limit applies to collections that you run in a workspace using the **Run manually** option. This is separate from the limits for [scheduled collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) in the Postman cloud. A collection run with multiple iterations counts as a single run.

You can check your manual collection run usage in the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview). Also, a message will display in the Collection Runner when you're approaching your usage limit.

Once you've reached your usage limit, you will no longer be able to run your collections using the **Run manually** option. To resume running collections before your monthly limit resets, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes), [schedule collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) in the Postman cloud, or run collections using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-collection/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Requests run in the Postman cloud by your [scheduled collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) count toward your [monitoring usage](#monitoring-usage). Scheduled collection runs don't count toward your manual collection runs usage.
</Info>

## Storage usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited amount of storage for [uploaded images](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#upload-an-image) in your API documentation. You will get an error message if you try to upload an image that would exceed your storage limit.

To upgrade your available storage, contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about [image storage limits](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#image-storage-limits) for API documentation.
</Info>

## Flows usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of credits that can be consumed by AI blocks like the [**Create with AI** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/) in [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/). Credits are shared across all users on a team. To get more credits, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes). Learn about [flows usage](/docs/billing/flows-usage/).

## Performance test limit

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of [performance test runs](/docs/collections/performance-testing/testing-api-performance/) you can use each month. This limit applies to collections that you run using the **Performance** tab in the Collection Runner. This is separate from the limits for functional tests ([manual collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) and [scheduled collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/)).

You can check your performance test usage in the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview). Also, a message will display in the Collection Runner when you're approaching your usage limit.

Once you've reached your usage limit, you will no longer be able to run performance tests. To resume running performance tests before your monthly limit resets, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Specifications

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives your team a limited number of [specifications](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) to create in Spec Hub in internal workspaces. In the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview), you can see how many specification have been created in internal workspaces. To create more specifications in internal workspaces, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Packages

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives your team a limited number of [packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/) to create in the Postman Package Library. In the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview), you can see how many packages have been created. To create more, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

As an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can select **View detailed usage** to view a detailed list of packages in your team. For each package, you can view the package name, who created the package, and when the package was created. You can also view when the package was last used. The last used date increases when one of the following occurs:

* A teammate views the package in the package library.
* A teammate sends an HTTP request that imports the package, and this is the first time they send the request after opening Postman.

To work with packages in your team, do any of the following:

* To filter the list by package name, start typing in the search box.
* To filter the list by the user who created the package, select a team member in the **Uploaded by** dropdown list.
* To delete a package, hover over a package and select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> > <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete**.

## Test data usage

Test data is made up of the data files you use to test various scenarios for your API. Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited amount of storage space you can use for uploaded test data files with requests and manual collection runs. Your plan also gives you a limited number of retrievals of uploaded files each month.

You can check your test data usage in the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview). View the amount of test data storage your team is using and the number of times test data has been retrieved from Postman.

To view your team's uploaded test data files, select **View detailed usage**. For each uploaded file, you can view the file name, who uploaded the file and when, and the file size. You can also view when the file was last retrieved, the number of times it's been retrieved, and the workspace it belongs to. You must be an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to view detailed test data usage or delete test data files.

You can view the following types of test data files:

* [Data files uploaded with requests](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/) are available at the team level. These files can be used with requests in any of your workspaces. Test data is retrieved each time a request that uses an uploaded file is sent manually or automatically from a [scheduled collection run](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/), [monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/), [flow](/docs/postman-flows/overview/), or the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/). Multiple instances of the same file in a collection run or monitor run count as a single retrieval.
* [Data files uploaded with manual collections runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) are available at the workspace level. These files can only be used in the workspace they were uploaded to. Test data is also retrieved each time a collection run that uses an uploaded file is run manually.

You can take the following actions from the dashboard:

* To filter the list by file name, start typing in the search box.
* To filter the list by the user who uploaded the file, select a team member in the **Uploaded by** dropdown list.
* To download a file, hover over a file and select <img alt="Download icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-download-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Download file**.
* To delete a file, hover over a file then select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> > <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete**.

![Manage test data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/test-data-manage-v11-40.jpg)

Once you've reached your test data storage limit, you won't be able to upload more test data files. You can delete files to free up storage space, or you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

Once you're reached your test data retrieval limit, requests that use uploaded data files won't be able to retrieve those files before being sent. This includes requests that are sent manually or automatically from a scheduled collection run, monitor, flow, or the Postman CLI. To resume using test data before your monthly limit resets, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Agent Mode usage

With [Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/), you get a monthly AI credit allowance on Free, Basic, and Professional plans.

On the Free plan, when your team members reach their monthly credit limit, you can purchase the Postman AI add-on to get more monthly credits. On Basic and Professional plans, you can keep using Agent Mode after reaching your limit if credit overages are enabled by an Admin. If overages aren’t enabled, Agent Mode pauses until credits renew.

To learn more, see [Manage your Postman Agent Mode credits](/docs/billing/agent-mode-usage/).

## Postbot usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of Postbot activities each month. Postbot will notify you when you reach the monthly activity limit. You can't use it for the remaining month unless you [purchase Postbot as an add-on](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products).

## Postman API usage

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of requests that can be sent to the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) each month. After the limit is reached, you will get a `Service limit exhausted` error message in the response body when sending a request to the Postman API.

To make more requests to the Postman API before your monthly limit resets, you can [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Integrations

Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of [integrations](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/) for connecting Postman to third-party tools you use for API development. After the limit is reached, you won't be able to add a new integration. You will get a notification in the Postman app when attempting to add a new integration.

To add a new integration, delete one of your existing integrations or [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes).

## Cloud Agent usage

The [Postman Cloud Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-cloud-agent) enables you to send requests from the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) without encountering cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of requests that can be sent using the Cloud Agent each month. After the limit is reached, you will get a `Cloud Agent Error` message in the response body when sending a request from the Postman web app using the Cloud Agent.

To continue sending requests from the Postman web app before your monthly limit resets, [upgrade your plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes) or switch to the Postman Desktop Agent. In the error message, select **Use Postman's Desktop Agent**. If you haven't already installed the Desktop Agent, you'll be prompted to download it.

# Manage your Postman AI credits

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Agent Mode is available with [Free, Basic, and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). To learn more, see [About Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/).
</Info>

You and your team members receive a monthly AI credit allowance to use on Postman [AI features](/docs/agent-mode/overview/), regardless of whether you’re on a Free, Basic, or Professional plan.

When your team members reach their monthly credit limit, what happens next depends on your plan:

* **Free plan** --- You can purchase the Postman AI add-on to get more monthly credits. After purchasing the add-on, you follow the same credit and pay-as-you-go model as Basic and Professional plans.
* **Basic and Professional plans** --- You can keep using Agent Mode after reaching your limit so long as pay-as-you-go is enabled by a Billing admin. If pay-as-you-go isn’t enabled for a team member, Agent Mode pauses until monthly credits renew.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Pay-as-you-go lets you continue using AI beyond your included monthly credits and is billed at your plan’s specified rate.
</Info>

AI credits renew monthly on your billing date, and they don’t roll over between periods.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Availability:** The Postman AI pricing structure will become effective December 1. For more information, see [Plans & Pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

## How Agent Mode consumes credits

Regardless of the plan, each Postman user is allotted some free AI credits every month. Credits are consumed each time Agent Mode performs an AI-powered action, such as generating or refining requests, writing tests, or creating documentation.

| Plan                   | Credits per user/month | Beyond the limit                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free                   | 50                     | When the limit is reached, you can either pause usage until monthly credits reset or purchase the Postman AI add-on for additional credits and optional pay-as-you-go.                                    |
| Basic and Professional | 400                    | When the limit is reached, if you have pay-as-you-go turned on, you can continue using Agent Mode without interruption. If pay-as-you-go is turned off, Agent Mode is paused until monthly credits renew. |

Pay-as-you-go charges appear on your next monthly invoice and are billed to the payment method on file. You'll see the AI credit charges on your invoice.

## Track your team’s AI credit usage

Postman notifies you when you reach 75% and 100% of your AI credit limit, and again when you exceed it. Once you reach 100%, you’ll see an in-product alert letting you know whether usage will pause or continue with pay-as-you-go (if turned on by your Billing admin).

If you have an Admin or Billing role, you receive an email when one or more of your team members has spent 75% of their monthly credits and again when members of your team transition to pay-as-you-go. Billing role users will get one additional email when their team’s total pay-as-you-go charges exceed a certain usage threshold.

You can use the [Resource usage](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview) dashboard to view [the resources your team is using](https://learning.postman.com/docs/billing/resource-usage/) and view your team member’s remaining AI credits for the billing period.

## Manage pay-as-you-go

Pay-as-you-go is turned on by default in Postman AI add-on and Basic and Professional plans. If you have a Billing role, you can turn off pay-as-you-go for individual users in the [AI credit details page](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview) dashboard.

When pay-as-you-go is turned off, Agent Mode access is paused once you reach the credit limit. You can resume using Agent Mode after the monthly allotment renews.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For Basic and Professional teams with Agent Mode enabled on December 1, pay-as-you-go has been disabled for all members. A Billing role user can enable it at any time in the [AI Credit Details page](http://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview).
</Info>


# Manage your team's Postman Flows credit usage

Postman provides tools to help you manage your team's usage of credits in Postman Flows. You get a certain [number of credits](#how-flows-consume-credits) each month. The amount of credits you get depends on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#postman-flows-add-on-pricing) and whether you purchased the Flows [add-on](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products). You consume credits when certain blocks are triggered and each time a deployed flow runs in the cloud.

You can use the [Resource usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage) to track the number of credits that have been consumed against your plan's monthly usage limit. You can also [enable overages](#enable-flows-overages) if needed.

## View flows usage

The maximum number of credits your flows can consume each month depends on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) and if you purchased the Flows [add-on](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products). To check your team's current credit usage, select **Team > Resource Usage** to open the [Resource Usage dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage).

When you reach your monthly credit limit, deployed flows and flows that include credit-consuming blocks will complete their current runs. Then they'll be suspended until the next billing cycle, or until overages are enabled.

## How Flows consume credits

The following table shows how many credits you get each month depending on your plan and whether you purchased the Flows add-on:

|                      | Free  | Basic  | Professional |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Without Flows add-on | 500   | 500    | 500          |
| With Flows add-on    | 5,000 | 25,000 | 100,000      |

A deployed flow consumes one credit each time it runs in the cloud. The following blocks consume one additional credit each time they run in a deployed flow:

* [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/)
* [**AI Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-request/)
* [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/)

[**Connector** blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/connector/) consume two credits each time they run.

The [**Create with AI** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/) consumes multiple credits each time it runs or tests a prompt. The number of credits consumed depends on which AI model the block is configured to use, shown in this table:

| Model       | Free, Basic, and Professional plans |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GPT-4o      | 15 credits                          |
| GPT-4o mini | 1 credit                            |
| GPT-4       | 25 credits                          |
| GPT-3.5     | 5 credits                           |

The [**AI Agent** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-agent/) consumes one or more credits each time it calls an AI model. The block may call an AI model multiple times during a single run. For example, the **AI Agent** block may call an AI model one or more times for each tool it uses in a single run. The number of credits consumed depends on the block's configured AI model, shown in this table:

| Model        | Free, Basic, and Professional plans |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| GPT-5 nano   | 1 credit                            |
| GPT-5 mini   | 2 credits                           |
| GPT-5        | 10 credits                          |
| GPT-4.1 nano | 1 credit                            |
| GPT-4.1 mini | 2 credits                           |
| GPT-4.1      | 10 credits                          |
| GPT-4o       | 13 credits                          |
| GPT-4o mini  | 1 credit                            |
| o3           | 10 credits                          |
| o3 mini      | 5 credits                           |

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The number of credits consumed by AI models is subject to change. Postman will notify you in advance of any such change.
</Info>

### AI-generated images

The **Create with AI** block uses DALL·E 3 to generate images. It consumes 10 credits each time it generates an image, regardless of which plan you're on.

## Enable flows overages

Without the Flows [add-on](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products), when you've reached your monthly credit limit, credit-consuming blocks and deployed flows will stop running until the next billing cycle. To continue using these blocks and deployed flows before the next billing cycle, you'll need to [upgrade your Postman plan](https://go.postman.co/purchase).

On Free, Basic, and Professional plans, you can enable flows overages if you've purchased the Flows add-on. With it enabled, you are charged for and get 1,000 credits each time you exceed your previous allotment.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Flows overages are deactivated by default for paid seats. To enable overages, select **Team > Resource Usage** to open the [**Resource usage** dashboard](https://go.postman.co/usage), and then turn on **Pay-as-you-go** under **Flows Credits**.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Pay-as-you-go for Postman Flows isn't available with the Enterprise plan. If you're an Enterprise customer, please contact the Postman sales team when approaching your Flows credit limit.

# Integrate Postman with third-party solutions

You can connect Postman to your API workflows with integrations for popular third-party solutions. Integrations enable you to automatically share data between Postman and the other tools you rely on for API development, such as GitHub, Slack, CircleCI, AWS API Gateway, and New Relic.

You can use Postman integrations to do the following:

* Sync your collections and API definitions to a source control repository.
* Send monitor alerts to your monitoring service or team messaging app.
* View and run continuous integration (CI) builds from within Postman.
* Manage API deployments to an API gateway.
* View application performance management (APM) metrics in Postman.

For a list of all third-party solutions you can integrate with Postman, go to [Postman-built integrations](https://www.postman.com/product/integrations/).

## Add integrations

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Integrations are available with Postman team plans.** If you are on a Free individual plan, [create a new team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/) to get started with integrations. The maximum number of integrations you can use is determined by your Postman plan. [Learn more about what's included with each plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

To view available integrations, click **Integrations** on the Postman **[Home](http://go.postman.co/)** page, then click **Browse All Integrations**. On the **[Browse Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse/)** page, search and select the tool or service you want to integrate with.

![Browse all integrations](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/integrations-browse-all-v10.jpg)

Each integration's page explains how to use the integration and what it can do. Depending on the tool or service you're integrating with, more than one integration may be available. Click **Add Integration** next to the integration you want to add. Enter your account authorization details and any other required information to complete the setup process.

![Add an integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/integrations-add-v11.jpg)

## View or edit integrations

You can view the integrations that have been configured for your team from the **[Browse Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse/)** page. Search and select the tool or service you want to view integrations for. Click **View** or **View All** next to an integration to view any integrations that have already been configured.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also view integrations that have been configured for a collection or monitor. Open the collection or monitor, and then click the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> in the right sidebar to view any configured integrations.
</Info>

Click a configured integration to view more details. From here you can take the following actions:

* **Refresh Run Log** - View the most recent integration runs.
* **Edit Integration** - Change any configuration settings for the integration, then click **Save Changes**. Not all settings can be changed, depending on the integration. If needed, delete the integration and add a new integration with the settings you want.
* **Delete Integration** - Delete the integration. You can add the integration again later if needed.

![View or edit an integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/integrations-view-v10.jpg)

## Installed apps

Adding an integration requires you to authenticate with the third-party app or service you are connecting to Postman. For supported integrations, you can store the authorization details in an *installed app*. Anyone on your team can then use the installed app to add a new integration, instead of authenticating with their own credentials.

Learn more about [adding and using installed apps in integrations](/docs/integrations/installed-apps/).

## Static IP support

You must allowlist a static IP address to enable integrations and custom webhooks that access hosted (private) networks. Static IP support is available for the following integrations:

* [GitHub custom domain backup](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/back-up-collection/#back-up-collections-to-github-enterprise-server)
* [GitLab custom domain backup](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/gitlab/#back-up-your-postman-collections-to-gitlab-on-a-custom-domain)
* [Custom webhooks](/docs/integrations/webhooks/)

Contact your IT team to allowlist the following static IP in your firewall:

* US East: `3.212.102.200`

Once you allowlist this IP address, collection backup integrations and custom webhooks will be able to connect to your private network.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  DNS records use the public IP address for instances that are behind a firewall or that can't be accessed on the internet.
</Info>

## CI integrations

Postman integrates with some of the most widely used continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools. After you set up a CI integration for your API, you can view the status of builds or start a new build, all from within Postman. You can also run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline.

To learn more about how CI integrations work, and for detailed configuration steps, go to [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).


# Configure custom webhooks in Postman

Postman's custom webhook integration enables you to automate workflows between your favorite apps and services to get notifications, synchronize files, collect data, and more. It offers services with predefined workflows that you can implement.

You can configure a custom webhook with Postman to send events such as monitor results or team and collection-specific activity feeds, or to back up your Postman Collections.

## Enable static IP support

If your network is behind a firewall, you will need to use a static IP address to enable collection backups to custom webhooks on custom domains.

Contact your IT team to allowlist the following static IP in your firewall to enable collection backups to webhooks:

* US East: `3.212.102.200`

Once you allowlist this IP address, calls for the custom webhook will be able to connect to your network and enable the webhook to work as expected.

## Configure custom webhooks

1. On the [Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse) page, search and select Webhooks from the list of integrations.

   The integration's page has choices for each type of custom webhook. If available, you can view previously configured integrations for the selected integration.

2. Click **Add Integration** next to a webhook type to configure your integration. Perform the steps in the related section below for the webhook type you are adding.

Once the integration has been created, you can view the integration you created in addition to the other active integrations created by your team:

### Send updates for a Postman Collection to a custom webhook

1. In the **Webhooks Integrations** page, next to **Backup a collection**, click **Add Integration**.
2. In the **Add integration** page:
   * Enter a **Nickname** for the integration.
   * Under **Choose workspace**, select the workspace your collection belongs to.
   * Under **Choose Collection**, select the collection you wish to send updates for.
   * Enter the webhook URL your webhook payload will be sent to.
3. Click **Add Integration**.

Postman periodically checks your collection for changes. If Postman identifies changes when it checks your collection, the changes automatically send to your custom webhook.

### Example collection backup schema

The following is a schema for the **Backup a collection** webhook:

# Add new integrations using installed apps in Postman

Each time you add a new integration, you need to authenticate with the third-party app or service you want to connect to Postman. *Installed apps* streamline this process by enabling all members of a team to use the same stored authorization details when adding an integration.

When you authenticate with a third-party service, you can choose to have Postman securely store the authorization details as an installed app. Any team member can add a new integration using the installed app, without needing to know or enter the authorization details.

## Add an installed app

You can add a new installed app from [**Team Settings > Installed apps**](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/installed-apps). After you add an installed app, any member of your team can use it to add a supported integration.

To add an installed app, do the following:

1. In Postman, click **Team > Team Settings**.
2. Click **Installed apps**.
3. Select the third-party app or service you want to add. The next steps can differ depending on the app or service you selected.
4. The new installed app appears on the [Installed apps](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/installed-apps) page.

<img alt="Adding an installed app from Team Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/installed-apps-adding-v10-12.jpg" />

## Manage installed apps

You can view all installed apps from [Team Settings > Installed apps](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/installed-apps). In Postman, click **Team > Team Settings**, and then click **Installed apps**. You can view the app name, what it's connected to, and who set up the connection.

To edit an installed app, click the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> next to the installed app.

To delete an installed app, click the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px" /> next to the installed app. You must be an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to delete an installed app.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Use caution when deleting an installed app.** If you delete an installed app, any integrations created using the installed app will stop working. You must [reauthenticate the affected integrations](#reauthenticate-an-integration) for them to continue working.
</Info>

<img alt="Managing installed apps" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/installed-apps-managing-v10-12.jpg" />

## Reauthenticate an integration

If an installed app is deleted, any integrations you added using the installed app stop working. You must reauthenticate the affected integrations for them to continue working.

# Integrate CI tools in Postman

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are a core part of the [API development workflow](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/). Postman integrates with popular CI tools so you can view details about API builds in the same place where you define and test your API. CI integrations support APIs in the [Postman API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/).

After you set up CI integration, you can view the status of builds or start a new build, all from within Postman. You can also run [API tests](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-test-automation/) created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) and the Postman API.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Integrations are available with Postman team plans.** If you are on a Free individual plan, [create a new team](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/create-teams/) to get started with integrations. The maximum number of integrations you can use is determined by your Postman plan. [Learn more about what's included with each plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

## Configure CI integration

To set up CI integration for your API in the Postman API Builder, first set up your CI project and then connect Postman to your CI tool. After you set up CI integration, information for CI build jobs is available in Postman. Click **Test and Automation** for your API to view recent build jobs, see the build status, and even start a new build.

To connect your API to your CI project, see the steps for your CI tool:

* [Azure Pipelines](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/azure-pipelines/)
* [Bitbucket Pipelines](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/bitbucket-pipelines/)
* [CircleCI](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/circleci/)

* [Jenkins](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/jenkins/)
* [Travis CI](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/travis-ci/)

## Configure the Postman CLI for CI

Running API tests as part of your CI pipeline helps to keep expectations between your API producers and consumers in sync. The Postman CLI can also perform [Postman API Governance and API Security checks](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) as part of your CI pipeline ([Enterprise teams only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).

To run your API tests along with each build and, optionally, your API Governance and API Security checks, first generate the Postman CLI configuration code in Postman. Then add the configuration code to your CI project. Each time a CI build runs, the Postman CLI uses the Postman API to run the collections that contain your tests. You can view the results of your tests in Postman.

To configure the Postman CLI to run API tests, see the steps for your CI tool:

* [Azure Pipelines](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/ci-integrations/azure-pipelines/#configure-the-postman-cli-for-azure-pipelines)

Once the data is present in Datadog, you can filter it. You can filter results by monitor name or ID, collection name or UID, user name or ID, and environment name or UID (if present). You can also combine different metrics to create a dashboard.

## Forward Postman metrics

Postman can forward a wide array of monitor metrics to Datadog. The following table lists the metric, its type, and the metric's level. For more information about Datadog's metric collection, see [Datadog's Metrics documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/).

| Metric                                  | Type  | Description                                                                                    | Level   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `postman.monitor.run.errors`            | Gauge | Total number of errors across all requests in a monitoring run.                                | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.run.failed\_tests`     | Gauge | Total number of failed tests across all requests in a monitoring run.                          | Run     |

| `postman.monitor.run.request\_count`    | Gauge | Total number of requests in a monitoring run.                                                  | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.run.total\_latency`    | Gauge | The total latency time for all requests in a monitoring run.                                   | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.run.http\_status\_2xx` | Gauge | Total number of requests in a monitoring run that return an HTTP status code in the 200 range. | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.run.http\_status\_4xx` | Gauge | Total number of requests in a monitoring run that return an HTTP status code in the 400 range. | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.run.http\_status\_5xx` | Gauge | Total number of requests in a monitoring run that return an HTTP status code in the 500 range. | Run     |
| `postman.monitor.request.latency`       | Gauge | Latency for each request in a monitoring run.                                                  | Request |
| `postman.monitor.request.failed\_tests` | Gauge | Number of failed tests for each request in a monitoring run.                                   | Request |
| `postman.monitor.request.passed\_tests` | Gauge | Number of passed tests for each request in a monitoring run.                                   | Request |
| `postman.monitor.request.bytes`         | Gauge | Total bytes sent and received for each request in a monitoring run.                            | Request |

## Metrics tags

Postman sends tags to Datadog along with each metric and event. Tags enable you to filter the metric based on various parameters such as monitor name or collection name. The following tags are sent by Postman to Datadog:

| Tag         | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Region      | The region from where the monitor is run.                      |
| Triggers    | What triggered the monitor run: Manual, Webhook, or Scheduled. |
| Run results | Successful, Failure, Error, or Abort.                          |
| Level       | The level the metric is captured for: Run or Request.          |
| Status Code | HTTP response code for the request run.                        |
| Job ID      | Monitor's Job ID.                                              |
| Request ID  | The request identifier.                                        |

## Update existing integrations

Postman is a Datadog Technology Partner, and Postman's integration is available in Datadog's [Integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/postman/). To enable the partnership, the metrics produced by Postman were renamed, as detailed in the [Forward Postman metrics](#forward-postman-metrics) section. If you have integrations created before the integration listing on Datadog, you must update them to take advantage of the integration listing.

To update existing integrations, do the following:

1. Go to the [Post monitoring results](https://go.postman.co/integrations/service/datadog/monitor_run_datadog) page.

2. Select the integration you want to upgrade.

3. Click **Update Now**, then click **Update Integration** on the confirmation box to upgrade the integration.

   ![Datadog upgrade integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/datadog-integration-update-now.jpg)

4. Click **Confirm**.

The updated integration has the following benefits:

* The Postman metrics for the integration are no longer treated as [Custom Metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/) in Datadog, which means they're free. (Custom metrics on Datadog are [charged](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/billing/custom_metrics/?tab=countrategauge).)
* Datadog provides a default dashboard that you can use to observe the monitor. Change the `monitor_name` variable to the monitor for which you want to observe the dashboard.

# Back up your collections to GitHub

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[GitHub Enterprise Server integrations are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Back up your Postman collections to GitHub, a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, with the Postman to GitHub integration. You can also back up collections to a custom domain on GitHub Enterprise Server.

Setting up a GitHub integration requires you to generate a GitHub personal access token and configure how you would like to back up your collections.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To import data into Postman from a GitHub repository, see [Importing from GitHub repositories](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/).
</Info>

## Generate a GitHub personal access token

To integrate with GitHub, you need a GitHub personal access token.

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. If you don't already have a personal access token, [generate a new one](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can use a classic token or a [fine-grained token](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/).

   * **Classic token** - Make sure to select the `repo` and `user` scopes.
   * **Fine-grained token** - Make sure the token has access to the repository you want to back up to and has the following Repository permissions: `Contents (Read and write)` and `Metadata (Read-only)`.

3. Save the generated token to use later.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For more information about generating a token, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
</Info>

## Back up collections to GitHub

You can back up a Postman Collection to a GitHub repository. After you create the integration, any new changes to the collection in Postman will also appear in the GitHub repository.

1. From the **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)** page select **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)**.

2. Search and select **GitHub**.

   <img alt="GitHub integration" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/integrations-github-v10.jpg" />

3. Next to **Backup a collection**, click **Add Integration**.

4. Enter your GitHub **Personal Access Token** and click **Authenticate and Proceed**.

   <img alt="GitHub integration" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/integrations-github-authenticate-v10.jpg" />

5. After Postman verifies the token, you can configure the integration:

   * **Nickname** - A nickname for your integration.
   * **Workspace** - The workspace with the collection you want to back up.
   * **Collection** - Select a collection to back up.
   * **Repository** - Select the GitHub repository where you want to back up the collection.
   * **Directory** - Enter the directory where you want to push the collection. This is optional. If the directory doesn't exist, Postman will create it for you. If you don't specify a directory, Postman will create a `Postman collections` directory.
   * **Filename** - Enter the file name of the collection in the repository.
   * **Branch** - Select the branch where you want to push the collection. The branch must already exist in your repository. If you don't specify a branch, Postman will push the collection to the default branch of the repository.

6. To finish setting up the integration, click **Add Integration**.

Postman often checks your collection for changes. If Postman identifies changes when it checks your collection, the changes automatically commit to your repository in JSON format. Go to your GitHub repository to view your collections.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **You can view your configured integrations on the [Browse Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse) page.** You can also view integrations that have been configured for a collection by opening the collection and clicking the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> in the right sidebar. Learn more about [viewing or editing integrations](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/#view-or-edit-integrations).
</Info>

## Back up collections to GitHub Enterprise Server

You can back up a Postman Collection to a GitHub Enterprise Server repository on a custom domain. Follow the same step as [backing up collections to GitHub](#back-up-collections-to-github) with the following differences.

1. After searching for the GitHub integration in Postman, click **Add Integration** next to **Backup a collection (custom domain)**.

2. Along with your personal access token, enter the custom domain of your enterprise server (for example, `https://my-git-server.example.com`). Then click **Authenticate and Proceed**.

3. Configure the integration with your collection, repository, directory, file name, and branch.

4. To finish setting up the integration, click **Add Integration**.

Postman often checks your collection for changes. If Postman identifies changes when it checks your collection, the changes automatically commit to your repository in JSON format. Go to your GitHub repository to view your collections.

### Static IP support

If your network is behind a firewall, you must allowlist a static IP address to enable collection backups to GitHub Enterprise Server on a custom domain.

Contact your IT team to allowlist the following static IP in your firewall:

* US East: `3.212.102.200`

Once you allowlist this IP address, the collection backup integration will be able to connect to your private network.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **Backup a collection (custom domain)** integration requires the ability to reach the static IP address `3.212.102.200` from the network where your GitHub Enterprise Server instance is hosted. If your server instance is in a virtual private cloud (VPC), you may need to change the VPC's network access control list or rules.
</Info>

## Troubleshoot the GitHub integration

If your GitHub integration has issues or your data isn't pushed to GitHub, make sure you've met the following requirements:

* You added the GitHub integration in the same workspace as the content you want to push to the GitHub repository.

* You selected the correct GitHub integration in Postman. For example, if you use [GitHub Enterprise Server on a custom domain](#back-up-collections-to-github-enterprise-server), make sure you selected the **Backup a collection (custom domain)** integration.

* You initialized your GitHub repository with a `README.md` file. When creating a new repository, you can select the **Add a README file** checkbox.

* You selected the correct permissions when creating your GitHub [personal access token](#generate-a-github-personal-access-token):

  * **Classic token** - Make sure to select the `repo` and `user` scopes.
  * **Fine-grained token** - Make sure the token has access to the repository you want to back up to and has the following Repository permissions: `Contents (Read and write)` and `Metadata (Read-only)`.

* The branch you specified when setting up the integration already exists on GitHub. Postman won't create the branch if it doesn't already exist.

* You have permissions to push to the branch.

* If your instance of GitHub Enterprise Server is on-premises or self-hosted, check with your IT team for [firewall requirements](#static-ip-support).

Edit the integration to make any required changes. If the integration still doesn't work after you edit it, delete the integration and add it again.


# Integrate GitHub Actions with Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[GitHub Actions self-hosted runners are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that's integrated with GitHub. Software development teams can use GitHub Actions to automatically build, test, and deploy code in GitHub.

To set up a GitHub Actions integration for your API in the Postman API Builder, first create a pipeline in GitHub and then configure your API in Postman. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds from within Postman.

## Create a pipeline in GitHub

If you haven't already, create a pipeline in the GitHub repository you use for your API. To create a pipeline, create a directory in your repository named `.github/workflows`, and then add a YAML file to the directory. You define your pipeline in this YAML file. To learn more, see [the GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows).

## Configure a GitHub Actions integration

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the sidebar. *Each API can be linked to one CI project*.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If you've already authenticated with GitHub to connect a Git repo for source control, you can use the same authentication. To automatically create the integration, under **Test and Automation**, select **Connect to GitHub**.
   </Info>

2. Click **Test and Automation**.

3. Under **Automate**, select **GitHub Actions**.

4. You'll be prompted to allow Postman to access your GitHub account. After you grant access, you can close the browser tab and return to Postman.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     **There's a limit of ten auth tokens per user per application imposed by GitHub.** If you create more than ten connections with the same user, the extra tokens will be revoked in the order that they were created. Teams can use other Postman accounts to create more than ten integrations.
   </Info>

5. Enter a **Nickname** to help you recognize the integration later. Postman pre-fills a nickname in the format `GitHub-{API_NAME}`, and you can edit it if you want.

6. Select the GitHub **Organization** with your API repository.

7. Select the **Repository** used for your API.

8. Click **Connect**.

<img alt="Connect to GitHub Actions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/github-actions-connect-v10.jpg" />

## View build status

After you set up a GitHub Actions integration, information for build jobs is available in Postman. For each build you can view the branch, start time, and status (`Success` or `Failure`). You can also view the results of collection runs that are [configured in your pipeline using the Postman CLI](#view-collection-run-details).

To view build jobs, open an API and click **Test and Automation**. The most recent jobs are listed under the repository name.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can't start GitHub Actions builds directly in Postman. To [start a new build](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow), go to GitHub.
</Info>

Click **View All Builds** to view the full list of build jobs. From here you can take the following actions:

* Use the dropdown lists to filter jobs by branch or build status.
* To open a build in GitHub, select the build name.
* To get the latest build status information, click <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px" /> **Refresh**.
* To edit or delete the integration, click the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px" />.

<img alt="View all GitHub builds" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/github-actions-collection-runs-v10.jpg" />

## View collection run details

Using the Postman CLI, you can run Postman collections with your API tests as part of a GitHub Actions pipeline.

To view details for collections that were run as part of a build, first [configure the Postman CLI for GitHub](#configure-the-postman-cli-for-github-actions) and then [start a new build in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow). After the build is complete, use the arrows to expand a build and expand a collection to view details about a collection run.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Click **View Report** to view a collection run report in the Postman **History**. Learn more about using the [Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).
</Info>

## View API Governance and API Security rule violations

Using the Postman CLI, you can enforce [Postman API Governance and API Security rules each time the pipeline runs](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/#track-governance-and-security-rule-violations-in-cicd) using the [api lint](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-options/#governance-and-security) command ([Enterprise teams only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).

To view the results of API Governance and API Security checks that ran as part of the build, first [configure the Postman CLI for GitHub Actions](#configure-the-postman-cli-for-github-actions) and then [start a new build in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow). After the build is complete, use the arrows to expand a build and expand an API specification stored in the Postman API Builder to view any rule violations.

<img alt="View API Governance and API Security results" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/github-actions-api-governance-and-security-results-v10.jpg" />

## Configure the Postman CLI for GitHub Actions

With the help of the Postman CLI and the Postman API, you can run Postman collections with your API tests as part of your GitHub pipeline. First generate the Postman CLI configuration code in Postman. Then add the configuration code to a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory in your GitHub repository.

Each time the pipeline runs, the Postman CLI runs the collections that contain your tests. You can view the results of your tests in Postman. You can also enforce [API Governance and API Security rules](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/#track-governance-and-security-rule-violations-in-cicd) each time the pipeline runs ([Enterprise teams only](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Before you begin, make sure you've already [set up an integration](#configure-a-github-actions-integration) between your API and GitHub Actions.
</Info>

To generate configuration code for the Postman CLI, do the following:

1. Open your API and click **Test and Automation**.
2. Under the repository name, select **View All Builds**.

Click **Insert link** at the top of the editor, add the text to display, enter the Postman link as the address, then click **Insert**. You can also add a space after the Postman link to make it a hyperlink.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If the element or HTTP response includes sensitive data, be aware that it might be visible to collaborators you share with in Teams. Make sure to consider the sensitivity of data when deciding which collaborators you share with. Postman recommends checking your organization's policies to understand what qualifies as sensitive data.

  You can remove the preview from your message if you're concerned about the data that's shared when a link unfurls. To remove the preview from a sent message, learn about [editing a sent message in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/edit-or-delete-a-sent-message-in-microsoft-teams-5f1fe604-a900-4a07-b8b7-8cf70ed6b263).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Get the Postman app for Slack to connect your Postman account to Slack.** Go to the [Postman App for Slack](https://go.pstmn.io/Integrations-page-slack/) in the Slack App Directory to get started.
</Info>

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a messaging app that teams all over the world rely on for collaboration. With Postman's integrations for Slack, you can bring your API development workflow into your Slack workspace. Get notifications, share what you're working on, and stay up to date with your Postman team, all within Slack.

Postman offers four different integrations for Slack: the Postman app for Slack, personal notifications, monitoring notifications, and activity feed notifications. You can set up the integrations you want, or use them all to get the most out of Postman and Slack.

## Get the Postman app for Slack

With the Postman app for Slack, you can collaborate with your Postman team right in Slack.

* **Get more context when sharing links to workspaces, collections, or requests.** When you share a Postman link, it's unfurled into a rich link you can use to perform actions from Slack, like watching or forking a collection.

* **Stay up to date on workspace activity.** Connect a Postman workspace to a Slack channel to get updates any time your teammates add or change a request, collection, or environment, or when someone [posts a workspace update](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/).

[Set up the Postman app for Slack](https://go.pstmn.io/Integrations-page-slack/) to start collaborating with your team in Slack.

</Info>

The Postman app for Slack gives you more ways to collaborate with your team. You can share enhanced Postman links that you and your teammates can use to take action right in Slack. You can also connect a Postman workspace to Slack to get notified about team activity and communicate [workspace updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/).

For tips on using Postman and Slack together to enhance team collaboration and receive important alerts, see the [best practices for integrating tools with Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/tool-integration/).

Installing the Postman app for Slack enables the following features:

* **Automatically unfurl Postman URLs** - Postman URLs shared in Slack unfurl into rich links that give more context about workspaces, collections, requests, and other Postman elements.
* **Perform Postman actions in Slack** - Use rich links to take actions in Slack, like forking a collection or commenting on a request.
* **View workspace updates** - Connect a Postman workspace to Slack and stay up to date on changes to requests, collections, and environments.

## Install the Postman app for Slack

Once you install the Postman app for Slack, everyone in your Slack workspace can use the app.

1. In your browser, make sure you're [signed in to your Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/).
2. Go to the [Postman App for Slack](https://postman.slack.com/apps/A02NRM5HGBE-postman?tab=more_info) in the Slack App Directory.
3. If you're not already signed in to Slack, click **Sign In to Install** and sign in with your email and password or SSO.
4. Click **Add to Slack**.
5. Click **Allow** to give Postman permission to view content and perform actions in Slack.

After installing the Postman app for Slack, when you share Postman links in Slack, they're automatically [unfurled into rich links](#unfurl-postman-links-and-take-action-in-slack). Also, you can [connect a Postman workspace to a Slack channel](#connect-a-postman-workspace-to-slack) to send updates about workspace activity to Slack.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You may need to be a Workspace Owner in Slack, or get approval from a Workspace Owner, to install the Postman app for Slack. If you lack the necessary permissions in Slack, you can request the app from your Slack Workspace Admin or Org Admin.
</Info>

## Unfurl Postman links and take action in Slack

After installing the Postman app for Slack, Postman links that you share in Slack are automatically unfurled into rich links. Postman supports rich links for elements such as workspaces, collections, folders, requests, examples, environments, and comments. Postman also supports rich links for HTTP responses.

When you share a Postman link, Slack displays extra information such as the name and type of element and who last updated it. Also, Slack displays options to take action with the element, such as adding a comment, or watching or forking a collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Link unfurling isn't available for Postman links shared from workspaces restricted only to you. [Change access to your workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) to collaborate in Slack.
</Info>

![Slack rich links](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/slack-rich-links-v11-18.jpg)

Postman also supports rich links for HTTP responses. Slack displays extra information such as the request URL and response code when you share a Postman link. Slack displays the response body for Postman links shared from team workspaces. For links shared from private workspaces or Partner Workspaces, Slack doesn't display the response body and you must open Postman to view it. Learn how to [share a response](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-a-request-with-its-response).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Link unfurling for HTTP responses isn't available for Postman links shared from workspaces restricted only to you.

![Slack rich links response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/slack-rich-links-response-v11-18.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If the element or HTTP response includes sensitive data, be aware that it might be visible to collaborators you share with in Slack. Make sure to consider the sensitivity of data when deciding which collaborators you share with. Postman recommends checking your organization's policies to understand what qualifies as sensitive data.

  You can remove the preview from your message if you're concerned about the data that's shared when a link unfurls.
</Info>

## Connect a Postman workspace to Slack

You can connect a Postman workspace to a Slack channel. Once connected, Postman will send updates to the Slack channel when a request, collection, or environment is added, changed, or deleted in the workspace. Each update in Slack includes options you can use to take action, such as adding a comment, or watching or forking a collection.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can connect internal and public workspaces to Slack. You can't connect Partner Workspaces. Learn more about [changing workspace visibility](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility).

# Send Postman Monitor results to Slack

[Postman Monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) enable you to continuously check the health and performance of your APIs. You can integrate Postman with Slack to automatically send monitor results to a channel in Slack. Each time the monitor runs, you'll get a notification in Slack with the results. It's recommended that you set up Slack notifications when you configure a monitor. Alternatively, you can set up Slack notifications when you set up a Postman Monitor integration.

## Configure monitors to send results to Slack

You can connect a Slack channel when you create a new monitor or when you edit an existing monitor.

To send Postman Monitor results to Slack from **Monitors**, do the following:

1. Click **Monitors** in the sidebar, then click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new monitor**.
2. When you [configure](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/#configure-a-monitor) your new monitor, under **Notifications**, select the **Notify a team channel** checkbox.
3. Click **Connect Slack channel**.
4. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Click **Continue**, then enter your workspace URL and sign in with your email or SSO.
5. Click **Allow** to give Postman permission to view content and perform actions in Slack. Close the tab to continue in Postman.
6. From the Postman **Monitors** page, under **Notifications**, select a Slack workspace and a Slack channel in which to receive notifications.
7. Choose whether to receive notifications for every completed run or after three consecutive failures and a successful run after the failures.
8. You'll receive a confirmation message in the selected Slack channel once the connection is established.

After connecting the Slack channel, Postman sends monitor results based on the selected settings.

## Configure an integration to send monitor results to Slack

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This integration works with monitors. Before you begin, make sure you've [created at least one monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).
</Info>

To send Postman Monitor results to Slack from the **Integrations** page, do the following:

1. From the **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)** page, click **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)** in the left sidebar.

2. Click **Browse All Integrations**.

3. Search for and select **[Slack](https://go.postman.co/integrations/service/slack)**.

4. Next to **Post monitoring results**, click **Add Integration**.

   ![Select Slack monitoring integration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/slack-select-monitoring-v11.jpg)

5. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Click **Continue**, then enter your workspace URL and sign in with your email or SSO.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If someone on your team created an [installed app](/docs/integrations/installed-apps/) for Slack, a message and green checkmark let you know you're already authenticated with your Slack workspace. You don't need to sign in or review permissions. If you want to connect to a different Slack workspace, click the link.
   </Info>

6. Click **Allow** to give Postman permission to view content and perform actions in Slack. Close the tab to continue in Postman.

7. Enter the following on the **Add integration** window:

   * **Nickname** - A nickname for your integration.
   * **Select a Workspace** - The workspace with your monitor.
   * **Monitor** - The monitor that will send its results to Slack.
   * **Channel name** - The Slack channel to send the monitor's results to.
   * **Configure when monitor runs must be notified** - Select if you want notifications for all completed monitor runs, or for three failed monitor runs in a row and then the next successful monitor run.
   * **Add Slack for your team** - Select this checkbox to add an [installed app](/docs/integrations/installed-apps/) for Slack. Other team members can use the installed app to add an integration without having to authorize with Slack.

8. Click **Add Integration**.

After configuring the integration, Postman sends the monitor results to the Slack channel you specified each time your monitor runs.

![Monitor results in Slack](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/slack-post-monitoring-results-example-v9.jpg)

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **You can view your configured integrations on the [Browse Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse) page.** You can also view integrations that have been configured for a monitor by opening the monitor and clicking <img alt="Info icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-info-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Monitor details** in the right sidebar.

# View Postman team activity in Slack

You can integrate Postman with Slack to automatically send team updates to a channel in Slack. You can get notified in real time or on a schedule about team activity such as changes to workspaces, collections, and other Postman elements. Your team's [activity feed](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#view-workspace-activity) also keeps you up to date on what your team is working on.

To send Postman team activity to Slack, do the following:

1. From your workspace **Overview** tab, click <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> <img alt="Teams icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-teams.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Connect**.
2. Click **Connect Slack** from the drop down menu.
3. A browser tab opens asking you to sign in to Slack. Click **Continue**, then enter the Slack workspace where you want to receive the notifications and sign in with your email or SSO.
4. From the workspace **Overview** tab, click the Slack icon to open the **Manage Slack integration** dialog.
5. Select a Slack channel where you want the integration to post team activity messages.
6. Select an option to receive notifications in real time or periodically. If you select the periodic notifications option, select the days of the week, time, and timezone to receive the notifications.
7. Click **Save changes**. A confirmation message with the options you selected appears in the connected Slack channel.

You can also connect multiple channels to a single workspace. For example, one channel can send immediate updates and another can be used to send a summary at a specified schedule.

To connect multiple channels to a workspace do the following:

1. From the workspace **Overview** tab, click the Slack icon to open the **Manage Slack integration** dialog. If multiple channels are already connected, you'll see an **Integrations** label with a count of the number of connected channels next to it, click **Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect New Channel** and select another Slack channel where you want the integration to post team activity messages.
3. Select an option to receive notifications in real time or periodically. If you select the periodic notifications option, select the days of the week, time, and timezone to receive the notifications.
4. Click **Save changes**. A confirmation message with the options you selected appears in both connected Slack channels.

When someone updates your workspace, Postman sends a notification to the selected Slack channel within a few minutes if you selected real time updates or sends an activity summary to the selected channel if you selected periodic updates.

You can update the schedule at any time by clicking the Slack logo on the **Overview** tab and updating the options in the **Manage Slack integration** dialog. If multiple channels are already connected, you'll see an **Integrations** label with a count of the number of connected channels next to it, click **Integrations**.

# Integrate Postman with Statuspage

Atlassian's [Statuspage](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage) is an uptime and incident communication tool. You can use Statuspage to create a home page for your customers so they can monitor if subsystems or services within your site are operational. Customers can also use the home page to find out more information on system outages or failures. An example of a Statuspage home page is Postman's status page, located at [status.postman.com](https://status.postman.com).

The Statuspage integration enables you to send metrics like response times to Statuspage and create and communicate incidents in case of a failure. When a Postman Monitor test run fails, this integration can then send updates to Statuspage.

Setting up a Statuspage integration requires you to get an API key from Statuspage. When configuring the integration, you can choose to link a monitor to a Statuspage component, create a Statuspage incident when a monitoring run fails, or both.

<Info class="iconless-callout">

### Linking a monitor to a component

When the **Link monitor to component** action is configured, if the specified monitor fails a test run, it will change the status of the linked component.

To configure the **Link monitor to component** action, do the following:

1. Select the Statuspage component you want to link to the monitor.
2. Select a component success status. This status will be displayed in Statuspage when the linked monitor is running as expected.
3. Select a component failure status. This status will be displayed in Statuspage when the linked monitor fails a test run.

![Statuspage link monitor to component](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/statuspage-monitor-to-component-v10-15.jpg)

When the monitor fails, the linked component's status will change on your status page:

![Statuspage component failure](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/statuspage-component-fail.jpg)

When a component's status is changed due to a failed test run, it will remain in that state until there is a successful test run in the monitor. After a successful run, the component status will return to the successful state.

### Creating an incident when a monitoring run fails

When the **Create incident when monitoring run fails** action is configured, if the specified monitor fails a test run, a Statuspage incident is created. The incident provides context to customers on why the failure happened and what will be done to address it.

To configure the **Create incident when monitoring run fails** action, do the following:

1. Enter an incident name. The name is shown to users when they view the incident.
2. Select an incident status. The status is shown to users when they view the incident.
3. Select an incident impact. Choose an impact based on the importance of the service you're monitoring. For example, the failure of an optional, low-traffic API could trigger a minor incident, but the failure of your main authentication API would have critical impact.

![Statuspage create incident](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/statuspage-create-incident-v10-15.jpg)

When the monitor fails, an incident will be created on your status page:

![Statuspage incident](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/statuspage-incident.jpg)

When an incident is created by a failed test run, if a later test run is successful, the incident will be closed.

# Postman Enterprise overview

Postman Enterprise plans are designed for organizations that require and seek advanced identity management, security, and governance features for API design, testing, and deployment at scale. Position your Enterprise team for success by setting up and managing secure Postman access across your organization.

* [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/) offer features like the following:

  * Reports on API performance and consumption.
  * Advanced identity management.
  * Your Private API Network for internal resource sharing.
  * Robust API governance and security tools.

Collaboration features enable internal and partner teamwork through shared workspaces and version control settings. The Enterprise app provides enhanced administrative control over deployments within your organization.

* To set up an efficient Enterprise team in Postman, it's recommended that you first identify Admins, Super Admins, and Billing users, set up the Identity Provider (IdP), verify domains, and assign groups and roles. Assigning roles like Admin and Billing is crucial for team setup, while creating service accounts for the Admins is advised for long-term solutions. Setting up an IdP involves coordinating with other groups at the beginning of the process to avoid delays. Domain verification is essential for trust within your Enterprise team, enabling seamless user addition without invites based on verified email addresses within the domain. For more information, see the [Enterprise onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/enterprise/enterprise-onboarding/).

* Postman Enterprise provides enhanced control for administrators deploying and managing Postman at scale. It offers features like managing app versioning and deploying the Enterprise app across the organization. See [Enterprise deployment](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/) for more information on how to install, update, and uninstall the Postman Enterprise app on Windows, macOS, and Linux while ensuring data encryption measures are in place.

* You can boost your API design and security capabilities by incorporating API Builder and Advanced Security Admin (ASA) as add-on products. For more information, visit [Purchasing add-on products](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products).


# Postman Enterprise plans

Postman Enterprise plans are for organizations that need advanced identity management, security, and governance features as they design, build, test, and deploy APIs. Postman Enterprise enables you to deploy Postman at scale, manage your teams, and streamline your organization's API development process.

## Enterprise features

Postman Enterprise has features for setting up your organization, reporting, advanced identity management, your Private API Network, API governance and API security, collaboration, and administration.

### Postman Organizations

Postman Organizations enable you to replicate your internal organization structure by creating independent teams within the organization. This setup prevents sharing sensitive information and gives each team better control over its membership. Organization teams can directly invite other organization teams to collaborate or consume the Teams' content, improving collaboration scaling.

### Reports

Postman Enterprise enables you to access reports that give you insights into the state of your APIs, including API creation and test runs. Reports also have information about your team's API consumption, performance, security posture, and SLA adherence. To learn more, see [View reports on usage, security, and billing in Postman](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

### Advanced identity management

Postman Enterprise plans give you access to advanced identity management features, including:

* **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Postman Enterprise RBAC enables you to give the right team members access to the right tools and data. To learn more about the roles available to Enterprise, including Super Admin, Community Manager, and API Network Manager, see [Define roles and permissions within Postman](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
* **User groups** - An Enterprise plan enables you to organize your members into groups, then assign roles and permissions according to each group's function. To learn more, see [Organize users into Postman groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).
* **Single sign-on (SSO)** - You can enable your members to sign in to Postman Enterprise using your organization's [identity provider (IdP)](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/#supported-idps). To learn more, see [Intro to SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).
* **System for cross-domain identity management (SCIM)** - Setting up SCIM enables you to automatically provision and de-provision your members and organize them into [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/). To learn more, see [SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).
* **Domain capture** - Domain capture enables you to consolidate all your organization's users into a single Postman Organization and ensure that any new users who sign up for Postman with your domain are automatically added. To learn more, see [Configure domain verification and account capture in Postman](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/).

### Your Private API Network

The Private API Network provides a [central directory](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-catalog/) of workspaces, collections, and APIs your teams use internally. Your Postman Organization members can access these resources and start using them right away. By using your Private API Network, you can enable developers across your organization to discover, consume, and track API development in one place.

### API Governance and API Security features

Postman Enterprise plans provide you with advanced [API governance](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-governance/) and [API security](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-security/) features:

* **Secret Scanner** - Create [custom patterns](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/secret-scanner-patterns/#custom-patterns) to proactively check for secret leaks.
* **Public link governance** - View and manage elements like workspaces, documentation, and collection links that your teams [makes public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/).
* **Audit logs** - Use [audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/) to understand how your members are using Postman.
* **Configurable API governance and API security warnings** - Custom API governance and API security warnings enable you to apply standards consistently throughout your API development process. In the design phase, you'll [track governance and security rule violations in the API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/). Then in testing, you'll [view security warnings in API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/). You can also use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to return Postman API Governance and API Security warnings.
* **Static IP monitoring** - Use monitors to monitor APIs that are behind a restricted firewall. To learn more, see [Configure Postman Monitors to run from static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/).

### Collaboration

Postman Enterprise plans enable your organization to collaborate internally and with partners:

* **Private API Network** - Your members with the Enterprise-only API Network Manager role can approve which APIs to add to your Private API Network. See [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/overview/).
* **Partner Workspaces** - Your organization can invite external partners and customers to a shared workspace to collaborate and build products and services with your APIs. See [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/overview/).
* **Advanced version control** - Manage permissions for reviewers and assign merge checks for forks on Postman elements. To learn more, see [Pull request settings](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/#pull-request-settings).

### Administration

After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can customize it to meet your organization's needs:

* **Postman Enterprise app** - The [Postman Enterprise app](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/) is a version of the Postman desktop app that offers greater control to administrators. After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can use the Enterprise app to manage deployment and installations within your organization.
* **App versioning** - Set an organization-wide version of the Postman desktop app for your organization. To learn more, see [Managing Postman app versioning](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#managing-postman-app-versioning).
* **Enterprise integrations** - Some integrations, including [Azure DevOps](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/azure-devops/), [GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/back-up-collection/), and [GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/gitlab/), are only available with an Enterprise plan.

# Enterprise onboarding checklist

To set up a productive Enterprise Organization in Postman, walk through the following general tasks. It's recommended that you first identify your Admins, Super Admins, Organization Managers, Team Managers, and Billing users, then set up your Identity Provider (IdP), verify your domains, and assign groups and roles to your users before you enable your Enterprise teams.

You can [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also [access Postman on the web](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#use-the-postman-web-app) with the [Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you're using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/) for more information.
</Info>

## Assign roles

The [Organization Manager, Team Manager, Admin, and Billing roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) are essential to the setup and operation of Postman Enterprise teams, so these are the first users that you need to set up.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman provides two free support users per account.
</Info>

### Assign the Organization Manager

Postman Organizations are overseen by Organization Managers. They're responsible for creating Teams in the Organization and can manage any team. They're also responsible for assigning individual Team Managers to the teams they create. Once the Organization Manager role is assigned, you can configure SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and SSO.

### Assign the Team Managers

Your Organization Manager can assign a Team Manager to each of the teams created within your organization so that they can add users to their teams. Team Managers are also responsible for managing their teams' resources.

### Assign the Admin user

You'll need to set up an Admin user first. This user doesn't consume a license, so it's good practice to create this user first so you can then create other users and configure your SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and SSO.

While the person at your organization who is the primary Postman contact is a good candidate for this role, it's not an ideal long-term solution. You can temporarily assign them the Admin role for the purposes of setting up your Enterprise teams. However, it's highly recommended that you set up a service account for this role. Use an identifiable email address, such as `postman-admin@example.com`, for this purpose because users in Postman are identified by their email address.

### Assign the Billing role

Another often-used role is a user with access to your [billing-related functions](/docs/billing/billing-overview/) in Postman. Like the Admin user, the Billing role doesn't consume a license. You can assign this role to an email address assigned to your organization's accounts payable group.

### The Super Admin role

Some operations, like SCIM, work best when configured by a user with the [Super Admin role](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/#manage-super-admins) because this role provides maximum control over these operations. To ensure service continuity, create a service user, such as `postman-admin@example.com`, with the Super Admin role that isn't tied to an individual.

## Set up your Identity Provider

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This step can take some time if you have to work with other groups in your organization. It's recommended that you coordinate with other groups as early as possible to avoid delays.
</Info>

If you're setting up an Identity Provider (IdP) with Postman, this step will vary depending on the IdP your organization uses:

* To configure your Single Sign On (SSO), find the instructions in [Intro to SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).
* To automate the creation and de-provisioning of users with your IdP (recommended), see [SCIM provisioning overview](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).

- If you can't use SCIM, Postman supports just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning with SAML. However, JIT doesn't allow you to invite users directly from Postman when added to the IdP. It also doesn't support automatically assigning users to groups and roles, or automatically removing users from your teams. You must perform these actions manually.

## Verify your domains

[Domain verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) enables Postman to trust your Enterprise teams and its connection to your organization. When you verify your organization's domain, Admins can seamlessly add users who verified their email addresses with the relevant domain to your teams. Users won't need to accept an invite to join your teams and instantly onboard with all the resources they need. Domain verification is one of the prerequisites for [enabling domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/#prerequisites-for-domain-capture).

Like setting up an IdP, domain verification configuration can take some time if you have to work with other groups in your organization. Begin by referring to [Configure domain verification and account capture in Postman](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) and identify the required steps, then contacting your domain's administrator.

## Assign your users to groups

With Postman, you can [organize users into groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) that reflect your organization's structure. You can use groups to assign specific roles to users so they have access to the resources they need in Postman on day one with your IdP.

Groups also enable you to assign [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) in Postman. For example, you can configure your IdP to automatically assign specific members with access to certain Postman roles based on their organization or job title position. These details depend highly on which IdP you use, so work with your IdP manager or IdP documentation get set up.

## Assign roles to your users

Postman supports several [roles](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) that have various access across the organization. Consider which users you want to grant these roles to and whether you want to assign these roles automatically with [user groups](#assign-your-users-to-groups).

## Enable your teams

Once you configure your IdP and SSO, verify your domains, and assign user groups, you can begin adding members to your teams with IdP. Once your IdP is configured to create users in your teams, it's highly recommended that you use your IdP to manage the user life cycle because:

* Manually adding users directly to Postman won't grant them access. This is because the IdP isn't aware of these users and may not grant them access with SSO.
* Manually removing users directly from Postman can cause errors in your IdP because it will try to update users that no longer exist in Postman.

Inform your existing Postman users that they're under SSO control and provide them with instructions for how to access it. New users added to the teams through your IdP are sent invitations by email to join the teams. You will also want to document how users can request access to the Postman Enterprise teams directly from your IdP.

## Questions

# Enterprise deployment

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman app versioning and the Postman Enterprise App are available with **[Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**.
</Info>

Postman Enterprise offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy and manage Postman at scale. Admins can choose to [manage Postman app versioning](#managing-postman-app-versioning) with Postman support, or [deploy the Postman Enterprise app](#deploying-the-postman-enterprise-app) to their organization.

## Comparing the Postman Enterprise app and Desktop app

The following table shows some differences between the Postman Enterprise app and the [Postman Desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/):

| Postman Enterprise app                                                                                                                            | Postman Desktop app                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deployed remotely by administrators                                                                                                               | Locally installed by each user                                                   |
| Administrators set the Postman version for all users in their team; users can't download updates                                                  | Each user can download updates for the latest version of Postman                 |
| Encrypts your [local value](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#understanding-variables) of global, environment, and collection variables | Doesn't encrypt the local value of global, environment, and collection variables |

## Managing Postman app versioning

Postman app versioning enables you to set a version of Postman for the entire organization or team. You can choose to set Postman v8, Postman v9, Postman v10, or Postman v11 as your team's version. App versioning is a back-end operation and must be requested by a [Postman Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).

To request this change, reach out to your Postman Account Manager or [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Check out [Postman's release notes](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/) to compare app versions, or reach out to your Postman Admin for help in selecting your team's version.
</Info>

## Deploying the Postman Enterprise app

Postman's Enterprise app is a variant of Postman's Desktop app that offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy Postman at an enterprise level. It's available as an MSI package for Windows and PKG package for macOS, and supports silent installation, system-wide installation, and additional configurations to control how Postman is installed on users' devices.

## Downloading the Postman Enterprise app

You must be a [Postman Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to access the Postman Enterprise app package.

To download the Postman Enterprise app, open Postman and click **Team** in the upper right, then click **Team Settings > Enterprise application**.

<img alt="Postman Enterprise app download" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/enterprise-app-download-v10.jpg" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Reach out to your Postman Admin or [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) for help with the Postman Enterprise app.
</Info>

## Installing the Postman Enterprise Windows app

Once you've downloaded the Postman Enterprise MSI package, you can move forward with installing the app.

### INSTALLDIR

The `INSTALLDIR` public property is used to select a custom installation directory. If this public property isn't manually overwritten, it defaults to `%PROGRAMFILES%\Postman\"Postman Enterprise"` for system-wide installations and `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Postman\"Postman Enterprise"` for per-user installations.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a system-wide installation to a custom directory:

```shell
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi INSTALLDIR=C:\custom
```

### The MSIINSTALLPERUSER option

The standard `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` option is used to install the app per-user instead of system-wide. By default, the MSI performs a system-wide installation. Set `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` to `1` to perform a per-user installation.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a per-user installation to the default installation directory:

```shell
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

This public property can be used with `INSTALLDIR` to perform a per-user installation to a custom directory:

```shell
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 INSTALLDIR=%USERPROFILE%\custom
```

### Silent installation

A silent installation or uninstallation is performed by passing the `/qn` option to `msiexec`:

```shell
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /qn MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

Running in silent installation mode will exclude error messages. If the installation fails for any reason, `%ERRORLEVEL%` won't equal `0` but no errors will display.

It's always recommended to [run silent installations with logging enabled](#enabling-verbose-logging-for-installation).

### Enabling verbose logging for installation

The `msiexec` tool can be configured to output debug log information about the installation process with the `/l*v` option. For example, you can output debug information to `C:\log.txt`:

```shell
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /l*v C:\log.txt
```

### MSI installation options

Settings can be changed during an MSI application installation.

For example, you can set the `TEAM_IDS` installation option to specify which Postman teams can use the Enterprise app:

```shell
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi TEAM_IDS="1234"
```

You can also install an MSI with multiple installation options:

```shell
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi MY_STRING_OPTION='hello' MY_INTEGER_OPTION=7
```

### Updating the Postman Enterprise Windows app

To upgrade the Postman Enterprise app, you can install the new version of the MSI package. Windows Installer will recognize this updated installation as an upgrade.

You must pass the exact same public properties that were used when you originally installed Postman Enterprise.

For example, if you first installed Postman Enterprise with the following, you must install the new MSI package in the same way:

```shell
INSTALLDIR=C:\custom and MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Downgrading the Postman Enterprise app isn't supported and attempts to do so will result in an error message. You can force a downgrade by manually removing the current version and then installing an earlier version of Postman Enterprise.
</Info>

### Uninstalling the Postman Enterprise Windows app

The `msiexec` command-line tool can be used to remove an existing app using the `/x` option:

```shell
msiexec /x path\to\package.msi
```

The app can also be removed from the Add/Remove Programs section in system settings or from the system Control Panel app.

## Installing the Postman Enterprise macOS app

macOS supports a flexible installer technology called PKG that can be installed without user intervention in scripting or enterprise deployment scenarios.

PKG installer packages have the following capabilities:

* You can select system-wide, per-user installation, or custom installation disks.
* They don't require reboots after installation.
* They're fully configurable for silent installation.
* Apple silicon is supported.

### Installing a PKG installer package

To install a PKG installer, open the file and follow the interactive configurable wizard. PKGs can also be installed from a command-line interface using the `installer` tool included in macOS.

The `LocalSystem` target instructs the PKG to install app bundles to `/Applications` and store installation settings at `/Library/Preferences`:

```shell
sudo installer -dumplog -verbose -pkg path/to/app.pkg -target LocalSystem
```

You can also perform a per-user installation by specifying the `CurrentUserHomeDirectory` target. Given this target, the PKG installs app bundles to `$HOME/Applications` and stores installation settings at `$HOME/Library/Preferences`:

```shell
installer -dumplog -verbose -pkg path/to/app.pkg -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory
```

### Uninstalling PKG installers

A disadvantage of PKG installers is that macOS doesn't provide a standard mechanism to uninstall PKGs. However, the `pkgutil` tool included with macOS can be used to get information about the current PKGs installed on a system and the files that each installation created using the app bundle identifier.

If you don't know the bundle identifier of the app you want to uninstall, you can print the list of all the PKG bundle identifiers installed either system-wide or per-user:

```shell
# For system-wide PKGs
pkgutil --volume / --packages
# For per-user PKGs
pkgutil --volume "$HOME" --packages
```

Given the app bundle identifier, you can list the files written by the PKG, relative to its installation root:

```shell
# For system-wide PKGs
pkgutil --volume / --files <the bundle id>
# For per-user PKGs
pkgutil --volume "$HOME" --files <the bundle id>
```

You can remove the PKG by deleting the files printed out by these commands relative to `$HOME`, depending on if the PKG was installed system-wide or per user.

After removal, you must notify macOS that the PKG was removed:

```shell
# For system-wide PKGs
sudo pkgutil --volume / --forget <the bundle id>
# For per-user PKGs
pkgutil --volume "$HOME" --forget <the bundle id>
```

### PKG installation options

Settings can be changed at installation time using the macOS `defaults` tool either before or after installing the PKG.

For example, you can set the `TEAM_IDS` installation option to specify which Postman teams can use the Enterprise app:

```shell
# For system-wide PKGs
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/<the bundle id> TEAM_IDS -string "1234,5678"
# For per-user PKGs
defaults write <the bundle id> TEAM_IDS -string "1234,5678"
```

Installing a PKG and updating some of its installation options looks like this:

```shell
sudo installer -dumplog -verbose -pkg path/to/app.pkg -target LocalSystem
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/<the bundle id> MY_STRING_OPTION -string "hello"
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/<the bundle id> MY_BOOLEAN_OPTION -boolean YES
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/<the bundle id> MY_INTEGER_OPTION -integer 7
```

### PKG installer logging

It's recommended to use the `-dumplog` and `-verbose` flags supported by `installer` to get detailed information about an installation. For example:

```shell
sudo installer -dumplog -verbose -pkg path/to/app.pkg -target LocalSystem
```

## Installing the Postman Enterprise Linux app

The Postman Enterprise app supports the same [64-bit Linux systems](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#install-postman-on-linux) as the Postman Desktop app.

Before installing, ensure a clean installation:

```shell
sudo snap remove postman-enterprise
```

Install the Postman Enterprise app with Snap:

```shell
sudo snap install /path/to/postman-enterprise.snap --dangerous
```

The `--dangerous` option is required because the Postman Enterprise app isn't distributed through the Snap store. See the [Snap documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/install-modes#heading--dangerous) to learn more.

### Encrypting data

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This step is mandatory.
</Info>

To securely store local data, you must connect the Snap password manager service interface to the Postman Enterprise app:

```shell
sudo snap connect postman-enterprise:password-manager-service
```

### Uninstalling the Postman Enterprise Linux app

Use this command to uninstall the app:

```shell
sudo snap remove postman-enterprise
```

## Login policy

You can specify which Postman teams can use the app with the `TEAM_IDS` option. For example, in Linux, if you want teams with IDs `1234` and `4321` to have access:

```shell
sudo snap set postman-enterprise TEAM_IDS="1234,4321"
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To get your Postman team ID, you can [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) or contact your Postman Account Manager.
</Info>

This configuration ensures that users must be signed in to a team you've specified in order to use the Postman Enterprise app. Users will only see the teams you've approved as options when signing in.

<img alt="Enterprise app sign in page" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/sign-in-to-enterprise app-v10.21.jpg" />


# Postman EU Data Residency

The Postman EU Data Residency provides a solution for customers in the European Union (EU) to use Postman in compliance with their internal privacy and residency requirements. If you select the EU Data Residency, your data will be stored in EU data centers. An instance of Postman hosted in `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) is available for new Enterprise customers.

## About EU Data Residency

Enterprise customers in the EU often have policies that require sensitive data to be stored in the EU. Postman users may require exceptions to data policies in their organization because the main Postman platform is hosted in the `us-east-1` AWS data center in Virginia, US. With the EU Data Residency, organizations have the option of storing all user personally identifiable information (PII) and user-generated data in the EU.

## Purchasing a Postman EU Data Residency plan

To purchase a Postman Enterprise EU Data Residency plan, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/). After you purchase your plan, the Postman team will help set up Postman Enterprise for your organization.

## Set Postman region preference

After you have purchased a Postman Enterprise EU Data Residency plan, you can add your new account when you log in from the Postman desktop app. To log in to the EU Data Residency in the Postman desktop app, do the following:

1. In the **Help** menu, select **Region Preference for New Accounts > Use EU Region by Default**.

2. Follow the usual sign-in procedure as detailed in [Sign in to Postman](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/#sign-in-to-postman).

The authentication flow begins in the EU region the next time you add an account. You can then select that account to log in to the EU Data Residency.

You can also select **Always Ask for Region Selection** if you prefer to choose the region for each new account added. This setting presents you with a region selector every time you add a new account. You can also select **Use EU Region by Default** to return to the default behavior.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This setting only affects the region in which authentication flow will initiate for adding new accounts to the app. It doesn't impact any existing accounts already present in the app.
</Info>

# API Governance and API Security in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  API Governance is available with Postman Enterprise plans. API Security is available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on. [Learn more about Postman plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

The Postman API Governance and Postman API Security features identify inconsistencies or weaknesses in your APIs and recommend possible fixes or improvements that follow industry best practices. These features enable you to automate your organization's governance and security review processes instead of relying on manual reviews.

[API governance](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-governance/) is the practice of defining and applying development rules that promote consistent API behaviors across your organization's API landscape. And a robust [API security](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-security/) posture means that your organization has development rules that promote security-first API behaviors.

Postman applies API governance and API security rules at the following phases of API development:

* [API specification](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) - See rule violations that might impact your specification's governance and security postures.
* [API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) - See rule violations when you send requests to any API using either the Postman web app or the Postman desktop app.

[Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can also create custom rules. See [Enforce API governance and security rules for your team in Postman](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configurable-rules-overview/) for more details.

To learn a systematic approach to API governance, see [best practices for API governance with Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/api-governance/).


# Track governance and security rule violations in the API definition

Postman supports API governance and API security rules for API specifications in [OpenAPI 3.1](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/), [OpenAPI 3.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/), and [OpenAPI 2.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/) formats in both [API Builder](#check-rule-violations-in-the-api-builder) and [Spec Hub](#check-rule-violations-in-spec-hub).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Rule customization**. [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can also customize the rules that Postman applies to API specifications. For more information, see [Configure API governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) and [Manage API security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/).
</Info>

## Check rule violations in the API Builder

To check the governance and security rule violations in an API specification in [the API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/overview/), do the following:

1. Click **APIs** in the sidebar, and then select the API you want to review.

2. From the API overview page, in the **Definition** section, click **View files**.

To learn more about how rule violations can help you create consistent and secure API specifications, see [Viewing rule violations in your API definition](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/validating-elements-against-schema/#viewing-rule-violations-in-your-api-definition).

## Check rule violations in Spec Hub

To check the governance rule violations in an API specification in [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/), do the following:

1. Click **Specs** in the sidebar, and then select an API specification you want to review.
2. Below the specification editor, click **Governance** to view the list of rule violations.

![OpenAPI 3.0 rule violations in Spec Hub](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-specification-rule-violations-openapi3-v11-47.jpg)

To learn more, see [View rule violations in your specification](/docs/design-apis/specifications/validate-a-specification/#view-rule-violations-in-your-specification).

## Track governance and security rule violations in CI/CD

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This feature is available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to enforce the [API Governance and Security](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) rules configured for your team every time the pipeline runs. To do this, generate a [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) configuration. Then add the generated configuration to the CI/CD pipeline you're using, as described in [Configure the Postman CLI for CI](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/#configure-the-postman-cli-for-ci).

To generate a Postman CLI configuration, do the following:

1. In the collection runner's **Functional** tab, select **Automate runs via CLI**.

2. Under **Run on CI/CD**, click **Configure command** to open the **Generate Postman CLI Configuration** tab.

3. From the dropdown menus, select your desired options.

4. If you haven't already saved a Postman API key as a secret environment variable, click **Generate API Key** and [save the key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#use-your-postman-api-key).

5. Click **Copy Postman CLI Command**. This generates and copies the command you'll need in the next step.

   ![Generate the Postman CLI configuration](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/generate-postman-cli-v11.jpg)

6. Paste the generated command into your CI/CD build configuration file.

7. When your CI/CD pipeline runs, it will run the command, thus checking for governance and security rule violations.

To see the results, go to the build run page and use the arrows to expand the desired build. Next, expand the API specification to see the build's results and any rule violations, if applicable.

## Next steps

For the list of all the rule violations that Postman might show at the API specification phase of development, see [OpenAPI 3 rules](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/) and [OpenAPI 2 rules](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/).

| Your API definition's [info object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#info-object) doesn't have a description. Although a description isn't required, including one enables you to provide your API's consumers with information about what the API does and how to use it. This can be anything from a short description to a long explanation of possible uses cases. For your organization, defining the API's description during the design phase can help set the boundaries of the API. | Add a description to your API definition's info object. |

#### Resolution

```json
openapi: '3.0.3'
info:
  title: An API name
  version: '1.0'
  description: An API description
```

 

### The info object should have a license

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Possible fix                                               |

| Your API definition's [license object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#license-object) doesn't have a license URL, which provides a link to a web page that describes the license. Although a license URL isn't required, a license name alone may not be not enough information for your API's consumers, especially when you use a custom license. | Add a URL to your API definition's license object. |

#### Resolution

| Your API definition's [info object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#info-object) doesn't have the URL of the API's Terms of Service. A terms of service is often mandatory for public APIs. It's also recommended that private APIs provide a link to a Terms and Conditions web page. | Add the URL of the API's Terms of Service to your API definition's info object. |

#### Resolution

## Operations

This rule category deals with operations on an API path.

### There should be no trailing slashes on paths

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Possible fix                                                                  |

Some tools treat a path that ends with a trailing slash (`/path/`) differently from the way that they treat paths without a trailing slash (`/path`), which can lead to problems that require long hours of debugging. | Remove any trailing slashes from paths in your API definition's paths object. |

#### Resolution

```json
openapi: '3.0.3'
# ...
paths:
  '/resources':
```

 

### All operations should have summaries

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Possible fix                             |

| One or more [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a summary. A summary of what the operation does provides your API's consumers with important context that the HTTP method and path don't provide on their own. Many organizations use the API operation description that they create during the define phase of the API development process as the summary. | Add a summary for each operation object. |

#### Resolution

```json
openapi: '3.0.3'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    get:
      summary: A GET operation summary
```

 

### Operation summaries shouldn't end with a period

| One or more [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#operation-object) in your API definition have a summary that ends with a period (`.`). API documentation tools use the summary as a title, so it shouldn't end with a period. | Remove the final period from all summaries at the operations object level in your API definition. |

| One or more [response objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#response-object) in your API definition don't have an example. It's important to provide undocumented examples (using the `example` property) or documented examples (using the `examples` property) to help your API's consumers understand what data they'll receive. It may also help them to generate [mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) or a [collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/). | Add an `example` or `examples` field to all response objects. |

## API information

This rule category deals with the OpenAPI info object, which has metadata about the API.

### The info object should have a description

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Possible fix                                            |

| Your API definition's [info object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#info-object) doesn't have a description. Although a description isn't required, including one enables you to provide your API's consumers with information about what the API does and how to use it. This can be anything from a short description to a long explanation of possible uses cases. For your organization, defining the API's description during the design phase can help set the boundaries of the API. | Add a description to your API definition's info object. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'

| Your API definition's [contact object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#contact-object) doesn't have an email address. Although a contact email isn't required, including one gives your API's consumers a way to contact your organization or the API owner. | Add an email address to your API definition's contact object. |

## Operations

This rule category deals with operations on an API path.

### There should be no trailing slashes on paths

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Possible fix                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One or more [path item objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#path-item-object) in your API definition's [paths object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#paths-object) have a trailing slash at the end of the path. Some tools treat a path that ends with a trailing slash (`/path/`) differently from the way that they treat paths without a trailing slash (`/path`), which can lead to problems that require long hours of debugging. | Remove any trailing slashes from paths in your API definition's paths object. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  '/resources':
```

 

### All operations should have summaries

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Possible fix                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| One or more [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a summary. A summary of what the operation does provides your API's consumers with important context that the HTTP method and path don't provide on their own. Many organizations use the API operation description that they create during the define phase of the API development process as the summary. | Add a summary for each operation object. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    get:
      summary: A GET operation summary
```

 

### Operation summaries shouldn't end with a period

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Possible fix                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One or more [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition has a summary that ends with a period (`.`). API documentation tools use the summary as a title, so don't end it with a period. | Remove the final period from all summaries at the operations object level in your API definition. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    get:
      summary: A GET operation summary
```

 

### All operations should have descriptions

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Possible fix                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| One or more [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a description. When the resource path, HTTP method, and summary don't provide enough context for your API's consumers, a description can provide them with useful information about the API operation and its behavior. | Add a description for each operation object. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    get:
      description: A GET operation description
```

 

### All parameters should have descriptions

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Possible fix                                         |

| One or more [parameter objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#parameter-object) in an [operations object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a `description` field. When the API name and context don't provide enough information for your API's consumers, a description can provide them with useful information about the parameter. | Add a `description` field for each parameter object. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: status
        description: filters resources on their status
        in: query
        type: string
```

 

### POST methods should have request bodies

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Possible fix                                      |

| One or more POST [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a request body. Even though the HTTP protocol permits POST requests without a body, this often hides a design problem. | Add a request body to any POST operation objects. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...
paths:
  /resources:
    post:
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: body

### PUT methods should have request bodies

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Possible fix                                      |

| One or more PUT [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a request body. Since a PUT operation is often used to replace or create something, not having a request body might be an error. However, this use might make sense in some cases (for example, to link two resources with a PUT, like `/resource-ones/id1/other-resources/id2`). | Add a request body to any POST operation objects. |

#### Resolution

```json
swagger: '2.0'
# ...

| One or more PATCH [operation objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#operation-object) in your API definition don't have a request body. Since PATCH operations are used to make partial updates, a PATCH method needs to include a request body. | Add a request body to any PATCH operation objects. |

#### Resolution

```json

It's important to provide an example of the request body to help your API's consumers understand what data they'll receive. It may also help them to generate [mock servers](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/set-up-mock-servers/) or a [collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/). | Add an `example` field to the schema of all body parameters. |

# View security warnings in API requests

Postman applies security rules configured for your API requests when you send requests to any API using either the Postman web app or the Postman desktop app. A security warning doesn't mean your API is broken. Instead, it indicates there are potential security risks your API might be vulnerable to. Postman highlights these security warnings and helps you understand their implications and possible ways to fix the warnings.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can also customize the rules that Postman applies to API requests. For more information, see [Configure API Governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/).
</Info>

When you [send an API request](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/#send-a-request), Postman scans it for potential security risks. If any are found, Postman adds the number of warnings to the **Security** tab in the response.

![Security tab showing one warning](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-response-security-tab-v10.jpg)

To learn about API security warnings and how to hide warnings that aren't relevant to your team, see [Security warnings](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/responses/#security-warnings).

For the list of all the security warnings that Postman might show for API requests, see [Security warnings in API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/security-warnings/).

## Security misconfiguration

A security misconfiguration can result from many issues, including:

* Overly permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
* Insecure default configurations
* Incomplete or ad-hoc configurations
* Open cloud storage
* Misconfigured HTTP headers
* Unnecessary HTTP methods
* Verbose error messages that contain sensitive information

### CORS misconfiguration

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism that enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy ([SOP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/same-origin-policy)). However, if a website's CORS policy isn't configured and implemented correctly, it also provides the potential for cross-domain attacks. CORS doesn't protect from cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery ([CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)).

| If the `null` origin is allowlisted, an attacker can use various tricks to generate a cross-origin request with the value `null` in the [`Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) header. This will satisfy the allowlist, leading to cross-domain access. | If a web resource has sensitive information, you need to specify the origin in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Only specify trusted websites that need this resource in this header, with the most secured protocol supported. |

#### Allowed all origins using a wildcard value

| Issue description                                                                                                             | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set as the wildcard value (`*`). This means that the resource can be accessed by any origin. | Make sure that sensitive data isn't available in an unauthenticated way (for example, by using IP address allowlisting). To enable the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive way, configure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header to a restricted set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely. |

### Unencrypted communication

Some websites accept a connection through HTTP and then redirect to HTTPS. In those cases, visitors might first communicate with the non-encrypted version of the site (for example, `www.example.com` or `example.com`) before they're redirected. This creates an opportunity for a [manipulator-in-the-middle attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Manipulator-in-the-middle_attack). The redirect could be exploited to direct visitors to a malicious site instead of the secure version of the original site.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` header is missing or isn't configured correctly. This header informs browsers to access the site using HTTPS and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP will automatically be converted to HTTPS. | Add the [`Strict-Transport-Security`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) header so the browser can remember to access the site using HTTPS, and define the `max-age` property in the header. |

### Cache poisoning

[Cache poisoning attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Cache_Poisoning) exploit [`Cache-Control`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) behavior so that a harmful response is served to users. If a maliciously constructed response is cached, either by a web cache used by multiple users or in the browser cache of a single user, the damage can be magnified.

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The `Cache-Control` header is missing or isn't configured correctly, which means the browser and proxies can cache content. This might be the intended behavior for static assets like CSS, JavaScript, or image files, but you need to review the assets to ensure that sensitive content won't be cached. | For secure content, make sure the `Cache-Control` header is set with `no-cache`, `no-store`, and `must-revalidate`. If an asset needs to be cached, consider setting the directives `public`, `max-age`, and `immutable`. |

### Cross-site request forgery

Cookies aren't sent on typical cross-site subrequests (for example, to load images or frames into a third party site). However, cookies are sent when a user navigates to the origin site (in other words, when they follow a link).

#### Sensitive cookie with improper `SameSite` attribute

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                   | Possible fix                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A cookie with `SameSite` set to `None` isn't using the `Secure` attribute. This means an attacker could access the cookie by simulating a XSS attack on the client. | To prevent a cookie with `SameSite=None` from being accessed by an XSS attack, use the `Secure` attribute. |

## Broken user authentication

If an authentication mechanism is implemented incorrectly, attackers might be able to compromise authentication tokens or exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. When a system's ability to identify the user is compromised, the overall security of an API is compromised.

### Authentication data exposure over unsecured protocol

| Issue description                                                                                                                        | Possible fix                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication credentials can be leaked over an unsecured protocol. An attacker can intercept the request and access these credentials. | Use the `HTTPS` protocol to encrypt the traffic transported on the network. |

### No authentication

| Issue description                                                                                                                 | Possible fix                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No authentication scheme is being used to authenticate the user's identity. An attacker can misuse the API to exploit the system. | Use an authentication strategy (like OAuth, OpenID Connect, API key, or HTTP) to verify the user's identity. |

## Excessive data exposure

Sometimes developers expose all object properties without considering their sensitivity. As they look forward to generic implementations of their API, they rely on clients to perform the data filtering before displaying it.

### Information exposure

Sometimes an API can inadvertently share sensitive information like the location of the file that produced an unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch more attacks on a web application.

Bad actors might provide invalid inputs to the API to get more information about the underlying system that's being used to power the API. If the invalid inputs aren't handled correctly, the API will return the stack trace of the error. The stack trace includes the error origin, packages used in the service, the server's directory path, and information about the technology used to build the API.

#### Stack trace leak

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Possible fix                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The stack trace is exposed in the response body. This might reveal the structure of the application and any internal components it relies on. It might also reveal information like server-side file names and SQL code that the application uses, which means an attacker could fine-tune a later injection attack. | Send the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it specifically to the server. |

#### Sensitive data exposure in response body

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Possible fix                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| The response body looks like it has sensitive information. An attacker could use this information to steal other users' identities or perform fraudulent financial transactions. This also violates payment card industry (PCI) security standards and most organizational compliance policies. | Trim sensitive information from the response. |

### Private IP exposure

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                            | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| There is a private IP address (such as `10.x.x.x`, `172.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`) in the HTTP response body. An attacker could use this information to target internal systems. | Remove the private IP address from the HTTP response body. For comments, use JSP, ASP, or PHP comments instead of HTML or JavaScript comments, which can be seen by client browsers. |

### Information exposure in URL

If information is exposed in a URL, attackers can use it to access sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and API tokens.

#### Information exposure in URL query parameters key

| Issue description                                                                                                      | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This request looks like it has sensitive information in the URL. An attacker could exploit this sensitive information. | Avoid using sensitive information (like API keys, access tokens, auth credentials, usernames, and passwords) in URLs since they can be captured in web server logs. Use body and headers for this information. |

#### Sensitive data exposure in URL

| Issue description                                                                                                      | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

An attacker could exploit this sensitive information. | Avoid using sensitive information (like API keys, access tokens, auth credentials, usernames, and passwords) in URLs since they can be captured in web server logs. Use body and headers for this information. |

## Injection

Injection flaws such as SQL, NoSQL, and [command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) can occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's malicious data can trick the interpreter into running unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

### SQL injection

SQL injection is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for database manipulation to access information that wasn't intended to be displayed. This information might include sensitive information like company data, user lists, or private customer details.

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Possible fix                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The SQL error stack trace is exposed in the response body. This means an attacker could interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. An attacker might also be able to view data that they wouldn't typically be able to retrieve. | SQL injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) instead of string concatenation within a query. |

## Cross-site scripting

Cross-Site scripting ([XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)) attacks are a type of injection in which a malicious script is injected into a trusted website. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, most often a browser-side script, to a different user.

### Sensitive cookie without `HttpOnly` flag

The `HttpOnly` flag is included in a [Set-Cookie HTTP response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie). Use the `HttpOnly` flag when generating a cookie to help mitigate the risk of client-side script accessing the protected cookie.

| Issue description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Possible fix                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| A cookie was set without the `HttpOnly` flag, which means the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If attackers run a malicious script on this page, then they can access the cookie and send it to another site. If this is a session cookie, session hijacking may be possible. | Set the `HttpOnly` flag for all cookies. |

### Sensitive cookie without secure flag

The browser won't send a cookie with the [`Secure` attribute](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/SecureCookieAttribute) set over an unencrypted HTTP request.

By setting the `Secure` attribute, the browser will prevent the transmission of a cookie over an unencrypted channel.

| Issue description                                                                                                           | Possible fix                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A cookie was set without the `Secure` flag. This means an attacker could access the cookie using an unencrypted connection. | If there is sensitive information in a cookie or the cookie is a session token, ensure that it's passed using an encrypted channel and that the `Secure` flag is set. |

### Clickjacking

[Clickjacking](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking) is when an attacker uses transparent layers to trick a user into clicking a button or link on another page when they meant to click the top-level page. Clickjacking is also known as a "UI redress attack." This enables the attacker to hijack clicks meant for one page and route them to another page owned by another application, domain, or both.

# Enforce API governance and security rules for your team in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Configurable API governance rules are available with Postman Enterprise plans. Configurable API security rules are available with Postman Enterprise plans with the API Builder add-on. [Learn more about Postman plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
</Info>

You can customize the API Governance and Security rules that Postman applies to your API specifications and requests. Postman notifies team members if their API specifications and requests violate the configured governance and security rules. This enables team members to keep APIs consistent and secure in your team.

<img alt="API governance dashboard" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-governance-dashboard-v11-46.jpg" />

## Configure governance rules

You can [configure API Governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) that Postman applies to your API specifications in the API Builder and Spec Hub. You can use existing governance rules from the rule library or create custom governance rules. Then you can apply those rules to specific workspaces in your team.

You can also [create custom governance functions](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/) and use them in your custom governance rules that Postman applies to your API specifications in the API Builder and Spec Hub.

## Manage security rules

You can [manage API Security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/) that Postman applies to your requests, and you can also apply existing security rules to them.

## Custom governance rule and function guidelines

Postman supports [Spectral](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/spectral/) for custom governance and security rules and custom governance functions. For more information about using Spectral in Postman, see the following:

* Learn how to [write custom governance and security rules using Spectral](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/spectral/#how-spectral-works) and configure [Spectral rule properties](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/spectral/#spectral-rule-properties).

* Learn how to [write custom governance functions using Spectral](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/spectral/#spectral-custom-functions) and use them in your custom governance rules.


# Configure API Governance rules in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Configurable governance rules are available with [Postman Enterprise plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). If you don't have an Enterprise account, you'll be able to see the API Governance page, but you won't be able to add new rules.
</Info>

You can configure the API Governance rules that Postman applies to your [API specifications](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) in the Postman API Builder and Spec Hub. Follow API Governance rules at the beginning of the [API lifecycle](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-lifecycle/) to keep your APIs consistent without requiring more work later.

Super Admins and API Governance Managers can configure rules and turn them on and off for public workspaces and internal workspaces everyone in your team can access. See [Define roles and permissions within a Postman team](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) for more information.

You can [create](#add-custom-rules) and [edit](#edit-custom-rules) your own custom rules to evaluate your team's APIs. You can also [import existing rules](#add-rules-to-your-api-governance-configuration) into your team's rule library. Then [create a workspace group](#turn-configured-rules-on-and-off) with the workspaces and rules you'd like Postman to apply to your APIs.

<img alt="API governance dashboard" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/api-governance-dashboard-v11.jpg" />

To access the configurable API Governance rules, do the following:

1. Go to the [Postman home screen](https://go.postman.co/).
2. Click **API Governance** in the team information pane.

## Add custom rules

You can create new custom rules that Postman can use to evaluate your API specifications in the API Builder or Spec Hub. Postman provides you with a boilerplate rule to help you start writing your custom rules. You can also use snippets of commonly used property-value pairs to help you write your custom rules.

To add a custom rule, do the following:

1. Go to the [Postman home screen](https://go.postman.co/), and then click **API Governance** in the team information pane.

2. Click **Create Rule**.

3. Define the rule in the editor. It must adhere to [custom Spectral rule guidelines](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/spectral/).

   You can use a curated list of commonly used property-value pair snippets to write your rules. Snippets are available in the right pane of the editor. Selecting a snippet adds the property-value pair automatically to your rule, helping you get started with writing rules. Once added to your rule, you can edit the snippets to meet your specific requirements.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Postman will prompt you with suggestions as you enter text. Select one to autocomplete your rule.

4. Once you import new rules from the library, add the rules to a workspace group to [turn them on](#turn-configured-rules-on-and-off) for the workspaces in the group.

## Turn configured rules on and off

To meet your team's development needs, you can turn individual governance rules on or off for public workspaces and internal workspaces everyone in your team can access. To do so, select the **Workspace Groups** tab. You can create a new group of workspaces to apply individual governance rules to by clicking **Create Group**, or you can select an existing group to update its governance configuration. To apply individual governance rules to all workspaces, select the default **All workspaces** group.

To turn a governance rule on or off for a workspace group, select an existing group, and then click **Edit**. To turn a governance rule on, select the checkbox next to the rule name. To turn a governance rule off, clear the checkbox next to the rule name.

<img alt="Turn individual rules on and off" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-governance-turn-rules-on-off-10.12.0.jpg" />

Once you've made the desired changes, click **Review Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to save them. Your team will only see violations for the governance rules that have been explicitly applied to the workspace the API resides in.

You can view detailed metrics on API Governance rule compliance in your specifications. Learn how to view metrics for specifications in [Spec Hub](/docs/reports/api-governance-specifications-reports/) and [the Postman API Builder](/docs/reports/api-builder-reports/).

# Define custom governance rules using Spectral

Spectral is a linting engine that helps you define custom rules and enforce them on JSON and YAML files. Postman supports Spectral v6 rules for the configurable [API Governance and Security](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/#add-custom-rules) rules for your team. Postman also supports ES6 syntax and CommonJS syntax for custom functions configurable in custom governance rules.

## How Spectral works

Spectral checks that the APIs defined in OpenAPI documents conform to API design guidelines using a specific set of rules. For example, you can use Spectral to check that all properties of all data models are in camel case, or that all operations have a summary.

A Spectral rule targets a given location using a [JSON Path Plus expression](#json-path-and-json-path-plus), then tests the values it finds with a `function`. It returns an error if the values don't conform to the rule.

This example shows how to check that the name of an API doesn't contain the word "API," regardless of case (for instance, "api" or "Api"):

```json
rules:
  api-name-doesnt-contain-api:
    given: $.info.title
    then:
      function: pattern
      functionOptions:
          notMatch: /\b(api)\b/i
```

First, the rule targets the `title` property of the `info` object located at the root (`$`) of the document with the [JSON Path Plus expression](#json-path-and-json-path-plus) `$.info.title`. In `then`, the `function` named `pattern` checks whether the value of the `title` property doesn't match (`functionOptions.notMatch`) the regular expression looking for the word `api` in any case (`/\b(api)\b/i`).

### Rulesets in Spectral documents

A Spectral document (often called a ruleset) has a `rules` property that can have one or more rules. Spectral identifies each rule with a key, which can be any JSON-compatible string.

```json
rules:
    api-name-doesnt-contain-api:
    # ...
    api-name-length:
    # ...
```

## Spectral support in Postman

Postman supports many of Spectral's features, though not all.

Whether it's created within Postman or imported from another source, a Spectral document needs to contain the properties shown in this example:

```json
rules:
  api-name-doesnt-contain-api:
    description: The API name must not contain the word API
    message: The info.title value "{{value}}" contains the forbidden word API
    severity: error
    formats:
      - oas2
      - oas3
    given:
      - $.info
    then:
      - field: title
        function: pattern
        functionOptions:
          notMatch: /\b(api)\b/i
```

To be valid in Postman, your Spectral document can't contain any properties beyond those listed here. For the full list of rules and their descriptions, see [Spectral rule properties](#spectral-rule-properties).

You'll find each rule defined in `rules` in the **Custom Rules** section in the configurable [API Governance](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) page.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Remember to turn on your custom rules after you create or import them.

| `description`          | An optional description of the rule. If you provide one, it will be shown in the configurable rules page for either API Governance or API Security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `message`              | <p>If the rule is triggered, the list of rule violations will contain the `message`, used in Postman as the name of the rule. This message aims to help users solve the problem. Keep it as short and meaningful as possible. It can contain optional placeholders:</p>  <ul><li>`{{error}}` - The error message returned by `function`.</li><li>`{{description}}` - The description of the rule.</li><li>`{{path}}` - The path of the error (the last element is the `property` below).</li><li>`{{property}}` - The name of the property causing the error. This is useful when `given` returns many different property names or when `then` is a list that uses multiple `fields`).</li><li>`{{value}}` - The value causing the error.</li></ul><br /> If `message` isn't provided, the `description` is used instead. And if `description` isn't available, the rule's key (in `rules`) is used.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `severity`             | <p>The severity of the problem detected by the rule. The possible values are `error`, `warn` (default), `info`, and `hint`. These values can be used as follows:</p> <ul><li>`error` - An obvious error that must be fixed. </li><li>`warn` - A possible error. If it's an error, it must be fixed. Some deviation on specific rules may be tolerated, like a `POST` without a body.</li><li>`info` - Something that could possibly be improved. An optional pattern defined in the guidelines could be applied.</li><li>`hint` - Something to be discussed during an API design review.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `resolved`             | <p>Determines whether your OpenAPI document is a resolved or unresolved document when Spectral runs your rule. This affects whether Spectral resolves `$ref` properties when running your rule.</p> <p>A `$ref` property is a reference in the form of a URI that references other components, which can be in your OpenAPI document. In a resolved document, references are replaced with the components each URI points to. In an unresolved document, references aren't replaced. The possible values are `true` (default) and `false`. These values can be used as follows:</p> <ul><li>`true` - The OpenAPI document is a resolved document when Spectral runs your rule. Each reference (`$ref`) is replaced with the component each URI points to, meaning you can't target `$ref` properties.</li><li>`false` - The OpenAPI document is an unresolved document when Spectral runs your rule. Each reference (`$ref`) isn't replaced. This enables you to target the `$ref` property to check its presence and the URI value as a string.</li></ul> |
| `formats`              | <p>The list of document formats to which the rule will be applied. The accepted values are:</p> <ul><li>`oas2` - Targets OpenAPI (Swagger) documents</li><li>`oas3` - Targets OpenAPI 3.x documents (3.0 and 3.1)</li><li>`oas3_0` - Targets OpenAPI 3.0 documents</li><li>`oas3_1` - Targets OpenAPI 3.1 documents</li></ul><br /> By default, a rule will target all versions 2 and 3.x (the default value is `[oas2,oas3]`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `given`                | <p>**Required**. This can be a list with at least one element or a single element. Each value is a [JSON Path Plus expression](#json-path-and-json-path-plus) that may return zero, one, or more elements.</p> <p>If `given` paths don't find any value, the `then` controls won't run. </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `then`                 | **Required**. This can be a list with at least one element or a single element. If the given [JSON Path Plus expressions](#json-path-and-json-path-plus) return values, the functions will be applied to all of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `then.field`           | <p>This optional name can be used if the value returned by the `given` paths is an object to target a specific field inside it. This value must be a name and can't hold a [JSON Path Plus expression](#json-path-and-json-path-plus).</p> <p>The keyword `@key` can be used to check all keys of an object returned by the `given` paths.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `then.function`        | **Required**. The name of the function to use. You can use all Spectral core functions in Postman. For more information about Spectral core functions, see the [Spectral documentation](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/blob/develop/docs/reference/functions.md). [Custom functions](#spectral-custom-functions) are supported in custom API Governance rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `then.functionOptions` | **May be required depending on the function**. The options of the function. You can use all Spectral core functions in Postman.

## JSON Path and JSON Path Plus

A JSON Path (or JSON Path Plus) expression aims to represent the path to some elements in a JSON or YAML document. For example, `$.info.title` represents the `title` property of the `info` object located at the document's root (`$`).

Initially, JSON Path was created to be [XPath for JSON](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) and aimed to represent the path to some element in an XML document. [JSON Path Plus](https://jsonpath-plus.github.io/JSONPath/docs/ts/) is an extension of JSON Path. It adds more operators and makes some behaviors of the original specification explicit.

### Building and testing JSON Path Plus expressions

You can use the official JSON Path Plus [documentation](https://jsonpath-plus.github.io/JSONPath/docs/ts/) to build and test your rules' given paths. [Syntax Through Examples](https://jsonpath-plus.github.io/JSONPath/docs/ts/#syntax-through-examples) and the [JSON Path Plus demo](https://jsonpath-plus.github.io/JSONPath/demo/) are both useful.

### JSON Path Plus examples

These examples show the typical JSON Path Plus features you'll need to create rules in Postman:

* `$.info.title` - The `title` property inside the `info` object, which is located at the document's root (`$`).
* `$.paths.*.*.responses` - All responses of all operations of all `paths`. `*` gets all elements inside an object or an array.
* `$.paths.*[post,patch,put]` - All `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` operations across all `paths`. `[ ]` can be used to filter elements.
* `$..properties` - All `properties` of all schema objects wherever they're located (for example, in parameters, responses, or reusable components). `..` gets all elements in the path tree.

## Check for the presence of a property

In the following example, the rule is supposed to check that there's a description of the API. The way it's written, though, it will never return a rule violation when the `description` isn't present in the `info` object.

```json
# this approach won't work!

rules:
  info-description:
    given: $.info.description
    then:
      function: truthy
```

If the `given` path doesn't find any value, the `then` checks won't run. This means you can't use the path `$.info.description` to check that the API description is defined in the OpenAPI document. This verification must be done using the path `$.info`, which will return the `info` object and the `field`  value set with the name of the field you're looking for (in this example, `description`).

```json
# this approach will work

rules:
  info-description:
    given: $.info
    then:
      field: description
      function: truthy
```

## Spectral custom functions

You can [add custom governance functions](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/) to your custom governance rules that Postman applies to your API specifications in the API Builder and Spec Hub. You can use these guidelines to write custom functions in JavaScript and add them to your custom governance rules. Postman supports ES6 syntax and CommonJS syntax for custom functions.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends using ES6 syntax for your custom functions.
</Info>

Your custom function must have the [`targetVal` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters), the [`message` property](#spectral-function-return-statement-properties) in your return statement, and either the [`export default` declaration (ES6) or `module.exports` object property (CommonJS)](#export-your-custom-function) exporting your function.

To add a custom function to a rule, your rule must have the [`then.function` property](#spectral-rule-properties) whose value is the name of the file containing the custom function. The filename is defined using the **Name** field when you [create a custom function](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/#add-a-custom-function).

### Spectral function parameters

Use the following parameters in your custom functions depending on your use case. You must add parameters to your custom function in the following order: `targetVal`, `options`, then `context`.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can use any parameter names you want. Postman expects the parameters to be in a specific order.
</Info>

| <div>Parameter</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `targetVal`          | <p>**Required**. The first parameter you must add to your function. This can be any data type, such as a string or array. This is the value that the [`given` property](#spectral-rule-properties) returns. The rule tests the value of `targetVal` using your custom function.</p> <p>If you also define a value for the [`then.field` property](#spectral-rule-properties) in your rule, `targetVal` is the value returned by the `given` path appended with `then.field`.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `options`            | <p>The second parameter you can add to your function. This is the optional value of the [`then.functionOptions` property](#spectral-rule-properties). Add this parameter to your function if your function expects options.</p> <p>If your custom function accepts options, Postman recommends adding a [JSON Schema](#json-schema) to your custom function. A JSON Schema enables you to define and validate your custom function's options when editing your rule. This requires you to export your custom function using the [`createRulesetFunction` Spectral function](#createrulesetfunction).</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `context`            | <p>The third parameter you can add to your function. You can use this optional parameter to access properties about the context in which the custom function is called. For example, you can access the `targetVal` path or other locations in the document. These properties are as follows: </p><ul><li>`path` - The path to `targetVal` in the form of an array of strings. For example, `["paths", "/resources", "get", "responses", "306"]`. To learn how to use it, see [Spectral function return statement properties](#spectral-function-return-statement-properties). </li><li>`document` - The document you're attempting to lint.</li><li>`rule` - The rule that's using the function.</li><li>`documentInventory` - Provides access to resolved and unresolved documents, the `$ref` resolution graph, and other advanced properties.</li></ul> |

```js
function myCustomFunction(targetVal, options, context) { ... }
```

### Spectral function return statement properties

Use the following properties to write the return statement in your custom functions depending on your use case.

| <div>Property</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`           | **Required**. The message describing the rule violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `path`              | <p>An optional path to an element in the document that triggers the rule violation. If you use the `path` property, you must add the [`context` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters) to your function. If you don't add the `path` property, the default path is the `targetVal` path.</p> <p>You can add the `path` property when investigating other locations in the document. The path must be an array of strings, such as `["paths", "/resources", "get", "responses", "306"]`.</p> <p>You can also add the `path` property when investigating subelements of the `targetVal` path. Add `...context.path` to the beginning of the path, enabling you to append a path to the `targetVal` path. For example, `[...context.path, "a", "custom", "path"]`.</p> |

```js
return [
  // Rule violation with the default targetVal path
  {
    message: `Value must be different from "${values.join(',')}".`,
  },
  // Rule violation with a custom path leveraging the default targetVal path
  {
    message: `Value must be different from "${values.join(',')}".`,
    path: [...context.path, "a", "custom", "path"]
  },
];
```

### Export your custom function

**Required**. Export your custom function. This enables you to add the custom function's filename to your custom rule using the [`then.function` property](#spectral-rule-properties). The custom function name you export must match the name in the function declaration.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your custom function accepts options, Postman recommends adding a [JSON Schema](#json-schema) to your custom function. A JSON Schema enables you to define and validate your custom function's options when editing your rule. This requires you to export your custom function using the [`createRulesetFunction` Spectral function](#createrulesetfunction).
</Info>

* For ES6 format, use the following syntax: `export default function-name`.
* For CommonJS format, use the following syntax: `module.exports = function-name`.

```js
function myCustomFunction(targetVal, options, context) { ... }

// ES6 syntax
export default myCustomFunction;
// CommonJS syntax
// module.exports = myCustomFunction;
```

### Supported Spectral functions

You can import the following Spectral functions into your custom function file in Postman.

#### createRulesetFunction

The `createRulesetFunction` function is an optional Spectral function you can import from the `@stoplight/spectral-core` module.

Use a [JSON Schema](#json-schema) to define your custom function's options, enabling you to validate whether the [options provided in your rule](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/#add-custom-rules) using `then.functionOptions` match specific criteria. The JSON Schema must be nested inside of a JSON object. If the provided options don't match the JSON Schema, an error message will explain the issue when editing your rule.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If you use ES6 syntax, error messages refer to your custom function as `"<unknown>" function`.
</Info>

Add a JSON Schema for each of the following to your JSON object:

| <div>Key</div> | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input`        | <p>**Required**. Postman expects a key named `input` in the JSON object. This is the JSON Schema that defines the [`targetVal` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters) in your custom function. This JSON Schema enables you to define and validate whether the value of `targetVal` matches specific criteria.</p> <p>If the `targetVal` value doesn't match the `input` JSON Schema, your rule won't call the function. You won't receive an error if the `targetVal` value doesn't match the `input` JSON Schema.</p> <p>Enter the following to skip validation for the `input` JSON Schema: `input: null,`.</p> |
| `options`      | **Required**. Postman expects a key named `options` in the JSON object. This is the JSON Schema that defines the [`options` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters) in your custom function. Options are provided in your rule using the [`then.functionOptions` property](#spectral-rule-properties). This JSON Schema enables you to define and validate whether the values of `options` matches specific criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

```json
  {
    // JSON Schema of the targetVal parameter
    input: {
      type: "string"
    },
    // JSON Schema of the options parameter
    options: {
      type: "object",
      additionalProperties: false,
      properties: {
        values: {
          type: "array"
        }
      },
      required: ["values"],
    },
  },
```

When you [export your custom function](#export-your-custom-function), call the `createRulesetFunction` Spectral function and include a JSON object containing JSON Schemas and the custom function's name as arguments. For a complete example of using a JSON Schema with a custom function, see [Check that a value isn't in a list (JSON Schema)](#check-that-a-value-isnt-in-a-list-json-schema).

* ES6 format:
  * To import, use the following syntax: `import { createRulesetFunction } from "@stoplight/spectral-core";`.
  * To export, use the following syntax: `export default createRulesetFunction(json-object, function-name);`.
* CommonJS format:
  * To import, use the following syntax: `const { createRulesetFunction } = require("@stoplight/spectral-core");`.
  * To export, use the following syntax: `module.exports = createRulesetFunction(json-object, function-name);`.

```js
// ES6 syntax
import { createRulesetFunction } from "@stoplight/spectral-core";
// CommonJS syntax
// const { createRulesetFunction } = require("@stoplight/spectral-core");

function myCustomFunction(targetVal, options, context) { ... }

// ES6 Syntax
export default createRulesetFunction(
// CommonJS Syntax
// module.exports = createRulesetFunction(
  {
    // JSON Schema of the targetVal parameter
    input: {
      type: "string"
    },
    // JSON Schema of the options parameter
    options: {
      type: "object",
      additionalProperties: false,
      properties: {
        values: {
          type: "array"
        }
      },
      required: ["values"],
    },
  },

  myCustomFunction,
);
```

### JSON Schema

JSON Schema specification enables you to describe a JSON document using a standard format.

You can add a JSON Schema that defines and validates your custom function's options. To learn about adding a JSON Schema to your custom function, see the [`createRulesetFunction` Spectral function](#createrulesetfunction).

You can use the [official JSON Schema documentation](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html) to learn more about describing a JSON document using this format.

#### JSON Schema examples

The following examples show JSON Schema key-value pairs you can use to validate your custom function's options:

* `$.options` - The root object that contains the JSON Schema of the [`options` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters), which is your custom function's options.
* `$.options.type` - A validation keyword that defines a constraint on the JSON data. In this example, the value is `object`, meaning the data must be a JSON object.
* `$.options.properties` - An object whose values define the parameter used to pass options to your custom function. In this example, `values` is a variable that stores the value of the [`options` parameter](#spectral-function-parameters).
* `$.options.required` - A validation keyword that's an array of strings containing keys from `$.options.properties`. Add properties to the array if they must be defined in the JSON Schema. In this example, `values` must be defined in the JSON Schema.

```json
  {
    input: {
      type: "string"
    },
    options: {
      type: "object",
      additionalProperties: false,
      properties: {
        values: {
          type: "array"
        }
      },
      required: ["values"],
    },
  },
```

### Check that a value isn't in a list

In the following example, the custom function named `notInEnumeration` is in a file named `not_in_enumeration`. The filename is defined using the **Name** field when you [create a custom function](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/#add-a-custom-function).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If your custom function accepts options, Postman recommends adding a [JSON Schema](#json-schema) to your custom function. A JSON Schema enables you to define and validate your custom function's options when editing your rule. This requires you to export your custom function using the [`createRulesetFunction` Spectral function](#createrulesetfunction).
</Info>

The custom function checks the value of the option `values`, which is defined in the [Spectral document](#rule-that-uses-a-custom-function) (or ruleset) using the [`then.functionOptions` property](#spectral-rule-properties). The value of `values` is a list of numeric strings. If `targetVal` is a value already in the list, the rule violation is triggered.

After the custom function, `export default` or `module.exports` references the custom function's name. This exports the custom function, enabling you to add its filename to your rule using the [`then.function` property](#spectral-rule-properties).

```js
// filename: not_in_enumeration

function notInEnumeration(targetVal, options, context) {
  const { values } = options;
  if (values.includes(targetVal)) {
    return [
      {
        message: `Value must be different from "${values.join(',')}".`,
      },
    ];
  }
}

// ES6 syntax
export default notInEnumeration;
// CommonJS syntax
// module.exports = notInEnumeration;
```

### Check that a value isn't in a list (JSON Schema)

In the following example, the custom function named `notInEnumeration` is in a file named `not_in_enumeration`. The filename is defined using the **Name** field when you [create a custom function](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/#add-a-custom-function).

Before the custom function, the [`createRulesetFunction` Spectral function](#createrulesetfunction) is imported into the file. This enables you to define the expected options in a [JSON Schema](#json-schema) to validate whether the [provided options in your rule](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/#add-custom-rules) match specific criteria.

The custom function checks the value of the option `values`, which is defined in the [Spectral document](#rule-that-uses-a-custom-function) (or ruleset) using the [`then.functionOptions` property](#spectral-rule-properties). The value of `values` is a list of numeric strings. If `targetVal` is a value already in the list, the rule violation is triggered.

After the custom function, `export default` or `module.exports` calls the `createRulesetFunction` Spectral function and includes the following arguments: a JSON object containing JSON Schemas of the `targetVal` parameter and `options` parameter, and the custom function's name. This exports the custom function, enabling you to add its filename to your rule using the [`then.function` property](#spectral-rule-properties).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Learn more about the [JSON Schemas used in this example](#json-schema-examples).
</Info>

```js
// filename: not_in_enumeration

// ES6 Syntax
import { createRulesetFunction } from "@stoplight/spectral-core";
// CommonJS Syntax
// const { createRulesetFunction } = require("@stoplight/spectral-core");

function notInEnumeration(targetVal, options, context) {
  const { values } = options;
  if (values.includes(targetVal)) {
    return [
      {
        message: `Value must be different from "${values.join(',')}".`,
      },
    ];
  }
}

// ES6 Syntax
export default createRulesetFunction(
// CommonJS Syntax
// module.exports = createRulesetFunction(
  {
    // JSON Schema of the targetVal parameter
    input: {
      type: "string"
    },
    // JSON Schema of the options parameter
    options: {
      type: "object",
      additionalProperties: false,
      properties: {
        values: {
          type: "array"
        }
      },
      required: ["values"],
    },
  },

  notInEnumeration,
);
```

### Rule that uses a custom function

In the following example, the Spectral document has a rule named `http-status-obsolete` that uses a custom function file named `not_in_enumeration`, which is defined using the **Name** field when you [create a custom function](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-custom-governance-functions/#add-a-custom-function). The custom function file has a custom function named `notInEnumeration`. The custom function filename is added to the rule using the [`then.function` property](#spectral-rule-properties).

The custom function accepts options using the [`then.functionOptions` property](#spectral-rule-properties), defining a property named `values` that's a list of numeric strings. The value of `then.functionOptions.values` is passed to the custom function `notInEnumeration`. The custom function then checks whether a rule violation occurred at the `given` path appended with the value of the [`then.field` property](#spectral-rule-properties).

```yaml
rules:
  http-status-obsolete:
    formats: [oas2, oas3]
    severity: warn
    message: "{{property}} is an obsolete or unused HTTP status code"
    given: $.paths.*.*.responses
    then:
      field: "@key"
      function: not_in_enumeration
      functionOptions:
        values: ["306","418","510"]
```


# View reports on usage, security, and billing in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [**Reports are available with all Postman Enterprise plans. The Public workspace metrics report is available with all Postman plans.**](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)
</Info>

Postman generates reports that enable you to visualize data for how your team uses Postman. These reports provide insight into the state of your APIs, including tests, documentation, and monitoring coverage. They also enable you to track performance and SLA adherence.

You can access reports in your [Postman reports dashboard](https://go.postman.co/reports/overview).

<img alt="The Postman reports dashboard" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/dashboard-reports-overview-v11-56.jpg" />

## Getting started with reports

Reports give information about various aspects of your team and plan, including [member](/docs/reports/members-overview-reports/), [team](/docs/reports/internal-workspaces-reports/) and [content](/docs/reports/content-activity-reports/) activity, [API security](/docs/reports/api-security-reports/), and [billing and overage](/docs/reports/billing-overview-reports/) information.

To view your reports dashboard, click **Home** in the Postman header. Then, click **Reports** in the team information section on the left.

To access a specific API's report, do the following:

1. On the report dashboard, select **Content activity > View report by API**.
2. Search for the API name, or scroll through the list to find it.

### Report availability

Postman generates reports periodically but not in real time. You might experience a delay of four to six hours before report data is available. Postman displays the last update time at the bottom of the report dashboard sidebar.

### Report permissions

In a report, your level of access in the relevant collections, APIs, elements, mock servers, and monitors determines what data is available to you. For more information about element-based roles, see [Define roles and permissions within a Postman team](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#element-based-roles).

If you don't have permission to access an element, visualizations still display the total number of elements. However, the visualizations won't provide you with the element name or other relevant information for the specific element.

<img alt="Report message that restricted data is hidden" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/reports-restricted-data-v11-1.jpg" width="540px" />

## Exploring reports and report data

To explore reports, select items in the report dashboard sidebar. Some report items have a link that opens another related report.

To explore data in a report, hover over a data point to show the data point's value. Then, click a data point to drill down and view more details. Sort the table by clicking a column heading. Hover over a table row and click the arrow to go to a related report or element.

## Troubleshooting

Reports have the following limitations:

* You can't download or export your reports.
* You can't view the details of elements you don't have access to.

If there isn't any data in your reports or the data is incomplete (for example, you have empty response times or sizes) this may be because:

* The data hasn't refreshed yet. Check after four to six hours.
* You might not have linked a collection to your API.
* You might not have sent a request. Or you might have run requests from [monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/), [collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/), but not from the request builder in Postman.
* Postman isn't syncing. Check your network connection and visit the [Postman Status Page](https://status.postman.com) to learn whether there's an outage.

Postman enables teams to integrate with various third-party services and platforms. The number of concurrent integrations a team can have is limited, based on their plan type. Enterprise teams have a limit of 100 concurrent integrations. Once a team reaches this limit, they can contact Postman Sales to discuss further modifications.

- **Postman API** - A historical view of the team's Postman API call limit and the usage on a monthly basis. The Postman API enables users to programmatically access data stored in their Postman account, using command-line interfaces (CLI) or automation flows. Teams have a limited number of calls they can make to the Postman API based on their plan. Enterprise teams have a limit of 1 million API calls per month.

* **Custom Domains** - The team's limit on custom domains and usage over time. Custom domains enable teams to host published API documentation on their own domain. The number of custom domains a team can have is limited by their plan.
* **Cloud Agent requests** - The team's limits and consumption of [Cloud Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#postman-cloud-agent) requests over time. The Postman Cloud Agent enables teams to bypass browser limitations by routing API requests through Postman's cloud servers. Teams have plan-based limits on the number of requests they can run with the Postman Cloud Agent.


# View reports about API rule compliance in the Postman API Builder

<Info class="iconless-callout">

# Intro to SSO

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  SSO is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Single sign-on (SSO) services enable you to manage your organization or team's identity across all the SaaS products that you use.

With an SSO service, a user can access multiple applications using one set of credentials (for example, an email address and password). The SSO service authenticates the user once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

An example of SSO is Google's sign-in implementation for products like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Drive. Any user who is signed in to one of Google's products is automatically signed in to their other products as well.

## What are the advantages of SSO?

* Removes the need for users to remember and manage multiple passwords.
* Simplifies users' experience by enabling them to sign in at a single access point and work seamlessly across multiple applications.
* Increases productivity by reducing the password-related support emails.
* Reduces phishing attempts that try to trick users into giving away sensitive information.

## Prerequisites for SSO with Postman

* Team's identity provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.

## Supported IdPs

* [Microsoft AD FS](/docs/administration/sso/microsoft-adfs/)
* [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/administration/sso/azure-ad/)
* [Custom SAML](/docs/administration/sso/custom-saml/)
* [Duo](/docs/administration/sso/duo/)
* [Google Workspace](/docs/administration/sso/google-workspace/)
* [Okta](/docs/administration/sso/okta/)
* [OneLogin](/docs/administration/sso/onelogin/)
* [Ping Identity](/docs/administration/sso/ping-identity/)

## SSO setup for SAML 2.0 compliant IdPs

Most SAML 2.0 compliant identity providers require the same information about the service provider for setup (Postman is the service provider). These values are specific to a Postman organization or team and are available while [configuring SSO](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/).

<Note title="Note">
  * While configuring your IdP, set your users' email addresses in SAML attributes and claims. Postman expects to receive an email address from your IdP to identify each user.
  * If you configure SSO, Postman Password, Google OAuth 2.0, and GitHub authentication methods remain enabled for your organization or team. You can turn off these authentication methods to allow your members to sign in using SSO only.
</Note>

# Configure SSO

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  SSO is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Single sign-on (SSO) for Postman is configured by an [Organization Manager or Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). To configure SSO, add an authentication method, and then configure the identity provider (IdP) details.

To learn more about the user experience, see [Signing in to SSO](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/).

## Configure single sign-on

To begin adding an authentication method, do the following:

1. Go to [Organization or team settings](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams/edit), then click **Authentication**.
2. Click **Add Authentication Method**.
3. Select the authentication type.
4. Enter an authentication name that's identifiable to your organization or team.
5. Click **Continue** to [configure the IdP details](#configure-the-idp-details).

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/add-auth-method-v10.jpg" alt="Authentication Method" />

   <Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
     Always check with your authentication provider dashboard or your IT support staff for the correct information to configure SSO.
   </Warning>

### Configure the IdP details

After [adding the authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on), you can configure the IdP details.

<Note title="Note">
  To configure the IdP details later, click **Configure Later**. When you're ready to continue configuring the IdP details, see [Editing SSO settings](#edit-sso-settings).
</Note>

In the **Service provider details (Postman)** section, the **Entity ID**, **Login URL**, and **ACS URL** are already populated.

Fill in the **Identity provider details** section. From your IdP account, enter your **SSO URL**, **Identity provider issuer**, and **X.509 Certificate**. Instead, you can upload a metadata file to configure the IdP details in one step.

<img alt="Configure identity provider details in Postman" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/configure-identity-provider-details-v11.75.png" />

To enter details in the **Identity provider details** section, you must sign in to your IdP account and get the details. Refer to the corresponding section of the documentation and follow the outlined procedure there:

* [Microsoft AD FS](/docs/administration/sso/microsoft-adfs/)

* [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/administration/sso/azure-ad/)

* [Custom SAML](/docs/administration/sso/custom-saml/)

* [Duo](/docs/administration/sso/duo/)

* [Google Workspace](/docs/administration/sso/google-workspace/)

* [Okta](/docs/administration/sso/okta/)

* [OneLogin](/docs/administration/sso/onelogin/)

* [Ping Identity](/docs/administration/sso/ping-identity/)

Optionally, you can select the [**Automatically add new users**](#automatically-add-new-users) checkbox if you want users to automatically join your organization or team. The first time users sign in to Postman using this authentication method they will automatically join the organization or team.

## Edit SSO settings

After configuring the [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) for Postman, you can select the **Status** toggle to turn it on or off. This is a team-level option, so this setting applies to the whole organization or team.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/admin-sso-turn-on-auth-method-v9.jpg" />

To update the settings for an authentication method, click **Edit**, then click **Continue**.

To delete an authentication method, click **Edit**, then click **Delete**.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/edit-auth-method-v10.jpg" />

## Create user accounts

The first time a new Postman user [signs in to Postman using the authentication method](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/), a Postman account is created, and the user is automatically added to the team if the following is true: the team has seats available and the **Automatically add new users** checkbox was selected during [authentication method configuration](#configure-single-sign-on).

The user is automatically associated to the organization or team with a [Developer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and has access to team resources.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If the required conditions aren't met to automatically join the organization or team, all Admins will receive your request to join.
</Info>

## Add existing user accounts

The first time an existing Postman user [signs in to Postman using the authentication method](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/), the user is automatically added to the organization or team if one of the following is true:

* The organization or team has available seats and the **Automatically add new users** checkbox was selected during [authentication method configuration](#configure-single-sign-on).
* An Admin has [invited the user](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/) to join.

The user will be automatically associated to the organization or team with a [Developer role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and have access to organization or team resources.

<Note title="Note">
  If the required conditions aren't met to automatically join the organization or team, all Admins will receive your request to join.
</Note>

## Automatically add new users

The **Automatically add new users** checkbox in your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) determines whether users with accounts in your IdP can automatically join your organization or team. [Sign in to Postman using the authentication method](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/) to automatically join.

<Note title="Note">
  **Automatically add new users** will only work if your organization or team has user seats available. Your organization or team size won't automatically increase if more users sign in with SSO.
</Note>

## Manage team sign-ins

By default, Postman only supports Service Provider (Postman)-initiated sign-ins for Postman [Enterprise](https://www.postman.com/pricing/). Your users must [sign in to Postman using the authentication method](/docs/administration/sso/user-sso/). If you require users to sign in using an IdP-initiated sign-in from your SSO portal, you can generate and copy the **Relay state** from your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on), and then save it in your IdP configuration. This ensures an extra level of security when the sign-in process is initiated through a source unknown to Postman.

## Remove access

You must remove users from your Postman to prevent access to shared resources. When you remove a user from Postman, you'll still retain access to any data they have shared. You'll also be able to reassign their workspaces and the data within them to remaining members in some situations. To learn more, see [Removing members](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/scale-team/#remove-members).

## Signing and encryption certificates

As an extra level of security, Postman provides optional SAML signing and encryption certificates. These certificates aren't supported by all IdPs nor are they required in a typical Postman SAML SSO configuration. However, for organizations or teams with stricter security requirements, these certificates may be valuable options to implement.

### Signing certificate

The signing certificate is an X.509 certificate used by Postman, the Service Provider (SP), to digitally sign SAML assertions sent to the Identity Provider (IdP). Signing ensures the authenticity and integrity of the SAML data by allowing the recipient (IdP) to verify that the message hasn't been tampered with and comes from the expected sender.

To enable the signing certificate, do the following:

1. In Postman’s [SAML SSO](#configure-single-sign-on) settings, select the **Sign SAML Requests** box.
2. Download the public certificate from Postman.
3. Upload the public certificate to your IdP, and select to require signature verification. For verification steps, refer to your IdP documentation.

<Warning title="Warning">
  If you configure your IdP to require signature validation, and then turn off SAML signing in Postman, you may break your SSO integration. The IdP will expect a signature but Postman won’t send it.
</Warning>

### Encryption certificate

The encryption certificate is an X.509 certificate used by the IdP to encrypt the SAML assertions (such as user attributes). The recipient of the SAML response, Postman (the SP), uses a stored private key to decrypt the encrypted SAML response assertions. Encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can read the protected information, providing confidentiality during transmission.

To enable the encryption certificate, do the following:

1. In Postman’s [SAML SSO](#configure-single-sign-on) settings, download the encryption certificate.
2. Upload the public certificate to your IdP for encrypting. For encryption steps, refer to your IdP documentation.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can rotate the encryption and signing certificates at your own convenience. Click **Generate New Encryption and Signing Certificates**, then download them for encryption and signature verification. Upload the new certificate to your IdP immediately, to avoid authentication failures.
</Tip>

## Troubleshoot SSO issues

Learn more about common SSO issues and how to troubleshoot them.

If you experience an error after signing in to Postman using SSO, check the type of error and these possible solutions:

* **Your IdP returns a 404 error.** Make sure the **SSO URL** is correctly copied from your IdP to your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) in Postman.
* **Postman returns a 500 error.** Make sure the **X.509 Certificate** is correctly copied from your IdP to your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) in Postman.
* **Postman returns a 404 error.** Make sure the values in the **Service provider details (Postman)** section are correctly copied from your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) in Postman to your IdP.
* **Postman returns a page explaining that the sign-in request expired.** Make sure the **Relay state** is correctly copied from your [authentication method](#configure-single-sign-on) in Postman to your IdP.

For more common SSO issues, see the following:

* **An email address isn't associated with your team members.** In your IdP configuration settings, make sure the username format is set to **Email**.

# SSO and SCIM FAQs

The following are frequently asked questions about configuring and using [single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/) and [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) in Postman.

## Does enabling SSO for one team impact other teams that aren't on SSO?

SSO configuration is specific to each Postman team. An organization can have multiple Postman teams, each with different (or the same) auth methods configured and enabled. However, this isn't the case for [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/). Domain capture consolidates all of the Postman user accounts within your organization into one team.

## When provisioning a user, which data is mapped from the IdP to Postman?

In provisioning, email is the primary attribute used for user mapping. The user's first name, last name, and active status fields must be included in the provisioning request. The first name and last name fields can be left blank if necessary. Therefore, the email, first name and last name, and active status (activation or deactivation) are the key attributes employed for setting up a new account in Postman.

## How does enabling SSO and SCIM impact existing users?

If users were part of a team before enabling SSO and SCIM, and they're not supposed to have access by SSO and SCIM, they will still be on the team and need to be manually removed if they're no longer needed.

Users who were active before the SCIM implementation, including those who are meant to have access by SSO and SCIM, will be managed by SCIM as long as their email address is correctly mapped to an identity provider (IdP). Their email address needs to be the same in both Postman and the IdP.

## What is SSO JIT provisioning?

SSO Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning allows a user to provision themselves to the Postman team by signing in to the team using the SSO IdP. Thus, JIT provisioning automatically adds users to the team without an invite or approval, if enabled. They can sign in by the IdP only if they’re permitted to do so using the IdP.

If JIT isn't enabled, users will receive an error message and will need an invitation to join the team. It's recommended to have JIT provisioning enabled for smooth user onboarding. For a team with domain capture turned on, JIT behaves similarly.

## Can I test my SSO setup without disrupting user workflows?

To conduct testing without disrupting user workflows, a team can set up an authentication method for testing. This practice is commonly used, especially during IdP migrations.

There are two recommended approaches for testing:

* Maintain the email and password authentication method alongside proper SSO and user sign in. After verification, turn off any other authentication methods.
* Temporarily label the authentication method as **Test** and notify users about the testing strategy, available authentication methods, transition dates, and more.

## If an IdP (such as Okta) goes down, is there a way to bypass SSO so users can continue their access?

Yes, admins can toggle the authentication methods they want to turn on or off.

If a user and account were created with JIT provisioning from their IdP (while Postman Auth was inactive), that user would need to go through the Forgot Password flow to update (populate) their Postman password.

## What's the difference between temporarily deactivating a user with SCIM and removal from the team?

### Temporary deactivation

Deprovisioning, or temporary deactivation, removes a user from your Postman team and blocks the account from authenticating into Postman. The major use case of SCIM deprovisioning is to provide a mechanism for the customer to manage the seats effectively between team members. You can deprovision a user account with the IdP integrated with SCIM. The SCIM deprovisioning will be triggered by removing the Postman SCIM application from the IdP for a user. While the deprovisioned user won't be able to reuse the same enterprise context to sign in, they will have another context provided where they can sign in with a Postman username and password.

Deactivation results in the following impact on workspace visibility:

* Internal Workspace: If the user is the only member of an internal workspace and is deactivated, the workspace visibility will stay with the team, and the team will be the new workspace admin. If other users associated with the internal workspace have the Viewer or Editor roles, they won't be promoted.
* Public Workspace: If the user is the only member of a public workspace and the user is deactivated, the workspace type will remain public, and the team will be the new workspace admin. If other users associated with the public workspace have Viewer or Editor roles, they won't be promoted.
* Partner Workspace: If the user is the only member of a Partner Workspace and is deactivated, the workspace type will continue to be partner, and the team will be the new workspace admin. If other users associated with the Partner Workspace have Viewer or Editor roles, they won't be promoted.

Upon reactivation, the user regains access to their workspaces within the team, but access to any shared resources (Private/Team/Public/Partner Workspace) isn't restored. For example, for Private and Partner Workspaces, if they were previously an Admin or editor, after reactivation, they won't regain the same access. Since Private and Partner Workspaces aren't available to other team members, they'll no longer have read access to them. For other workspaces such as Public and internal workspaces, they'll have the same access to the resources as other team members.

### Removal from team

The user removal flow will remove the user from the team by removing access to all team-level workspaces. The user must assign their workspaces to any existing team admins. Removal of a user account is done through Postman. The deleted user can't sign in to the same team. However, they have a different context for signing in with a Postman username and password.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Unlike the SCIM flow, re-adding a user to the team doesn’t restore their read access to internal workspaces or any other access to their workspaces.
</Info>

## How do IdP groups and licenses work with SCIM provisioning?

SCIM provisioning works until all seats are filled. If Auto-Flex or True-up is enabled, more users can be added beyond the initial license count. In the case of group provisioning, the users associated with the group need to be provisioned prior. Otherwise, group provisioning will fail.

Instead, teams are recommended to verify the email domains, which will automatically provision users of the same domain name to the team without any user interaction.


# Microsoft AD FS

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[SSO with Microsoft AD FS is available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

To configure SSO with [Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview) (AD FS), you can use your Microsoft AD FS server. You must be an administrator in both Microsoft AD FS and Postman to configure SSO for your team.

Before you configure SSO with Microsoft AD FS, you must create the following:

* An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
* An SSL certificate from the Microsoft AD FS server.

# SCIM provisioning overview

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Provisioning with SCIM is available with Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Postman supports [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), enabling you to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning. With this feature, you can efficiently deploy Postman at scale across your organization and control access to it with your identity provider (IdP). You can enable SCIM provisioning with the [SCIM API](#configuring-scim-with-the-scim-api), [Okta](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-okta/), [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-azure-ad/), or [OneLogin](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/configuring-scim-with-onelogin/).

You must be a [Postman Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable SCIM for your team. A SCIM key that belongs to an Admin can be used to provision and de-provision users through SCIM. However, the SCIM key that belongs to an Admin can't be used to de-provision a Super Admin. Also, account email updates only work if the SCIM key belongs to a user with the Super Admin role.

To ensure complete functionality, you can assign the SCIM key to a user with the Super Admin role. Alternatively, you can create a service account and assign it to the Super Admin role, avoiding the risk of service disruption in case a team member leaves the company. Learn more about [assigning the Super Admin role to a service account](/docs/administration/enterprise/enterprise-onboarding/#the-super-admin-role).

With SCIM enabled, users won't have the option to leave your team on their own, and won't be able to change their account email or password. Only Admins, Organization Managers, and Super Admins have permission to remove team members. Only IdP administrators have permission to use SCIM to change user account emails if they're associated with your team's verified domain.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  With [domain verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/), you can do the following:

  * Onboard users faster, by not requiring the [account linking](/docs/getting-started/account/manage/#link-your-account-to-postman) step.
  * Update users' emails using SCIM if the user account email domain matches a domain your team verified.
</Info>

## SCIM features

Postman supports the following provisioning features:

* **Create user** - Creates a new user account in Postman, adds the account to your organization's Postman team, and activates authentication for the user if their email ID isn't attached to an existing Postman account. If a Postman account with the same email ID exists and it's associated with your team's verified domain, the user is automatically added to your team. If a Postman account with the same email ID exists, and it's not associated with a verified domain, an email invite to join your Postman team is sent to the user. Once the user accepts the invite, they'll be added to your team.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    The newly added user will have the Developer role in Postman by default. You can later [update account roles in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/manage-roles/).
  </Info>

* **Update user information**

  * **Update user attributes** - Updates a user's first and last name in Postman.

  * **Activate user** - Creates a new user on your Postman team, if one doesn't already exist, and activates the user to authenticate into your Postman team.

  * **Deactivate user** - Removes a user from your Postman team and deactivates their account, blocking the account from authenticating into Postman.

    <Info class="iconless-callout">
      User accounts and the data corresponding to them won't be deleted.
    </Info>

  * **Reactivate user** - Reactivates an existing deactivated user by unblocking the account's authentication into Postman and adds the account back to your Postman team.

* **Create group** - Creates a new [user group](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) in Postman. When you assign the Postman app to a group, Postman creates a new account for each user, adds each account to your organization's Postman team, and activates authentication for each user. If an existing Postman account uses an email that matches a user's email ID, an [email invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-members/invite-members/#manage-invites) to join your Postman team is sent to that user. Once the user accepts the invite, they'll be added to your team.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    Newly created groups will have the Developer role in Postman by default. You can later [update group roles in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#editing-team-roles-for-a-group) and [control a group's access to workspaces and individual Postman elements](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#managing-roles-on-workspaces-and-postman-elements), such as collections and APIs.
  </Info>

* **Delete group** - Deletes a user group in Postman. User accounts that were part of the deleted group are deactivated in Postman.

  <Info class="iconless-callout">
    User accounts and the data corresponding to them won't be deleted.
  </Info>

* **Update group information**

  * **Update group attributes** - Updates a group's name in Postman.

  * **Update group members** - Adds or removes users from a group in Postman.

* **Set user roles** - Use SCIM to assign roles to users by [creating a user group](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#creating-a-group) in Postman, then assigning roles to the group. When you add users to the group using SCIM, users will get the roles assigned to the group. Learn how to [update team roles for groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#editing-team-roles-for-a-group), and [update workspace and elements roles for groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/#managing-roles-on-workspaces-and-postman-elements).

Postman doesn't support the following provisioning features:

* Push groups from Postman to your IdP
* Push or sync password updates
* Push user attribute updates from your IdP to Postman other than name
* Pull user attribute updates from Postman to your IdP

## Enabling SCIM provisioning

You must [configure SSO in Postman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) before you can enable SCIM for your Postman team.

# Configure SCIM with Microsoft Entra ID

Postman supports [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning through [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/) (formerly Azure Active Directory), allowing you to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning.

You must be a [Postman Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable SCIM for your team. If you have Postman Organizations enabled, then you must be an [Organization Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles). It's recommended that you enable SCIM with a [service account assigned the Super Admin role](/docs/administration/enterprise/enterprise-onboarding/#the-super-admin-role) or the Organization Manager role.

With SCIM enabled, users won't have the option to leave your team on their own, and won't be able to change their account email or password. Only Admins, Super Admins, and Organization Managers have permission to remove team members. Only administrators in Microsoft Entra ID have permission to use SCIM to change user account emails if they're associated with a domain your team [verified](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/).

## Enabling SCIM in Microsoft Entra ID

Postman is available as an app in the Microsoft Entra application gallery. Once connected, Microsoft Entra ID queries the Postman SCIM endpoint every 40 minutes for assigned users, and creates or modifies them according to the assignment details you set.

To set up provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID, do the following:

1. In Postman, [enable SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-in-postman) and [generate a SCIM API key](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#generating-scim-api-key).
2. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra ID portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
3. Click **Applications**, then select **Enterprise applications** in the left pane.
4. Select the Postman app if you've already configured [SSO with Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/administration/sso/azure-ad/). Otherwise, click **+ New application**, search for "Postman", select the Postman app from the results, then click **Create**.
5. In the app management screen, select **Provisioning** in the left pane.
6. In the **Provisioning Mode** menu, click **Automatic**.
7. In the **Tenant URL** field, enter the Postman SCIM endpoint: `https://api.getpostman.com/scim/v2/`.
   <Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
     If you're using the EU Data Residency plan, enter `https://api.eu.postman.com/scim/v2`.
   </Warning>
8. In the **Secret Token** field, enter your SCIM API key.
9. Click **Test Connection** to have Microsoft Entra ID attempt to connect to the Postman SCIM endpoint. An error message displays if the attempt fails. If the attempt is successful, the response is `HTTP 200 OK` with an empty SCIM `ListResponse` message.
10. Click **Save** to save the admin credentials.

Next, you will configure the Microsoft Entra ID integration.

## Configuring the Microsoft Entra ID SCIM integration

After you set up SCIM in Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the integration with Postman for users. Optionally, you can also configure the integration for groups.

The attributes you select as **Attribute Mappings** are used to match the users or groups in Postman for update operations.

### Mapping user attributes

To map Postman user attributes to Microsoft Entra ID user attributes, do the following:

1. In the Microsoft Entra ID **Mappings** section, click **Yes** to turn on **Provision Azure Active Directory Users**. This is the set of attribute mappings for user objects.

2. Under **Target Object Actions**, click **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

3. Under **Attribute Mappings**, click **Add New Mapping** to map the following attributes:

   | Microsoft Entra ID attribute | Target attribute  | Postman attribute | Mapping type | Match objects using this attribute | Apply this mapping |
   | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
   | `user.email` \*              | `userName`        | `email`           | Direct       | Yes                                | Always             |
   | `surname`                    | `name.familyName` | `name`            | Direct       | No                                 | Always             |
   | `givenName`                  | `name.givenName`  | `name`            | Direct       | No                                 | Always             |
   | `Not([IsSoftDeleted])`       | `active`          | `active`          | Expression   | No                                 | Always             |

   \* For `user.email`, set the value for **Matching precedence** to `1`.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     **Notes**:

     * To avoid creating duplicate accounts, ensure that the SAML and SCIM values used for `user.email` match.
     * You must remove any existing attribute mappings that aren't on this list to avoid any conflicts or mismatches. Click **Delete** next to any mappings that aren't on this list to remove them.
   </Info>

4. Click **Save**.

### Mapping group attributes (Optional)

# Configure SCIM with OneLogin

Postman supports [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning through [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) with the Postman OneLogin app, enabling you to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning.

You must be an administrator in OneLogin, and a [Postman Admin or Super Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable SCIM. It's recommended that you enable SCIM with a [service account assigned the Super Admin role](/docs/administration/enterprise/enterprise-onboarding/#the-super-admin-role).

With SCIM enabled, users won't have the option to leave your teams on their own, and won't be able to change their account email or password. Only Admins, Super Admins, and Organization Managers have permission to remove members. Only administrators in OneLogin have permission to use SCIM to change user account emails if they're associated with a [verified domain](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/).

Postman is available as an app in OneLogin, allowing you to enable user provisioning along with SSO. Before enabling SCIM, you must [configure SSO with OneLogin](/docs/administration/sso/onelogin/).

## Enable SCIM in OneLogin

To set up provisioning with OneLogin, do the following:

1. [Enable SCIM in Postman](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#enabling-scim-in-postman) and [generate a SCIM API key](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#generating-scim-api-key).

2. In OneLogin, go to the Postman app and click **Configuration**.

3. In the **API Connection** section, paste the generated SCIM API key in the **SCIM Bearer Token** text box, then click **Enable**.

   <img alt="OneLogin configuration API connection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/onelogin-api-connection.jpg" />

4. In Postman, click **Save**.

## Configure the OneLogin SCIM integration

Postman supports the provisioning features detailed in the [SCIM provisioning overview](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#scim-features). To configure provisioning, go to the Postman app in OneLogin and click **Provisioning**, then **Enable provisioning**.

<img alt="OneLogin provisioning workflow" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/onelogin-provisioning-workflow.jpg" />

Select features to enable them, or clear them to turn them off.

You can also define what happens when users are deleted in OneLogin, their Postman app access is removed, or their accounts are suspended. You can choose to **Suspend** these users' Postman accounts or **Do Nothing**. If you choose to **Suspend**, the affected accounts no longer appear in your [Postman organization or team dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/members). Regardless of your choice, users who are deleted, suspended, or have their app access removed will no longer be able to sign in to their Postman account.

Click **Save** to save your changes.


# Configure domain verification and account capture in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Domain verification is available with Postman Enterprise plans. Domain capture is available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Domain verification and domain capture let you improve your organization's onboarding experience and simplify team management. With these features, Admins can instantly give people access to the teams and resources they need to collaborate in Postman.

[Domain verification](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/) enables Postman to trust your organization. When you verify your organization's domain, Admins can add users from that domain to relevant teams. Domain verification is one of the [prerequisites for enabling domain capture](#prerequisites-for-domain-capture).

[Domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/) consolidates all the Postman user accounts that exist within your organization into one team. When you enable it, any accounts associated with the verified internet domain or subdomain will only be able to use Postman within your team. Moving forward, any Postman users who sign up for a new account with the relevant domain will be automatically added to your team as new members.

## Benefits of enabling domain capture

Domain capture benefits both administrators and developers in the following ways:

* **Administrators** - Domain capture consolidates all of the Postman user accounts within your organization into one Postman Enterprise team. This lets you use a single dashboard to maintain compliance and security across your organization. Domain capture ensures there's no unauthorized usage within your organization. It also ensures that all Postman users associated with your domain are directed to your organization's official team.

* **Developers** - As users authenticate into Postman with your verified domain, domain capture automatically directs users to your organization's official team. This ensures that new teammates are instantly provided all the resources they'll need to be successful contributors.

## Prerequisites for domain capture

You must be a [Postman Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable domain capture for your team. In addition, your team must:

* Be on a [Postman Enterprise plan with the Advanced Security Administration add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
* Use [Postman version 9 or later](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/).
* Have [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) configured and enabled. Alternative authentication methods (Postman, Google, or GitHub sign in) must be turned off.
* [Add and verify a domain or subdomain](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/).

It's recommended that you enable [SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) to ease the process of onboarding new users. [Auto-Flex](/docs/billing/billing/#using-auto-flex) is also recommended to ensure your team can automatically accommodate all users that may be added to your Postman team when domain capture is enabled.

## Set up domain capture

To set up domain capture, do the following:

1. Complete the [prerequisites](#prerequisites-for-domain-capture) for enabling domain capture, including [adding and verifying a domain](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/).
2. [Enable domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/).

For more information on domain verification and account capture, see [Domain capture FAQs](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-faqs/).


# Verify your organization's domain in Postman

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Domain verification is available with **[Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

As an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can add and verify a domain or subdomain. This enables Postman to implicitly trust your organization. Domain verification is one of the [prerequisites for enabling domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/#prerequisites-for-domain-capture).

When you verify your organization's domain, Admins can add users that belong to that domain. Postman won't require users to accept an invite to join your teams. This lets you instantly provide new teammates with all the resources they'll need to be successful contributors.

Without a verified domain, individual accounts that you invite to your team are given the option to join or dismiss the invite. If they choose to join, they're also required to reauthenticate prior to accessing the team.

# Domain capture FAQs

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **[Domain verification is available with Postman Enterprise plans. Domain capture is available with Postman Enterprise plans with the Advanced Security Administration add-on.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**
</Info>

Following are frequently asked questions about [domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) in Postman.

## What happens to captured users and their data when domain capture is enabled?

The experience for captured users and their data (collections, environments) depends on their prior team status:

* If a captured user is already on your organization's team and isn't a member of any other teams, nothing changes for them.
* If a captured user is a member of [multiple teams](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team), including your organization's team, they're no longer able to authenticate into any other teams they're a member of.
* If a captured user isn't part of any team:
  * All existing user sessions are revoked.
  * The next time the user logs in, they're prompted to join your organization's team using SSO.
  * When the user authenticates into your organization's team using SSO, their existing data is transferred to the team.
* If a captured user is part of an existing free or paid team:
  * They're removed from their existing team.
  * All existing user sessions are revoked.
  * They lose access to all data from their earlier teams, including their own workspaces. No data is transferred from their earlier teams to their new team.
    <Info class="iconless-callout">

  * All existing user sessions are revoked.
  * The next time the user logs in, they're prompted to leave their existing team.
  * Users can authenticate into your organization's team using SSO.

## Can an Admin view the list of unclaimed user accounts before enabling domain capture?

Yes, an Admin on a [Postman Enterprise plan with the Advanced Security Administration add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can view the list of the unclaimed Postman accounts before enabling domain capture. To learn more, see [View unclaimed accounts](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/#view-unclaimed-accounts).

## Does adding a domain automatically add all verified domain users to the organization's team?

No, after an Admin adds and verifies a domain and completes the [prerequisites for enabling domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/#prerequisites-for-domain-capture), they can create a request to enable domain capture. Postman support will then contact Admins to explain the effects of enabling domain capture. To learn more, see [Enable domain capture in Postman](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/).

## How do I delete a domain?

# Postman security features

Data security is a shared responsibility between Postman and its users. Postman maintains compliance with global industry security standards, manages vulnerabilities to secure Postman code, and fosters a security-first culture. Postman's security program and processes are consistent with best practices and industry standards. Postman also embeds security into the product to make it safe and secure to use.

You can share responsibility for security and privacy by following safe practices with your data and credentials. Contact Postman about any security issues at [Postman Trust Center](https://security.postman.com/).

Learn about Postman's security and governance features that you can use to secure your account, secrets, and data as a [developer](/docs/administration/security/developer-security/) or [team](/docs/administration/security/team-security/) in a small company or a large organization with enterprise-grade security needs.


# Security for Postman developers

As a developer creating APIs, you can secure your work in Postman using variables, leveraging 2FA, protecting your Postman API key, limiting your workspace visibility, and storing your secrets in Postman Vault.

## Variables

Postman enables you to store and reuse values in your collections, requests, and scripts as [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/). The variables give access to different scopes (global, collection, and environment) to support your use cases and workflows. You can also leverage local scope variables to prevent data synchronization to Postman's servers.

Postman [environment variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) are encrypted on the server before storage using AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - 256-bit key - Galois/Counter Mode). You also can use a [sensitive data type](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data) that's only available in environment variables. Using it masks the value of these secret variables, helping you avoid unintentionally sharing sensitive tokens, for example, during screen sharing or live streaming. Postman recommends securing variables with [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) when storing sensitive data such as API keys, access tokens, or passwords.

## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Enable 2FA for your Postman account to add an extra layer of security when you sign in using a password. Using 2FA can reduce the potential risk of an attacker compromising your account if they know your password. You can enable the feature in your [account settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/account/) or see [Manage your Postman account settings](/docs/getting-started/account/settings/) for a step-by-step guide.

## Protect your Postman API key in GitHub

Postman [sends an alert](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/how-secret-scanner-works/#protect-postman-api-keys-in-github) when you accidentally commit a Postman API key to a public GitHub repository. This capability is key to responding before any unauthorized access to your Postman data. If you receive an email or in-app notification about a leaked Postman API key in GitHub, Postman recommends that you delete the leaked API key immediately.

## API encryption configuration

As a Postman API developer, you can configure your API encryption using the following options:

* Using server cipher suite during handshake.
* Disabling protocols during handshake.
* Selecting a custom cipher suite.
* Using [client SSL certificates](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/certificates/)

## Workspaces

[Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/) help you organize your work and collaborate with others on your APIs. They serve as a single source of truth for collections, environments, mocks, monitors, and other linked entities.

Private workspaces allow teams to [restrict access or visibility](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#change-workspace-visibility) to collections, environments, mocks, and monitors to only a particular group.

## Postman Vault

[Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) enables you to store sensitive data as vault secrets in your local instance of Postman. Vault secrets are sensitive data, such as API keys and passwords, that you store in your Postman Vault and reuse in your local instance of Postman.

Only you can access and reuse values associated with your vault secrets, and they aren't synced to the Postman Cloud.

Your vault secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM.

You can also [use Guided Auth to add vault secrets](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/#add-authorization-as-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth) that have authentication credentials for public APIs. [Reference vault secrets added using Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/manage-vault-secrets-using-guided-auth/#use-vault-secrets-added-using-guided-auth) in your HTTP requests, and reuse your authentication credentials in new HTTP requests to the same public APIs.

Postman supports [integrations](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-integrations/) with 1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and HashiCorp Vault.


# Security for Postman teams

Postman's advanced administration features for teams include single sign-on support, audit logs, role-based access control (RBAC), configurable API encryption, and a token scanner that searches for exposed sensitive information.

You can use Postman's [RBAC system](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/#advanced-identity-management) to manage your team's resource visibility, define the development workflow, and provide administrative and billing personnel access. Using Postman's features also enables you to identify exposed proprietary and third-party tokens. Furthermore, you can manage your team's public resources to secure your data.

An [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can define security configurations at the team level.

## Single sign-On

Postman supports [single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/) for Enterprise teams using the SAML 2.0 standard and most identity providers, including Okta, OneLogin, and Duo. Postman recommends setting up SSO for your Postman team to get a seamless sign-in experience. Implementing SSO will also enforce team multi-factor authentication and help your organization meet regulatory compliance requirements.

## Domain capture

Use [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/) to manage all the Postman accounts that you created with your organization’s domains or subdomains. You can also consolidate all Postman users in your organization into a single team. In addition, you can enable [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) and auto-flex, a flexible billing feature. Doing so can ease the process of onboarding new Postman team users when domain capture is enabled.

## User provisioning

Postman supports [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), which allows you to automate user provisioning and deprovisioning for your team. With SCIM enabled, you can deploy Postman to your organization and control who can access it using your identity provider.

## User groups

Leverage [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/) to organize your team members into functional groups that mimic your organizational structure. You can also assign specific roles to these groups and enable access to particular resources for all the members. Postman recommends using user groups to manage access control while seamlessly onboarding new Postman team members.

## Token scanning with custom alerts

Your data security is Postman's priority. The [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/) searches for leaked sensitive tokens on public elements such as collections, environments, and documentation. Then, it sends an alert when a leak is detected.

Postman supports an extensive list of tokens, but the Secret Scanner isn’t limited to them. Admins can add their proprietary and third-party tokens by defining custom tokens alerts. Postman will scan these tokens in their team’s context and provide alerts for any exposure.

## Public element management

The [**Manage public elements**](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/) dashboard gives you a central place to control collections and environments shared outside your team for public consumption.

You'll need a [Community Manager](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) role in Enterprise teams to view and manage everything made public by your team. These include collections links, documentation, and workspaces. You can also turn off the creation of new JSON links for collections.

## Audit logs

[Audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/) track Postman account changes related to user management, team management, billing, and security. Postman recommends regularly reviewing your Postman team’s audit log data for potential security issues.

## Audit log API

Your Postman team’s audit logs are also available with the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/request/12959542-ec810a1a-6a84-471c-a145-a8b470ac5606). You can integrate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool of your choice with this API to set up a threat intelligence system.

## BYOK encryption

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  BYOK Encryption is available on Postman Enterprise plans with the [Advanced Security Administration add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#advanced-security-administration).
</Info>

With [Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Encryption](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/byok-encryption/), your team's sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted with your own customer managed key stored in [Amazon Key Management Service (KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html). BYOK offers your team seamless collaboration on sensitive data while adhering to your organization's security and compliance policies.

BYOK supports encryption for data synced to the Postman cloud in your team's [request history](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#history), [environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), [globals](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-global-variables), [monitor runs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/viewing-monitor-results/#test-results), and [collection runs](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/). Other Postman elements synced to the Postman cloud aren't encrypted with BYOK, such as workspaces and collections.

As an [Admin](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), work with your Customer Success Manager to set up and configure BYOK in your team. To learn more about BYOK Encryption, please contact your Postman Customer Success Manager or [Postman support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

# Build API-first apps with Postman Flows—a visual, low-code editor

You can use the *Postman Flows* low-code editor to prototype, build, and deploy [API-first](https://www.postman.com/api-first/) apps in a collaborative environment. Create [*flows*](#get-started-with-flows) that automate tasks, connect systems, and showcase your APIs to others on your team or the entire world with the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/). You can deploy flows so they function as API endpoints on the Postman Cloud and can connect to third-party services.

Flows are *composable*. You can [reuse flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/overview/#reuse-flows-within-other-flows) as blocks within other flows. This helps you keep your flows organized and efficient, even when you're using flows to automate complex tasks or processes.

![Postman Flows illustration](https://voyager.postman.com/illustration/flows-illustration-postman.svg)

Starting in Postman version 11.42.3, Postman users on [all plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can create, run, deploy, edit, and view flows in Postman Flows.

Postman Flows is available as an [add-on](/docs/billing/billing/#purchasing-add-on-products) for users on the Free, Basic and Professional plans. When purchased as an add-on, users have unlimited runs in Postman Flows. Users without a paid Flows seat will be able to run flows a limited number of times each month. Learn more about [managing Flows usage](/docs/billing/flows-usage/).

## Get started with Flows

With Postman Flows, you assemble building blocks on an infinite, drag-and-drop canvas. These building blocks may contain data, such as text or a date, or perform a task, such as solving a mathematical problem or sending an API request.

Use the editor and canvas to arrange your blocks to complete nearly any workflow you can imagine. Or you can use the <a href="https://www.postman.com/templates/flows/">Postman Flows Template Gallery</a> to explore ready-to-use flows. If that sounds like a lot, you can start by building a "Hello, world" flow.

To learn more, see [Build a "Hello world" flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

## Build flows

You build flows with *blocks* and *connections*. You use blocks to store information or perform a task, and connections to pass information or trigger blocks. When you connect two blocks, you connect one block's input to another block's output. Inputs are on the block's left side and outputs are on its right side.

To learn more, see [Build flows with Postman's visual, low-code editor](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/overview/).

## Deploy flows

You can deploy flows to the Postman Cloud. Flows running in the cloud function as API endpoints with public URLs, where external systems can trigger them. Flows running in the cloud can receive requests, process and apply logic to the incoming data, and send responses. Use flows to automate business logic, handle webhooks, connect with third-party services, and create AI-powered tools.

## Work with data in flows

In some cases, you may want to use advanced logic to work with data. With Postman Flows, you can use TypeScript or Flows Query Language (FQL) to query and transform data and add conditional logic.

TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript) is a complete programming language you can use to program logic and transform data in Postman Flows. FQL is a query programming language built by Postman for Postman Flows. If you need to query and transform your data, FQL is a great option. If you need to work with more complex logic, TypeScript is a better option.

To learn more, see [Introduction to Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) and [Use TypeScript in Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/).

## Learn Flows with tutorials

Tutorials are a great way to familiarize yourself with the Flows editor and canvas, and prepare to build your own API-first projects. You can get started with beginning use cases and go further with advanced tutorials. If you prefer to watch videos, you can explore the Flows video tutorials.

To learn more, see [Learn how to use Postman Flows with tutorials](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/overview/).

## Build flows with AI

With [Postman Agent mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/), you can use natural language to build or add to your flows. Agent Mode also has [skills](/docs/agent-mode/skills/) you can select to accomplish specific tasks.

<InterlinkCTA platform="community" datatype="flows-feedback" />


# Get started with your Postman Flows API journey

With Postman Flows, you can build API-first apps that automate tasks, integrate systems, and showcase your APIs to anyone in the world. You can get started with a new flow and learn by doing, or start creating with an existing flow from the Flows Template Gallery.

![The Postman Flows screen](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-screen-v11.svg)

## Use the Postman Flows editor and canvas to build your Flows

You can use the visual, low-code editor to assemble building blocks on a drag-and-drop canvas and build nearly any workflow you can imagine.

To learn more, see [Build a "Hello world" flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

## Use the Flows Template Gallery to explore ready-to-use flows

You can use the Postman Flows Template Gallery to browse ready-to-use flows. If you find something you want to build from, you can add it to your workspace and make it your own.

Check out the [Flows Template Gallery](https://www.postman.com/templates/flows/).

## Build your first flow and say "Hello, world"

Start your Postman Flows API journey by building a "Hello, world" flow. You'll create a two-block flow and learn how blocks and connections work—and prepare yourself to build more complex flows in the future.

To learn more, see [Build a "Hello, world" flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

<InterlinkCTA platform="community" datatype="flows-learn" />


# Build a "Hello, world" flow

Postman Flows is a visual, low-code editor you can use to build almost any workflow you can imagine. With Postman Flows you can create flows that run locally and can be deployed in the Postman cloud.

In this tutorial, you'll create a two-block flow that displays the text **Hello, world**. You'll learn how blocks and connections work and prepare yourself to build larger and more complex flows.

## Create a new flow

With flows, you can create reusable flow components that can be added to multiple other flows. Then you can share your flows with teammates so they don't need to rebuild the same components.

You create flows in a workspace. Use workspaces to organize your API projects and collaborate with your team.

To create a new flow, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
2. In the upper left corner, click **New** > <img alt="Flow icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow**.
3. In the sidebar, hover over the new flow, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**, then select **Rename**.
4. Rename the flow to **Hello, world**.
5. Press the **Return** or **Enter** key.

## Add a String block

Use the **String** block to define text, which you can send to another block.

To add a **String** block, do the following:

1. On the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Block**.
2. Select <img alt="String icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-string-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **String**. You can also search for the block by entering "string" in the search box.
3. To the right of the **Start** block, click the canvas to place the **String** block in that location.
4. In the **String** block, enter the text **Hello, world**.

In the next procedure, you'll connect this block to a **Display** block to display your text.

## Connect a Display block

When you connect two blocks, you connect one block's input to another block's output. Inputs are on the block's left side and outputs are on its right side. The **Display** block displays incoming data, such as the **String** block's string value.

To connect a **Display** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **String** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Drag the output port to the right of the **String** block to place the **Display** block in that location.
3. Select <img alt="Output icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-output-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Display**. You can also search for the block by entering "output" in the search box.

## Run the flow

On the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

!["Hello, world" flow](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-build-your-first-flow-v11-40.jpg)

Congratulations! You built your first flow and displayed **Hello, world** in a **Display** block.


# Explore ready-to-use Flows in the Postman Flows Catalog

# Build flows overview

Postman Flows lets you automate and visualize API workflows using modular building blocks. This guide introduces you to creating, connecting, and testing flows.

## Build your first flow

If you're new to building flows, you can do the following:

* Try the ["Hello, world" flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) to get started quickly.
* Learn how to [create](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-blocks/), [connect](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-connections/), and [run](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/requests-and-variables/) blocks.
* [Work with date and time](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/date-and-time/) in your flows.

## Working with blocks

Each flow is made of blocks that perform specific tasks. You can do the following:

* [Chain blocks to pass data between them](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-connections/).
* [Get or set variables to manage dynamic values](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/requests-and-variables/).
* [Filter data using conditions](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/find-and-filter-data/).
* Build [branching logic](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/) into flows that apply conditions to data.
* Build [loops](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/) to tackle iteration-heavy tasks.

## Reuse flows within other flows

A flow with a [snapshot](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/) and [outputs](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/) can be called from within other flows with a [**Flow** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/). Encapsulating all the original flow's blocks in a single **Flow** block makes your flow simpler and easier to grasp.

## Deploy flows

Another way to make your flow reusable is to deploy it with a unique cloud-hosted URL. This means your flow can connect with external services and interact with AI applications through MCP. Deployed flows [receive HTTP requests](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/) and send out structured [responses](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/response/).

## Working with AI

AI is an integral part of working with Postman Flows.

* [AI blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-ai-blocks/) enable your flow to interact with AI applications.
* [Postman Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/) enables you to create and add to your flows with natural language.
* You can build and run an [MCP server](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-server-flows/overview/) as a special kind of flow that runs in the Postman cloud.

## Organize and visualize flows

[Make your flows easier to understand](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/organize/organize-flows/) by using the following options:

* Colors to differentiate blocks
* Annotations to add descriptions or instructions
* Groups to cluster related steps

You can also [visualize data within your flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/visualize-data/) to debug or share insights.

## Test and troubleshoot

To learn more about testing and troubleshooting your flows:

* Use [troubleshooting tools](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/troubleshoot/troubleshoot/) to inspect errors and fix block logic.
* Postman Flows supports [deployment and monitoring](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/analytics/) so you can test as you build.


# Create blocks in Postman Flows

All blocks have an input port, an output port, or both. Input ports are on the left side of a block, and output ports are on the right. You can find an explanation and example for every block in [Blocks overview](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/).

There are several ways to add a new block:

* Right-click anywhere in the flow.
* Click the <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Block** button on the toolbar.
* Drag a connection from the output port of another block.

Any of these steps will open the block list, where you can select a block and add it to the flow. You can also [copy and paste blocks into your flow](#copy-and-paste-blocks).

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-add-a-block-v11-75.png" alt="Add a block" />

When you create a new flow, there's a [**Start** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) on the canvas, with colored suggestions for things you can do:

* <img alt="Magic icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-magic-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Describe** - Opens agent mode where you can describe and build a flow with AI.
* <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Add blocks** - Opens the blocks list.
* <img alt="Collection Template icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-collection-template-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Browse templates** - Opens the <a href="https://www.postman.com/templates/flows/">Postman Flows Template Gallery</a> where you can discover and load prebuilt flows.

## Copy and paste blocks

You can copy and paste blocks in flows using your system's standard keyboard shortcuts. The pasted blocks preserve the copied blocks' configurations. If you copy and paste connected blocks, they keep their connections. You can also copy and paste [annotations](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/organize/organize-flows/#annotations) and [groups](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/organize/organize-flows/#groups).

To copy and paste blocks in a flow, do the following:

1. Select a block. For multiple blocks, hold **⌘** or **Ctrl** while selecting the blocks.

2. Select **⌘+C** or **Ctrl+C** to copy the block.

3. Press **⌘+V** or **Ctrl+V** to paste the block.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can copy blocks from one flow and paste them in a different flow.
</Tip>


# Connect blocks in Postman Flows

Blocks communicate with each other through connections. Connections are like unidirectional conduits that carry data between blocks. Most blocks have an input port, an output port, or both, where connections can begin or end. Many blocks' output ports can have multiple connections so you can send their data to more than one block. You can select and drag a block's output port to create and connect to a new block.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-add-a-connection-v11-61-3.gif" alt="Add a connection" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

A typical flow often involves making a request, and then sending the result to another block. To do this, flows pass information between blocks to perform tasks.

## Using one block's output as another block's input

Once data is selected, it can be used with other blocks. Sending it to a **Display** block is great for seeing that the request worked, but it doesn't actually do anything with the value.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-using-selected-data-v11-60-1.gif" alt="Using selected data" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

Adding another **HTTP Request** block and then dragging a connection to its `value1` and `value2` variable inputs lets the request use the value for `eur` and `date` that was returned in the first request.

You can also create a **Select** block by dragging and dropping output data from an **HTTP Request** or **Display** block. The new **Select** block automatically selects the data you dragged and dropped.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-drag-and-drop-v11-60.gif" alt="Select block" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

## Blocks inside of other blocks

You may have noticed in the previous step that the **HTTP Request** block has a variable named `value1` that's using a **Select** block with no value set. When this happens, it's selecting everything that's being sent to it (which in this case is `eur`).

This flow can be simplified to remove the extra **Select** block and instead use the existing ones in the second **HTTP Request** block.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-simplify-the-flow-v11-60.png" alt="Simplifying the flow" />


# Create copies of flows with clones

You can create copies of flows with the *clone* feature in Postman Flows. When you clone a flow, the cloned flow includes all the blocks present in the original flow. You can clone a flow into the same workspace as the original or into a different workspace. When you clone a flow into a new workspace, any requests used by the flow are copied into a new collection in that workspace.

## Clone a flow into the same workspace

To clone a flow into the same workspace as the original flow, do the following:

1. In the flow you want to clone, click <img alt="Duplicate icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-duplicate-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Clone this flow**. A dialog appears with the current workspace already selected.

   <img alt="Select the same workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/clone-flow-1-v11.png" />

2. Click **Continue**.

3. The cloned flow opens and appears in the list of flows in the sidebar. The cloned flow is named "*flow name* copy".

## Clone a flow into a different workspace

To clone a flow into a different workspace than the original flow, do the following:

1. In the flow you want to clone, click <img alt="Duplicate icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-duplicate-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Clone this flow**.

2. In the dialog that appears, select the destination workspace from the dropdown list.

   <img alt="Select a different workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/clone-flow-different-workspace-v11.png" />

3. Click **Continue**.

4. A dialog appears showing the cloning process. When the process is complete, click **Open Cloned Flow** to open the cloned flow in its workspace, or click **Close** to return to the original flow in the current workspace.


# Loops overview

Loops are a basic element of control flow in computer programming that Postman Flows supports. As a *visual* programming environment, Flows has its own design patterns that you need to know to make looping structures work for you.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Starting in Postman version 11.47.2, you can't connect blocks to pass data into loops within flow. Instead, use a **Create Variable** block to store a value, and then insert an inline **Get Variable** block in the block that needs to use that value. See [About flows before Postman 11.47.2](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#about-flows-before-postman-11472).

## Loops with the Repeat block

In Flows, here's the most basic design pattern for a loop:

1. Begin with a [**Repeat**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/repeat/) block. Use a **Number** block to set the `Count` input to the number of times you want Flows to iterate through the loop.

2. Connect a block that does work (for example, an [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/) block) to the **Repeat** block.

3. Optionally, add more blocks that do work, connecting them together in a series.

4. Connect a [**Collect**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/collect/) block to the last of the blocks from the previous step.

5. Connect a [**Display**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-display/) block to the **Collect** block.

This loop repeats the specified number of times. There's no way to break out of the loop.

Here's how the loop will look:

<img alt="Design pattern for basic loop with Repeat" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-repeat-v11.49.0.jpg" />

## Loops with the For block

Since the [**For**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/for/) block iterates over a list, you need to provide a list to its input.

1. Begin with a [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/) block. Alternatively, you can use an **HTTP Request** block to pass in a list from an API.

2. Connect a **For** block to the **List** block.

3. Connect a block that does work (for example, an **Evaluate** block) to the **For** block.

4. Optionally, add more blocks that do work, connecting them together in a series.

5. Connect a **Collect** block to the last of the blocks from the previous step.

6. Connect a **Display** block to the **Collect** block.

This loop goes all the way through the list - there's no way to break out. Nor can you start in the middle.

Here's how the loop will look:

<img alt="Design pattern for basic loop with For" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-for-v11.49.0.jpg" />

## Best practices for working with loops

When planning and creating loops in flows, consider the following facts and principles:

* **Collect** blocks are great for synchronizing loops, because the flow will wait until all data has been collected before continuing.

* Don't try to create a variable within a loop. Flows treat variables as constants that can only be set once.

* In Flows, you can construct a double **For** loop that's equivalent to a nested loop in programming languages like Python or JavaScript. For example, if a value *X* in the outer loop is needed to process other values in the inner loop, use an **Evaluate** block in the outer loop to map *X* to each item you're sending through to the inner loop. (See the TypeScript [map()](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html) function.)

## Alternatives to loops

Flows can filter and map data. For computational efficiency, consider doing this with TypeScript in **Evaluate** blocks rather than with loops.

Here's an example flow whose source data is a list of JSON objects that describe water and oil wells. The goal is to reveal correlations between a well's elevation and its status.

* The first **Evaluate** block filters out all the wells whose elevation falls outside of a range of interest, thus selecting a manageable subset of wells to investigate. The range of interest is from 700 to 960 feet, inclusive, and the following expression performs the filtering:

  ```javascript
  tableOfWells.filter(
  (row) => row.Elevation >= 700 && row.Elevation <= 960);
  ```

* The second **Evaluate** block maps values from the data's `Elevation` and `Status of Well` fields to new JSON objects and outputs these as a list ordered by elevation from low to high. Displaying the transformed data as a table makes correlations easier to spot. The following expression performs the mapping and ordering:

  ```javascript
  wellList = wells.map((row) => ({["Elevation"]: row["Elevation"],["Status": row["Status of Well"]}));
  wellList.sort((a, b) => a.Elevation - b.Elevation);
  ```

You could produce the same result using loops. But especially when operating on large data sets, you'll get better performance using **Evaluate** blocks with the TypeScript methods `filter()`, `map()`, and `sort()`.

## About flows before Postman 11.47.2

In some earlier versions of Postman, flows have a **Deploy** button that when clicked would generate a webhook and deploy the flow at that URL. If you have flows that were deployed in this way and that contain loops, they will continue to run normally unless you redeploy them. When redeployed, they may fail. To prevent this, before you redeploy such flows, revise the loops to pass data using **Get Variable** and **Create Variable** blocks.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Webhooks in flows are deprecated and will be sunset on February 11, 2026. Webhooks in flows will stop working after that date. To learn how to migrate flows with webhooks to flows running in the cloud, see the [Webhook migration guide](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/troubleshoot/webhook-migration-guide/).
</Info>

[Deployable flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) have always required **Get Variable** and **Create Variable** to pass data into loops. Thus, while it's a breaking change for older flows deployed with webhooks, this change doesn't affect flows running in the cloud.

Here's an example that correctly uses **Get Variable** and **Create Variable** blocks to pass data into a loop. This method has always been supported. The data being passed is the string "Hello".

<img alt="Design pattern for basic loop with For" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-variable-correct-v11.52.3.jpg" />

Here's another version of the same example, this time using the obsolete approach that was supported only in flows created in Postman version 11.47.1 or earlier. Don't do this!

# Loops with external data

The [Loops Overview](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/) showed how to build loops that begin with a **For** or **Repeat** block, then send each iteration's output through a sequence of blocks to a **Collect** block. The blocks in those examples were all *inside the loop*. In this topic, you'll learn how to rigorously define what it means for a block to be *inside the loop* or *outside the loop*. This matters because data that originates outside the loop behaves differently than data that originates inside.

When blocks outside a loop provide data, you can think of this as *external* data, meaning external to the loop but still within Postman.

## What's inside a loop in flows

The inside of a loop is defined as including the following blocks:

* The **For** or **Repeat** block that begins the work of the loop and its respective data source. (A **For** block's data source might be a **List** block; a **Repeat** block's data source might be a **Number** block.)

* The **Collect** block that completes the work of the loop, and any blocks connected to the **Collect** block's output. (This might include **Display** or **Output** blocks.)

* Any blocks that do work after the **For** or **Repeat** block and before the **Collect** block. (This might include **Evaluate**, **Create Variable**, **Get Variable**, **Template**, **Delay**, **Output**, or other kinds of blocks.)

All blocks in the example below are inside the loop. Each iteration of the loop obtains a random number and multiplies it by 11. Later in this topic you'll see how to avoid hard-coding an arbitrary value (in this case 11).

<img alt="All blocks are inside the loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-all-within-v11.52.3-v2.jpg" />

The loop's HTTP request has a parameter that gets assigned a new, random integer value each time you send the request. What makes this work is that the parameter's value is defined as `{{$randomint}}`, one of the special dynamic variables from the [Faker library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/#text-numbers-and-colors).

## What's outside a loop in flows

Suppose you add a block that's *not* in between the **For** or **Repeat** block that begins and the **Collect** block that completes the work of the loop? That block will be *outside the loop*. This holds true even if you connect its output to the input of a block inside the loop.

Here's an example where a **String** and **Create Variable** block sit outside the loop. Then, the value they store is consumed inside the loop, by an inline **Get Variable** block within a **Template** block.

<img alt="Data stored outside and consumed inside a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-outside-example-1-v11.52.3.jpg" />

## Work with data from both inside and outside a loop

The example from [What's inside a loop in flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-external-data/#whats-inside-a-loop-in-flows) used the same hard-coded value to process data in every iteration of the loop. To make this example more interesting, you can replace the hard-coded value with a number obtained and stored outside the loop, then consumed inside the loop.

To build this loop, do the following:

1. Clone or build a copy of the example from [What's inside a loop in flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-external-data/#whats-inside-a-loop-in-flows).

2. Clone the HTTP request named **Get a number repeatedly** and rename the clone **Get a number once**. Although the two requests are functionally identical, naming the two copies differently will make your flow easier to understand.

3. Create the new blocks that will sit outside the loop. These will be the **HTTP request**, **Select**, and **Create Variable** blocks shown below:

   <img alt="Data stored outside and consumed inside a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-long-example-step-a-v11.52.3.jpg" />

4. Leave the first row of blocks from your original loop as is.

   <img alt="Data stored outside and consumed inside a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-long-example-step-b-v11.52.3.jpg" />

5. Modify the second row of blocks to match what's shown below. Be sure to do the following:

   * Rename the **Multiply the number by 11** block as **Multiply the two numbers**.

   * Verify that in both the **Multiply the two numbers** block and the **Template** block, there are two inline **Get Variable** blocks: one whose value is `fromOutside` and another whose value is `fromInside`.

   <img alt="Data stored outside and consumed inside a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-long-example-step-c-v11.53.3-v2.jpg" />

Run the flow. Every time you run it, it will obtain a new random number and multiply that number (the `fromOutside` variable) by four different random numbers (the `fromInside` variable). The completed flow looks like this:

<img alt="Data stored outside and consumed inside a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-long-example-step-d-v11.53.3-v2.jpg" />

This kind of flow, where a loop combines unchanging data from outside with modifiable data from inside, is another important Flows design pattern. For example, this works well for flows that need to obtain a new API token each time they run.

## About data from outside the loop

A flow won't iterate over any block that's outside the loop. Therefore, when a loop uses data from blocks outside the loop, it only retrieves that data once.

When data originates outside the loop, you store it in a **Create Variable** block. The stored data can then be consumed inside the loop, by an inline **Get Variable** block within an **Evaluate**, **Template**, or some other block.

By default, Postman *pins* the inline **Get Variable** block. The pinned data is then available for each iteration of the loop. If the variable isn't pinned, the block that's using it will run out of data, causing an error. Blocks won't change a pinned variable's value.

Notice the difference in appearance between an unpinned and a pinned variable. When the variable is pinned, the pin icon is vertical and filled in with black. When it's unpinned, the pin icon is angled and has no fill.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends that you leave variables pinned.
</Info>

<img alt="Pinned and unpinned variables" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-external-data-pinning-v11.51.6.jpg" />

Pinned variables keep their initial values through all of the loop's iterations. For this reason, you can't use a pinned variable in Flows the way you'd use a variable in a "while do" loop coded in a programming language like Python or JavaScript.


# Loops for pagination

You can use Postman Flows to build a "while do" loop that's well-suited to pagination use cases.

The loops covered in the previous topics about [loops](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/) and [loops with external data](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-external-data/) all run through an entire list or for a specified number of iterations. Other than waiting for them to complete, you can't short circuit or break out of those loops.

This topic's pagination use case requires a different design pattern: one that enables you break out of a loop:

* Update a value within the loop, then use an **HTTP Request** block to send the value to and retrieve it from the Postman Echo API. This enables your flow to manipulate *state* across multiple iterations of the loop.

* Within the loop, use an **Evaluate** block to increment or otherwise changes the value and a **Condition** block to decide whether the loop should iterate or terminate based on the new value.

## Build a loop for pagination

Here's how the finished loop will look:

<img alt="Flow to paginate within a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-break-out-v11.49.0-v4.jpg" />

Before building the flow, create an HTTP GET request in a collection of your choice. Configure the request with the following URL:

```javascript
https://postman-echo.com/get?pageNumber={{value}}
```

Rename the request "Current page number".

Create a new flow.

### Construct the loop

In this section you'll add blocks to build a loop, including a **Condition** block to determine whether to continue iterating or stop.

1. Create an **HTTP Request** block, choose the "Current page number" HTTP request you created above. This renames the block as **Current page number**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Make sure the **Start** block isn't connected to this or any other block.
   </Info>

2. Connect a **Number** block to the **value** input of the **Current page number** block. Leave its value at `0`.

3. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **Current page number** block's **Success** output and rename it "Turn the page". Change `value1` to "pageBeforeTurning". In the inline **Select** block, enter the path `body.args.pageNumber`.

4. Paste the following expression into the TypeScript window:

   ```javascript
   Number(pageBeforeTurning) + 1
   ```

5. Connect a **Delay** block to the `Result` output of the **Turn the page** block and set its value to 1500 milliseconds.

6. Connect a **Condition** block to the **Delay** block and rename it "Stop after page 5". Rename `value1` as `onPage` and paste the following expression into the **Condition 1** window:

   ```javascript
   onPage > 5
   ```

   This expression returns true when the page number exceeds 5. When that happens, the loop terminates. As long as the page number is less than or equal to 5, the loop keeps iterating.

7. Run the flow so that output values appear for each block. In the output of the **Stop after page 5** block, under **default**, click and drag `onPage` to create a **Select** block that outputs the page number value.

8. Connect the output of the new **Select** block to the `value` input of the **Current page number** block. Note that this connection loops back to the beginning, making the flow a true loop in form, not only in function.

### Add blocks to display status

The blocks you add in this section will enable you to follow the loop's action throughout its lifecycle.

1. Connect a **Template** block to the `Success` output of the **Current page number** block and rename it **Message when iterating**. Rename `key` as `onPage`. In the inline **Select** block, enter the path `body.args.pageNumber`. Paste the following expression into the text window:

   ```javascript
   We are now on page {{onPage}}. Turning the page ...
   ```

2. Connect a **Display** block to the **Message when iterating** block. From <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**, select **Text size > Large**.

3. Connect a **Template** block to the **Condition 1** output of the **Stop after page 5** block and rename it **Message when terminating**. Rename `key` as `lastPage`. In the inline **Select** block, click `Enter path...` and choose `onPage`.

4. Paste the following expression into the text window:

   ```javascript
   Stopping! We got to page {{lastPage}}.
   ```

5. Connect the **Display** block you created earlier to the **Message when terminating** block.

Run the flow. You'll see each block activate in sequence until the loop goes beyond page 5 and terminates.


# Loops for polling

You can use Postman Flows to build a "while do" loop that polls an API for new values until a condition is satisfied.

Like the previous topic, [Loops for pagination](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-pagination/), this topic describes a design pattern that allows you break out of a loop:

* Use an **HTTP Request** block to obtain a value from the Postman Echo API – that is, to poll the API.

* Use a **Condition** block to test whether the value satisfies a condition. If the test returns `false`, iterate: return to the beginning of the loop and poll the API again. If the test returns `true`, break out of the loop and stop.

As long as the loop keeps polling, you know that the condition hasn't been satisfied yet. In a sense, this enables your flow to manipulate state across multiple iterations of the loop.

## Build a loop for polling

Here's how the finished loop will look:

<img alt="Flow to poll an API within a loop" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-loops-polling-v11.63.6.jpg" />

Before building the flow, create an HTTP GET request in a collection of your choice. Configure the request with the following URL:

```javascript
https://postman-echo.com/get?randomNumber={{$randomInt}}
```

Rename the request "Random number generator" and click **Save**.

Create a new flow.

### Construct the loop

In this section you'll add blocks to build a loop, including a **Condition** block to determine whether to continue iterating or stop.

1. Create an **HTTP Request** block, choosing the "Random number generator" HTTP request you created above. This renames the block as **Random number generator**.

2. Connect the output of the **Start** block to the **Send** input of the **Random number generator** block.

3. Connect a **Condition** block to the **Random number generator** block's **Success** output and rename it "Condition: the number must be divisible by 5". In the **value1** input's inline **Select** block, enter the path `body.args.randomNumber`.

4. Paste the following expression into the TypeScript window:

   ```javascript
   value1 % 5 === 0 ? true : false
   ```

   When `value1` is divisible by 5, the expression returns `true` and the loop terminates. Otherwise the expression returns `false` and the flow iterates again, polling the API for a new value.

5. Connect a **Delay** block to the `Default` output of the **Condition: the number must be divisible by 5** block and set its value to 1000 milliseconds.

6. Connect the **Delay** block's output to the `Send` input of the **Random number generator** block. Note that this connection loops back to the beginning, making the flow a true loop in form, not only in function.

### Add blocks to display status

The blocks you add in this section will enable you to follow the loop's action throughout its lifecycle.

1. Connect a **Template** block to the `Condition 1` output of the **Random number generator** block and rename it **Met the condition, stop**. Rename `key` as `inputInt`. In the inline **Select** block, click `Enter path...` and select `value1`. Paste the following expression into the text window:

   ```javascript
   {{inputInt}} meets the condition:
   it's divisible by 5.

   We can stop now!
   ```

2. Connect a **Template** block to the `Default` output of the **Random number generator** block and rename it **Didn't meet the condition, keep polling**. Rename `key` as `inputInt`. In the inline **Select** block, click `Enter path...` and select `value1`. Paste the following expression into the text window:

   ```javascript
   {{inputInt}} is not divisible by 5.

   Keep polling!
   ```

3. Connect a **Display** block to both the **Met the condition, stop** and the **Didn't meet the condition, keep polling** block. From <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**, select **Text size > Large**.

Run the flow. You'll see each block activate in sequence and the loop iterate until the API it's polling produces a number that's divisible by 5. At that point, the condition you specified is satisfied and the loop terminates.


# Work with date and time formats in Postman Flows

Many APIs expect different formats for date and time. Flows has many built-in [Flows Query Language (FQL)](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) and TypeScript functions to handle any of the formats required.

## How date and time is stored in Flows

Flows date and time blocks (such as **Now**, **Date**, and **Date & Time**) store date and time as a number. This number is a common format which is the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1st January 1970 (referred to as *Unix time*). This simplifies date comparison, and the number can be converted into other formats as needed.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-time-format-v11-60.png" alt="Flows time format" width="280px" />

## Use FQL for different formats

The [ISO 8601 format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html/) is commonly used in APIs. FQL has a `now` function that prints the current timestamp in date, time, and UTC offset format (for example, `2023-08-11T02:03:46.145+00:00`). If an API requires a shortened version of the timestamp, you can use the [`fromMillis` function](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/data-manipulation/#convert-from-unix-epoch-time-into-a-specific-date-format).

For example, to get a date without the time in ISO format, use `$fromMillis($toMillis($now()), "y-M-d")`. This function converts the date and returns it in a shortened YYYY-DD-MM format. For a list of supported FQL date and time formats, see [Time and date formatting](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/data-manipulation/#time-and-date-formatting).

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/fql-time-format-date-no-time-v11-60.png" alt="FQL date and time format" width="280px" />


# Find and filter data in Postman Flows

Frequently, the need arises to check if information in a flow has a certain value. Depending on the structure of the information returned from an API, there are several different ways to solve this using [Flows Query Language (FQL)](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/).

## Contains

The [contains](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/function-reference/#contains) function is the most direct way to check if information contains a specific word or pattern (regex). Since `contains` returns either true or false, it's often used with an **If** block.

The following example displays how information is only passed through the **If** block when the input contains the expected value:

![A contains example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-contains-example-v11-60.png)

## Filter

The [filter](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/function-reference/#filter) function enables you to get a subset of elements from a larger list of elements. Use the `$filter(list name,fn($v,$i,$a) { filter condition })` function, where `$v` is the list's values, `$i` is the index (zeroth, first, second, and third item), and `$a` is the entire list. `$v` is an important value for filtering and the only one actually required to be used.

In the following example, there's a list of companies, but only the enabled companies are required for the remainder of the flow:

![A filter example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-filter-example-v11-60.png)

## Count

The [count](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/function-reference/#count) function returns the number of items in a list. This is commonly used because APIs often return lists of items when the flow is looking for one particular item. When this happens, the flow needs to check if the API returns a single record or if there's a list and further filtering is required. This function is also useful for generating a random result from a list.

In the following example, the flow counts the number of headers in an API response:

![A count example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-count-example-v11-60.png)

## Distinct

The [distinct](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/function-reference/#distinct) function returns only the unique items in a list. Sometimes there are duplicate entries in a list of results that the flow needs to filter out.

In the following example, the flow filters out a duplicate user name that has already appeared in the list:

![A distinct example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-distinct-example-v11-60.png)


# Deploy flows to the Postman cloud

You can deploy any flow to the Postman cloud, where it can receive and respond to requests from collaborators and other users. Flows running in the cloud can be scheduled, or triggered by external systems like third-party services, other APIs, or webhooks. Flows in the cloud are useful for running automations and exposing functionality as an API or as an AI tool for MCP servers.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Flows running in the Postman cloud don't support private APIs.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Deployable flows are available in Postman version 11.42.3 and later.
</Info>

For more information about running flows in the cloud, see [Deployed flows overview](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/).

## Create a deployable flow

To create a flow you can run in the cloud, do the following:

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

2. On the **Start** block, click **Change trigger** and select <img alt="API icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-api-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Request**.The **Start** block becomes a [**Request** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/).

3. Add and connect blocks to [create a flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) that processes data from one or more of the **Request** block's output ports.

4. Add a [**Response** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/response/). Connect other blocks' outputs to the **Response** block's **Headers** and **Body** inputs as necessary. This will return status codes and include routed data in the response's headers and body according to your requirements.

5. Click **Run** to test your flow locally with [scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/) data.

You can design your flows to be *synchronous* (sync) or *asynchronous* (async). In a sync flow, all the blocks complete their functions before the flow sends a response. An async flow running in the cloud sends a response before its blocks finish running. For more information, see [Synchronous and Asynchronous deployed flows](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/#synchronous-and-asynchronous-flows).

## Deploy a flow

After you create a flow with a **Request** block and a **Response** block, you can *deploy* it to make it publicly available. For more information about deploying flows, see [Deploy flows with snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/#deploy-flows-with-snapshots).

To deploy a new flow to the cloud, do the following:

1. In your flow, click **Deploy** and enter the following:

   * **URL** - This path will be added to the domain where the flow is deployed. You can use the resulting URL to call the flow.

   * **Authentication** - (Optional) Turn this on to require a token to access the URL.

   * **Timeout** - Sets the amount of time that the flow will wait before sending a 408 Request Timeout error if it hasn't finished running. Enter a value between 5 and 30 seconds (inclusive). For more information, see [Manage long-running deployed flows](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/#manage-long-running-deployed-flows).

   * **Description** - (Optional) Describe the flow's purpose and any important details.

2. Click **Deploy**. The flow runs in the Postman cloud at the specified URL. In the **Deploy** window, click **Current** to see a summary of the flow. The summary includes the flow's status (online or offline), last deployed date and snapshot version, and authentication setting.

## Deploy a new snapshot of a flow

If you make changes to your flow, you can deploy the new version and create a new [snapshot](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/) of it.

To deploy a new version of an existing flow, do the following:

1. In your flow, click **Deploy**.

2. (Optional) Enter a description of the changes.

3. Click **Deploy**. The new version of the flow is deployed to the original URL and a new snapshot is created.

## Deploy a previous snapshot of a flow

To revert a flow to a previous [snapshot](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/), do the following:

1. In your flow, click **Deploy > New**.

2. Click the <img alt="Versions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **New Snapshot** dropdown list.

3. Select the snapshot you want to deploy.

4. Click **Deploy**.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     The local version of your flow doesn't automatically restore the snapshot when you deploy it. To learn about restoring snapshots and more, see [Version flows with snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/).
   </Info>

## Schedule a flow to run automatically

You can trigger flows in the cloud to run at regular intervals or at specific times.

To trigger a flow with a schedule, do the following:

1. In the **Request** block in your flow, click **Change trigger** and select <img alt="Calendar icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-calendar-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Schedule**. The **Request** block changes to a **Schedule** block.

2. In the text box, enter when you want the flow to run in plain language. For example, you could enter "Run once per minute for five minutes." The shortest time increment you can schedule is one minute. The longest is one year.

3. Click **Apply**.

4. Click **Deploy > New > Deploy**. You can see the flow's results on the [**Analytics**](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/analytics/) page after it runs.

## Enforce bearer token authorization

You can configure new and existing flows to authorize requests with a [*bearer token*](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#bearer-token). To require a bearer token for a new flow, do the following:

1. [Create a deployable flow](#create-a-deployable-flow).

2. Click **Deploy**.

3. Enter a URL.

4. Turn on **Authentication**.

   <img alt="Enable auth" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-enable-actions-auth-v11-75.png" width="280px" />

5. Click **Deploy**.

6. In the **Deploy** window, click **Current**. The obfuscated token appears at the bottom of the **Deploy** window.

7. Hover over the token and click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy** to copy the token. You can then share the token with authorized users so they can include it in requests to the flow's URL.

   <img alt="Async action" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-actions-copy-auth-v11-75.png" width="280px" />

8. (Optional) Hover over the token and click <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-refresh-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Regenerate token** to create a new token.


# Send URL-encoded or form data to flows

The **Request** block can get input data for your flow from a scenario. That enables you to test the flow locally. This topic explains how to create scenarios for **Request** blocks in flows whose HTTP request bodies need to be formatted as `form-data` or `x-www-form-urlencoded` data. For flows whose request bodies will only require plain JSON, skip this topic and follow the [Request block setup instruction](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/#setup) instead.

## Create and deploy the flow

1. [Create a deployable flow](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#create-a-deployable-flow) and include an **HTTP Request** block with an HTTP request.

2. Click **Deploy** and enter a URL.

3. Click **Deploy**.

4. Click **Current**, then click <img alt="Open in Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openInPostman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open in HTTP request** to open the HTTP request editor.

## Edit the request

1. In the HTTP request editor, select the **POST** request method.

2. (Optional) Configure parameters, authorization, headers, scripts, and settings as desired.

3. Configure the request body in the **Body** tab. Choose one of the following two options, depending on whether your flow will require its HTTP request body to be formatted as `x-www-form-urlencoded` or `form-data`:

   * **Option one:** Select **x-www-form-urlencoded**, then enter the keys and example values.

   * **Option two:** Select **form-data**, then enter the keys and example values for your form fields.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Form data values are of type `Text` by default, but you can alternatively select `File`, add a file. If the file hasn't been uploaded to the Postman cloud yet, click <img alt="Upload to cloud icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-uploadToCloud-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Upload file to team** to make it available to your teammates.
   </Info>

4. Save and send the request.

5. Assuming that the flow responds with `200 OK`, click <img alt="Home icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-home-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Home > Analytics**.

## Obtain the request body

1. In the **Flow** column, click the name of the flow you're sending requests to, to open its details at right.

2. Under **Run Logs**, click **Request** to reveal details. In the **Body** section, click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy** to copy the request body.

3. Click **Open flow** to return to your flow.

## Work with the request body

1. In your flow, create a [scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/), and in the **Body** field, paste the request body that you copied while in the request editor.

2. Save and run the scenario.

3. Click the **Body** port of the **Request** block to open the block footer, and verify that the block emitted the correct request body, headers, and parameters.

4. Based on the correctly formed request body that's available in the block footer, add blocks to your flow to process the request body data as desired.


# Organize flows with color, annotations, and groups

As you build more flows and their designs become more complex, the ability to organize your flows becomes more important. Flows have several features that enable organization on the canvas and folders to assist with organizing flows in the sidebar.

## Colors

You can configure color highlighting for blocks. This makes individual blocks more distinguishable from other blocks around them. You can add a color by selecting a block, then click <img alt="Style icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-style-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Change Color** in the menu that appears. This also changes the color of connection lines extended from the block's output ports.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/block-colors-v11-60.png" alt="Colors" />

## Annotations

When collaborating with other people or putting a flow in a public workspace, it's helpful to add directions directly on the canvas. This helps explain how to use the flow and what certain blocks are doing. Click <img alt="Add Annotation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-annotation-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add Text** in the toolbar to add an annotation. Selecting text in an annotation opens the text formatting menu which has bold, italics, and heading options. If you copy a link, then highlight some text and paste the link, the highlighted text becomes a hyperlink.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-annotations-v11-60-1.png" alt="Annotations" />

## Groups

You can group blocks and annotations together. The group can then be named, given a color, resized, and have blocks added or removed from it. This can be useful when several blocks may be involved in performing a task such as sending an email.

To access the grouping menu, hold the **Shift** key and drag the cursor around a set of blocks. You can also select and hold **⌘** or **Ctrl** while selecting the blocks you want to add. Selecting the file icon will create a group.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-grouping-v11-60.png" alt="Grouping" />

## Folders

You can organize flows into folders in the sidebar. Using folders helps streamline navigation and maintain a cleaner workspace. The following procedures guide you through setting up and managing folders to keep your flows organized.

### Create a folder

In the Flows sidebar, click <img alt="Create a new folder or flow" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> and select **New folder**. An empty folder named **New Folder** appears in the sidebar.

### Add a flow to a folder

In the Flows sidebar, you can drag and drop an existing flow into a folder.

To create a new flow in an existing folder, hover over the folder and click <img alt="View more actions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more**, then select **Create flow**.

### Rename a folder

In the Flows sidebar, hover over a folder and click <img alt="View more actions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more**, then select **Rename**. Enter a new name for the folder.

### Add a folder to an existing folder

In the Flows sidebar, hover over a folder and select <img alt="View more actions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more > Create folder**. You can also drag and drop a folder into another folder.

### Delete a folder

In the Flows sidebar, hover over a folder and select <img alt="View more actions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more > Delete**. You'll be prompted to confirm the deletion. The deleted folder's contents will move up one level to the containing folder or the sidebar.


# Share links to flows and embed flows in websites

You can share flows by sending links or embedding iframes in websites and other online resources. This enables colleagues and anyone with internet access to see your flows on public websites, internal wikis, and online documentation. By sharing flows both inside and outside the Postman API platform, you can foster development, streamline testing, and effectively promote your APIs.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-embedded-flow-hero-v11-69.png" alt="Embedded flow" />

## Share a flow with a link

You can share a flow by providing a link to the flow in the Postman web app.

To share a link to a flow, do the following:

1. In your flow, click <img alt="Share icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-share-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Share or embed this flow**.

2. Click the **Share** tab, then click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> **Copy link to Flow**. The link is copied to your clipboard.

3. Share the link with anyone. When someone clicks the link, Postman prompts them to sign in or create an account. They can then view, run, or edit the flow in Postman, depending on their [workspace role](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#workspace-roles).

## Embedded flows

By sharing embedded flows, you can extend your flows' reach beyond the Postman API platform. Anyone can view an embedded flow, with or without a Postman account. You can embed a flow as an iframe in a website or an application. You can also share a link to an embedded flow, so the recipient can view the flow without signing in to Postman.

## Create an embedded flow

1. [Create a flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) or open an existing flow.

2. Click <img alt="Share icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-share-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Share or embed this flow > Embed > Create an embedded flow**.

3. Give the embedded flow a title, a description, and a frame color. You can also use the **Blocks** dropdown list to give names and descriptions to the blocks in your embedded flow.

4. Click **Create > Save**.

## Share an embedded flow

1. In your flow, click <img alt="Share icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-share-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Share or embed this flow > Embed**, then click the embedded flow you want to share.

2. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy iframe code** to copy the embedded flow's iframe code, or click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy link** to copy the embedded flow's URL.

3. Add the iframe code to a website or other online resource, or share the URL.

## Update an embedded flow

If you make changes to a flow that was used to create an embedded flow, those changes aren't automatically applied to the embedded flow.

To update an embedded flow to reflect changes, do the following:

1. Open the changed flow and click **Share or embed this flow > Embed**.

2. Click the embedded flow you want to update.

3. Click **Update to latest flow version > Save**. Any iframes or links that point to the embedded flow will show the changes.

## Delete an embedded flow

1. In your flow, click **Share or embed this flow > Embed**.

2. Hover over the embedded flow you want to delete and click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Delete**.


# Create Postman requests and variables using Postman Flow blocks

You can send API requests and receive responses in your flows with the **HTTP Request** block. Your flow can then evaluate and transform the response data to inform its logic, make decisions, and pass relevant information to other blocks.

API requests often use different data each time they're sent. For example, a request to a weather API might specify a different city each time. In Postman, you can use *variables* to manage interactions with APIs that expect or respond with data that changes from request to request.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  To learn how to create a request in a flow, check out [this Postman Flows tutorial](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/beginner/send-request/).
</Info>

## Requests

With the **HTTP Request** block, you can select an existing request from a collection in your workspace, or create a new request.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-HTTP-block-request-v11-60.png" alt="Select a request" width="280px" />

If the workspace contains no collections, you can get started by choosing from the suggested requests that appear under the **Spotlight** heading.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Flows can run requests that use files in your local [working directory](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/#working-directory) to send [body data](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/parameters/). To make collaboration and publishing your flow easier, [upload your test data files](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/test-data/) to your Postman team.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can run requests with scripts that import packages from your team's [Postman Package Library](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/). Learn how to [add packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#add-a-package) to the package library, and [import packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/package-library/#import-a-package) into your scripts. You can also run collections that [import external packages](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) from npm or JSR package registries.
</Info>

## Variables

*Variables* are values that can change from one request to another. These can be things like IDs, usernames, and numbers.

When the selected request uses variables, the variables part of the **HTTP Request** block opens automatically and enables you to [insert a data block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) and enter a value.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-http-block-variable-v11-60.png" alt="Request with a variable" />

In this request, the variable is named `method` and its value is the string `GET`. (For more information on setting up variables in requests, see [Store and reuse values using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/).) Once the request runs, you can preview the response by clicking the **Success** output port. The response body includes the request's URL, which uses a GET method defined by the variable.

### Environment variables

You can configure the [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/) block in local flows so that environment variable values changed by pre-request and post-request scripts persist or reset when the block's run completes. To learn more, see [Update environment variables with scripts](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/#update-environment-variables-with-scripts).

To turn persistent changes to environment variables on or off, do the following:

1. Click the **HTTP Request** block.

2. Click <img alt="Additional Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

3. Next to **Allow persistent changes to environment values**, turn the toggle on or off. <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-toggle-off-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> Left is off, <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-toggle-on-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> right is on.


# Version flows with snapshots

*Snapshots* enable you to save, view, and restore versions of your flows. With snapshots, you can create and manage reliable versions of your flows to share with others. You can also experiment with design ideas without fear of breaking a functioning flow.

## Create a snapshot

To create a snapshot of a flow, do the following:

1. In Postman, [create a flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) or select a flow from the sidebar.

2. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Snapshots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snapshots**.

3. Click **Create Snapshot**.

4. Enter a message that describes this version of your flow.

5. Click **Create**. The first snapshot is automatically titled **Snapshot 1**. The newest snapshot's title includes the label **LATEST**. Additional snapshots are automatically numbered in sequence like **Snapshot 2** and **Snapshot 3**.

6. To create more snapshots, click <img alt="Add snapshot" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add snapshot**, enter a message, and click **Create**.

## View a snapshot

When you view a snapshot, Postman loads that version of your flow on the canvas. While viewing a snapshot, you can run the flow but you can't edit it. To edit a snapshot's flow, you must [restore](#restore-a-snapshot) the snapshot. Viewing a snapshot doesn't override the current state of your flow.

To view a snapshot, do the following:

1. Select a flow from the sidebar.

2. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Snapshots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snapshots**.

3. Select the snapshot you want to view. That version of the flow appears on the canvas, along with a message that lets you know you are viewing a snapshot.

4. To run the flow, click **Run**.

5. To stop viewing the selected snapshot and return to the latest version of the flow, click **Exit**.

## Restore a snapshot

When you restore a snapshot, you can run and edit that version of your flow. Restoring a snapshot will override the current state of your flow.

To restore a snapshot, do the following:

1. Select a flow from the sidebar.

2. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Snapshots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snapshots**.

3. Next to the snapshot you want to restore, click <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More actions**.

4. Click **Restore**. A warning appears to let you know that restoring the snapshot overrides the current state of your flow.

5. Click **Restore Snapshot**. The snapshot's version of your flow appears on the canvas, and you can run and edit it.

## Archive a snapshot

You can archive snapshots you no longer need. Archived snapshots can't be viewed, run, or restored. For example, you could archive a snapshot of a flow that no longer works due to underlying API changes, or a snapshot of a flow that includes sensitive information.

To archive a snapshot, do the following:

1. Next to the snapshot you want to archive, click <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **More actions**.

2. Select **Archive**. In the confirmation that appears, click **Archive Snapshot**.


# Configure values for flows

When working with flows, you'll often want to include static values for the blocks to use. This includes both parameters used in HTTP requests and variables used in other kinds of blocks.

In Postman these values are called *configurations*. This topic explains how to use configurations - it's similar to using [environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/) in a collection - and what to expect when others use your flow in the cloud.

The **Configurations** panel in a flow's **Settings** is the place where you'll specify these values. When you set the type of a configuration to **Secret** there, Postman encrypts it and stores it securely.

<img alt="Select the same workspace" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/actions-config-panel-v11-75.png" width="280px" />

Users who clone a flow you've deployed won't see the values you've set, but they will see the names of all the configurations you've created. They can then enter the values needed to run it on their own systems.

To use a configuration that you've set, add a [**Get Configuration**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-configuration/) block on the canvas or inline within another type of block.

This topic assumes that you have begun to [create](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) a flow.

## Identify values your flow will need

Here are some examples of the kinds of values your flows might need:

* API keys that **HTTP Request** blocks use to communicate with APIs
* Channel IDs for Discord, Slack, or similar platforms
* Version numbers for APIs that your flow calls
* Secret keys that **Evaluate** blocks use to compute HMAC signatures for HTTP headers

Often, a particular value will be used in multiple places within a flow. When you change a value in the **Configurations** panel, Postman applies that single change throughout the flow. This helps when, for example, you need to change the target Slack channel your flow sends messages to, or to update the version of an API your flow calls.

Before creating configurations for your flow, it's a best practice to figure out what values your flow will need and decide how you want Postman to treat each value. The options are `Secret`, `String`, `Bool`, and `Number`.

## Create or view configurations for your flow

To create configurations, complete the following steps. To view configurations, stop once you get to **Configurations**.

1. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow Settings**.
2. Under **Configurations**, create and set the desired values.
3. By default, Postman designates values entered here as <img alt="Locked icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-locked-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Secret**, and encrypts the values. For values that you don't want to treat as secrets, use the dropdown to set their type to <img alt="String icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-string-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **String**.

## Create a Get Configuration block

You can either add a **Get Configuration** block on the canvas, or insert one inline in the blocks listed [in the Get Configuration reference](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-configuration/#setup).

## Override configuration values when deploying flows

When [deploying](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) a flow, you can temporarily override the value of a configuration. This helps when, for example, you create and test a flow in a development environment, but deploying the flow into production requires overriding one or more configurations.

To deploy a flow while overriding configurations, do the following:

1. Click **Deploy**.
2. From the **Configurations** dropdown, enter new values for the configurations you want to override.
3. Enter values for all other required or desired settings.
4. Click **Deploy** within the deployment dialog.

The new value will only override the original value for the deployment where you've configured. For users who access the flow at its deployment URL, the new value will apply.

When you return to the flow, its configuration keeps the original value. If you deploy the flow a second time, Postman restores the original value, because overrides you make in one deployment don't automatically carry over into subsequent deployments.

## Use configurations instead of environment variables

When you first create and test requests in a collection, you'll typically use environment variables. When you use those same requests in a flow, however, you'll want to recreate those environment variables as configurations.

Using configurations rather than environment variables is a best practice for the following reasons:

* While only **HTTP Request** blocks can access environment variables, any kind of block can access configuration values.
* For security reasons, cloning a flow doesn't clone its environment. By contrast, cloning does clone the key names, but never the values, of the flow's configurations. Postman will require whoever clones the flow to enter their own values for those configurations. This makes flows that use configurations, rather than environments, ideal for sharing.
* When deploying a flow, you can't override an environment; you'll need to update every request manually.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Note that you can't access configurations from a pre- or post-request script.
</Info>


# Assign input values with scenarios

*Scenarios* are sets of values assigned to [**Start**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) block inputs. You can define multiple scenarios with different values for inputs, and change between scenarios for different use cases. For example, scenarios are convenient when you're testing flows that require the same inputs but different values for each test. They're also useful when you want to use different input values for a beta or production deployment.

## Start block inputs

You can [add inputs to the **Start** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/#receive-data-with-inputs) to receive data from a scenario. The **Start** block can then pass that data to other blocks as key-value pairs. The key is the input's name and the value is any data received by the input.

## Create a scenario

When you add inputs to the **Start** block, you can assign them values with a scenario. Your flow will then use the scenario's values when it runs. To create a scenario, do the following:

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

1.[Add one or more inputs to your **Start** block.](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/#receive-data-with-inputs)

1. In the right sidebar, click <img alt="Scenarios" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-scenarios-icon-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> **Scenarios** > **Create scenario**. The scenario editor appears with editable fields for each input in the **Start** block.

2. Enter data for each input field.

3. Click **Save**.

## Run a flow using scenario data

Once you've created a scenario, you can run the flow using the scenario's data as values assigned to the **Start** block's inputs. To run a flow using a scenario's data, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Scenarios" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-scenarios-icon-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> **Scenarios**.

2. Hover over the scenario you want to use and click **Run**. The flow runs using data defined in the scenario.

## Secrets in scenarios

When adding inputs to the [**Start** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/), you can designate an input as <img alt="Locked icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-locked-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Secret** provided its value will be a string. Postman encrypts the values of **Secret** inputs and stores them securely, giving you a safe way to handle API keys or other sensitive values in your flows. Postman redacts them in run logs, **Output** blocks, and the Console, even when used in flows referenced by **Flow** blocks.

When you clone a flow that has a secret input, the input appears in the **Start** block and scenarios pane, but its value is left blank and is never present in the clone.

In the Scenarios pane, inputs designated as <img alt="Locked icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-locked-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Secret** in the **Start** block:

* Also have type <img alt="Locked icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-locked-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Secret**.
* Are shown with their values masked by default.

What you can do with secret inputs depends on your permissions:

* Flow Editors can unmask secret inputs by clicking <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Show**. They can create, edit, and save secret input values.
* Runners can run flows with secret inputs, but can't view their values. At runtime, Postman decrypts secret values if needed, without making them visible.
* Viewers can't run flows with secret inputs, and can't view the values of secret inputs.

## Edit a scenario

You can change and save the values in a scenario. To edit a scenario, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Scenarios" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-scenarios-icon-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> **Scenarios**.

2. Hover over the scenario you want to edit and click **Edit**.

3. Enter new values in the input fields.

4. Click **Save**.

## Rename a scenario

You can change a scenario's name. To rename a scenario, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Scenarios" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-scenarios-icon-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> **Scenarios**.

2. Hover over the scenario you want to delete and click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> the more actions icon > **Rename**.

3. Enter a new name.

4. Press the **Return** or **Enter** key.

# Visualize data in Postman Flows

The **Display** block accepts information from other blocks and creates a visualization of that information. You can select from several visualization types.

<img alt="Output block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/stock-charts-v11-60.png" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

This image shows four types of output visualization types: [line chart](#line-chart), [text](#text), [gauge](#gauge), and [Boolean](#boolean). You can find links to example flows for other visualization types in the [Visualization types](#visualization-types) section.

## Visualization types

The **Display** block supports the following types of output:

|                               |                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                     |

## Text

When a **Display** block receives a string, it automatically selects the **Text** visualization type and shows the text.

To create an example text **Display** block, do the following:

1. Create an **HTTP Request** block with a GET request to `postman-echo.com/get`.

2. Create and connect a **Select** block to the **HTTP Request** block and enter `body.headers.host`. This selects a string from the response.

3. Create a **Display > Text** block, then connect the **Select** block to the **Display** block.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     To adjust the text size, select the **Display** block, then click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings > Text size**.
   </Info>

4. Click **Run** in the Flows toolbar. The **Display** block displays the `postman-echo.com` string from the `body.headers.host` response.

## Boolean

When a **Display** block receives a message that's either true or false, it automatically selects the **Boolean** visualization type, displaying **True** or **False**.

To create an example Boolean **Display** block, do the following:

1. Create an **HTTP Request** block with a GET request to `postman-echo.com/get`.
2. Create and connect an **Evaluate > FQL** block to the **HTTP Request** block and enter the `value1.http.status = 200` [FQL](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) query. This query checks if the response returns a `200` status code.
3. Create and connect a **Display > Boolean** block to the **Evaluate** block and run the flow. If the response has a `200` status code, the **Display** block shows a circle that says **True**. If not, the circle shows **False**.

## Line chart

The **Line Chart** visualization type accepts two lists and plots them on X and Y axes in a chart. The first list received is the X axis, and the second list is the Y axis.

To create an example line chart **Display** block, do the following:

1. In the **Start** block, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add input**. Enter "List 1" for the first input, then add another input and enter "List 2". Change both inputs to <img alt="List icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-list-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **List**.
2. In the right sidebar, select <img alt="Scenarios" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-scenarios-icon-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> **Scenarios** > **Create scenario**.
3. Enter `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]` for **List 1**'s data and `[100, 200, 300, 400]` for **List 2**'s data. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**.
4. Create a **Display > Line Chart** block, then connect the **List 1** and **List 2** inputs in the **Start** block to the **Display** block.
5. Click **Run** in the Flows toolbar. A line chart displays the data on their respective axes.

## Gauge

The **Gauge** visualization type shows a value's position in a range using a half-pie chart.

To create an example gauge **Display** block, do the following:

1. Create an **HTTP Request** block with a GET request to `techcrunch.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`.
2. Create and connect an **Evaluate > FQL** block to the **HTTP Request** block.
3. In the **Evaluate** block, enter the `$count(value1.body)` [FQL](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) query to count how many items the response body contains.
4. Create a **Display > Gauge** block. Connect it to the **Evaluate** block.
5. Connect the **Display** block to the **Evaluate** block, then click **Run**. The gauge shows the number of items in the response body as the shaded part of the graph.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     To set the minimum and maximum values for the gauge, click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings** in the **Display** block.
   </Info>


# Check flow health and run history

The **Analytics** tab in Postman Flows provides details about how flows in the Postman Cloud are performing. Use the **Analytics** tab to monitor when, how often, and how long flows run in the cloud, and whether they succeed or fail. In the displayed run logs, you can open any individual block and view its success/failure status, data input and output, and further details.

To see the **Analytics** tab in Postman Flows, do the following:

1. From the **Flows** tab, click <img alt="Home icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-home-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flows Home > Analytics**.

   <img alt="Flows analytics tab" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-analytics-v11-75-1.png" />

2. Select a time range from the dropdown list to display runs from that time. You can filter the list of runs by run ID, flow name, status, and trigger type.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You can get the run ID from the response's `x-session-id` header.
   </Info>

3. Click a run in the list to open the **Run Details** pane.

4. After a flow completes its run, the **Run Details** pane shows each block's status (<img alt="Flows success icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-success-icon-v11-46.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> **Success** or <img alt="Flows error icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-failure-icon-v11-46.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> **Fail**). Click the **Run Logs** dropdown lists to filter by block and status.

5. Select a block from the list to see its input, output, and details.

6. If your flow uses [**Flow** blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/), click <img alt="Right Large icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-right-large.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **View module blocks** next to the **Flow** block's name to view the input, output, and details for its constituent blocks.


# Demo your flows with slides

You can create on-canvas demos and tutorials for your flows with *slides*. Slides in Postman Flows enable you to create slide-deck presentations that focus on specific areas and blocks in your flow. These presentations provide an effective way to show and explain your flows to colleagues and other flows users.

## Create slides

To create slides in flows, do the following:

1. Position your flow's blocks and canvas how you want them to appear in the first slide of your presentation.

2. Click <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/slides-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Slides** in the right sidebar.

3. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add slide**. An image of the flow's current state is added to the presentation as a slide.

4. Enter a name for the slide.

5. Reposition the canvas (for example, zoom in on the block you want to describe next in the presentation) and click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add slide** to add another slide to the presentation.

6. Enter a name for the slide.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until your presentation is complete. Click <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-close-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to close the presentation.

# Connect third-party services to flows

You can connect third-party services to flows with **Connector** blocks. Once connected, your flow can interact with the service through predefined tasks called *operations*.

Learn more about [**Connector blocks**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/connector/).

## Connect a third-party service to a flow

To connect a third-party service to a flow, do the following:

1. In [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/), [create a flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).
2. Right-click the canvas and select a **Connector** block for a third-party service.
3. Click **Select an operation...** and select the operation you want the block to perform.
4. Click **Connect** and follow the prompts to connect your account.
5. Connect blocks' input and output ports as needed.


# Troubleshoot Postman Flows

Whether you're developing an application with code or building a flow with Postman Flows, sometimes things don't work as expected. *Troubleshooting* is the process of identifying the cause of the difference between what your flow is doing and what you expect it to do. Postman Flows includes several built-in tools to help with troubleshooting.

## Preview inputs, outputs, and details

Most blocks give you a preview of their input and output data when you click them in your flow. The **Create with AI** block also has a **Details** preview that shows its prompt. The preview feature is useful for confirming the incoming and outgoing data are what's expected. To preview the data, click the block, then click **Input**, **Output**, or **Details**.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-input-output-preview-v11-60-2.png" width="280px" alt="Preview input and output data" />

## The Display block

The **Display** block doesn't change the information that passes through it, which makes it ideal for monitoring the data flowing between two blocks. Sometimes, **HTTP Request** blocks can return large amounts of information and most of it isn't relevant to the issue you're troubleshooting. Selecting only the relevant information and displaying it in a **Display** block can simplify the process.

<img alt="Troubleshooting with the Display block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-troubleshooting-display-v11-60.png" />

## Run logs

*Run logs* can help you troubleshoot by providing insight into block activity for specific runs. Click <img alt="Flows run log icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-flowsRunLog-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open run logs panel** from the tool bar to open the **Run Log** pane. From the **Run Log** pane, you can click individual runs based on their start time, then click blocks to see their input data, output data, and details. You can also filter results by block type and run status.

<img alt="Run log pane" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-run-log-pane-11-60.png" />

## The Postman Console

Every request and response is sent to the Postman Console, which keeps a history of events that happened in a flow. If something specific needs to be displayed in the Console, use the **Log** block to send the information there. This can be useful when using loops because a **Display** block shows only the last item passed through it once the flow finished running.

<img alt="Postman Console in Flows" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-console-v11-60.png" />

### General tips

* If a request is failing, check the run logs and Console to inspect the request, and make sure all of the variables are set as expected.
* If a request uses environment variables, make sure the correct environment is selected in the **HTTP Request** block.
* Put either **Display** blocks or **Log** blocks at every place the information flows when things aren't working as expected.
* Test only one possible cause at a time to isolate the issue to a single block.


# Webhook migration guide

Webhooks will be sunset on February 11, 2026. Any existing flows that use webhooks will stop running after this date. You can preserve these flows' functionality by migrating them to [flows running in the cloud](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/), a more powerful, cloud-based alternative to webhooks. This guide shows how to migrate your workflows to flows running in the cloud.

## Benefits of migrating webhooks to flows running in the cloud

Flows running in the cloud provide everything webhooks offered, plus the following:

* **Cloud deployment** - Your flows run reliably in the cloud in addition to running locally in the Postman cloud runtime environment.

* **Built-in scheduling** - Run flows in the cloud automatically at custom intervals with [scheduled flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#schedule-a-flow-to-run-automatically).

* **Better observability** - Track run history, logs, and performance metrics in [analytics](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/analytics/).

* **Version control** - [Snapshot](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/) and manage different versions of your workflows.

## Differences between webhooks and flows running in the cloud

# Flows reference

The Flows reference section provides descriptions, details, and examples for blocks, TypeScript functions, and Flows Query Language (FQL).

## Blocks reference

Learn about each block's inputs, outputs, and setup options, in the [blocks reference section](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/). You can also see what blocks are often used together.

## TypeScript functions

Learn how and where you can [use TypeScript](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/) to enhance logic and functionality in the logic blocks of your Postman Flows.

## Flows Query Language

Learn how to use [*Flows Query Language*](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) in your flows to parse and transform JSON data to get the fields and structure you want. You can also discover when to use FQL as opposed to TypeScript.


# Blocks reference

A *block* is a fundamental unit of a flow. Each block stores information or performs a task. You can configure a block to fit your specific use case. Blocks may have input ports, output ports, or both. You can use these ports to connect your blocks and route information or trigger a flow that's running in the Postman cloud.

The blocks reference section contains a topic for each block describing its inputs, outputs, setup, and usage options. These topics also include links to example flows and related blocks.

The following types of blocks are available in Postman Flows:

* [Actions](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-action-blocks/) - Used to perform actions like sending an HTTP request or referencing another flow.
* [Trigger](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-trigger-blocks/) - Start the run of a flow or send data back to a request made to a deployed flow's URL.
* [AI](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-ai-blocks/) - Use natural language to generate text and images, and send AI requests.
* [Logic](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-logic-blocks/) - Route data in a flow using conditions, evaluations, or branching logic.
* [Looping](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-looping-blocks/) - Repeat a set of blocks based on a count or list.
* [Visualize](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-visualize-blocks/) - Display data as graphs, tables, or raw output.
* [Data](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-data-blocks/) - Create and manipulate data types like strings, numbers, lists, and objects.

## Insert data blocks into other blocks

Some blocks support inserting data blocks to access the data blocks' values. For example, you can insert a [**String**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/string/) block into a [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/) block to include the **String** block's value as an item in the **List** block's array.

To insert a block, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** and select a block from the dropdown list.

<img alt="Insert a data block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/embed-data-block-v11-2.jpg" width="280px" />


# Action blocks overview

*Action blocks* include the following:

* [**Connector**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/connector/)
* [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/)
* [**Flow**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/)


# Connector blocks

<img alt="Connector block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-connector-block-v11-65.png" width="245px" />

**Connector** blocks enable flows in Postman Flows to interact with supported third-party services like Calendly and Figma. There's a dedicated **Connector** block for each supported app, with app-specific operations to choose from. For example, the **Connector** block for Figma has an operation that gets all the comments from a Figma file.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A **Connector** block consumes two credits each time it runs. To learn more, see [How Flows consume credits](/docs/billing/flows-usage/#how-flows-consume-credits).
</Info>

## Inputs

**Connector** block inputs vary depending on the app and the selected operation. For example, for the Figma **Connector** block's **Get a File by ID** operation, there is a **File ID** input that accepts a string. For the Calendly **Get Available Times for Event Type** operation, there are three inputs that accept the **Event Type**, **Start Time**, and **End Time** strings.

## Outputs

**Connector** blocks have a **Result** output that sends the result of the selected operation.

## Setup

A new **Connector** block has two fields: **Operation** and **Account**. Under **Account**, click **Connect** to connect a new account to the block. If you've already connected one or more accounts, click **Select an account** to select one.

Click **Select an operation...** to open a dropdown list of operations. *Operations* are predefined tasks the **Connector** block can perform with its app. Different operations have different required and optional inputs. When you select an operation and its associated inputs appear, you can provide data for the required inputs [from other blocks' outputs](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-connections/) or [inserted data blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks).

To learn more, see [Connect third-party services to Flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/flows-connectors/flows-connectors/).


# The HTTP Request block

<img alt="The HTTP Request block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-http-request-v11.53.2-v2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **HTTP Request** block runs an HTTP request that you select from a collection and sends the result from its output port.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **HTTP Request** block consumes one credit each time it runs. To learn more, see [How Flows consume credits](/docs/billing/flows-usage/#how-flows-consume-credits).
</Info>

## Input

**Send** - If you connect another block to this input port, that block triggers the **HTTP Request** block to run. This connection is optional. The **HTTP Request** block will run when the flow runs, even if this port isn't connected to another block.

**Variables** - If the selected request obtains values from variables, those variables will be listed here. Requests can use variables to set values for query parameters and for elements of the request body.

To learn how to set or override these variable values, see [Setup](#setup).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When a request is created in a collection, if a query parameter's value was set without using a variable:

  * No variable will be listed for it in the **HTTP Request** block.

  * There is no way to override its value from a flow.
</Info>

## Outputs

**Success** - Sends the response of a successful API request. To succeed, a request must return a 2xx HTTP status code and pass all of its [tests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/test-scripts/).

**Fail** - Sends the response of an unsuccessful API request. A request will fail if it returns an HTTP status code other than 2xx or if any of its tests fail. If your request is returning a 2xx HTTP status code but failing a test, you might want to disregard the test temporarily. In this case, you can connect a block to the **Fail** output and that block will receive the data returned by the request.

## Setup

**Find or create new request** - Click to open a dropdown list showing all the collections in your workspace. Select a collection, then select a request or **Create a new request**. If there are no collections in the workspace, some introductory requests will appear that you can choose from to get started.

**Variables** - To assign a value to a variable, use either of the following methods:

* Connect another block's output port to the variable's input port.

* Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to [Insert a data block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) inline.

You can also use these value assignment methods if your request obtains values using environment variables or [dynamic variables](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/).

* If your request uses environment variables, corresponding variables will appear in the **HTTP Request** block. You can select the environment from the <img alt="Environment icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-environment-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add environment** dropdown list. If you can't or don't want to use the relevant environment, re-create the desired values using one of the value assignment methods.

* If your request uses [dynamic variables](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/variables-list/), the dynamic variables will work as usual in your flow. If you want to override their values, use one of the value assignment methods to assign the values you prefer.

Here's an example showing different ways that query parameters can obtain their values:

<img alt="HTTP Request block with variables" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-http-request-variabels-v11-54.6.jpg" />

In the example, the request URL is:

```javascript
https://postman-echo.com/get?pickanumber={{$randomInt}}&pickacolor={{chosenColor}}&pickaday={{chosenDay}}
```

The query parameters obtain their values as follows:

* `pickanumber` would get its value from the dynamic variable `{{$randomInt}}`, but the connected **Number** block overrides it with the value 531.

* `pickacolor` gets its value from the variable `{{chosenColor}}` in an inline **Get Variable** block that references a **Create Variable** block. That **Create Variable** block gets its value (`sea green`) from a connected **String** block.

* `pickaday` gets its value (`Tuesday`) from the environment variable `{{chosenDay}}` that's set in the selected environment `Test env with day`.

This example shows how a flow stores and retrieves values with **Create Variable** and **Get Variable** blocks. You can also store values as [configurations](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/configure-values-actions/) and retrieve them with [**Get Configuration** blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-configuration/).

### Create a new request

To create new and edit existing requests, you can use the Postman Flows request editor that's built into the **HTTP Request** block. To create a request in the **HTTP Request** block, do the following:

1. Click **Find or create new request** to open a dropdown list showing the collections in your workspace.

2. Select a collection and click **Create a new request**. If you don't have any collections, click **Create a new request**. The Postman Flows request editor opens.

   <img alt="Postman Flows request editor" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-request-editor-v11-1.png" width="280px" />

3. In the request editor, select a method from the dropdown list and enter a URL. Alternatively, you can copy a cURL command from your terminal and paste it here. Besides the URL, this add the parameters, headers, and body specified in your cURL command.

4. (Optional) Select and edit the request's name.

5. (Optional) Select and edit the request's parameters, headers, and body.

6. Click **Save**.

### Specify how to parse the response

The **HTTP Request** block can parse its response as JSON, XML, HTML, or text. By default, the **HTTP Request** block decides how to parse the response.

To choose your preferred way to parse the response, do the following:

1. Click the **HTTP Request** block.

2. Click <img alt="Additional Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

3. Next to <img alt="Parse Response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Parse Response**, click **Auto** to view the dropdown list of formats.

4. Select a format from the dropdown list.

### Update environment variables with scripts

Requests can change [environment variables'](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) values with [scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/). You can configure the [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/) block so that environment variable values changed by pre-request and post-request scripts persist or reset when the block's run completes. By default, script-changed values persist in new **HTTP Request** blocks. [Deployed flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) don't support persistent changed values for environment variables.

To turn persistent changes to environment variables on or off, do the following:

1. Click the **HTTP Request** block.

2. Click <img alt="Additional Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

3. Next to **Allow persistent changes to environment values**, turn the toggle on or off. <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-toggle-off-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> Left is off, <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-toggle-on-v11.png#icon" width="16px" /> right is on.

4. Select a format from the dropdown list.

## Example

To see the **HTTP Request** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: HTTP Request](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6841fe03a0431d0031dfd5f2).

## Related blocks

The [**Select**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/select/) and [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/) blocks are often connected to the **HTTP Request** block. The **Select** block is useful for extracting specific information from a response. The **Evaluate** block is useful for transforming response data and creating conditions to route data in your flow based on a response.

# The Flow block

<img alt="Flow block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flow-block-v11-81.png" width="280px" />

The **Flow** block references a [flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) from your workspace and outputs its result. This block lets you use the logic of multiple other flows in your current flow. By accepting input data and referencing other flows, **Flow** blocks can work like code functions.

Suppose you have two flows: flow A and flow B. Flow A checks the availability of meeting rooms in your office based on input data such as location, time, and room preference. It then outputs whether a room is available. Flow B can use a **Flow** block to send input data to flow A and retrieve its result (room availability), then use that result in its own logic (for example, to decide to send an API call that reserves the room).

The **Flow** block can reference any flow in your workspace that has at least one *snapshot*. Snapshots are saved versions of a flow. To learn more, see [Version flows with snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/).

## Inputs

By default, the **Flow** block has one **Run** input port and one input port for each input present in the **Start** block of the flow it references. When the **Run** port receives data, it triggers the **Flow** block. If it's not connected, the **Flow** block triggers when its host flow runs.

If the referenced flow has a [**Start**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) block with inputs, the **Flow** block will also have input ports that correspond with the **Start** block's inputs. For example, if a **Flow** block references a flow with three inputs defined in its **Start** block, the **Flow** block will have three input ports with the same names and data types as the **Start** block's inputs. Data sent to the **Flow** block's input ports will be passed to the corresponding **Start** block inputs in the referenced flow.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  When the referenced flow has **Start** block inputs, the **Flow** block must receive data in each of its corresponding input ports to trigger the referenced flow.
</Info>

## Outputs

The **Flow** block has one output port for each input port in the referenced flow's [**Output**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/) block. Each output port sends the value received by its corresponding input port in the referenced flow's **Output** block.

The **Flow** block also has a **Done** output port that sends a boolean true signal when the referenced flow has completed.

## Setup

When you add a **Flow** block, it prompts you to select a flow to reference. The **Flow** block can only reference flows in your workspace that have one or more [snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/).

To set up a **Flow** block, do the following:

1. Create a flow and add a **Flow** block. A list of flows you can reference appears.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     If the list is empty, make sure the flow you want to reference has at least one snapshot.
   </Info>

2. Select a flow from the list. The **Flow** block appears with the same title as the referenced flow. The latest snapshot number appears next to the title. When a newer version of the snapshot is available, the <img alt="Snapshots" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snapshots** icon turns purple.

### Select a different snapshot

When you add a **Flow** block, it automatically selects the latest snapshot of the referenced flow.

To select a different snapshot, do the following:

1. In the **Flow** block, click <img alt="Snapshots" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Snapshots**.

2. Select a snapshot from the dropdown list. The **Flow** block uses the selected snapshot of the referenced flow.

## Example

To see the **Flow** block in action, check out [Flow Snippets: Flow block](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6840b15868d0c30032a35bde).

## Related blocks

The [**Start**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) block is automatically added to every new flow. The [**Output**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/) block sends the result from one flow to a **Flow** block in a different flow.


# Trigger blocks overview

*Trigger blocks* include the following:

* [**Output**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/)
* [**Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/)
* [**Response**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/response/)
* [**Schedule**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/schedule/)
* [**Start**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/)


# The Output block

<img alt="Output block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-output-v11-75.png" width="357px" />

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This **Output** block is different from the previous version of the **Output** block, which became the [**Display**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-display/) block.
</Info>

The **Output** block receives data in one flow and sends that data to a [**Flow**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/) block in a different flow. The **Flow** block then sends the result from its output port. A flow can't have more than one **Output** block.

## Inputs and outputs

The **Output** block's inputs are referred to as *outputs* because they send data to a **Flow** block in a different flow. Each output can receive data through its corresponding input port. The **Output** block has no output ports. When a **Flow** block references the **Output** block's flow, the **Flow** block sends the **Output** block's data from its own output port.

* If the **Output** block has no outputs, the **Flow** block that references its flow will have no output port.

* If the **Output** block has one or more outputs, the **Flow** block that references its flow will have the same number of output ports.

## Setup

When you add an **Output** block to your flow, it has one input port and no outputs. A flow can't have more than one **Output** block.

To add an output to an **Output** block, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Add output" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add output**. A new output named **Output \<number>** appears.

2. Connect another block's output port to the **Output** block's input port. The icon next to the output changes to indicate the connected block's data type.

3. (Optional) Click the output's name to edit it.

4. (Optional) If the incoming data has more than one item, click **Enter path...** to specify which item to assign to the output.

## Example

To see the **Output** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Output](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6827a04b38266c0031de1e3c).


# The Request block

<img alt="Request block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-request-block-v11-75.png" width="280px" />

The **Request** block is a special block that's required to create a [deployable flow](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/) that runs in the Postman cloud. The **Request** block takes request data sent to a flow's URL and routes the data through its **Headers**, **Params**, and **Body** output ports. The only way to add a **Request** block to a flow is to change the [**Start** block's](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) trigger to **Request**. The **Request** block can't be deleted.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can change a **Request** block to a **Schedule** block to run the flow at regular intervals or at specific times. To learn how, see [Schedule a deployed flow to run automatically](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#schedule-a-flow-to-run-automatically).
</Info>

Prior to a flow being deployed to the cloud, the **Request** block gets values for headers, parameters, and the request body from [scenarios](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/). By running different scenarios, you can test how your flow will behave once it's running in the cloud. Testing with scenarios is necessary because the flow won't have a URL until you deploy it to the cloud.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **Request** block can ingest input data of up to 5 megabytes if you've [purchased the Flows add-on](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), or 1 megabyte if you're using Flows for free.
</Info>

## Outputs

* **Headers** - Sends the request headers to the flow's URL.
* **Params** - Sends the request's query parameters to the flow's URL.
* **Body** - Sends the request body to the flow's URL. Actions support JSON, `form-data`, and `x-www-form-urlencoded` formats.

## Setup

All deployable flows require either one **Request** block or one **Schedule** block. Flows with a **Request** block require at least one [**Response** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/response/).

To add a **Request** block to a flow, do the following:

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

2. In the **Start** block, click **Change trigger** and select <img alt="API icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-api-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Request**.

You can change a **Request** block to a **Schedule** block to run flows at specified times and intervals. To change a **Request** block to a **Schedule** block, in the **Request** block, click **Change trigger** and select <img alt="Calendar icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-calendar-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Schedule**. To learn more, see [The Schedule block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/schedule/).

To change a **Request** block back to a **Start** block, click **Change trigger** and select <img alt="Open right icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openRight-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Start**.

## Related blocks

Deployable flows require one **Request** or [**Schedule**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/schedule/) block. Deployable flows that have a **Request** block require at least one [**Response**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/response/) block.


# The Response block

<img alt="Response block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-response-v11.54.6.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Response** block is a special block that's required to create a [deployable flow](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/). The **Response** block sends data back to a request made to a flow's URL. It receives data from other blocks in the flow that are connected to its input ports. You can add multiple **Response** blocks to a flow, but there can only be one **Response** block for each branch of the flow's logic. You must design the logic such that whatever happens in the flow, only one **Response** block will be triggered.

<Note title="Note">
  The **Response** block only returns a response when the flow starts with a [**Request** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/).
</Note>

## Inputs

* **Status Code** - When an HTTP request is sent to a flow's URL, the flow determines what [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/) to send in the response. Every flow with a **Request** block requires at least one **Response** block that sends a 200 ("success") status code. This **Response** block, situated at the end of the flow's sequence of blocks, confirms that the flow completed its work.
* **Headers** (optional) - Add a key-value pair for every [HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers) that you want the flow's HTTP response to send. You can connect the **Headers** input to another block, if desired.
* **Body** - Specify an [HTTP response body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Messages#response_body) that you want the flow's HTTP response to send. The response body can be an empty string.

The **Response** block can accommodate the requirements of a variety of use cases besides those covered by these defaults. For details, see the [Setup](#setup) section.

## Setup

* **Status Code** - As described in the [Inputs](#inputs) section, the **Response** block sends a 200 status code by default. If you need a **Response** block to send a different status code, edit the number field.

More advanced options for HTTP status codes and **Response** blocks include the following:

* A flow can send success status codes from more than one **Response** block. For example, in addition to the **Response** block at the end of the sequence, you can connect another **Response** block to the **Request** block, near the beginning. This sends a success response at the moment an HTTP request reaches the flow's URL -- a useful data point for some testing and automation workflows.

* While you can add **Response** blocks to send 4xx ("failure") status codes, not every flow needs to do this. By default, when a flow running in the cloud fails, it automatically sends a 400 Bad Request code and records the failure in [Flows analytics](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/analytics/). This suffices for many internal automation use cases.

To include data from the flow in the response headers or body, connect one or more blocks to the corresponding input port. This is optional for the **Headers** input port and required for the **Body** input port:

* **Headers** - Deployed flows aren't required to send response headers. Use cases where you'll need them include those where you want to the deployed flow's client to be aware of the [content type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) being sent.

* **Body** - It's a best practice to always connect the **Body** input to another block. Consider the following options:

  * If you want the flow's response body to replicate the incoming request body, connect the **Response** block's **Body** input to the **Request** block's **Body** output.

  * If you want the flow to send a message immediately upon receiving a request, connect a **Template** or **Record** block with the desired "request received" message to the **Body** output of the **Request** block. Then connect the **Response** block's **Body** input to the **Template** or **Record** block.

  * If you want the flow to send an empty response body, connect a **Template** block with no content in its text box to the **Body** output of the **Request** block. Then connect the **Response** block's **Body** input to the **Template** block.

## Example

Here's an example that shows how content sent to the **Response** block's **Body** input port (in this case, a message) appears in the response body. To make it clear that the message ("Testing my flow URL") is present, the **Response** block's output is selected in the example. There's also a **Display** block to show that the **Template** block's output is what's being sent to the **Response** block.

<img alt="Response block example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-response-example-v11.56.1.jpg" />

## Related blocks

Deployable flows require one [**Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/) or [**Schedule**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/schedule/) block. Deployable flows that have a **Request** block require at least one **Response** block.


# The Schedule block

<img alt="Schedule block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-schedule-block-v11-75.png" width="280px" />

The **Schedule** block is a special block in [deployable flows](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/) that lets you specify when and how often a flow will automatically run in the cloud. The **Schedule** block replaces the **Request** block or **Start** block when you set a run schedule for the deployable flow. Like the **Request** and **Start** blocks, the **Schedule** block can't be deleted.

## Outputs

**Timestamp** - Sends the date and time as a JSON key/value pair with the following format:

```json
{
    "startTime": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ"
}
```

## Setup

To access the **Schedule** block in your flow, click **Change trigger** on the [**Start**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/start/) or [**Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/) block and select <img alt="Calendar icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-calendar-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Schedule**.

In the **Schedule** block's text box, enter a schedule in plain language and click **Apply**. For example, you could enter "Run every five minutes for one hour" or "Run every Tuesday at 2:00 PM PDT." The shortest time increment you can schedule is one minute. The longest is one year. To edit the schedule, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit Schedule**.

The **Schedule** block doesn't need to be connected to any other blocks to run the flow at the specified times. You can optionally connect the **Timestamp** output to any blocks you want to receive the time and date when the flow was triggered.

After you define the schedule, you can deploy the flow to begin the scheduled runs. To learn how, see [Deploy flows in the Postman cloud](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/).

## Example

The following example shows a flow with a **Schedule** block set to run the flow every Tuesday at 2:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time:

<img alt="Schedule block example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-schedule-block-example-v11-65.png" />


# The Start block

<img alt="Start block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-start-v11-75.png" width="485" />

The **Start** block is automatically added to every new flow. It triggers connected blocks to run, but connecting blocks to the **Start** block is optional. You can add inputs to this block that receive data from [scenarios](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/). You can also change the **Start** block to a [**Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/) or [**Schedule**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/schedule/) block so you can [deploy](/docs/postman-flows/reference/flows-actions-overview/) the flow to the Postman cloud.

## Inputs

By default, the **Start** block has no input ports. You can [add inputs](#receive-data-with-inputs) as desired. When you add an input to the **Start** block, Postman Flows creates a **Start Trigger** [scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/) and adds the inputs to it as key-value pairs. The input's name is the key, and the value is empty until you edit the scenario.

## Output

By default, the **Start** block has a single output port you can connect to other blocks. Any blocks connected to the **Start** block's output port will run when you click the **Run** button. If you add inputs to the **Start** block, each new input will have its own output port that sends data defined in the flow's [scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/).

## Setup

The **Start** block appears automatically on every new flow's canvas. A new **Start** block is connected to three buttons you can click to do the following:

* <img alt="Magic icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-magic-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Describe** - Open [agent mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/), where you can describe in plain language what you want your flow to do.
* <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Add blocks** - Open the [blocks list](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-blocks/) to add a block.
* <img alt="Collection Template icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-collection-template-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Browse templates** - Explore the [Flows Catalog](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/flows-catalog/).

### Receive data with inputs

You can add inputs to the **Start** block. Each input will appear as an inline [data block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-data-blocks/). When you add inputs to the **Start** block, Postman Flows automatically creates a [scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/) named **Start Trigger**. Each input you create adds an output port to the **Start** block. Each input also appears as a key-value pair in the **Start Trigger** scenario, where the key is the input's name and the value is empty. Edit the scenario to add values to the key-value pairs. The **Start** block will send these values when you run the flow locally.

To add an input to the **Start** block, do the following:

1. In the **Start** block, click <img alt="Add input" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add input**. A **String** block is inserted into the **Start** block.

2. (Optional) Click the dropdown list if you want to select a data block other than **String**. Use <img alt="Locked icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-locked-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Secret** for sensitive string values like API keys. To learn how secret inputs work, see [Secrets in scenarios](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/#secrets-in-scenarios).

3. Enter a name for the input.

4. Edit the **Start Trigger** scenario to assign data to the input.

### Specify inputs for a Flow block

When a [**Flow** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/) references a flow whose **Start** block has inputs, those inputs appear as named input ports in the **Flow** block. When other blocks send data to these ports, the **Flow** block will send that data to the corresponding inputs in the referenced flow's **Start** block. The values that the referenced flow produces will then be available through the **Flow** block's outputs. To learn more, see [The Flow block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/).

The scenarios you created to provide data to the inputs in the referenced flow's **Start** block won't be available to the **Flow** block. This means that in the flow containing the **Flow** block, you need to add blocks or scenarios to supply data to the inputs.

## Example

Suppose you make the following flow:

<img alt="HTTP Request block with variables" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-http-start-ex1-v11-75.png" />

You name the flow **Build wx message** and use a **Flow** block to reference it in another new flow. Encapsulating all the original flow's blocks in a single **Flow** block makes your new flow simpler and easier to understand.

Providing data to the **Flow** block's inputs is required. When testing the new flow, you create a scenario to provide the data. The result looks like this:

<img alt="HTTP Request block with variables" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-http-start-ex4-v11-56.0.jpg" />

## Related blocks

Upon creation, every flow has a **Start** block. If you add inputs to a **Start** block, they will become inputs in any [**Flow**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/flow-module/) block referencing the flow that contains the **Start** block.


# AI blocks overview

*AI blocks* include the following:

* [**AI Agent**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-agent/)
* [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/)
* [**AI Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-request/)


# The AI Agent block

<img alt="AI Agent block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-ai-agent-block-v11-50.jpg" width="280px" />

The **AI Agent** block is an AI assistant that can automate tasks in Postman Flows. It responds to natural language prompts by analyzing data, generating content, making decisions, and calling other flows.

The **AI Agent** block uses one of several AI models to interpret prompts and act on available context. You can pass data to the block as variables in the **Context** section, and each variable's *label* helps the block understand the variable's purpose. The **AI Agent** block can also use other flows as *tools* to complete its tasks.

For example, you could give the **AI Agent** block a list of API endpoints as a variable named **endpoints\_list**. Then, you could select a flow from the **Tools** section that sends a GET request to a provided endpoint. When you prompt the **AI Agent** block to “Get the content headers for each endpoint in endpoints\_list,” it will automatically run the tool for each one and output the results.

## Input

**Context** -  Variables you can reference in your prompt using plain text. The variable's name is called a *label* here because the **AI Agent** block interprets context about the variable’s value from the its label. For example, an **endpoints** label provides more context than a label like **variable-1**. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to add more variables. You can add variables to the **Context** section using any of the following data blocks:

* [**String**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/string/)
* [**Bool**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/bool/)
* [**Number**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/number/)
* [**Select**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/select/)
* [**Get Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-variable/)
* [**Get Configuration**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-configuration/)

## Outputs

**Result** - Sends the result of the **AI Agent** block's task.

## Setup

**Model** - Select the AI model from the dropdown list that best suits your task. Different models consume different amounts of credits. See [Manage your team's Postman Flows credit usage](/docs/billing/flows-usage/#how-flows-consume-credits) for details about how the **AI Agent** block consumes credits.

**Prompt** - The *system prompt* for the AI agent. A system prompt is static and persists for the duration of the task. Enter a prompt in natural language that describes what you want your agent to do. You can reference variables in the prompt by including the variables' labels as plain text. If you added tools to the block, the **AI Agent** block will automatically use them if needed to act on the prompt.

**Tools** - Tools are flows your **AI Agent** block can run automatically. The **AI Agent** block tries to generate any input data it needs from its own knowledge or from variables you've provided. To use a flow as a tool, the flow must have at least one [snapshot](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/).

To add a tool, do the following:

1. Click the **AI Agent** block.

2. Click **Add a tool**.

3. Select a tool from the dropdown list.

To select a different snapshot of a tool, do the following:

1. Hover over the tool.

2. Click <img alt="Versions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-versions-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />.

3. Select a snapshot from the dropdown list.

When a tool uses [inputs](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/), the **AI Agent** block will automatically populate those inputs with AI-generated data. You can also assign static values to the inputs with a [*configuration*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/configure-values-actions/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Flows doesn't pass static configuration data to the LLM to preserve the security of any secrets.
</Info>

To select a configuration for a tool, do the following:

1. Hover over a tool.

2. Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit Tool**.

3. Next to the input, click <img alt="Magic icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-magic-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **AI-generated**.

4. Select a configuration from the dropdown list or click <img alt="Open web icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openWeb-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add configuration** to create a new one.

**Additional Settings** - Appears when you click the block, and enables you to select an AI model or enforce an output schema that you can parse later in the flow.

To enforce an output schema, do the following:

1. Click the **AI Agent** block, then click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

2. Click <img alt="JSON icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-json-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Enforce output schema > <img alt="JSON icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-json-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> Schema**.

3. Click **Generate from example** and paste valid JSON data into the text box, then click **Generate schema**. Alternatively, click **Define custom schema** to manually enter a JSON schema.

# The Create with AI block

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **Create with AI** block is a [beta feature](https://www.postman.com/legal/terms/).
</Info>

<img alt="Create AI block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/create-with-ai-block-v10.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Create with AI** block uses artificial intelligence (AI) models to generate text, images, and JSON data based on your plain-language prompts. For example, you could enter a prompt like "Create a profile picture for a random person" or "Write a welcome email for a new employee at Postman".

You can assign another block's output to the **Create with AI** block's built-in variable, or [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) data blocks. You can then reference the variable or data block in your prompt using curly braces. To learn how, see [Setup](#setup).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The number of credits a **Create with AI** block consumes any given time that it runs depends on which model it's using. To learn more, see [How Flows consume credits](/docs/billing/flows-usage/#how-flows-consume-credits).
</Info>

## Input

Connect another block's output port to the **Create with AI** block's single input port to assign incoming data to a variable. Select the variable's name to edit it. Select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a data block into the **Create with AI** block. You can then assign a value to the data block and reference it in your prompt with curly braces like `{{this}}`.

## Output

The output port sends the data that the AI model creates. The symbol next to this output port changes depending on the type of data selected.

## Setup

You can set up the **Create with AI** block to generate text, images, or JSON. Select the type of content you want from the dropdown list next to the block's title. To let the block decide the type of content you want based on your prompt, select **Smart** from the dropdown list.

Click the text box to enter a prompt in plain language. Click **Run** to see how the block handles your prompt and if it needs to be reworded.

To insert a variable data block into your **Create with AI** block, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**. For example, you could insert a **String** block, name the variable `animal`, and reference it in a prompt like this: `Create an image of {{animal}}`. The **Create with AI** block generates an image of whatever animal is assigned to the variable `animal`. You can change an inserted block to a different data block by clicking the inserted block's icon and choosing a block from the dropdown list.

### Use Mustache syntax in AI prompts

The **Create with AI** block supports [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) syntax. You can use Mustache to dynamically format prompts, iterate over arrays, conditionally display text, and more.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If a referenced variable in your AI prompt contains an object, Mustache syntax in the **Create with AI** block returns the full JSON representation of the object, including field names, rather than `[object Object]`.
</Info>

### Change the AI model

To change the AI model and adjust its settings, do the following:

1. Click the **Create with AI** block, then click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

2. Click <img alt="Agent Mode icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **AI Model**, then select a model from the list.

3. (Optional) Click **Predictability** or **Creativity** to adjust their settings for the selected AI model. You can use the slider to set them higher or lower. A higher predictability value increases the chances of results repeating under the same conditions. A higher creativity value returns results with more variety.

## Example

To see the **Create with AI** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Create with AI](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6841fce881d05a003f60123b).

## Related blocks

You can insert a number of blocks into the **Create with AI** block to process their data including the [**String**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/string/), [**Bool**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/bool/), [**Number**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/number/), [**Null**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/null/), [**Select**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/select/), [**Now**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/now/), [**Date**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/date/), [**Date & Time**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/date-and-time/), and [**Get Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-variable/) blocks.


# The AI Request block

<img alt="AI Request block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-ai-request-block-v11-50-1.jpg" width="280px" />

The **AI Request** block runs an [AI request](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/create/) from your collection and sends the result from one of its output ports. The **AI Request** block is similar to the [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/) block, but instead of sending an HTTP request to an API, it sends a prompt to an AI model. If the prompt in your AI request includes variables in curly braces (`{}`), the variables appear at the bottom of the block.

To learn more about Postman's AI capabilities, see [Evaluate AI models and MCP servers with Postman](/docs/postman-ai/overview/).

## Input

**Send** - If you connect another block to this input port, that block triggers the **AI Request** block to run. This connection is optional. If no blocks are connected to the **Send** input, the **AI Request** block will run when the flow runs.

## Outputs

**Success** - Sends the response of a successful AI request. A successful request has a 2xx status code.

**Fail** - Sends the response of an unsuccessful AI request. An unsuccessful request has a status code other than 2xx.

## Setup

**Select a request** - Click this dropdown list to view all the collections in your workspace that contain AI requests. Select a collection, then select a request. To create a new request, select a collection then click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create a new request**. To edit the request in the right sidebar, hover over the request and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit request**.

**Variables** - If the selected request has [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/) in its prompt, they'll be listed here. You can assign a value to a variable by connecting another block's output port to the variable's input port, or by [inserting a data block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) with <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**. If your request uses environment variables, you can select the environment from the **Add environment** dropdown list.

### Specify how to parse the response

The **AI Request** block can parse its response as JSON, XML, HTML, or text.

To choose how to parse the response, do the following:

1. Click the **AI Request** block, then click <img alt="Additional Settings" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings**.

2. Click <img alt="Parse Response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Parse Response**.

3. Select a format from the dropdown list. You can also select **Auto** to let the **AI Request** block decide how to parse the response. The default setting is **Auto**.

## Example

To see the **AI Request** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: AI Request](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6849e3778fff02003235757d).

## Related blocks

The **Select** and **Evaluate** blocks are often connected to the **AI Request** block's **Success** output port. The **Select** block is useful for extracting specific information from a response. The **Evaluate** block is useful for transforming response data and creating conditions to route data in your flow based on a response. You can also insert or connect data blocks to provide values for any variables in the AI request's prompt.

The **Condition** block is a logical gate that routes data through one of multiple output ports based on the results of one or more conditions. It assigns incoming data to variables and checks the variables against a series of true/false expressions you provide. You can write the expressions using [TypeScript](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/) or [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL).

Each condition has an output port. The first condition that returns true sends the data from its corresponding output port. If no conditions return true, the data is routed through the **Default** output port. By combining multiple conditions, a single **Condition** block can do the work of multiple [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/) or [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/) blocks.

## Inputs

**variable** - You can connect a block to this input port or [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a data block to assign data to a [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/). You can then reference the variable in your expressions. You can also click <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to insert a data block into the **Condition** block. You can change an inserted block to a different data block by clicking the inserted block's icon and selecting a different block from the dropdown list.

**Condition \<number>** - Enter a true/false expression here using TypeScript or FQL. Click the dropdown list at the top of the block to select TypeScript or FQL. Click <img alt="Add condition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add condition** to add another **Condition** field. To rename a condition, hover over the condition's name and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit Title**. To delete a condition, hover over it and click <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-delete-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />.

## Outputs

The first condition that evaluates to true routes the input data through its output port, and the block stops checking conditions. For example, if **Condition 1** evaluates to false and **Condition 2** evaluates to true, the input data is routed through the **Condition 2** output port. Once a condition returns true, no other conditions are checked. If no conditions are true, the input data is routed through the **Default** output port.

## Setup

1. To receive and evaluate data from another block in your flow, connect the **variable** input port to the other block's output port.

2. (Optional) To [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a block and evaluate its data, click <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** then select a block from the dropdown list. You can reference the inserted block's value as a variable in your true/false expressions. To rename the variable, click the inserted block's name and enter a new name.

3. Click the dropdown list next to the block's title and select **TypeScript** or **FQL**.

4. Enter your true/false expression in the text box.

5. (Optional) Click <img alt="Add condition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add condition** to add another condition and enter an expression.

# The If block

<img alt="The If block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-if-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **If** block is a logical gate that routes data through one of two output ports based on the result of an evaluation. The **If** block can process and evaluate data using [TypeScript](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/) or [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) expressions.

<Tip title="Tip">
  The **If** block is one of two blocks you can use to do branching logic in a flow. The other one - the [**Condition** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/condition/) - supports a wider variety of use cases than the **If** block. Use the **If** block only if the your flow's logic must branch into exactly two logical paths, based on a single condition.

  One common use for the **If** block is to [find and filter data](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/find-and-filter-data/#contains).
</Tip>

## Inputs

**variable** - Connect a block to this input port to evaluate its data with TypeScript or FQL. Click <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a data block into your **If** block. You can change an inserted block to a different data block by selecting the inserted block's icon and choosing a block from the dropdown list.

**Text box** - Enter TypeScript (the default) or FQL code to create true/false expressions here. To switch between TypeScript and FQL, select from the dropdown list at the top of the block.

**Data** - Data received by this input port will be routed through either the **Then** or **Else** output port depending on whether the expression in the text box is true or false. If you don't need to pass any data through to those outputs, connect a **Bool** block to the **Data** input. (This avoids having the **If** block fail because the **Data** input has received no data.)

## Outputs

When the expression in the text box is true, the block routes data received by the **Data** input through the **Then** output port. Otherwise, the data is routed through the **Else** output.

The data sent through either port is only what the **Data** input receives, not the variables (if any) that you added as inputs to the evaluation expression.

## Setup

1. To receive and evaluate data from another block in your flow, connect the **variable** input port to the other block's output port.

2. To [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a block and evaluate its data, click <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**, then select a block from the dropdown list. You can reference the inserted block's value as a variable in your true/false expression. To rename the variable, select the inserted block's name and enter a new name.

3. Enter TypeScript (the default) or FQL code to create true/false expressions here. To switch between TypeScript and FQL, select from the dropdown list at the top of the block.

4. Enter your TypeScript or FQL expression in the text box.

## Example

The following example flow uses an **If** block to compare a random integer to a cutoff set at 350. The flow follows one branch if the input value exceeds the cutoff, and follows the other branch if the input is less than or equal to the cutoff.

Note that for the integer to appear in the **Display** blocks connected to the `THEN` and `ELSE` branches, it was necessary to send that data to the **Data** input. Sending it to an input for the text box didn't suffice, because data in the text box isn't available to the `THEN` and `ELSE` branches.

<img alt="An If block example flow" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-blocks-reference-if-example-v11.54.2.jpg" />

To run this flow, clone it from [Flow Snippets: If](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bcba94f3155f2e86b54eb0).

# The Validate block

<img alt="Validate block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-validate-block-v11.png" width="280px" />

The **Validate** block is a logical gate that checks incoming JSON data against a schema and routes the data based on the result. If the JSON data conforms to the schema, it's routed through the **Pass** output port. If the JSON doesn't conform to the schema, it's routed through the **Fail** output port. You can create your own schema in the **Validate** block or generate one automatically based on existing JSON data.

## Input

**Data** - Connect this input port to any block that sends JSON data. The **Validate** block checks the data it receives against a JSON schema.

## Outputs

**Pass** - Sends the received JSON data if it conforms to the schema.

**Fail** - Sends the received JSON data if it doesn't conform to the schema.

## Setup

To create a JSON schema, click **Generate from example** and paste valid JSON data into the text box, then click **Generate schema**. Alternatively, click **Define custom schema** to manually enter a JSON schema.

Connect the **Data** input port to the output port of a block that sends JSON data. The **Validate** block checks the incoming data against its schema.

# The Evaluate block

<img alt="Evaluate block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/evaluate-block-v11.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Evaluate** block is a powerful tool for manipulating and evaluating data. It's ideal for filtering data, conditionally running parts of your flow, and integrating complex logic.

Using [TypeScript](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/) scripts or [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) queries, you can set up the **Evaluate** block to process data and send the result. The **Evaluate** block has pre-defined snippets to help you create FQL queries.

## Input

**variable** - Accepts data from another block's output port.

## Output

**Result** - Sends the result of the script or query.

## Setup

The **Evaluate** block processes data it receives from its input ports and inserted [data blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-data-blocks/).

When created, the **Evaluate** block has one input port. When you connect another block to this port, the **Evaluate** block [inserts](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) a **Select** block and assigns the selected value to a variable named **value1**. To rename the variable, click it and enter a new name.

You can also change the inserted **Select** block to a different data block by clicking the <img alt="Flows select icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-flowsSelect-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Select** block's icon and choosing a data block from the dropdown list.

You can also insert more variable data blocks into the **Evaluate** block to process their data. For example, you could insert a **String** block into your **Evaluate** block, name the variable `string1`, and reference it in your query as `string1`. Click <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to insert a data block into your **Evaluate** block.

The **Evaluate** block has a text box where you can enter TypeScript to create scripts or FQL to create queries. Click the dropdown list at the top of the block to set the text box to use TypeScript or FQL. Then click inside the text box and enter your code. When the text box is set to use FQL, you can click **Snippets** and choose from a list of common tasks.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Flows can't modify environment variables, including by using scripts in **Evaluate** blocks.

# The Delay block

<img alt="The Delay block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-delay-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Delay** block receives data from one or more blocks, then waits for the specified number of milliseconds before sending the data from its output port. The timer starts when the **Delay** block receives data. If the **Delay** block receives data from multiple blocks, it waits for the specified amount of time before sending each block's data in the order the data was received.

## Input

The delay timer begins when the input port receives data. You can connect one or more blocks' output ports to the **Delay** block's input port.

## Outputs

When the delay is complete, the output port sends the data the **Delay** block received. If the **Delay** block received data from multiple blocks, each block's data is sent in the order it was received. The delay is applied to each block's data.

## Setup

**Delay** - Click the number and enter the number of milliseconds you want the **Delay** block to wait. You can increase or decrease the number with the plus and minus icons.

## Example

To see the **Delay** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Delay](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bcbaf6ead4e97c45493eb9).


# The OR block

<img alt="OR block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-or-block-v11-75.png" width="150px" />

The **OR** block receives data with two inputs, then sends the data from the input that received data first. The **OR** block is useful in flows where there are two paths leading to the same block (like an [**Output**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/) block) and only one path has data in a given run. Routing two paths through an **OR** block prevents the final block from waiting for data from both paths.

## Inputs

The **OR** block has two input ports. You can only connect a single block to each input port. The first input port that receives data routes the data to the output port.

## Output

The **OR** block has a single output port. It sends data from the input port that received data first.

## Example

To see the **OR** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: OR](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/691e4a1672545c0014faefd6).


# Looping blocks overview

*Looping blocks* include the following:

* [**Repeat**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/repeat/)
* [**For**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/for/)
* [**Collect**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/collect/)


# The Repeat block

<img alt="Repeat block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-repeat-block-v11-1.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Repeat** block functions as the starting point for a loop. The loop continues through the sequence of blocks that follows, and ends with a **Collect** block. You can use this kind of loop to perform a series of actions multiple times. See [Loops with the Repeat block](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#loops-with-the-repeat-block) and [Loops with external data](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-external-data/).

## Inputs

* **Count** - Specifies the number of times to run the **Repeat** block. Connect the input port to any block that sends a number.
* **Start** - Runs the block when it receives input. If there's no block connected, the **Repeat** block triggers when the block receives data on the **Count** input. For example, you could connect an **HTTP Request** block's **Success** output port to synchronize the **Repeat** block with the request's successful response.

## Output

**Index** - Sends the current run's index number. The first run's index number is 0.

## Setup

Connect any block that sends a number to the **Count** input port. Connect the **Index** output port to one or more blocks that you want to run a specific number of times. You can also connect the **Start** input port to another block's output to run the **Repeat** block when the other blocks send data.

## Example

This example shows a **Repeat** block triggering an **HTTP Request** block that sends its output through a **Select** block to a **Collect** block, with results displayed as a table.

<img alt="Repeat block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-repeat-v11-56.1.jpg" />

## Related blocks

To supply the integer that the **Repeat** block requires as input, use a **Number** block or any other block that sends a number.

Besides the Repeat block, the other option for beginning a loop is the [**For**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/for/) block. See [Loops with the for block](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#loops-with-the-for-block).

## Related pages

For more information about creating loops in Flows and tutorials that use the **Repeat** block, see the following:

* [Loops overview](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/)
* [Create a count-based loop with the Repeat block](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/beginner/create-count-based-loop/)
* [Create a list-based loop with the For block](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/beginner/create-list-based-loop/)


# The For block

<img alt="The For block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-for-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **For** block always serves as the beginning of a loop. See [Loops with the For block](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#loops-with-the-for-block). Technically, the **For** block is a control block used to repeatedly run a series of blocks in your flow. It accepts an array as input, and sends each item in the array from its output port, one item at a time.

At the end of the loop, after whatever blocks you use to process data within the loop, you must have a [**Collect** block](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/collect/). The **Collect** block gathers the individual items sent from the **For** block, and places them back into their original array order.

## Inputs

**List** - Accepts an array of values like `[1,2,3]` or `["one","two","three"]`. The **For** block requires an array to be sent this input in order to run.

**Start** - Connecting another block to this input port is optional. If no block is connected here, the arrival of data at the **List** input port triggers the **For** block.

If you do connect another block to the **Start** input, the **For** block runs only when it has received data from both connected blocks. This provides control over the order in which blocks run in your flow. For example, if you connect an **HTTP Request** block to the **Start** input, the **For** block will run only when data has arrived at *both* the **List** and **Start** inputs.

## Output

**Item** - Sends each item in the list sequentially, one at a time.

## Setup

To set up the **For** block, connect the **List** input port to another block's output port that sends an array. Blocks that can send an array include the following:

* A **List** block
* A **Get Variable** block with a variable that has an array
* An **Evaluate** block with an [inserted](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) **List** block
* A **Select** block that selects an array

Optionally, you can connect the **Start** input port to another block's output port to trigger the **For** block.

## Example

To see the **For** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: For](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63b89820a365885b55bc51f6).

## Related blocks

To supply the array that the **For** block requires as input, use any of the blocks described in the [Setup](#setup) section.

Besides the **For** block, the other option for beginning a loop is the **Repeat** block. See [Loops with the Repeat block](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#loops-with-the-repeat-block).

# The Collect block

<img alt="The Collect block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-collect-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Collect** block receives individual data items from iterations of a [loop](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/), then aggregates them into a list, formatted as a JSON array like this: `["item1","item2","item3"]`. For example, if a loop sends one HTTP request per iteration, the **Collect** block can gather all the responses into a single list when the loop completes. The **Collect** block is commonly used with the [**For**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/for/) block, which sends each item in a list individually, and the [**Repeat**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/repeat/) block, which runs a group of blocks multiple times.

## Input

**Item** - Accepts a single data item from a [**For**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/for/) or [**Repeat**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/repeat/) loop.

## Outputs

**List** - Creates a JSON array of all the items sent to this block when the loop is complete.

**Finish** - Sends an event when the loop is complete and the **Collect** block has aggregated the data into an array.

## Example

To see the **Collect** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Collect](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63b898822e67b05a8333e16c).

# Visualize blocks overview

*Visualize blocks* include the following:

* [**Display**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-display/)
* [**Log**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/log/)


# The Display block

<img alt="Display block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-display-block-v11.56.1.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Display** block shows data from other blocks in one of several formats, including images, text, numbers, and charts. It automatically detects the best format for incoming data, or you can select a format from a dropdown list. See [Visualize data in Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/visualize-data/#visualization-types) for a complete list of display formats.

The **Display** block has an output port, so you can send the data to another block. The **Display** block doesn't transform the data when it visualizes it, and the data remains in its original format when it's passed through. The **Display** block is useful in many situations, including troubleshooting your flow, analyzing different blocks' output, and visualizing data in dashboards.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The **Display** block was previously named **Output**. A different [**Output**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-module/) block is available.
</Info>

## Input

The **Display** block has a single input port that accepts data from any other block.

## Output

The **Display** block's output port sends the data it receives without altering it.

## Setup

Connect a block's output port to the **Display** block's input port. You can optionally connect the **Display** block's output port to another block's input port to send the same data it received.

The **Display** block automatically detects the incoming data's format, or you can select a format from the dropdown list. If the format is **Text**, you can adjust the text size by clicking the **Display** block, then clicking <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Additional Settings > Text size**.

## Example

To see the various formats the **Display** block can produce, check out [Visualize data in Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/analyze/visualize-data/).

# The Log block

<img alt="The Log block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-log-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Log** block accepts information to its input port and sends the information to the [Postman Console](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/). The **Log** block is useful for [debugging flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/troubleshoot/troubleshoot/).

## Input

The **Log** block has a single input port that accepts data from any block's output port. If you connect multiple output ports to a **Log** blocks' input port, all the incoming data is sent to the Postman Console in the order it was received.

If you have any **HTTP Request** blocks in your flow, the requests they send are logged automatically as network events. You don't need to add **Log** blocks to capture that output.

## Setup

Connect one or more block's output port to the **Log** block's input port to send the incoming data to the Postman Console. Click <img alt="View logs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/icons/flows-view-logs-icon-v11.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> **View logs** to open the Postman Console.

Within the Postman Console, optionally click <img alt="Open web icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openWeb-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> to open a copy of the console in its own window. There you find the following checkboxes:

* **Show timestamps** prefaces each log entry with a timestamp in `HH:MM:SS.MS` format where `HH` is the hour, `MM` is the minute, `SS` is the second, and `MS` is the millisecond.

* **Hide network** hides the network events described in the [Input](#input) section.

## Example

To see the **Log** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Logging to Console](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63b8b07ea365885b55bc51f9).

The example flow below obtains a random integer, raises it to the third power, outputs a string stating both values, and logs the string.

<img alt="A flow that logs output" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-blocks-reference-log-example-upper-v11.54.0.jpg" />

Both the network event (that is, the HTTP request) and the output string appear in the log. With the Postman Console in its own window, you can turn on **Show timestamps**. In this case that reveals that the HTTP request was logged 60 milliseconds before the output.

<img alt="How logs look in the console" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-blocks-reference-log-example-lower-v11.54.0.jpg" />

# The String block

<img alt="The String block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-string-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **String** block outputs a sequence of characters that's configured in the block. This can be used in situations where you need to send a static string to the input of another block. For example, you can use a **String** block when you want to set a static parameter to an API request or define a variable.

You can [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **String** block into other blocks, such as **Evaluate**, **If**, **List**, **Record**, or **Template**.

## Output

The **String** block has a single output port that sends the string of characters entered in the block.

## Setup

Select the **String** block's text box and enter a string of characters.

## Example

To see the **String** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: String](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc6328e308d202595085bc).

# The Bool block

<img alt="The Bool block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-bool-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Bool** block sends a true or false value from its output port. This can be useful when you want to control your flow based on a condition. For example, you could send the **Bool** block's output to an [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/) block. The **If** block could then route incoming data to one of two other blocks, depending on whether the **Bool** block's value is true or false.

## Output

**True** or **False** - Sends a true or false value, depending on the state of the **True/False** toggle.

## Setup

Click the toggle to set the block's output to true or false.

You can [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Bool** block into certain blocks instead of connecting it to them. For a list of blocks you can insert the **Bool** block into, see [Related blocks](#related-blocks).

## Example

To see the **Bool** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Bool](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63b8b16f2b292a29393dbef9).

# The Number block

<img alt="The Number block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-number-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Number** block sends the specified whole or decimal number. The number can be positive or negative. The **Number** block is often [inserted](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) into other blocks that perform math operations or assign values to numeric parameters.

## Output

The **Number** block's single output port sends the specified number.

## Setup

When you create a **Number** block, its specified number is **0**. Click the **0** to enter a new number, or increase or decrease by clicking <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" /> or <img alt="Subtract icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-subtract-stroke-small.svg#icon" width="12px" />.

## Example

To see the **Number** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Number](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63b8b417a365885b55bc51fd).

## Related pages

# The Null block

<img alt="The Null block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-null-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

When the flow runs, the **Null** block sends a null value from its output port. Null values can be useful in many cases, including handling API responses with null value fields and clearing [inserted](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) data block values.

## Output

The **Null** block has a single output port that sends a null value.

## Setup

Connect the **Null** block's output port to another block's input port. It will send a null value to that block.

## Example

To see the **Null** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Null](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc6e4a82ae416b9e6bc108).


# The Select block

<img alt="The Select block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-select-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Select** block receives JSON data from another block and extracts an element that you specify. This can help you isolate and work with data from an **HTTP Request** block's response.

## Input

Connect this input port to any block that sends JSON data.

## Output

This output port sends the selected data. The symbol next to this output port changes depending on the type of data selected.

## Setup

If you want the **Select** block to operate on output data from an **HTTP Request** block:

1. Run the flow to make output available in the **HTTP Request** block. A red dot will appear at the **Success** output.

2. Click the **Success** output to open the block footer, then select the **Output** tab in the footer.

3. In the output, navigate to the field you want to populate the **Select** block.

4. Drag the desired field beyond the boundary of the **HTTP Request** block and drop it on the canvas. This will create a **Select** block whose output will be the field you chose.

Here's another way you can set up a **Select** block to operate on data from an **HTTP Request** block:

1. Run the flow to make output available in the **HTTP Request** block. A red dot will appear at the **Success** output.

2. Create a **Select** block [with the blocks list](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/create-blocks/) and connect it to the **HTTP Request** block.

3. In the **Select** block, click **Enter path...** to show the **HTTP Request** block's output data.

4. Click the field you want to send from the **Select** block. Click the symbol next to the output port to preview the data being sent. If you change the selected field, you must run the flow to update the preview.

In addition to **HTTP Request** blocks, you can use **Display** or any of [several other blocks](#related-blocks) to provide input to **Select** blocks.

## Example

The example below shows the result of dragging and dropping two different fields from HTTP request output, one at a time. This created a **Select** block for each of the fields. Each **Select** block was then connected to a **Display** block renamed for its respective field.

<img alt="The Select block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-select-setup-v11.55.3.jpg" />

## Related blocks

Numerous blocks can send JSON data to the **Select** block, including the [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), [**HTTP Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/http-request/), [**Display**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/output-display/), [**Template**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/template/), [**AI Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-request/), [**AI Agent**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-agent/), [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/), and [**Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/request/) blocks.

Numerous blocks enable you to [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Select** block inline, including the [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/), [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/), [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/), [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), and [**Template**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/template/) blocks.

# The Now block

<img alt="The Now block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-now-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

When the flow runs, the **Now** block sends the current date and time as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). This block is useful for generating timestamps and tracking when flows are triggered.

## Output

The **Now** block has a single output port that sends the current date and time.

## Setup

Connect the **Now** block's output port to another block's input port. It sends the current date and time from its output port.

## Example

# The Date block

<img alt="The Date block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-date-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Date** block sends the specified date as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

## Output

The **Date** block's single output port sends the specified date as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Setup

When you add a **Date** block to your flow, it shows the date when it was added. Click the date in the block to open a calendar where you can select a different date.

You can [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Date** block into certain blocks instead of connecting them. This makes the selected date available to the block it's inserted into. For a list of blocks you can insert the **Date** block into, see [Related blocks](#related-blocks).

## Example

To see the **Date** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Date](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc6e72ead4e97c45493e9a).

# The Date & Time block

<img alt="The Date & Time block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-date-and-time-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Date & Time** block is a data block that sends the specified date and time as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).

## Output

The **Date & Time** block's single output port sends the specified date and time as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Setup

When you add a **Date & Time** block to your flow, it shows a placeholder date and time. Click the date and time in the block to open a calendar and clock where you can select a different date and time.

You can [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Date & Time** block into certain blocks instead of connecting them. This makes the selected date and time available to the block it's inserted into. For a list of blocks you can insert the **Date & Time** block into, see [Related blocks](#related-blocks).

## Example

To see the **Date & Time** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Date & Time](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc6e7782ae416b9e6bc10a).

## Related blocks

* You can use the [**Date**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/date/) block if you only need a date. The **Date & Time** block can also be inserted into a number of other blocks including the [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/), [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/), [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/), [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), and [**Template**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/template/) blocks.


# The List block

<img alt="The List block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-list-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **List** block sends an array in your flow. You can define the items in the array by [inserting](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) data blocks into the **List** block. A **List** block can output an array where different items have different data types. For example, you could insert a **Now** block, a **Bool** block, and a **String** block into the **List** block. Each item in the **List** block has an index number next to it, indicating the item's position in the array. The first index number in the list is **0**.

You can connect the **List** block to another block whose output you want to select information from to use as an item in the **List** block's output array. Insert a **Select** block into the  **List** block and use it to select the desired information.

For example, when you want to add API response information to the array, connect the **List** block to an **HTTP Request** block. Then use a **Select** block to extract the desired element from the response.

[Loops created with the **For** block](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/overview/#loops-with-the-for-block) often use a **List** block.

## Input

The **List** block has no input port by default. When you insert a **Select** block into the **List** block, an input port appears where the inserted **Select** block can receive data from another block. You can then use the inserted **Select** block to choose a specific piece of data to be added to the **List** block's array. See [Setup](#setup) for more details. You can also insert **List** blocks into **List** blocks to create nested arrays.

## Output

The **List** block has a single output port that sends an array when the block runs.

## Setup

When you create a **List** block, it contains an empty array (`[]`). It has an index number, **0**, but no items. To add items to the **List** block's array, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**, then select a block from the dropdown list. The embedded block's data becomes an item in the **List** block's array. The item's index number appears next to the embedded block.

If you insert a **Select** block, it adds an input port to the **List** block. You can then connect another block's output port to the inserted **Select** block's input port, and select a specific piece of information from the incoming dat. The selected information becomes an item in the **List** block's array.

## Example

To see the **List** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: List](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc9412ead4e97c45493eb0).

## Related blocks

You can insert another block into the **List** block to add its data as an item in the array. The blocks you can insert like this include the **List** block itself and the [**String**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/string/), [**Bool**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/bool/), [**Number**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/number/), [**Null**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/null/), [**Select**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/select/), [**Now**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/now/), [**Date**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/date/), [**Date & Time**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/date-and-time/), [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/), [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), and [**Get Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-variable/) blocks.

Several blocks allow you to [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **List** block inline, including the **List** block itself and the [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/), [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), and [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), and blocks.

# The Record block

<img alt="Record block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-record-block-v11-56-1.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Record** block creates key-value pairs from received data and sends them as a JSON object. The **Record** block is useful for structuring and transforming data in your flow. For example, you can use it to construct API request payloads or to merge data from multiple responses.

## Input

Each input port receives data from a connected or [inserted](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) block and creates a key-value pair. The name of the input port is the key, and the data it receives is the value. All keys in the block must be unique.

A new **Record** block has one input port by default. To add another input port, connect a block to an existing input port or click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**.

When you connect another block's output port to a **Record** block's input port, a **Select** block is automatically inserted. Click **Enter path...** to select data for the key-value pair's value. You can also insert blocks into the **Record** block to use their data in the key-value pair.

## Output

The **Record** block has a single output port that sends a JSON object containing the key-value pairs defined in the block.

## Setup

To set up a **Record** block, do the following:

1. Connect a block's output port to the **Record** block's input port, or click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** to insert a block.

2. Enter or select a value.

3. Click **key\<number>** and enter a name for the key.

## Example

To see the **Record** block in an example flow, see [Flow Snippets: Record](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc6eacead4e97c45493e9c).

# The Create Variable block

<img alt="Create Variable block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-create-variable-block-v11-50-1.jpg" width="140px" />

The **Create Variable** block creates a variable and assigns it a name and a value. The variable can then be referenced by one or more [**Get Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/get-variable/) blocks from anywhere in the flow. The variable's value comes from the block that's connected to the **Create Variable** block's input port. For example, you could connect a **String** block's output port to the **Create Variable** block's input port. Whatever text you enter in the **String** block will be assigned to the variable named in the **Create Variable** block. Or you could connect an **HTTP Request** block to a **Create Variable** block to assign the request's entire response to the variable.

**Create Variable** blocks are colored by default. Any **Get Variable** blocks that reference the variable also has the same color. When you click a **Create Variable** block that's referenced by a **Get Variable** block, a dotted line appears between them. The dotted line is the same color as the blocks. This can be useful when you're locating variables in your flow.

## Input

**Variable (number)** - Accepts any data sent from a single connected block, including:

* Text
* A number
* A JSON object
* A boolean value
* A list
* An image

## Setup

Click the variable's name in the block to edit it. To change the block's color, click the block, then click <img alt="Style icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-style-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Change Color** and select a new color. Any **Get Variable** blocks that reference the variable will update their name or color automatically.

## Example

# The Get Variable block

<img alt="The Get Variable block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-reference-blocks-get-variable-v11.53.2.jpg" width="280px" />

The **Get Variable** block retrieves the value of any variable defined by a [**Create Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-variable/) block anywhere in the flow. The **Get Variable** block then sends that value from its output port.

## Output

**Select a variable** - When a variable is selected, this port sends the variable's value.

## Setup

You can add a **Get Variable** block directly to the canvas, or insert it inline within any block that takes variables as input. See [Related blocks](#related-blocks).

Select **Select a variable** and choose a variable from the dropdown list. The list is populated with variables created by **Create Variable** blocks in the flow.

A pin icon appears in any **Get Variable** block that you insert inline into a block that's within a loop. To learn how variable pinning works, see [Loops with external data](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/loops/loops-external-data/).

## Example

To see the **Get Variable** block in an example flow, check out [Flow Snippets: Variables](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/63bc94d282cf9728f279e020).

## Related blocks

Any value that the **Get Variable** block can retrieve must first be defined by a [**Create Variable**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-variable/) block somewhere in the canvas.

Numerous blocks allow you to [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Get Variable** block inline, including the [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/), [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/), [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), [**List**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/list/), [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/), and [**Template**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/template/) blocks.

# The Template block

<img alt="Template block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/template-block-v11.png" width="280px" />

The **Template** block enables you to insert variable values into a predefined text document and pass the value on to another block. For example, you could write a form letter and dynamically change placeholder variables for the customer name or sale item in the email.

You can also [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) data blocks into the **Template** block to reference their data in the text or JSON as variables, such as the **String**, **Bool**, **Number**, or **Select** block. The values are injected into the text in placeholder variables surrounded with double curly braces.

## Input

**variable** - When this port receives data, it assigns the data to a variable. You can then reference the variable in the text box with double curly braces like this: `{{variable_name}}`. You can also [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) data blocks here and assign their values to variables.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Variables created in flows aren't available to post-response scripts or other features outside Postman Flows.
</Info>

**Text box** - Enter text or JSON here. Select **Text** or **JSON** from the dropdown list at the top of the block to specify the input type. Selecting **Text** sends the input as a string from the **Output** port. Selecting **JSON** sends it as formatted JSON, which can be consumed by an **HTTP Request** or **Select** block. With a **Select** block, you can specify a path to retrieve specific data from the JSON.

**Snippets** - Select this dropdown list to add pre-defined text and variables to the **Template** block that you can edit for your use case. Choose from a Markdown document, an HTML email, or an SQL query.

## Output

**Output** - Sends the information entered in the text box. Text input is sent as a string. JSON input is sent as formatted JSON.

## Setup

Enter text in the text box and select the dropdown list at the top of the block to specify the input type. The **Template** block's output port sends text as a string and retains its formatting. It sends JSON as formatted JSON. Reference the **Template** block's variables with curly braces like this: `{{variable_name}}`.

To create a variable in the **Template** block, connect a block's output to the **variable** input port, or insert a block with <img alt="Add data blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks**. Change an inserted block to a different data block by selecting the inserted block's icon and choosing a block from the dropdown list.

### Use Mustache syntax

The **Template** block supports [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) syntax. You can use Mustache to dynamically format data, iterate over arrays, conditionally display text, and more.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If a referenced variable contains an object, Mustache syntax in the **Template** block returns the full JSON representation of the object, including field names, rather than `[object Object]`.
</Info>

## Example

# The Get Configuration block

<img alt="Get Configuration block" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/get-configuration-block-v11.jpg" width="150px" />

The **Get Configuration** block retrieves the specified configuration's value and sends that value from its output port.

## Output

**Select a configuration** - When a configuration is selected, this port sends the configuration's value.

## Setup

Click the dropdown list and select a configuration. The list shows configurations created in the flow's [**Settings**](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/configure-values-actions/).

You can [insert](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/#insert-data-blocks-into-other-blocks) the **Get Configuration** block into the following blocks:

* [**Create with AI**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/create-with-ai/)
* [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/)
* [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/)

* [**Record**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/)
* [**Template**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/template/)


# Use TypeScript in Postman Flows

You can use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to enhance logic and functionality in the [logic blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/overview-logic-blocks/) of your Postman Flows. For example, with TypeScript you can write expressions that evaluate data informing your Flow's decisions, and functions that process data within your Flow.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-typescript-filter-v11-60.png" alt="TypeScript in an Evaluate block" />

## TypeScript compared to FQL

The [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), [**Condition**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/condition/), and [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/) logic blocks in Postman Flows support both TypeScript and [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL). While FQL is designed for querying and transforming data, TypeScript offers the robustness and flexibility of a full programming language within your Postman Flows. This makes TypeScript more suitable for complex logic and large-scale projects. Also, if you're familiar with both, you may prefer using TypeScript over FQL.

## Restrictions and notes

Scripts written with TypeScript in Postman Flows have the following restrictions:

* Scripts can't import or require libraries.
* Scripts don't have file system access.
* Scripts can't make API calls (for example, `fetch` isn't available).
* The top level code must be an expression.

TypeScript in Postman Flows provides a range of cryptographic capabilities, including the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), SHA-256 hashing, AES encryption, and secure random number generation.

You can use TypeScript to send console logs to the Postman Console using the following methods:

* `console.log`
* `console.error`
* `console.warn`
* `console.info`

## Use TypeScript in a Postman Flows decision block

To use TypeScript in an **Evaluate** or **If** block, select **TypeScript** from the dropdown list and enter your code in the block.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-select-typescript-v11-60.png" alt="Select TypeScript" />

# Rename headers with TypeScript in Flows

This TypeScript example renames the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers using camel case. Renaming headers can be useful for normalizing field names for testing purposes and mapping fields to different data models.

## Example JSON

The example uses JSON data from a GET request to `postman-echo.com` like this:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "args": {},
    "headers": {
      "host": "postman-echo.com",
      "x-request-start": "t1757972551.591",
      "connection": "close",
      "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
      "x-forwarded-port": "443",
      "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-68c88847-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.46.0",
      "accept": "*/*",
      "cache-control": "no-cache",
      "postman-token": "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444",
      "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
      "cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySessionId1234567890.abcdef1234567890"
    },
    "url": "https://postman-echo.com/get"
  },
  "http": {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Date": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:42:31 GMT",
      "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
      "Content-Length": "621",
      "Connection": "keep-alive",
      "Server": "nginx",
      "ETag": "W/"26d-FAKEETAG1234567890"",
      "Set-Cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySetCookieId0987654321.qwerty9876543210; Path=/; HttpOnly"
    }
  },
  "tests": [],
  "binary": false
}
```

## Rename headers with camel case

The following TypeScript takes the headers from a `response` variable defined by the **Evaluate** block. It then maps the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers to an object named `normalized` and renames them using camel case.

```javascript
const headers = response.http?.headers ?? {};

const normalized = {
  contentType: response.http.headers["Content-Type"],
  contentLength: response.http.headers["Content-Length"]
};

normalized
```

## Example

To see this TypeScript in an example flow, check out [TypeScript example 1: Rename headers with camel case](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/68c9ca6dd0954f00138d7e7a).


# Detect a session id cookie with TypeScript in Flows

This TypeScript example checks an API response for a `sails.sid` cookie. If a `sails.sid` cookie is present in the response, it could indicate that a session ID has been leaked. By using TypeScript to check for the `sails.sid` cookie in an **If** or **Condition** block, you can route the response to different blocks, depending on the result.

## Example JSON

The example uses JSON data from a GET request to `postman-echo.com` like this:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "args": {},
    "headers": {
      "host": "postman-echo.com",
      "x-request-start": "t1757972551.591",
      "connection": "close",
      "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
      "x-forwarded-port": "443",
      "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-68c88847-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.46.0",
      "accept": "*/*",
      "cache-control": "no-cache",
      "postman-token": "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444",
      "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
      "cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySessionId1234567890.abcdef1234567890"
    },
    "url": "https://postman-echo.com/get"
  },
  "http": {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Date": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:42:31 GMT",
      "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
      "Content-Length": "621",
      "Connection": "keep-alive",
      "Server": "nginx",
      "ETag": "W/"26d-FAKEETAG1234567890"",
      "Set-Cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySetCookieId0987654321.qwerty9876543210; Path=/; HttpOnly"
    }
  },
  "tests": [],
  "binary": false
}
```

## Check a response for sails.sid

The following TypeScript checks an API response in a variable named `response` for a `sails.sid` cookie:

```javascript
(response.body.headers["cookie"]?.includes("sails.sid"))
```

If the `sails.sid` cookie is present in the response, the TypeScript returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. You can use this example script in an **If** or **Condition** block to route the response data based on the result.

## Example

To see this TypeScript in an example flow, check out [TypeScript example 2: Check for session cookie](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/68c9822cd556a900131b528e).


# Route response data with TypeScript in Flows

This example uses three TypeScript expressions to route response data based on health and performance using a **Condition** block. The first expression to return `true` routes the response data through its output port. If none of the three TypeScript expressions resolve to true, the **Condition** block routes the response data through the **Default** output port.

## Example JSON

The example uses JSON data from a GET request to `postman-echo.com` like this:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "args": {},
    "headers": {
      "host": "postman-echo.com",
      "x-request-start": "t1757972551.591",
      "connection": "close",
      "x-forwarded-proto": "https",
      "x-forwarded-port": "443",
      "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-68c88847-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.46.0",
      "accept": "*/*",
      "cache-control": "no-cache",
      "postman-token": "00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444",
      "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
      "cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySessionId1234567890.abcdef1234567890"
    },
    "url": "https://postman-echo.com/get"
  },
  "http": {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Date": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:42:31 GMT",
      "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
      "Content-Length": "621",
      "Connection": "keep-alive",
      "Server": "nginx",
      "ETag": "W/"26d-FAKEETAG1234567890"",
      "Set-Cookie": "sails.sid=s%3AdummySetCookieId0987654321.qwerty9876543210; Path=/; HttpOnly"
    }
  },
  "tests": [],
  "binary": false
}
```

## Condition 1: Check for critical server errors

The TypeScript in this condition finds the response's status code and checks if the code is greater than or equal to 400:

```javascript
response.http.status >= 400
```

## Condition 2: Check for slow response

The TypeScript in this condition finds the `Server-Timing` header value and checks if it's greater than 1000. The `Server-Timing` header shows the number of milliseconds the request took to process. If it's greater than 1000 ms, that could indicate a slow response.

```javascript
Number((response.http.headers["Server-Timing"] || "")
  .match(/dur=([\d.]+)/)?.[1]) > 1000
```

## Condition 3: Not JSON

The TypeScript in this condition checks if the `Content-Type` header is missing the string `application/json`. If `application/json` isn't present in the header, the expression returns true and routes the response from this condition's output port. If the string is present, the expression returns false.

```javascript
!(response.http.headers["Content-Type"]?.includes("application/json"))
```

## Example

# Introduction to Flows Query Language

You can use *Flows Query Language* (FQL) to parse and transform JSON data to get the fields and structure you want.

## FQL compared to TypeScript

The logic blocks in Postman Flows ([**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/), [**Condition**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/condition/), and [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/)) support both FQL and [TypeScript](/docs/postman-flows/typescript/typescript-overview/). While FQL is designed for querying and transforming data, TypeScript offers the robustness and flexibility of a full programming language within your Postman Flows. This makes TypeScript more suitable for complex logic and large-scale projects. Also, if you are familiar with both the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, you may prefer using TypeScript over FQL.

## Extract fields from data with FQL

![FQL example](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/fql-example-v11-60.png)

You can use FQL to extract specific fields from data passed between blocks. In this example, the **Template** block holds a `customer_info` JSON object. The variable `data_field` receives the formatted data and passes it into the **Evaluate** block where it can be queried with FQL. FQL in the **Evaluate** block prints out the values of `customer_info`. This example also includes a comment that uses the FQL `/*comment*/` syntax.

## Things you can do with FQL

The following pages show examples of things you can do with FQL:

* [Get basic values](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/get-basic-values/)
* [Conditional data selection](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/conditional-data-selection/)
* [Return structured data](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/return-structured-results/)
* [Data manipulation](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/data-manipulation/)

## Using Postman Agent Mode with FQL

Not sure how to write an FQL statement for your flow? Use [Postman Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/)! Tell Agent Mode what you want to do using plain language, and it will generate a FQL statement for you.

In the **Evaluate** block, drag the Agent Mode icon <img alt="Agent mode icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-postbot-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> to the block's text box or anywhere on the canvas to open Agent Mode. Enter your query as plain text in the Agent Mode text box and press the **Return** or **Enter** key. Agent Mode will suggest a query for you based on your prompt.

To learn more about how you can use Postman's AI to help you use Flows, visit [Postman Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/).

## FQL reference

For a complete reference for all FQL functions, see the [FQL function reference](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/function-reference/).


# Get basic values in FQL

FQL uses location path syntax to extract values from JSON structures. The following examples show several examples of getting basic values from JSON data.

## Example JSON

The examples below use this JSON data in a variable named `data`:

```json
{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Park Avenue",
        "city": "Atlanta",
        "state": "GA",
        "zip": "12345"
    },
    "phones": [
        {
            "type": "Home",
            "number": "123-456-7890"
        },
        {
            "type": "Cell",
            "number": "098-765-4321"
        }
    ],
    "display name": "myuser123"
}
```

## Get a top-level field

To access a top-level field with FQL, enter the field's name.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        data.name
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        "John Smith"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Get a nested field

To access fields below the top level, use field names separated by dot `.` delimiters.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        data.address.city
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        "Atlanta"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Get an entire object

Enter the name of an object in the JSON file to retrieve all the data within that object.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        address
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        {
            "street": "123 Park Avenue",
            "city": "Atlanta",
            "state": "GA",
            "zip": "12345"
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Select a specific index in an array

To access individual values in an array in a JSON file, specify an index number between square brackets after the array's name.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        data.phones[0].number
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        "123-456-7890"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Select an entire array

Enter the name of an array in the JSON file to retrieve all the data within that array.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        data.phones
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json

# Use FQL conditional logic to select data

You can use [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) to filter for specific data in your responses. Multiple responses return in an array. Single responses return as a single record. Sample data and FQL examples are below.

## Example JSON

The examples below use this JSON object:

```json
    {
        "customer_info": {
            "customer_field": "Customer data",
            "unformated_customer_field": " customer \n stuff ",
            "total_value": "281.01",
            "associated_usernames": ["user1", "myuser", "online_user"]
        },
        "payments": [
            {
                "invoice_number": "101301",
                "date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z",
                "description": "recurring subscription",
                "amount": 110.48
            },
            {
                "invoice_number": "101302",
                "date": "2022-09-29T14:45:13.148Z",
                "description": "one time purchase",
                "amount": 24.49
            },
            {
                "invoice_number": "101303",
                "date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z",
                "description": "recurring subscription",
                "amount": 110.48
            },
            {
                "invoice_number": "101304",
                "date": "2022-10-12T11:45:22.182Z",
                "description": "recurring subscription deluxe",
                "amount": 35.56
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Filter query results for objects with specific key-value pairs

The example below filters for objects in the `payments` array that have the key-value pair `"description": "recurring subscription"`.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        payments[description="recurring subscription"]
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
            {
                "invoice_number": "101301",
                "date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z",
                "description": "recurring subscription",
                "amount": 110.48
            },
            {
                "invoice_number": "101303",
                "date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z",
                "description": "recurring subscription",
                "amount": 110.48
            }
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Navigate your filtered results

FQL uses the same syntax to navigate filtered query results as it does to navigate JSON data. The example below gets the values from the `invoice.number` fields in the `payments` array.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        payments[description="recurring subscription"].invoice_number
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \["101301","101303"]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Return a single record

When a filter has a single result, it returns as a record instead of an array. The filter below returns a single result as a record.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
         payments[description="recurring subscription deluxe"].invoice_number
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \["101304"]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Check if a field has a specific value

FQL can check if your query results have a specific key-value pair and return `true` or `false`. The example below checks the first item in the `payments` array for the key-value pair `"description": "recurring"`.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $contains(payments[0].description, "recurring")
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        true
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Get only unique payment amounts

The `$distinct` function returns a single instance of any recurring values. In the example below, the `110.48` value appears twice in the data, but only once in the result.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $distinct(payments.amount)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \[110.48, 24.49, 35.56]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


# Return structured data in FQL

You can use [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) to transform one JSON object into another, differently structured, JSON object. This topic provides example FQL expressions that show different ways of structuring the JSON output of an **Evaluate** block in Postman Flows.

To try out the examples, add a [Record](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/record/) input to the **Start** block in your flow. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **Start** block. In the **Evaluate** block's dropdown menu, select FQL. Paste an example FQL expression into the **Evaluate** block. Then create a scenario and paste the following example JSON into the scenario field that corresponds to your **Start** block's input.

<Accordion>
  <summary>
     Click to view example JSON 
  </summary>

  ```json
  {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "physical_address": {
          "street": "123 Park Avenue",
          "city": "Atlanta",
          "state": "GA",
          "zip": "12345"
      },
      "work_address": {
          "street": "583 W. Island Drive",
          "city": "Miami",
          "state": "FL",
          "zip": "44456"
      },
      "mailing_address": {
          "street": "232 Ravensburg Road",
          "city": "Durham",
          "state": "NC",
          "zip": "03948"
      },
      "phones": [
          {
              "type": "Home",
              "number": "123-456-7890"
          },
          {
              "type": "Cell",
              "number": "098-765-4321"
          },
          {
              "type": "Cell",
              "number": "888-777-5555"
          },
          {
              "type": "work",
              "number": "314-265-9078"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

When you run the flow, the expression will operate on the example JSON and the **Evaluate** block will output the result.

## Return multiple objects as an array

To return an array containing three of the top-level objects in the example JSON, use the following expression:

```json
    value1.[physical_address, work_address, mailing_address]
```

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Expected result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
            {"street": "123 Park Avenue","city": "Atlanta","state": "GA","zip": "12345"},
            {"street": "583 W. Island Drive","city": "Miami","state": "FL","zip": "44456" },
            {"street": "232 Ravensburg Road","city": "Durham","state": "NC","zip": "03948"}
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Return an array of a single field from multiple objects

To return an array containing only the values of the `city` key from the three top-level `address` objects in the example JSON, use the following expression:

```json
    value1.[physical_address, work_address, mailing_address].city
```

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Expected result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        ["Atlanta","Miami","Durham"]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Collapse multiple objects into a single key-value pair

FQL can return an array of key-value pairs composed of values from an object. To get the values of the `type` and `number` keys from objects in the `phones` array and return them as an array of key-value pairs, use the following expression:

```json
    value1.phones.{type: number}
```

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Expected result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
            {"Home": "123-456-7890"},
            {"Cell": "098-765-4321"},
            {"Cell": "888-777-5555"},
            {"work": "314-265-9078"}
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Collapse and group results by a shared field value

FQL can return an array that groups the values of a given key that's present in multiple input objects. To group the values of `Cell` keys from two different objects in the `phones` array, use the following expression:

```json
    value1.phones{type: number[]}
```

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Expected result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        {
            "Home": ["123-456-7890"],
            "Cell": ["098-765-4321","888-777-5555"],
            "work": ["314-265-9078"]
        }
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

```json
{
    "customer_info": {
        "customer field": "Customer data",
        "unformatted_customer_field": " customer \n stuff ",
        "total_value": "281.01",
        "associated_usernames": ["user1", "myuser", "online_user"]
    },
    "payments": [
        {
            "invoice_number": "101301",
            "date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z",
            "description": "recurring subscription",
            "amount": 110.48
        },
        {
            "invoice_number": "101302",
            "date": "2022-09-29T14:45:13.148Z",
            "description": "one time purchase",
            "amount": 24.49
        },
        {
            "invoice_number": "101303",
            "date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z",
            "description": "recurring subscription",
            "amount": 110.48
        },
        {
            "invoice_number": "101304",
            "date": "2022-10-12T11:45:22.182Z",
            "description": "recurring subscription deluxe",
            "amount": 35.56
        }
    ]
}
```

### Insert strings then group and sum results by description

The example below gets every `description` value in the `payments` array and appends the `annual cost` string. It then gets the `amount` value below each `description` field, multiplies it by 12, then appends it to its corresponding result. The results are grouped by `description` field.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        payments.{description & " annual cost" : amount*12}
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
            {"recurring subscription annual cost": 1325.76},
            {"one time purchase annual cost": 293.88},
            {"recurring subscription annual cost": 1325.76},
            {"recurring subscription deluxe annual cost": 426.72}
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Return the length of a string

The `$length()` function returns the length of the specified string. The example below returns the length of the string in the first `description` key-value pair in the `payments` array.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$length(payments\[0].description)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        22
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Return part of a string

The `$substring()` function returns part of a specified string. In the example below, The `3` is optional and specifies the offset, and the `6` is the number of characters you are selecting. Negative numbers can also be used for the offset.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$substring(payments\[0].description, 3, 6)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        "urring"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Get the string before the first occurrence of a pattern

In the example below, the `$substringBefore()` function returns the substring before the specified occurrence of `subscription` . If it doesn't find `subscription`, it returns the entire string.

### Compare two dates

The `$hasSameDate()` function accepts two or more dates with parameters specifying values in the dates. The function compares the values specified by the parameters and returns `true` if they're the same, or `false` if they're not.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL

### Increase a date by one day

The `$datePlus()` function accepts a date (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` or milliseconds since epoch), the number of units you want to add, and the date component you want to advance (`years`, `months`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, or `milliseconds`). The function returns the increased date as milliseconds since epoch.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$datePlus("2023-02-07", 1, "days")

### Get the difference between two dates

The `$diffDate()` function accepts two dates (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` or milliseconds since epoch) and a component of each date (`years`, `months`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, or `milliseconds`), then returns the difference between the two dates' component.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>

### Append to an array

The `$append()` function can combine two arrays, an array and a single value, or two strings into an array.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$append(\[1,2,3], \[4,5,6])
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \[1,2,3,4,5,6]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### If-then-else

The `$boolean` value is a true/false test. The second value is the output for true and the final value is the output for false. The example below tests if the `total_value` field's value is greater than 250. Since the value is greater than 250, the function returns "high-value customer".

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$boolean(customer\_info.total\_value > 250) ? "high-value customer" : "not a high-value customer"
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        "high-value customer"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Partition an array

The `$partition()` function breaks an array up into smaller arrays and returns the smaller arrays as a list.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        \$partition(payments,2)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
         [{"invoice_number": "101301","date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z","description": "recurring subscription","amount": 110.48},{"invoice_number": "101302","date": "2022-09-29T14:45:13.148Z","description": "one time purchase","amount": 24.49}],
         [{"invoice_number": "101303","date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z","description": "recurring subscription","amount": 110.48},{"invoice_number": "101304","date": "2022-10-12T11:45:22.182Z","description": "recurring subscription deluxe","amount": 35.56}]
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Perform an action on each value in an array

In this example, the `$map()` function gets the numerical values from the `amount` fields in the `payments` array and converts them to strings with the `$string()` function.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $map(input.payments[].amount,$string)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \["110.48", "24.49", "110.48", "35.56"]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Filter for values

In this example, the `$filter()` function returns values greater than 40 from `amount` fields in the `payments` array.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $filter(input.payments[].amount,fn($v,$i,$a) \{ \$v > 40})
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \[110.48, 110.48]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In this example, the `filter()` function returns items from the list where the `description` property matches the `payments` variable.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        list.payments.filter(
        (payment) => payment.description === payments
        );
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        ```json
        [
          {
            "invoice_number": "101301",
            "date": "2022-09-11T16:12:34.494Z",
            "description": "recurring subscription",
            "amount": 110.48
          },
          {
            "invoice_number": "101303",
            "date": "2022-10-11T16:12:34.683Z",
            "description": "recurring subscription",
            "amount": 110.48
          }
        ]
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Collapse an array to a single value

The `reduce()` function applies a function to every element in the array. In this example, it adds all the elements of the array together.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $reduce(input.payments[].amount,fn($i, $j){$i + \$j})
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        281.01
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Sort an array

The `$sort()` function sorts an array by the function specified where `$j` is the current item and `$i` is the next item.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        `$sort(input.payments[].amount,fn($i, $j){$i &lt; $j})`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \[110.48, 110.48, 35.56, 24.49]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Perform an action on each value in an object

In this example, the `$each()` function converts every string value in an object to uppercase.

<table class="code-ref-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        FQL
      </td>

      <td>
        $each({"transaction_id": "inv_80394", "description": "buying 20 units of data"},$uppercase)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Result
      </td>

      <td>
        \["INV\_80394", "BUYING 20 UNITS OF DATA"]
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Deployed flows overview

You can deploy and run flows in the Postman cloud. Flows running in the cloud can be triggered with automatic schedules, or with requests from webhooks, third-party apps, or other APIs. Flows running in the cloud are useful for running automations and exposing functionality as an API or as an AI tool for MCP servers.

Flows running in the cloud can process incoming data and return structured responses. Once deployed, a request-triggered flow gets a unique cloud-hosted URL. A deployed flow's URL is useful for tasks like automating business logic, handling webhooks, integrating with external services, or powering AI-driven tools on MCP servers.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Flows running in the cloud don't support private APIs.
</Info>

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Deployable flows are available in Postman version 11.42.3 and later.
</Info>

To learn about creating and deploying flows, see [Deploy flows to the Postman cloud](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/).

## Manage long-running deployed flows

Flows running in the cloud typically send out any data they produce as HTTP response bodies. This holds true for any flow that finishes running in less than the **Timeout** duration. The data flows through the **Response** block.

The maximum **Timeout** is 30 seconds. If your flow requires longer to run, [contact Postman support](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/enable-domain-capture/#contact-support-to-manage-accounts) to request an increase of the maximum timeout value to 60 seconds.

Once the **Timeout** interval has elapsed, the **Response** block sends out a 408 Request Timeout error. The flow will continue running for up to 60 minutes, at which point it will automatically stop.

If your flow requires over 60 seconds to run, it won't be able to send out data from the **Response** block. Instead, design your flow to be [asynchronous](#synchronous-and-asynchronous-flows).

## Deploy flows with snapshots

Flows can be *deployed* in the Postman cloud. Once it's running in the cloud, a request-triggered flow has a unique URL. You and other users can send requests to the flow's URL and receive responses from it.

You can create and restore different [snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/) of a flow that's running in the cloud. Snapshots are like different versions of a flow. When you deploy a flow to make it publicly available in the Postman cloud, you can deploy a new snapshot or an existing one.

If you deploy an existing snapshot of a flow, the local version of your flow doesn't automatically restore the snapshot when you deploy it. To learn about restoring snapshots and more, see [Version flows with snapshots](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/snapshots/).

## Schedule flows to run automatically

You can automate flows in the cloud to run at regular intervals or at specific times. Automated flows can be useful for testing and other scheduled events in your API workflow. To learn more, see [Schedule a flow to run automatically](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#schedule-a-flow-to-run-automatically).

## Bearer tokens in flows

You can configure flows running in the cloud to authorize requests with a [*bearer token*](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/#bearer-token). Bearer tokens make flows running in the cloud more secure by only granting access to requests that include the token.

Learn how to [enforce bearer token authorization for deployed flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#enforce-bearer-token-authorization).

## Synchronous and asynchronous flows

You can design your flows to be *synchronous* (sync) or *asynchronous* (async). In a sync flow, all the blocks complete their functions before the flow sends a response. An async flow sends a response before its blocks finish running.

For example, if an AI block in your flow takes several seconds to complete a task, you may choose to send the response first. Async flows are useful when integrating with webhooks from services that expect a quick response, like Slack.

Here's an example of an async flow:

<img alt="Async action" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-async-action-v11-75.png" />

In this flow, a **Validate** block checks the request data against a schema. If the request data is valid, the flow simultaneously sends a Status Code 200 response and triggers the **Create with AI** block. The **Create with AI** block may complete after the flow's timeout setting elapses. By making the flow async, it can send a response before completing its workflow.

## How flows parse received data

Flows parse incoming data as a structured data object. Each field in the object maps to a list of string values. For example, when a flow receives the following data:

```bash
token=9XqPLt7mKaRjVh2NbzC4f5Yw&team_id=T91H6Z2LK&team_domain=acme&channel_id=C72DF1XRK9&channel_name=integration-testing&user_id=U18ABZQXPR&user_name=jane.doe&command=%2Fflows&text=status&api_app_id=A45K9L72QM&is_enterprise_install=false&enterprise_id=E55YT9QWKV&enterprise_name=AcmeCorp&response_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhooks.slack.com%2Fcommands%2FT91H6Z2LK%2F3399128457101%2FHgT9yW3aKpLvQ8RbFsXe5JdM&trigger_id=3399128462830.8451991626.a1bc
```

it parses the data like this:

```json
{
  "token": ["9XqPLt7mKaRjVh2NbzC4f5Yw"],
  "team_id": ["T91H6Z2LK"],
  "team_domain": ["acme"],

}
```


# Connector blocks overview

You can connect third-party services to flows with **Connector** blocks. Each **Connector** block connects services, like Calendly and Salesforce, to your flow using OAuth 2.0. Once connected, your flow can interact with the service, like searching and canceling events in Calendly, or getting a file in Figma.

You can connect several services to flows, including:

* Calendly
* Salesforce
* Clickup
* Notion
* Figma
* Box
* GitHub

To learn how to use **Connector** blocks, see [Connect third-party services to flows](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/flows-connectors/flows-connectors/) and [Connector blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/connector/).


# Postman Flows Cookbook overview

The Postman Flows Cookbook is a collection of practical recipes for developing flows. Each recipe describes the best practice for a specific real-world example. The cookbook provides working examples of common tasks and shows prescribed methods for efficiently building your own flows. The focus of each recipe is to explain common idioms or design patterns that help you understand more advanced flow structures or design patterns involved in creating a flow.

Along with an explanation of the steps involved to write the flow, each recipe in the cookbook provides an embedded example you can copy into your own workspace and use. These examples may work as-is for your current task, or they may be a starting point you can expand and refine to tackle your own specific use case.

The cookbook assumes a basic knowledge of Postman Flows. If you're using flows for the first time, it might be helpful to start with the [Build your first flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) tutorial first. The cookbook is also not designed to be a quick reference to the functionality of each block. If you're looking for an item-by-item inventory of the fields in a block or tables of possible values, check out the [block reference](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/) section.


# Use TypeScript in an Evaluate block

You can use TypeScript to process and manipulate data in [**Evaluate**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/evaluate/), [**Condition**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/condition/), and [**If**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/if/) blocks in your flows. For example, you might use TypeScript to format a timestamp, check a response for errors, or select an item from a list.

## Recipe

The following recipe describes how to use TypeScript with an **Evaluate** block to select a random item from a list:

1. Create a flow and add an **HTTP Request** block. For this example, send a GET request to `https://openlibrary.org/subjects/love.json?limit=5`.

   This gets a list of five book titles.

2. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** port.

3. In the **Evaluate** block, name the variable `items` and set it to `body.works`.

4. Enter the following TypeScript in the **Evaluate** block to select a random title from the response:

   ```js
   items[Math.floor(Math.random() * items.length)].title
   ```

5. Run the flow and click the **Evaluate** block's **Result** output port to see the selected title.

# Iterate through a list using a For loop

A common Flows design pattern involves getting a response from a request that returns a list, then processing each item in the list. You can do this by constructing a loop with a **For** block. A **For** block requires an array as its input. Blocks such as **List**, **Get Variable**, **Evaluate**, and **Select** can return an array, but the response from an **HTTP Request** block typically doesn't. You can use TypeScript in an **Evaluate** block to transform a response into an array.

## Recipe

The following recipe shows how to use an **Evaluate** block to manipulate the response from an **HTTP Request** to create an array:

1. Create a flow and add an **HTTP Request** block.

2. In the **HTTP Request** block, create a GET request with the following URL:

   ```html
   https://openlibrary.org/subjects/love.json?limit=5
   ```

   This gets a list of five book titles, along with other response data.

3. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** port. Rename the `value1` input `items`, then click its **Enter path...** field and add an inline **Select** block. Set the **Select** block's path to `body.works`.

4. To make an array from the selected part of the previous block's response, enter this code in the **Evaluate** block:

   ```js
   items.map((work: any) => work.title)
   ```

   This creates an array of the book titles.

5. Connect a **For** block's **List** port to the **Evaluate** block's **Result** port.

6. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **For** block's **Item** port and rename the `value1` input `item`. Then enter this code:

   ```js
   item.toUpperCase()
   ```

   This capitalizes all the letters in the titles.

7. Connect a **Collect** block to the **Evaluate** block's **Result** port. This will put the capitalized items back into a list.

# Select data from a complex JSON response

Selecting and processing data from responses is a fundamental function in Postman Flows. Understanding how to pull data from specific fields in a response is vital to designing effective flows. For example, you might want to extract an address field from several levels down in a complex JSON object from an API response.

## Recipe

The following recipe shows how to extract a specific field from a complex JSON response:

1. Create a flow and add an **HTTP Request** block with a GET request to the following URL:

   ```html
   https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK0000320193.json
   ```

   This will return a large, multi-leveled JSON object describing details about Apple Inc.

2. Connect a **Select** block to the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** port.

3. Run the flow and click **Enter path...** in the **Select** block. A dropdown list appears showing the top-level fields in the JSON object from the response.

4. In the dropdown list, click the arrow next to **body** to view its nested fields.

5. Scroll down the **body** object and click the arrow next to the **addresses** field. More nested fields appear.

6. Click the arrow next to **mailing** to view its nested fields and select **street1**. The dropdown list closes and the following path appears in the **Select** block:

   ```html
   body.addresses.mailing.street1
   ```

7. Run the flow and click the **Select** block's **Output** tab view the **street1** field's value.

Pulling specific data from a complex JSON response lets you isolate that data so you can use it in the flow's logic.

# Persist data outside a flow

Data in flows is transient by default. Whatever data the flow retrieves or processes is cleared or replaced when the flow runs again. But you can design flows to persist data by sending it to an external data store, where you can retrieve it later.

## Recipe

The following recipe shows how to persist data with [JSONbin.io](https://jsonbin.io/):

1. Create a JSONbin.io account and locate the `x-master-key` API key.

2. Create a flow and add an **HTTP Request** block with a GET request to this URL:

   ```html
   https://openlibrary.org/subjects/love.json?limit=5
   ```

3. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** port.

4. In the **Evaluate** block, change `value1` to `items` and give it the path `body.works`. Then click **Start writing TypeScript** and enter the following code:

   ```js
   items.map((work: any) => work.title)
   ```

   This will create an array of book titles from the **HTTP Request** block's response.

5. Add an **HTTP Request** block and create a POST request with the following URL:

   ```html
   https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b
   ```

6. Add an `x-master-key` header to the request. Use your JSONbin.io API key as the header's value.

7. Add a variable named `{{body}}` to the POST request's body.

8. Connect the **Evaluate** block's **Result** port to the **HTTP Request** block's **body** variable input port.

9. Run the flow. The POST request sends the array of book titles to a new bin at JSONbin.io.

To access the posted data, you can send a GET request to `https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/(binId)/latest` using your `x-master-key` API key. You can find the binID in the POST response body's metadata.

# Use the AI Agent block as logic for a flow

The traditional method of performing logic in a flow uses a series of blocks. For example, you might get a response from an **HTTP Request** block and route the data to a **Select** block. The flow would process the selected data with an **Evaluate** block and send the result to a **Display** or **Output** block. This method can sometimes result in a complex system of blocks that perform your use case, but can be challenging to design and debug.

With the **AI Agent** block, this process can use fewer blocks. You can route the response into a single **AI Agent** block, write a prompt to describe your business logic, and an AI model will handle the logic. You can also explain any data conversion in the prompt to handle that, too.

## Recipe

The following recipe shows how to use an **AI Agent** block to get a list of GitHub issues from Postman's app support repo:

1. Create a flow and add an **HTTP Request** block. Leave the HTTP verb as `GET`, and enter the following URL:

   `https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues`

2. Add an **AI Agent** block and connect its **key** input port to the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** port.

3. Select a **Model** for the **AI Agent** block.

4. Write a prompt that describes what to do. Prompt engineering is beyond the scope of this recipe, but a good strategy is to describe a persona, the task, the context, and the format of the result. For this recipe, use this prompt:

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     You are a customer support manager named Joe Smith. Draft an email to your team at Example.com showing the first ten items in the body array in the provided list. For each item, provide a ten-word summary of the title and a one-sentence summary of the item's body. Make this a ten-item bulleted list, with each bullet the title and body summary.
   </Info>

5. Connect a **Display** block to the **AI Agent** block's **Result** port.

6. Run the flow. The **AI Agent** block generates an email as described in the prompt.

# Send a request with the HTTP Request block

You can build a flow that uses a request from your workspace or the [Postman API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/). You can also create a new request when building your flow.

In this tutorial, you'll create a new flow, collection, and request. Then, you'll use the **HTTP Request** block to send a request to the [Postman Echo API](/docs/developer/echo-api/).

## Create a new flow

You build flows in a workspace. Workspaces let you organize your API projects and collaborate with your team.

To create a new flow, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
2. In the upper left corner, click **New** > <img alt="Flow icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow**.

Congratulations! You sent a request and displayed the response in a **Display** block.


# Calculate the years since a milestone

You can build a flow to calculate the years since an important date, such as an anniversary, when one of your customers opened an account, or another important milestone.

In this tutorial, you'll create a new flow that calculates the years since Postman's founders founded the company. However, feel free to use your own milestone instead.

## Create a new flow

You build flows in a workspace. Workspaces let you organize your API projects and collaborate with your team.

To create a new flow, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
2. In the upper left corner, click **New** > <img alt="Flow icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow**.

## Create a variable for the current date and time

When you run a flow, the **Now** block gives you the current date and time, which you'll need to calculate the years since the milestone.

<img alt="Now blocks" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-now-v11-60.png" />

### Add a Now block

1. From the canvas toolbar, select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Block**.
2. Click <img alt="Time icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-time-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Now**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Now** in search.
3. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Now** block and select that location.

### Connect a Create Variable block

When you connect two blocks, you connect one block's input to another block's output. Inputs are on the block's left side and outputs are on its right side.

It's optional to connect a **Create Variable** block. However, if you plan to use a value in multiple places, the best practice is to create a variable. These steps will also let you separate your logic.

To connect a **Create Variable** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Now** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Create Variable** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Click **Create Variable**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Create Variable** in search.
4. Enter the variable's name. For example, enter **now**.

### Group your blocks

In this tutorial, you'll separate the logic to get the current date and time from the logic to calculate the years since the milestone and other logic. You can group blocks to better separate this logic.

To group your blocks, do the following:

1. Press and hold the **Command** or **Ctrl** key.
2. Click the blocks you want to group. The canvas's flyout menu appears and displays the number of blocks you clicked.
3. Hover over the canvas's flyout menu and click <img alt="Folder icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-folder-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Group selection**.
4. Hover over the group's title and click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit title**.
5. Enter a name. For example, enter **Now**.
6. Press the **Return** or **Enter** key.

## Create a variable for the milestone

In the following set of procedures, you'll add a **Record** block to store the milestone date and other milestone-related information.

You could add a **Date** block instead. However, the **Record** block resembles the kind of information an API returns to you. In other words, these steps will prepare you to build more complex flows in the future.

![Milestone blocks](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-record.jpg)

### Add a Record block

1. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Record** block and right-click that location.
2. Click <img alt="Record icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-record-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Record**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Record** in search.
3. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** and select <img alt="String icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-string-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **String**. If you want to search for the block, enter **String** in search.
4. Enter the string's key and value. For example, if the milestone is for a company, enter **company** and **Postman**, respectively.
5. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** and select <img alt="Calendar icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-calendar-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Date**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Date** in search.
6. Enter the date's key and value. For example, if the milestone is a company's founded date, enter **founded** and **October 14, 2014**, respectively.

Optionally, add more data blocks. For example, to build on the previous steps, you can create a more complex data structure to represent the company's founders. In this case, you could add a list of records, where each item in the list represents a founder, and each record stores the founder's details.

### Connect a Select block

1. Hover over the **Record** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Select** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Link icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-link-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Select**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Select** in search.
4. Click **Enter path** and select the **Record** block's date key. For example, if the milestone is a company's founded date, choose that date.

### Connect a Create Variable block

1. Hover over the **Select** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Create Variable** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select **Create Variable**. If you want to search for the block, enter **Create Variable** in search.
4. Enter the variable's name. For example, if the milestone is a company's founded date, enter **date**.

### Group your blocks

1. Press and hold the **Command** or **Ctrl** key.
2. Click the blocks you want to group and select <img alt="Folder icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-folder-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Group selection**.
3. Hover over the group's title, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit title**, and enter a name. For example, enter **Postman**.
4. Press the **Return** or **Enter** key.

## Create a variable for milliseconds per year

When you finish this tutorial, you'll calculate the difference between now and the milestone date. However, this calculation will return an answer in milliseconds. For this reason, you must calculate millisecond per year and divide by this value to calculate the difference in years.

In this set of procedures, you'll calculate the average milliseconds per year, which takes leap year into account. However, note that while this is a great approximation, there are more exact methods to calculate the exact value.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-milliseconds-per-year-v11-60.png" alt="Milliseconds per year blocks" />

### Add an Evaluate block

1. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Evaluate** block and right-click that location.
2. Select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Evaluate**.
3. Add the following to the code editor:

   ```javascript
   1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25
   ```

### Connect a Create Variable block

1. Hover over the **Evaluate** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Create Variable** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select **Create Variable**.
4. Enter the variable's name. For example, enter **millisecondsPerYear**.

### Group your blocks

1. Press and hold the **Command** or **Ctrl** key.
2. Click the blocks you want to group and click <img alt="Folder icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-folder-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Group selection**.
3. Hover over the group's title, click <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Edit title**, and enter a name. For example, enter **Milliseconds per year**.
4. Press the **Return** or **Enter** key.

## Calculate the years since the milestone

Once you've created the variables you need to calculate the years since the milestone (`now`, `date`, and `millisecondsPerYear`), you can use them to get an answer.

![Calculate years since milestone blocks](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-calculate-years-since-milestone-v11-60.png)

### Add an Evaluate block

Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Evaluate** block and right-click that location. Then, select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Evaluate**.

### Get the variables

1. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** and choose **Get Variable**.
2. Enter the variable's key and choose the variable. For example, if you want to add the **now** variable, enter **now** and select **now**.
3. Repeat these steps for each variable.

Your **Evaluate** block will reference all the variables you created: `now`, `date`, and `millisecondsPerYear`.

### Calculate

All **Evaluate** blocks default to [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL). You'll use FQL to calculate the years since the milestone.

To calculate the value, add the following to the code editor:

```javascript
$floor(
	(now - date) /
	millisecondsPerYear
)
```

This calculation takes the difference between now and the milestone date (which is in milliseconds) and divides it by milliseconds per year to get the years since the milestone. The FQL `$floor()` function removes any decimal values.

Optionally, use TypeScript to calculate this value. If you'd like to try this option, add another **Evaluate** block, switch to TypeScript (upper-right corner), and use the TypeScript `Math.floor()` method instead.

### Connect an Output block

1. Hover over the **Evaluate** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Display** block and drag the port to that location.

# Create a count-based loop with the Repeat block

You can build a flow that loops over a count. For example, you can run a flow that loops over a count of three and generates a list of three random numbers.

This tutorial's goal is to teach you how to set up and use count-based loops. To achieve this goal, you'll build a flow that uses a loop to count to three.

## Create a new flow

You build flows in a workspace. Workspaces let you organize your API projects and collaborate with your team.

To create a new flow, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
2. In the upper left corner, click **New** > <img alt="Flow icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow**.

## Add a Repeat block

The **Repeat** block lets you build a loop that iterates over a count. For example, to run a loop three times, set the count to three.

In the next procedure, you'll use the **Number** block to define this count.

To add a **Repeat** block, do the following:

1. From the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add blocks**.
2. Select <img alt="Repeat icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-repeat-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Repeat** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "Repeat" in search.
3. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Repeat** block and click that location.

## Connect a Number block

When you connect two blocks, you connect one block's input to another block's output. Inputs are on the block's left side and outputs are on its right side.

In this tutorial, you'll use the **Number** block to define the number of times you want to run your loop.

To connect a **Number** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Repeat** block's **Count** input port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Number** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Number icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-number-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Number** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "Number" in search.
4. Enter a whole number. For example, if you want your loop to repeat three times, enter **3**.

## Connect an Evaluate block

Many programming languages start counting with an index value of zero (for example, 0, 1, 2).

In the following steps, you'll use an **Evaluate** block to add one to the count to start counting with an index value of one (for example, 1, 2, 3).

To connect an **Evaluate** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Repeat** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Evaluate** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-code-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Evaluate** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "Evaluate" in search.
4. Rename the variable. For example, enter **index**.
5. Add the following to the code editor:

   ```javascript
   index + 1
   ```

This code takes the index, which starts at zero, and adds one.

Alternatively, use the [Flows Query Language](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) (FQL) `$now()` function to timestamp the loop. This is another great way to conceptualize what happens when you run a loop.

## Connect a Collect block

The **Collect** block saves multiple outputs to a list. In this tutorial, your loop will run three times, output three values, and use this block to save these values to a list.

To connect a **Collect** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Evaluate** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Collect** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Collect icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-collect-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collect** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "Collect" in search.

## Connect a Display block

The **Display** block displays incoming data, such as the **Collect** block's outgoing list.

To connect a **Display** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Collect** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Display** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Output icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-output-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Display** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "Display" in search.

## Run the flow

From the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

![Create a count-based loop flow](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-count-based-loop-v11-60.png)

Congratulations! You created a count-based loop and displayed the result in a **Display** block.


# Create a list-based loop with the For block

You can build a flow that loops over a list. For example, you can run a flow that loops over a list of email addresses and emails each person in the list.

This tutorial's goal is to teach you how to set up and use list-based loops. To achieve this goal, you'll build a flow that iterates over the first three letters of the alphabet.

## Create a new flow

You build flows in a workspace. Workspaces let you organize your API projects and collaborate with your team.

To create a new flow, do the following:

1. Choose an existing workspace or [create a new one](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/).
2. In the upper left corner, click **New** > <img alt="Flow icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-flow-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Flow**.

## Add For and Collect blocks

With the **For** block, you can build a loop that iterates over a list. For example, if you want to run a loop that loops over a list of the alphabet, you connect the **For** block to such a list.

In the next procedure, you'll use the **List** block to define this list.

To add a **For** block, do the following:

1. From the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Block**.
2. Select **For** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "for" in the search.
3. Click the location on the canvas where you want to place the **For** block.
4. A **Collect** block automatically appears on the canvas.

## Connect a List block

When you connect two blocks, you connect one block's input to another block's output. Inputs are on the block's left side and outputs are on its right side.

In this tutorial, you'll use the **List** block to define the list you want your loop to iterate over.

To connect a **List** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **For** block's **List** input port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.

   <img alt="Hover over the List input port" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-for-list-port-v11-69.png" width="190px" />

2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **List** block and drag the port to that location.

3. Select <img alt="List icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-list-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **List** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "list" in the search.

4. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add data blocks** and select <img alt="String icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-string-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **String**. If you want to search for the block, enter "string" in the search.

5. Enter the string's value. For example, if you want to iterate over the first three letters of the alphabet, enter "a".

6. Repeat the previous two steps until you complete your list.

You can loop over any list. For example, you can get a list from an **HTTP Request** block's response or use the **Evaluate** block to generate a list.

As an alternative, replace the **List** block with an **Evaluate** block, switch to TypeScript (upper-right corner), and add the following code to the code editor:

```javascript
const alphabet = []

for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
	alphabet.push(String.fromCharCode(97 + i))
}

alphabet

```

This code creates an empty list, adds the letter "a" to it, and loops over the code until it adds all 26 letters of the alphabet to the list.

## Connect to the Collect block

The **Collect** block saves multiple outputs to a list. In this tutorial, your loop will run three times, output three values, and use this block to save these values to a list.

To connect the **Collect** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **For** block's output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Drag the **For** block's output port to the **Collect** block's input port.

## Connect a Display block

The **Display** block displays incoming data, such as the **Collect** block's outgoing list.

To connect a **Display** block, do the following:

1. Hover over the **Collect** block's **List** output port. The pointer changes to a crosshair.
2. Decide where on the canvas you want to place the **Display** block and drag the port to that location.
3. Select <img alt="Output icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-output-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Display** from the list. If you want to search for the block, enter "display" in search.

## Run the flow

From the canvas toolbar, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

![Create a list-based loop flow](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-flows-list-based-loop-v11-60.png)

Congratulations! You created a list-based loop and displayed the result in a **Display** block.

# Send information from one system to another using Postman Flows

Developers often integrate multiple APIs to leverage their individual features. For example, you can get customer profiles from a payment services provider like [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) and add those profiles as contacts on a marketing platform like [Brevo](http://www.brevo.com). This tutorial shows you how to do this with Postman Flows.

## Goal

Create a flow that gets a list of customer profiles from [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) and adds them as contacts to a database in [Brevo](http://www.brevo.com).

## Prerequisites

* A [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) account and API key.
* At least 15 Stripe customers.
* A [Brevo](http://www.brevo.com) account and API key.

## Create the flow, collections, and environment

1. Open the [**Integration Flows** public workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/integration-flows/flows-get-started) and [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) the **Brevo API** collection, the **Stripe API** collection, and the **Stripe + Brevo** environment to your workspace.

2. In your workspace, [open the Stripe + Brevo environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/#edit-an-environment).

3. [Replace](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/#edit-environment-variables) the **stripe\_secret\_key** variable's value, **your key here**, with your Stripe API key.

4. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/) and click **Send a request**.

## Set up the initial Stripe request

1. Click **Find or create new request** and select **Stripe API > Customers > List all customers**.

2. Click **Add environment** and select **Stripe + Brevo**. The **HTTP Request** block shows the request's three variables. The `baseUrl` and `stripe_secret_key` variables are populated automatically from values stored in the request's collection and environment.

3. Next to the **limit** variable, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Add data blocks** and select **Number**. Enter "5" to specify how many contacts to include in each page of results. This tutorial uses 15 contacts, so a limit of 5 will send three pages of results.

# Create a dashboard using Postman Flows

Dashboards are useful for visualizing and simplifying large amounts of data. For example, you can create an internet-of-things (IoT) dashboard that displays information about your home's thermostat, door locks, security cameras, and environmental sensors. Or you can create a dashboard that compares a stock's price to a market index to evaluate the stock's performance. The dashboard can visualize data with a true/false display and a line chart.

This tutorial shows you how to create a stock performance dashboard using test data from a Postman mock server. You can view the [completed flow](https://www.postman.com/postman/utility-flows/flow/64123b57c224290033fcb089/) in the [**Utility Flows**](https://www.postman.com/postman/utility-flows/overview/) workspace.

## Goal

Create a flow that quantifies a stock's performance by comparing it to a market index.

## Prerequisites

* A [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) account.
* A Polygon.io API key.

## Creating the flow

1. Begin by [forking](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) (copying) the [**stocks** collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/utility-flows/collection/qm3apv9/stocks?action=share\&creator=21580188) and the [**stocks-tutorial** environment](https://www.postman.com/postman/utility-flows/environment/21580188-07226525-53d7-40ca-b9d3-6cac35c39306) from the [**Utility Flows**](https://www.postman.com/postman/utility-flows/flows-get-started) workspace to your workspace. In your fork of the **stocks-tutorial** environment, replace the `<your-api-key>` value with your Polygon.io API key and select **Save**.

   * Create a new flow and connect three **HTTP Request** blocks to the **Start** block.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-3sends-v10-5.gif" alt="Add three Send blocks" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

   * In the first two **HTTP Request** blocks, select the **get the close price** request. In the third **HTTP Request** block, select the **get stock SMA** request.

   * In the first **HTTP Request** block, select the **stocks-tutorial** environment. Flows prompts you to select the same environment for the other two **HTTP Request** blocks. Select **Update All**.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-select-environment-v10-1.gif" alt="Select the environment" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

   * Add a **String** block to assign the `VOO` market index to the `ticker` variable in the first request. The flow will compare your stock's performance to this index to check if your stock is outperforming the market.

   * Add another **String** block to assign `AAPL` to the `ticker` variables in the second and third **HTTP Request** blocks.

   ![Dashboard flow - step 1](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step1-v10-1.jpg)

2. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the first **HTTP Request** block. Change `value` to `benchmark` and select `body`.

   * In the FQL window, enter "((benchmark.close - benchmark.open) / benchmark.open) \* 100". This will get a percentage of the difference between the `VOO` index's open and close price.

   * Connect another **Evaluate** block to the **Evaluate** block you created. In the FQL window, enter "value2 > value1". You'll add `value2` in a later step.

   * Connect a **Display** block to the `value2 > value1` **Evaluate** block and select **Boolean** from the dropdown list.

   ![Dashboard flow - step 2](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step2-v10.jpg)

3. Go back to the second **HTTP Request** block and connect an **Evaluate** block to it. In this new **Evaluate** block, change `value1` to `yours` and select `body`. In the FQL window, enter "((yours.close - yours.open) / yours.open) \* 100" to get a percentage of the difference between this stock's open and close price.

   * Connect this block's **Result** output to the `key` input on the `value2 > value1` block. Flows automatically renames the variable `value2`.

   ![Dashboard flow - step 3](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step3-v10.jpg)

4. Connect the `yours` **Evaluate** block to a new **Display** block and select **Gauge** from the dropdown list. Set the **Gauge** output block's minimum value to `-5` and its maximum value to `5`.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-configure-gauge-v10.gif" alt="Configure the gauge" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

   * Connect the `AAPL` **String** block with to a **Display** block and rename the **Display** block `Your ticker`.

   ![Dashboard flow - step 4](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step4-v10.jpg)

5. Go back the third **HTTP Request** block and connect a **Select** block to it. In the **Select** block, select `body.results.values`. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **Select** block and rename `value1` to `list`. In the FQL window, enter "\$reverse(list)". This arranges the dates in the results in chronological order.

   * Connect a **For** block to the `$reverse(list)` **Evaluate** block, then connect an **Evaluate** block to the **For** block. In the **Evaluate** block, change `value1` to `item`. In the FQL window, enter "$month(item.timestamp) & '-' & $day(item.timestamp)". This converts timestamps in the results to a readable date format. Connect a **Collect** block to the **Evaluate** block's **Result** output.

   * Connect another **Evaluate** block to the `$reverse(list)` **Evaluate** block and rename `value1` to `list`. In the FQL window, enter "list.value".

   ![Dashboard flow - step 5](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step5-v10-1.jpg)

6. Create a **List** block and add two **Select** blocks to it. Connect the `list.value` **Evaluate** block to the **List** block's `0` input. Connect the **Collect** block's **List** output to the **List** block's `1` input.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-list-block-v10-2.gif" alt="Add a List block" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

   * Connect the **List** block's output to a **Display** block. select **Line Chart** from the dropdown list and rename the block `Simple moving average`.

   ![Dashboard flow - step 6](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flows-tut-db-step6-v10-1.jpg)

1) Run the flow and check your dashboard of **Display** blocks. Use it to view your stock ticker, if your stock is outperforming or underperforming the market, and how much it's outperforming or underperforming. You can also view a chart displaying the stock's simple moving average.

# Automate repetitive tasks using Postman Flows

You can use Postman Flows to complete repetitive tasks. Businesses often need to delete emails from multiple systems. Logging in, searching, and deleting emails from multiple locations can be time consuming. This tutorial shows you how to create a flow that deletes an email from three locations each time you run the flow.

For this tutorial, the locations are [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com/), [Brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com/), and a Postman mock server that acts as a hypothetical internal system.

You can find the [complete flow](https://www.postman.com/postman/devops-flows/flow/6417a7608c4c54003a4ad899) in the [DevOps Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/devops-flows/overview) workspace.

## Prerequisites

* A Stripe account with a customer with the `test@email.com` email address.
* A Brevo account with a contact with the `test@email.com` email address.
* A Stripe secret key.
* A Brevo API key.

## Fork the collections and environment

[Fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) these collections from the [**DevOps Flows**](https://www.postman.com/postman/devops-flows/overview) workspace into your workspace:

* [**Stripe API**](https://www.postman.com/postman/devops-flows/collection/xuxoonj/stripe-api?action=share\&creator=21580188)

* [**Brevo**](https://www.postman.com/postman/devops-flows/collection/lwjd0gh/brevo?action=share\&creator=21580188)

## Run the flow

Select **Run**. The flow finds and deletes the contact with the `test@email.com` email address on Brevo, Stripe, and the internal system. When the contact is deleted, the `Contact deleted` **Display** block shows **True**. If there is no contact with that email address, the `Contact not found` **Display** block shows **False**.


# Run requests in sequence using Postman Flows

When you have several requests with no dependency on each other and you want them sent in a specific order, you can connect multiple **HTTP Request** blocks in sequence. This tutorial shows you how.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  For an example, see the [Chaining requests](https://www.postman.com/postman/flows-snippets/flow/6267f9315d367a64e7ba06e5) example flow.
</Info>

## Run multiple requests in sequence

To run several requests in a specific order, do the following:

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

2. Select **Send a request** to add the first **HTTP Request** block.

   ![Select Send a request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-select-send-request-v11-43.jpg)

3. Drag and drop the **HTTP Request** block's **Success** output port to the canvas next to it and click **HTTP Request**.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-drag-port-v11-42.gif" alt="Add a block" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" />

4. Repeat the previous step with the second **HTTP Request** block so you have three connected blocks.

   ![Three HTTP Request blocks](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-three-requests-v11-42.jpg)

5. In each **HTTP Request** block, click **Find or create new request** and select a request from the dropdown list.

6. Click **Run** to start the flow. The requests run in the order you specified.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  If any request returns a response code other than `200 OK`, the flow stops and requests that follow won't run.
</Info>

The requests in this tutorial run in sequence but don't interact with each other. You can also [use data from one request in another request](/docs/postman-flows/tutorials/advanced/send-information-from-one-system-to-another/).

# About Postman AI features

Postman's AI features enable you to perform tasks faster, automate your workflows, and build your own AI models.

## Postman Agent Mode

With [Agent Mode](/docs/agent-mode/overview/), you can turn your words into action across the API lifecycle. Send requests, fix errors, update tests, and more, using natural language.

## AI models and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

You can experiment, test, and evaluate AI models and [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) servers. Use Postman to add an AI model of your choice to your project, such as one from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. Or, add an MCP server from the community--or build your own.

Start by [sending requests to AI models](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/overview/). You can compare models based on their responses, response times, and token counts. Then, send requests to MCP servers. You can compare servers based on their tools, resources, and prompts. You can also combine the two and see how an [AI model uses an MCP server to enhance a response](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/overview/).

With Postman's [MCP Generator](https://www.postman.com/explore/mcp-generator), you can [create your own MCP server](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-servers/overview/) with public APIs from the Postman API Network, and use Postman to improve your server's developer experience.

## Postman Flows AI

If you prefer a visual, low-code editor, you can use [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/) to experiment, test, and evaluate AI models and MCP servers. Or use Flows to [build your own MCP server](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-server-flows/overview/).

# Postman Agent Mode

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman Agent Mode is available on Free, Basic, and Professional plans to users who consent to using AI.
</Info>

Agent Mode can help you complete tasks faster across collections, tests, workspaces, environments, monitors, and Spec Hub. Agent Mode can help create and manage requests, flows, and mock servers, and debug errors and write tests.

[Get started](/docs/agent-mode/get-started/) by using built-in suggestions, selecting actions within the context of your work, or using natural language requests.

An even faster way to perform certain key tasks is to use [Skills](/docs/agent-mode/skills/). Enter slash (`/`) to open the skills menu, select a skill, replace placeholders in the skill prompt, and Agent Mode completes the required multi-step workflow.

The Agent Mode chat gives you [options](/docs/agent-mode/get-started/#agent-mode-options) to switch your AI model or configure an MCP server. You can also [start over](/docs/agent-mode/troubleshoot/) or continue from a previous conversation. You can help Postman improve Agent mode by [providing feedback and reporting issues](/docs/agent-mode/troubleshoot/).

Manage Agent Mode activation and control your code editing in Postman's [AI settings](/docs/agent-mode/settings/).


# Get started with Postman AI

You can access Agent Mode directly from the [Homepage](https://go.postman.co). Type in your query or use one of the suggestions. Click **Let's go**, and you'll be taken to your most recently visited workspace with edit access. When the workspace opens, Agent Mode will already be loaded with your query.

![Access Agent mode from the Homepage](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/homepage-agent-mode-v11.68.png)

# Run automated tasks with Postman AI Skills

Agent Mode has built-in "recipes" for accomplishing certain meaningful tasks by combining one or more tools with specific configurations. These tasks are called Skills.

To use skills, do the following:

1. Enter the slash character (`/`). Agent Mode gives you a popup menu of skills to choose from.

2. Select a skill from the menu. Agent Mode answers with a prompt that starts with the skill name and includes placeholders for the inputs that the skill needs.

3. Replace any placeholders within the prompt, in the following way:

   * For placeholders that start with the "at" character (`@`): Tab to or click the placeholder to open the menu, and select the desired collection, environment, or API specification from the menu.

   * For plain placeholders (those that don't start with `@`): Tab to or click the placeholder and enter your desired text. Examples of this type of placeholder include `new workspace name` and `project description`.

4. Press the return key. Agent mode will take it from there.

# Create AI requests and add them to your collections

You create AI requests to interact with an AI model of your choice. Choose any OpenAI-compatible model, whether it's from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/), [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/), [Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), or an alternative provider such as [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co). Use AI requests to experiment, test, and evaluate different AI models, whether they're fine-tuned, self-hosted, or local. Use the model that best fits your security requirements, budget, and workflow.

Then, add a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) server to your request to give the model added context. For example, add a server that performs an action or gets information from a trusted data source.

## Create your AI requests

Create AI requests to interact with AI models. Then, add them to your collections and organize them in your workspace for your project.

To learn more, see [Create an AI request for your collection](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/create/).

## Add MCP servers

Add MCP servers to your AI requests to give the AI models you interact with further context.

To learn more, see [Add an MCP server to your AI request](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/add-mcp-servers/).

## Interact with AI models

Use your AI requests to interact with AI models. As you interact with the model, the model returns a response. You can use these responses to experiment, test, and evaluate an AI model.

To learn more, see [Use your AI request to interact with an AI model](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/interact/).

## Manage your AI request settings

Edit your authentication details and adjust how you interact with an AI model.

To learn more, see [Manage how you interact with an AI model](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/manage/).


# Create an AI request for your collection

8. Open the **Prompt** tab, enter your user prompt, and (optional) enter your system prompt.
9. Click **Send**.

Postman adds your **Message** (user prompt) and the **Response** to the open conversation. You can use the steps in the following section to save your new AI request to a collection.

## Save your new AI request

If you don't have any [multi-protocol collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections) in your workspace, Postman opens a save request dialog that asks you for a request and collection name. Otherwise, Postman displays more options, such as the option to add your new AI request to an existing collection.

To save your new AI request, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="Save icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-save-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save**. Postman opens a save request dialog.
2. Name your new AI request.
3. If you don't have any [multi-protocol collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/#about-multi-protocol-collections) in your workspace, name your collection and skip to the last step.
4. (Optional) Click **Add description** and describe your new AI request.
5. To save your new request to an existing collection, select a collection. To save your request to an existing folder, select a folder. If you want to search for a collection or folder, enter your search term in the search box.
6. If you want to create a new collection, click **New Collection**, name your collection, and click **Create**. If you want to create a new folder, click **New Folder**, name your folder, and click **Create**.
7. Click **Save**.

Your new AI request is ready to use to [interact with an AI model](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/interact/). You can optionally [add an MCP server](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/add-mcp-servers/) to your request. You can also [manage your settings](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/manage/).


# Add an MCP server to your AI request

You add [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers to your AI requests to give the AI models you interact with further context. For example, you can add the [Postman MCP Server](https://www.postman.com/getmcp/workspace/public-mcp-servers/collection/682c95c75ac051812a618a18?action=share\&creator=19201670) to your request and then prompt the model to create a Postman Collection for you.

## Add the MCP server

To add the MCP server, do the following:

1. Choose an existing AI request or [create a new one](/docs/postman-ai/ai-requests/create/).
2. Open the **Tools** tab.
3. If you don't see the **Add Server** section, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add**.
4. Enter the server's command (STDIO) or URL (streamable HTTP), or search for the server. You can search for any server in your workspace or [on the Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/mcp-servers).
5. (Optional) Name your server.
6. (Optional) Add **Environment** (STDIO) or **Headers** (streamable HTTP) key-value pairs.
7. Click **Add Server**.

Postman lists your server under **MCP Servers**.

By default, your server is on, which means all of its tools are available to your request. To make them unavailable, turn your server off.

You can also make individual tools available and unavailable. To turn them on or off, click the server. Postman lists all of the server's tools. Then, select or clear the tool to make it available or unavailable, respectively.


# Use your AI request to interact with an AI model

You interact with AI models with two kinds of prompts: user prompts and system prompts.

A *user prompt* is an individual request made within the context of an ongoing conversation, such as a question or instruction. For example, "When did Postman's founders found the company?" or "List Postman's best collaboration features."

A *system prompt* sets the parameters and overall context for the entire conversation. For example, "Respond like you're Cooper the dog—Postman's official mascot. You're friendly and helpful."

As you interact with an AI model, the model returns a response. You can use these responses to experiment, test, and evaluate an AI model.

## Interact with the AI model

To interact with the AI model, do the following:

# Use your MCP request to interact with an MCP server

You can interact with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers with server and client capabilities. These features give AI models further context and extend their capabilities. Servers that support the [MCP Apps Extension](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) can also return interactive user interfaces.

*Server capabilities* are features the server exposes. These capabilities include [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools), [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), and [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts). *Client capabilities* are features the client exposes. They typically require user input. These capabilities include [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling), [roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots), and [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/elicitation).

When you send requests to a server, the server returns a response. Servers can also send real-time notifications and requests of their own. You can use these interactions to experiment, test, and evaluate a server.

## Interact with an MCP server capability

Server capabilities include the following:

* *Tools* are actions the server can perform for an AI model. For example, an AI model can use a server's tool to create a calendar event for you.

* *Resources* are data the server can retrieve for an AI model. For example, an AI model can use a server's resources to get your schedule from your calendar.

* *Prompts* are prompt templates the server can suggest for interacting with an AI model. For example, the server can suggest, "Can you create an event for me?" or "Can you show me my schedule for tomorrow?"

To interact with an MCP server capability, do the following:

1. Choose an existing MCP request or [create a new one](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/create/).

2. Click **Load Capabilities**. If prompted, review the consent prompt and grant Postman access. Postman connects to the server and displays the server's capabilities.

3. List the server's capabilities:

# Promote your MCP server on the Postman API Network

The [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/) is where millions of developers discover, test, and integrate APIs. Publishing your work on the Postman API Network is a powerful way to get new customers and drive deeper adoption from your existing user base. As the industry shifts towards AI-driven applications, developers are actively seeking new ways for agents and models to interact programmatically with services.

You’ve already built an MCP server to give AI agents a dedicated entry point to your services. The next step is to get it in front of the developers who need it. Publishing your server on the Postman API Network makes it available to developers building AI-powered features, allowing them to discover, test, and integrate with your MCP server, within Postman.

This topic guides you through the steps to publish your MCP server and feature it in Postman's [official MCP Catalog](https://www.postman.com/explore/mcp-servers), connecting your work with the world's largest and most active API community.

## Become a publisher

The first step to publishing on the Postman API Network is sharing your public APIs. Before adding an MCP server, your team needs a complete public profile and at least one public workspace that contains your well-documented API collections.

The goal is to become a [verified publisher](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/), which builds consumer trust and awards your team a blue "verified" badge. This verification is critical when it comes to MCP servers. Because AI agents run actions based on the tools your server provides, developers need absolute confidence that they're integrating with the official, authoritative source.

To learn more about setting up your public profile, creating public workspaces, and preparing for verification, see [Showcase your public APIs on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/overview/).

Once you are an established publisher sharing your APIs, you'll be ready to add your MCP server to your public workspace.

## Build your MCP server collection

Once your team is established as a publisher, you're ready to add your MCP server to a new collection. To build out your MCP collection, do the following:

1. Create a new [collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/) within your workspace and give it a clear name, for example, "My AI Service MCP Server".
2. Add a detailed description to your collection. The description must explain primary use cases for your MCP server and how to get started. Be sure to include any authentication or setup instructions.
3. [Add an MCP request](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/overview/) for each MCP server configuration. Postman supports different types of MCP servers. You  need to add one or more requests to your collection that lets users to interact with your server.

   * For local servers: If one or more of your MCP servers are run locally using a command-line tool, you can add a STDIO request for each server that includes the necessary command and arguments, for example `npx -y @mycompany/mycompany-mcp-server`. You must include all necessary environment variables.
   * For remote servers: If your server can be reached using HTTP or SSE, add a request with the requisite URL and assign the HTTP request type. You must include all necessary environment variables.

Learn more about [configuring MCP requests](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/create/).

## Make a workspace update announcing your MCP server

When your collection is ready, announce it to the community using a [workspace update](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/). These updates appear on your public workspace and in the Postman API Network's news feed, ensuring maximum visibility.

## Add your MCP server to the Postman MCP Catalog

The official [Postman MCP Catalog](https://www.postman.com/explore/mcp-servers) is a curated list of high-quality, official MCP servers. The best way to have your server included is to follow the steps to become a publisher and create a complete, public MCP collection in your own workspace.

Once your public MCP collection is ready, email Postman at [api-network@postman.com](mailto:api-network@postman.com). The team will review your submission and, upon approval, fork it into the official catalog.

If you're not a publisher yet, but would like to suggest an MCP server for the catalog, reach out to our team at the same email address. Please include a link to your official documentation and any necessary configuration details for our team to review ahead of adding your server to the catalog.


# Create AI request blocks and add them to your flows

You create AI request blocks to interact with an AI model of your choice, such as one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/), [Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/), or [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/). You can then manage how you interact with the model.

AI request blocks can help you evaluate different AI models, add AI to your workflows, prototype agents, and much more.

## Create your AI request blocks

Create AI request blocks to interact with AI models. You can then add them to your flows and organize them in your workspace for your project.

To learn more, see [Create an AI request block for your flow](/docs/postman-ai/ai-request-blocks/create/).

## Interact with AI models

Use prompts to interact with AI models. As you interact with the model, it returns a response. You can then manage how you interact with the model.

To learn more, see [Use your AI request block to interact with an AI model](/docs/postman-ai/ai-request-blocks/interact/).


# Create an AI request block for your flow

You use [**AI Request**](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/ai-request/) blocks to interact with AI models, which can help you evaluate different models, add AI to your workflows, prototype AI agents, and much more. You can add **AI Request** blocks to [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/build-your-first-flow/).

# Create MCP servers with Postman Flows

You can create [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers and MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts), and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources) using [*actions*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) in Postman Flows. Actions are flows running in the cloud, with public URLs where users can send requests. The action processes the requests and returns the results that the AI model generates using the MCP server's tools. You can create and run an MCP server as an action without doing any coding.

To learn how actions in Postman Flows function as MCP servers with AI tools, see [MCP servers in Postman Flows](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-server-flows/mcp-server-flows/).

To learn how to create and run an MCP server in Postman Flows, see [Create an MCP server with Postman Flows](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-server-flows/create-mcp-server-flow/).


# MCP servers in Postman Flows

In [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/), you can define a special [*scenario*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/) to create an [*Action*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) that functions as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) server with MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts), and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources). When deployed to a public URL, the action can process incoming requests and send the results as responses.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This document describes the concepts behind MCP servers in Flows. For the steps to create one, see [Create an MCP server with Postman Flows](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-server-flows/create-mcp-server-flow/).
</Info>

Actions are special flows that can be deployed to a public URL in the Postman cloud. Users can send requests to the action's URL. The URL can also be triggered by external systems like webhooks, third-party apps, and other APIs. The action processes incoming data using the [blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/) on its canvas, then sends the result as a response.

To function as an MCP server, an action needs a scenario named **toolDefinition** that defines the server's MCP tools, prompts, and resources. *Scenarios* in flows are sets of static values used by the flow's blocks. Data items required by MCP tools are called *arguments*. The body of the **toolDefinition** scenario must follow the MCP [tool definition structure](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools/).

## Test your MCP server in Postman

You can use your MCP server from any client that supports the Model Context Protocol, such as Claude or VS Code GitHub Copilot. But you can also quickly test your MCP server from Postman, using an MCP request.

When you create an [MCP request](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-requests/create/) in Postman and connect to the MCP server, the request shows the available tools. You can click a tool to see its required arguments.

<img alt="Example MCP request in Postman Flows" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-example-mcp-request-v11-51.jpg" />

You can then enter the required arguments and click **Run** to get a response from the MCP server.


# Create an MCP server with Postman Flows

In [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/overview/), you can define a special [*scenario*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/) to create an [*Action*](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/) that functions as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) server with MCP [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts), and [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources). Once deployed, the [action](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/)’s URL can receive requests, process incoming data using [blocks](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks/overview/), and send responses.

## Create a deployable flow and a toolDefinition scenario

To begin building an MCP server in Postman Flows, do the following:

1. [Create a deployable flow](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#create-a-deployable-flow) in Postman Flows.

2. In the flow, [create a scenario](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/configure/scenarios/#create-a-scenario) and name it "toolDefinition".

## Add tools to the toolDefinition scenario

In the **toolDefinition** scenario, you define the MCP tools that you want to make available to the MCP server you're building. Meanwhile, in the flow canvas, you add blocks to work with the data that the MCP server will obtain through each tool.&#x20;

1. In the **Body** section of your **toolDefinition** scenario, enter one or more tools using the MCP [tool definition structure](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools/#tool-definition-structure). For example, adding the following to the scenario defines a tool that greets a user by name:

   ```json
   {
     "tools": [
       {
         "name": "greeter",
         "description": "Says hello to a person by their first name",
         "inputSchema": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "first_name": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "The person's first name"
             }
           },
           "required": [
             "first_name"
           ]
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Each item in the `properties` element of the tool definition will become an *argument* in calls to the tool.
   </Info>

2. Add blocks to the flow to perform the tool's task. For the greeter tool, you can use a **Template** block to concatenate the user's name to the message "Hello":

   <img alt="Example MCP server in Postman Flows" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-example-mcp-server-v11-58.2-v2.jpg" />

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     Recall that in your tool definition, the `properties` element defines a `first_name` property. Since tool definition properties become tool call arguments, the path to that property in the example **Select** block is `arguments.first_name`.
   </Info>

3. (Optional) For MCP servers that have multiple tools, you can use a **Condition** block to check which tool is being called in the request. Then a **Select** block can parse the tool's arguments.

   <img alt="Parse a tool's arguments" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-parse-argument-v11.59.2.jpg" />

If you don't want to add prompts or resources to your MCP server, go ahead and [deploy the flow](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#deploy-a-flow), then [test](#test-the-mcp-server) your MCP server.

## (Optional) Add prompts to the MCP server

You can add prompts to your MCP server in Flows. Servers with prompts can provide structured messages and instructions for interacting with language models. Clients can discover available prompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them.

The unique identifier for a prompt is in the `name` field. MCP requests will include this `name` field in the `params` section of the request body. Once it receives the request, the action strips away outer elements of the request body. What's left for the action to process is a JSON object with two key-value pairs: one whose key is `name` and the other whose key is `arguments`. The value of `arguments` is one or more key-value pairs.

You can add one or more prompts to the **Body** section of a **toolDefinition** scenario with the structure shown in the following example prompt:

```json
"prompts": [
  {
    "name": "example-prompt",
    "title": "Request Code Review",
    "description": "Asks the LLM to analyze data file to find anomalies",
    "arguments": [
      {
        "name": "file",
        "description": "The data file to review",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A real-life **toolDefinition** will include any prompts and resources along with tools. If you add the tool, prompt, and resource examples provided in this topic to a single **toolDefinition**, the resulting **toolDefinition** will be structurally valid. However, since those examples are all from different use cases, the resulting won't be a practical example of a **toolDefinition** that makes sense for a real-life purpose.
</Info>

## (Optional) Add resources to the MCP server

Resources enable servers to share data that provides context to language models. Each resource is uniquely identified by a URI (not a name as in a tool or a prompt). MCP requests will include this `uri` field in the `params` section of the request body. The action receives the internal content of the request body: the outer elements are stripped away.

For example, consider the following prompt that specifies a tool:

```json
"params": {
    "name": "code_review",
    "arguments": {
      "code": "def hello():\n    print('world')"
    }
  }
```

The "unboxed" version of this prompt that an action will process looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "code_review",
    "arguments": {
      "code": "def hello():\n    print('world')"
    }
}
```

Similarly, a prompt that specifies a resource might look like this:

```json
{
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs"
  }
}
```

An action will process the "unboxed" version of the prompt, namely `{ uri }`.

You can add one or more resources to the **Body** section of your **toolDefinition** scenario with the structure shown in the following example resource:

```json
"resources": [
      {
        "uri": "http://example.com/data.json",
        "name": "data.js",
        "title": "Data file",
        "description": "File containing important data",
        "mimeType": "application/json"
      }
    ]
```

If you want to parameterize the resources your MCP server exposes, you can add one or more *resource templates* to the **Body** section of your **toolDefinition** scenario. MCP resource templates are [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570), structured as shown in the following example:

```json
"resourceTemplates": [
      {
        "uriTemplate": "file:///{path}",
        "name": "Project Files",
        "title": "Project Files",
        "description": "Access files in the project directory",
        "mimeType": "application/octet-stream"
      }
    ]
```

Once it receives the request, the action strips some outer elements of the request body away. What's left for the action to process is a JSON object with two key-value pairs: one whose key is `name` and the other whose key is `arguments`. The value of `arguments` is one or more key-value pairs.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  A real-life **toolDefinition** will include any prompts and resources along with tools. If you add the tool, prompt, and resource examples provided in this topic to a single **toolDefinition**, the resulting **toolDefinition** will be structurally valid. However, since those examples are all from different use cases, the resulting won't be a practical example of a **toolDefinition** that makes sense for a real-life purpose.
</Info>

## Deploy the MCP server

Given an action with a **toolDefinition** scenario that defines tools and (optionally) prompts and resources, you can [deploy the action](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/structure/actions/#deploy-an-action). Once deployed, your action will be an MCP server, meaning that the deployed action's URL will respond to MCP requests.

## Test the MCP server

This topic assumes that your goal is to configure an AI application such as Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT to use your new MCP server. Before you do that, you can use Postman to create and send an MCP request to the server.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This procedure tests whether the MCP tool definition and the flow itself work as designed. It won't test the functionality of any prompts or resources that you add to the tool definition, because those would require interacting with an LLM, which an MCP request won't do.
</Info>

To test your MCP server, do the following:

1. Click **Deploy** (even if you have already deployed the action) to open the **Deploy** dialog.

2. Hover over the **MCP URL** and click <img alt="Open in Postman icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-openInPostman-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Open in MCP request**. A new MCP request opens.

3. In the MCP request, make sure **HTTP** is selected from the protocol dropdown list.

4. Click **Connect**. The MCP server's tools appear in the **Message** section. Click a tool to view and enter any required arguments.

5. Click **Run** to send the request to the MCP server. The `params` element of the request body will include the tool name and the arguments. Below that you'll find the response body in the **Response** section.

   <img alt="Sending an MCP request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/flows-sending-mcp-request-v11.58.3.jpg" />

When you are satisfied with the results of this test, you can move on to configuring your AI application of choice to use your new MCP server.

Set up your [alerts](/docs/insights/reference/app/alerts-tab/) and integrate them with Slack. Use Repro Mode to rerun requests using real data. Enable Repro Mode from your Insights project **Settings**. Then, [debug your endpoints using Repro Mode](/docs/insights/debug/).


# Try a local Insights demo

You can explore a demo of Postman Insights capabilities on a local Docker instance. A prerequisite for the demo is that you've locally installed and configured [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

To get started, do the following:

1. Add Insights to your workspace. Access your **Workspace settings** and turn on **Insights**.

   <img alt="Enable Insights" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-enable-v11.45.jpg" />

2. Select **Insights** from the sidebar and click **Try a local demo**. This action creates a new Insights project.

   <img alt="Try an Insights demo" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-try-demo-v11.60.png" />

3. Copy the agent install script. The script installs the Insights Agent to generate traffic in Docker. It contains your project ID (formatted as *svc\_xxxxxxxxxx*) and API key. The project ID is autopopulated, but if you need to retrieve it, you'll find it in the **Diagnostics** tab. To insert your API key, click **Generate Key** or **Use Existing Key**.

   <img alt="Copy the Insights demo script" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-run-demo-v11.60.png" />

4. Run the script on your command line. You'll need to input your local password to start the install. Your Docker container will show your API traffic.

# Install Postman Insights Agent on Kubernetes

The Postman Insights Agent listens to the traffic arriving at the cluster service you want to monitor and automatically populates your Insights project with endpoints.

To use the Insights Agent with Kubernetes, you can install it as a [DaemonSet](/docs/insights/get-started/kubernetes/daemonset/) or [sidecar](/docs/insights/get-started/kubernetes/sidecar/).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Best practice:** If you're installing the Insights Agent through a DevOps team or on more than one service, Postman recommends the DaemonSet installation.
</Info>


# Install Postman Insights Agent as a DaemonSet

Install the Postman Insights Agent as a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) if you want to install it in multiple services at once, for example, across your entire organization by your DevOps or platform team.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Estimated time:** 10-minute setup, 5-minute wait
</Info>

This installation is a three-part process consisting of:

1. [Installing the Insights Agent](#install-the-agent-in-the-kubernetes-cluster) as a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes cluster.
2. [Onboarding your service](#onboard-your-service-to-insights) as environment variables.
3. [Activating Repro Mode](#activate-repro-mode), to enable you to reproduce errors on real user data.

You can also set up [alerts](#set-up-alerts) to get notifications about your errors.

## Requirements

* Edit permissions for the Kubernetes deployment.
* Postman Workspace Admin or Editor role.
* **Linux environment.** The agent and the user’s service should be running in a Linux environment.
* **Insights project.** See [Get started with Postman Insights](/docs/insights/get-started/overview/) to learn more.

## Install the agent in the Kubernetes cluster

To install the Insights agent as a DaemonSet in your Kubernetes cluster, do the following:

1. Download the [postman-insights-agent-daemonset.yaml](https://releases.observability.postman.com/scripts/postman-insights-agent-daemonset.yaml) manifest file.

2. Apply the manifest file to your cluster by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f postman-insights-agent-daemonset.yaml
   ```

   This sets up the following resources in your cluster:

   | Resource type        | Resource                                      |
   | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
   | Namespace            | `postman-insights-namespace`                  |
   | Service Account      | `postman-insights-service-account`            |
   | Cluster Role         | `postman-insights-read-only-role`             |
   | Cluster Role Binding | `postman-insights-view-all-resources-binding` |
   | DaemonSet            | `postman-insights-agent`                      |

3. Wait for all the pods assigned to the DaemonSet to start up. You can check the status of the DaemonSet by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get daemonsets -n postman-insights-namespace postman-insights-agent
   ```

   The number of desired and ready pods should be equal.

   <img alt="Daemonset pods" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-daemonset-pods-v11.45.png" />

## Onboard your service to Insights

To continue onboarding your service, you'll collect your project ID and API key and move on to adding the required environment variables to your Kubernetes deployment.

### Get your project ID

Go to the **Diagnostics** tab to locate your project ID string, formatted as *svc\_xxxxxxxxxx*. Copy and keep it for the next steps.

### Get your Postman API key

[Get or create a new API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys). For more information, see [Generate and use Postman API keys](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/). Keep the API key for the next steps.

### Manage and store the API Key

You need to provide the API key as an environment variable to the containers. You can either add it directly in the deployment YAML file or use one of the following methods:

* Kubernetes ConfigMap
* Kubernetes Secrets
* AWS Secrets Manager
* HashiCorp Vault
* Other secret management tools

When using these options, make sure the container has the necessary permissions to access the secret from your secrets manager and that the secret is accessible from within the container.
The following examples show how to use Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets to store the API key.

Learn more about [DaemonSet security considerations](/docs/insights/data/daemonset-security/).

### Add environment variables to your deployment

You can add environment variables by defining them directly or by using a ConfigMap.

Do the following:

1. Set the following two environment variables per service:

   | Environment variable          | Description                                                                                        |
   | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_PROJECT_ID` | Your Insights project ID from the Postman app.                                                     |
   | `POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_API_KEY`    | Your AWS Secret ARN of Postman API Key, which will be used to send traffic data from your service. |

   You can use these optional environment variables:

   | Environment variable                  | Description                                                                              |
   | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_DISABLE_REPRO_MODE` | Turn off Repro Mode for a specific service.                                              |
   | `POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_AGENT_RATE_LIMIT`   | Service-specific rate limit. The Insights Agent drops traffic after reaching this limit. |

2. Based on the following options, decide how to use Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets to store the API key.

   * [Option 1: Define environment variables directly](#option-1-define-environment-variables-directly)
   * [Option 2: Define environment variables using a ConfigMap](#option-2-define-environment-variables-using-a-configmap)
   * [Option 3: Define environment variables using both ConfigMap and Secrets](#option-3-define-environment-variables-using-both-configmap-and-secrets)

### Option 1: Define environment variables directly

To add an environment variable to a Kubernetes deployment from a config file, you typically define it in a YAML manifest under the env section of the container spec.

```yaml
...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image
          env:
            - name: POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_PROJECT_ID
              value: "svc_xxxxxxxxxx"
            - name: POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_API_KEY
              value: "PMAK_xxxxxxxxxx"
  ...
...
```

### Option 2: Define environment variables using a ConfigMap

If you want to manage environment variables through a ConfigMap, do the following:

1. Define the ConfigMap:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: deployment-service-config
   data:
     POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_PROJECT_ID: "svc_xxxxxxxxxx"
     POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_API_KEY: "PMAK_xxxxxxxx"
   ```

2. Reference the ConfigMap in the deployment:

   ```yaml
   ...
   spec:
     ...
     template:
       ...
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: deployment-service
             image: deployment-service-image
             envFrom:
               - configMapRef:
                   name: deployment-service-config
     ...
   ...
   ```

This imports all key-value pairs from the `deployment-service-config` as environment variables into the container.

### Option 3: Define environment variables using both ConfigMap and Secrets

If you want to store the API Key in secrets (for security concerns) and the Service ID in Config Map, do the following:

1. Define the ConfigMap:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: deployment-service-config
   data:
     POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_PROJECT_ID: "svc_xxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

2. Define the secret:

   * Encode your API key.

     ```bash
     echo -n "<your_api_key>" | base64
     # Output: UE1BSy1hc2RmZ2hqa2wtcXdlcnR5dTU0MzIx
     ```

   * Create `secret.yaml`.

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: deployment-service-secret
     type: Opaque
     data:
       POSTMAN_INSIGHTS_API_KEY: "encoded API key"
     ```

3. Reference both ConfigMap and Secret in the deployment:

   ```yaml
   ...
   spec:
     ...
     template:
       ...
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: deployment-service
             image: deployment-service-image
             envFrom:
               - configMapRef:
                   name: deployment-service-config
               - secretRef:
                   name: deployment-service-secret
     ...
   ...
   ```

After you add the environment variables, the deployment restarts, and new pods are created. The Insights Agent, running as a DaemonSet, begins monitoring traffic from your services.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Tip:** If you're not seeing your endpoints right away, traffic may be taking some time to collect. See the next section for more information.
</Info>

## Wait for the Insights Agent to collect traffic

After Insights detects traffic from the Insights Agent, you'll get automatically redirected to the **Overview** page. The Insights Agent needs 5-8 minutes to use AI to generate endpoints.

If you're only seeing health checks, your traffic may be affected. If you're not seeing what you expect after 10 minutes, see [Diagnose and troubleshoot Insights Agent errors](/docs/insights/troubleshoot/overview/).

## Activate Repro Mode

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only a Workspace Admin can enable the **Repro Mode**.
</Info>

In a DaemonSet setup, agent-level Repro Mode can be controlled both at the DaemonSet level and at the individual service level. For Repro Mode to work for a service, you need to activate it at both the agent and service levels.

To turn on Repro Mode, go to your Insights project and click [**Settings**](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/). Then, toggle on **Activate Repro Mode**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Default data redactions.** Postman Insights automatically redacts a set of sensitive values including authentication tokens. See the [full list](/docs/insights/data/redactions/). You can also add fields to redact ahead of turning on the feature.
</Info>

## Set up alerts

Insights alerts notify you about your errors in real time, so you can act on them immediately. In your Insights project's **Alerts** tab, you can adjust error rate thresholds, find and view problematic endpoints, mute or unmute alerts globally for specific endpoints, and integrate your alerts with Slack. Learn more about [configuring and using alerts](/docs/insights/reference/app/alerts-tab/).


# Install Postman Insights Agent as a sidecar

After you create an Insights project and select **Start with Kubernetes**, you can begin your Insights Agent installation as a [sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/). To reproduce errors on real user data, activate the Insights' Repro Mode.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Estimated time:** 10-minute setup, 5-minute wait
</Info>

After onboarding a service, you'll see your endpoints and their insights. Then, you can leverage the Insights' [Repro Mode](#activate-repro-mode) to debug your failing endpoints. You can also set up [alerts](#set-up-alerts) to get notifications about your errors.

## Requirements

* Edit permissions for the Kubernetes deployment.
* Postman Workspace Admin or Editor role.
* **Linux environment.** The agent and the user’s service should be running in a Linux environment.

## More help with the ECS install

The following tasks help to set up your ECS install.

### Ensure internet access

Verify that your Fargate or EC2 task has a route to the internet.

#### Fargate tasks

To verify that your task has a route to the internet:

* When using a public subnet, you can assign a public IP address to the task ENI.
* When using a private subnet, the subnet can have a NAT gateway attached.

For more information, see [Amazon ECS task networking options for the Fargate launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/fargate-task-networking.html).

#### EC2 tasks

Tasks must be launched in private subnets with NAT gateway. For more information, see [Amazon ECS task networking options for the EC2 launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html).

### Set up AWS ECS permissions

Attach the following policy to your AWS profile.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:UpdateService",
                "ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:DescribeServices",
                "ecs:TagResource",
                "ecs:DescribeTaskDefinition",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters"
                ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The Postman Insights Agent CLI needs the following permissions to install the Insights Agent in ECS. If the profile you selected is missing any of these permissions, the CLI displays an error message indicating which action it was attempting to perform.

The `AmazonECS_FullAccess` policy provided by Amazon is a superset of these actions. You could add the entire policy to ensure full permission.

# Install Postman Insights Agent on EC2

The Postman Insights Agent listens to the traffic arriving at the service you want to monitor and automatically populates your Insights project with endpoints.

To use the Insights Agent with a standalone Linux instance of Amazon EC2, complete the following steps.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Estimated time:** 10-minute setup, 5-minute wait
</Info>

After onboarding a service, you'll see your endpoints and their insights. Then, you can leverage the Insights' [Repro Mode](#activate-repro-mode) to debug your failing endpoints. You can also set up [alerts](#set-up-alerts) to get notifications about your errors.

## Requirements

* SSH access to your virtual EC2 machine.
* Your server's OS supports `systemd`.
* Root user privileges in order to edit `systemd` files.
* **Insights project.** See [Get started with Postman Insights](/docs/insights/get-started/overview/) to learn more.

## Install Insights Agent on EC2

To install the Insights Agent, do the following:

1. From the **Setup** tab of your workspace, select **Start with EC2**.

   <img alt="Select your environment" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-environment-select-v.11.45.jpg" />

2. Log in to the EC2 instance. For more information, see [Connect to your EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect.html).

3. As shown on the Insights onboarding screen, run the install script on that instance.

   ```bash
   bash -c "$(curl -L https://releases.observability.postman.com/scripts/install-postman-insights-agent.sh)"
   ```

4. On the Insights onboarding screen, click **Add API key** to copy and paste it with the next command.

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     In the example command below, the angle brackets and the text between them are placeholders. The command you copy in the onboarding screen will contain your correct API key and project ID.
   </Info>

   ```bash
   sudo POSTMAN_API_KEY=<your-api-key> postman-insights-agent ec2 setup --project <projectId> --repro-mode
   ```

   <Info class="iconless-callout">
     The `--repro-mode` flag allows the agent to send encrypted payload data for rerunning requests.
   </Info>

   In the resulting output, the server checks for user permissions and the presence of `systemd`, configures `systemd` files, and enables Postman Insights Agent as a `systemd` service.

5. Check the status or logs. Run the `journalctl` command:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -fu postman-insights-agent
   ```

6. In Postman, check out the Insight Project's **Endpoints** tab to see the list of endpoints the Insights Agent generates as it gathers data.

# Debug with Insights

Repro Mode aims to make it seamless to rerun requests using real user data from production. The Insights Agent prefills the data for you from the observed traffic, eliminating the need to check logs and traces to find the elements needed to send the request and fix your failing endpoint.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Coming soon:** You'll be able to use Repro Mode to replicate bugs and errors in lower environments, such as staging or development, where deeper debugging is possible.
</Info>

Before you can reproduce your errors, you need to decide which data needs to be redacted and turn on Repro Mode in the [**Settings**](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/) tab.

## Locate your error

If you know you have an error but don't know exactly which endpoint, or if you are wondering whether you have errors at all, there are a couple of ways to find them:

* From the [**Global insights**](/docs/insights/reference/app/global-insights/) page.

* From the [**Error overview**](/docs/insights/reference/app/errors-tab/#errors-overview) page.

* From the [**Alerts**](/docs/insights/reference/app/alerts-tab/) page.

Each of these pages provides error details you can select to inspect the cause of your errors.

## Analyze your alert AI summary

## Use Repro Mode

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Before you begin, check that the Repro Mode is enabled in the [**Settings**](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/) tab. This procedure assumes that you enabled the `--repro-mode` flag during your [Insights Agent configuration](/docs/insights/get-started/overview/).
</Info>

You can access Repro Mode from an [Error details](/docs/insights/reference/app/errors-tab/#error-details) page, which you get to by selecting an endpoint from the **Overview**, **Errors**, and **Endpoints** tabs.

To use Repro Mode, select the **Run** dropdown.

<img alt="Access Insights Repro Mode" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-repro-mode-access-v.11.58.png" />

Clicking **Original request** takes you to Postman's [request builder](/docs/sending-requests/requests/), where you can reproduce your error.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Coming soon:** You'll be able to use Bifrost and Access Logs in the future iterations of Postman Insights.
</Info>

## Debug your endpoint with Repro Mode

To debug a failing endpoint, do the following:

1. From the **Errors** tab, search and filter endpoints by time range, error code, host, or method. You can also use text search.

   <img alt="Sort errors" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-repro-sort-v11.62.png" />

2. Select a failed request you want to inspect and reproduce. Then, expand it to observe the endpoint details such as request, headers, response, and query parameters, if any.

   <img alt="Request details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-request-expanded-v11.62.2.png" />

3. Click **Run** to open Postman's request builder.

   <img alt="Run Repro Mode" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-repro-run-v11.62.2.png" />

4. Click **Send** to reproduce the error.

5. In the response pane, select **Save as example** to capture the error response.

## Known limitations of Repro Mode

As the Postman Insights team continues to improve automation around Repro Mode, you may need to manually substitute values in the [Repro Mode settings](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/). Known instances of this requirement include:

* URLs and authorization.

* Redacted sensitive values, like keys.

* Resources that do not exist in pre-production environments, for instance, collection IDs and user IDs.

## Debugging in different environments

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  In-app support for this feature is coming soon.
</Info>

If, for example, you choose to debug a specific error, you can try to run the request in different environments or using Bifrost. Suppose you choose to use a beta environment to replicate your `403` error. If you try to send it, you might get `User not found`, and the reason can be that the user token is missing. You can paste the access token of your beta environment and replicate the issue.


# Customize your Postman Insights

The Postman Insights Agent observes your API traffic to automatically populate your endpoints inside your *Insights project*. You can customize your project to pinpoint, monitor, and troubleshoot the endpoints you're most interested in.

You can [redact your data](#redact-your-own-data-for-repro-mode) before you rerun requests to your endpoints. You can [show or hide the endpoints filtered out](#show-or-hide-your-filtered-endpoints) by the Insights Agent. If the Postman Insights AI didn't get your endpoints right, you can also [give path hints](#edit-path-parameters) to improve the inference. To monitor a set of endpoints of your choosing, you can select and [save them to a Postman Collection](#add-endpoints-to-a-collection).

## Redact your own data for Repro Mode

When rerunning requests in Repro Mode, Postman Insights automatically redacts a set of sensitive values, including authentication tokens. See the [full list](/docs/insights/data/redactions/). You can redact your own fields before you [turn on Repro Mode](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/#activate-repro-mode) or for the data you receive going forward.

To redact your own data, do the following:

1. In the [**Settings**](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/) tab, under **Fields to redact**, use either of the following options:

   * Match a field name, and redact anything that's present in such a field.
   * Match the data using a regular expression, and redact anything that matches that regular expression.

   To redact more than one value, enter each expression on a separate line.

2. Click **Save** to apply your options.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Note:** You can redact data at any time for both new and existing Insights projects. Edits don't apply retroactively to the stored data. However, the displayed payloads take the new settings into account immediately, if they're more restrictive.
</Info>

When matching data is found, it will be replaced with the string `*REDACTED*`.

## Show or hide your filtered endpoints

Insights observes all API traffic, including API calls you may not be interested in.

By default, Insights filters the following endpoints:

* **IP-host addresses** - These are API calls that have an IP host where the `postman.com` part is usually found.

* **Health checks** - These are API calls to `/healthz` and similar endpoints used for pinging the health of a service.

For example, you may want to view these endpoints in the following cases:

* The Insights service is getting your traffic, but all API calls are filtered out.
* You're getting errors on IP host or health check endpoints.

To show IP host and health endpoints, go to the [**Settings**](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/) tab, and toggle on **IP hosts & health checks**.

When this option isn't turned on, Postman displays the number of hidden endpoints in the **Errors**, **Endpoints**, and **Alerts** tabs.

<img alt="Hidden endpoints" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-hidden-endpoints-v11.60.png" />

## Edit path parameters

As Postman Insights watches your API traffic, it's automatically finding the dynamic parts of API paths and replacing them with path argument variables. However, the Insights AI doesn't always get things right, and you may have to give some hints.

To edit a path parameter, do the following:

1. In your Insights Project, select the **Endpoints** tab.

2. Select <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-edit-stroke.svg#icon" width="16" /> **Edit path parameters** next to the endpoint you want to edit.

3. From the dropdown list, select the component to edit.

   <img alt="Select component" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-path-component-v11-3.jpg" width="405" />

4. Give the component a name, which will automatically display as a variable in the endpoint.

5. Specify the parameter values. You can select the types of characters the parameter can include or, for better precision, specify a string by entering regular expressions. Make sure to press **Return** or **Enter** after each expression. Values that will and won't be included appear at the bottom.

   <img alt="Edit parameter" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-path-regex-v11-3.jpg" width="405" />

6. Select **Next** to review any exceptions you want to use to avoid merging specific values into the parameter, for example, if you want to watch a specific endpoint separately.

7. Select **Confirm** to apply the change. The timeline will be recomputed, and the API model will apply the new rule to future traffic.

   <img alt="Confirm edit" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-path-exceptions-v11-3.jpg" width="405" />

## Add endpoints to a collection

Adding your endpoints to a collection enables you to keep track of a specific set of endpoints. Before you decide to save endpoints to a collection, take a look at the endpoint details to help you make a selection. To learn more, see [Explore your endpoints](/docs/insights/reference/app/errors-tab/).

To curate your endpoints, do the following:

1. In your Insights Project, select the **Endpoints** tab.

2. Find endpoints that you would like to monitor and add them to a curated collection. For example, select all endpoints by a specific host and select **Save to Collection**.

   <img alt="Insights curation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-curation-v11.60.png" />

3. Add the selected endpoints to an existing curated collection or create a new collection. Select **Add**.

   <img alt="Save endpoints to a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-save-to-collection-v11.jpg" />

4. Access your curated collection and check the **Endpoints** tab.

   <img alt="Endpoints in an Insights collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-collection-endpoints-v11.58.png" />

To explore and debug your endpoints, see [Debug with Insights](/docs/insights/debug/).


# Diagnose and troubleshoot Insights errors

Postman Insights shows you the properties of your system based on real-time API traffic. For Insights to work, the Insights Agent needs to see your API traffic. As you work in Insights, you may encounter errors and receive error messages. In many of these cases, there's a solution.

The Insights Agent doesn't support these three cases:

* Encrypted traffic.
* gRPC/GraphQL.
* PaaS platforms where the Insights Agent can't easily access the network traffic through packet capture. Known platforms in this category are Heroku and Render.

If you experience any of these cases, contact [Support](mailto:observability-support@postman.com).

Postman provides more information about how to debug what's going on:

* Diagnostic information in the CLI itself. If your traffic is getting blocked in a way that the Insights Agent recognizes, your CLI shows error output describing what's gone wrong. If you need help resolving your issues, email your log output to [Support](mailto:observability-support@postman.com).
* Information about encrypted traffic and errors in Postman. To see if your agent is working, or to debug problems, you can see traffic error states and messages in the Insights Project's [**Diagnostics**](/docs/insights/reference/app/diagnostics-tab/) tab.

The following are some common issues you may experience and their respective solutions:

* [ECS memory issues](/docs/insights/troubleshoot/memory/).
* [API traffic errors](/docs/insights/troubleshoot/traffic/).


# ECS memory issues

The Postman Insights Agent needs at least 300 MB of memory to run. If you've used most memory available, you need to make adjustments. Consider specifying an upper limit. Learn more from the following use cases.

For more information, see [How Amazon ECS manages CPU and memory resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/how-amazon-ecs-manages-cpu-and-memory-resources/).

## OutofMemory message

A task memory limit is required for an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate instance but optional for an ECS on EC2 instance. If you specify a task-level memory limit, the [`ecs add`](/docs/insights/reference/agent/ecs-add/) command won't specify the memory size for the Insights Agent. This means the Agent shares memory with other containers in the task.

If the instance runs out of memory, one of the containers may stop operating. If you see instances restarting after an `OutOfMemory` outage, you can either increase the hard limit for the task, or set a hard limit on the Agent. To set a hard limit on the Agent, specify at least 700 MB as the **Memory hard limit** value in the container definition.

For more information, see [How do I troubleshoot `OutOfMemory` errors in Amazon ECS?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ecs-resolve-outofmemory-errors).

## Container size is too large

If you don't specify a task-level memory limit, then the `ecs add` command sets a container-level memory request of 300 MB. This means that your task requires additional 300 MB of memory to be scheduled on an instance.

If you use a Docker Compose file to create your ECS task or service and no memory limit is specified, the Insights Agent sidecar is allocated 512 MB by default.

If you've already tuned the other containers in your task definition based on the instance size used in your cluster, the total size of the base container and the sidecar may be too large to schedule. You'll get the following message:

```bash
INFO[0006] (service mgg-test) was unable to place a task because no container instance met all of its requirements. The closest matching (container-instance 79cac21ecdb44097a989744944e202d7) has insufficient memory available. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide. timestamp="2023-12-18 23:31:31 +0000 UTC"
```

![Insufficient memory](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/live-insights-insufficient-memory-v10-21.jpg)

In this case, you may need to reduce the memory or `memoryReservation` parameters on other containers in the task by the 300 MB (or 512 MB) requested by the Insights Agent.


# Troubleshoot traffic issues

You've set up the Postman Insights Agent, and you've been running API traffic across the network, but your API model page is either empty or shows random endpoints you don't care about.

The endpoints you expected to find in your first Insights project may not be appearing for the following reasons:

* Permission issues that prevent the Insights Agent from seeing traffic. See [Insights project permissions](#insights-project-permissions) for solutions.
* Your endpoints are encrypted. See [Encrypted traffic](#encrypted-traffic) for workarounds.
* The Insights Agent is seeing mostly health checks and infrastructure endpoints, and your other traffic isn't getting through. You can filter them out by [path](#filter-out-endpoints-by-path) or [IP address](#filter-out-endpoints-by-ip-address) or [increase the rate limit](#increase-rate-limit).
* ECS on EC2 with bridge networking. You can install Insights Agent as a daemon service only. See the [installation instructions](/docs/insights/get-started/ecs/#configure-the-insights-agent-as-a-daemon-service).
* Data formats that the Insights Agent doesn't recognize. Contact [Support](mailto:observability-support@postman.com).

## Insights project permissions

You may come across the following error message when you try to update your Insights project.

```shell
[ERROR] You cannot send traffic to the to the service with ID svc_01234AaBbCcDd. Ensure that your project ID is correct and that you have edit permissions on the collection. If you don't have edit permissions, please contact the workspace administrator to add you as a collection editor.
```

This issue can occur for the following reasons:

* You don't have the right project ID. To locate the project ID, select your Insights Project and then select the [**Diagnostics**](/docs/insights/reference/app/diagnostics-tab/) tab. The project ID is an alphanumeric string that begins with `svc_`.

  ![Get the project ID](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-diagnostics-tab-v11.65.png)

* You don't have the required permission. Please contact your Workspace Admin for access.

## Irrelevant or missing endpoints

You may have been able to successfully generate an API model, but most of the outputs are health checks.

The Insights Agent samples your traffic, rather than sending all of your traffic to Postman. As a result, health check and infrastructure endpoints can dominate the traffic that the Insights Agent sees. The Insights Agent's rate limiting (which defaults to 1000 calls per minute) may cause some API calls to be dropped. You can filter out the health endpoints or increase the rate limit to ensure you get the endpoints you care about.

To increase the Insights Agent's ability to capture meaningful, non-health check data, you can set up filters on the Insights Agent.

### Filter out endpoints by path

You can filter out traffic by using the `--path-exclusions` flag.

To remove a health check endpoint, for instance, use [`apidump`](/docs/insights/reference/agent/apidump/) with the `--path-exclusions` flag, specifying the path part of the health check.

For example, the following command causes all the `/health` endpoints on all hosts to be ignored by the Insights Agent:

```shell
apidump --project <projectID> –-path-exclusions ^/health$
```

The argument to `--path-exclusions` is a Go regular expression, which may match any part of the path. The special characters `^` and `$` set the start and end of a string, preventing the filter from matching other paths that include the string `/health`, like `/employee/health-benefits`.

### Filter out endpoints by IP address

If your model contains API calls to unnamed infrastructure services accessed by the IP address, you can remove them by using a regular expression in the `--host-exclusions` flag, as follows:

```shell
apidump --project <projectID> –-host-exclusions ^(\d)+\.(\d)+\.(\d)+\.(\d)+$
```

This removes all endpoints whose host is given by a dotted-quad IP address.

### Increase rate limit

If you get the error that the agents have seen traffic exceeding the rate limit of 12000 requests per minute, you can adjust the rate limit on your Insights Agent.

Locate `postman-insights-agent` in your deployment and add the `--rate-limit` flag with a higher value.

For example, if you're on an ECS deployment, do the following:

1. Go to the **Task definitions** page of the ECS console. Ensure you are in the appropriate AWS region.
2. Select `postman-insights-agent`.
3. From the **Create new task definition** dropdown list, select **Create new task definition with JSON**
4. Add the flag `--rate-limit=15000.0` to the `entryPoint` section of the `postman-insights-agent` container.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Click **Update** to refresh the service.

## Encrypted traffic

If your model is missing expected endpoints or is empty, you may be trying to observe your API at a point where it's encrypted. In Postman, navigate to the Insights Project's **Diagnostics** tab and review the client reports listed there. Check whether the Insights Agent detected any traffic encrypted with TLS.


# Uninstall the Postman Insights Agent

If you need to remove the Postman Insights Agent from your local machine and deployment, follow the [CLI](#cli) instructions and the directions listed for your deployment: [Kubernetes](#kubernetes), [AWS ECS](#aws-ecs), [AWS EC2](#aws-ec2), and [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](#aws-elastic-beanstalk). You can also contact [Support](#support).

## CLI

To uninstall the Insights Agent client on Debian and macOS, follow the steps listed below. For all other distributions of Linux and other operating systems, remove the `postman-insights-agent` file from your file's location.

To uninstall the Insights Agent client from Debian, run the following:

```bash
apt remove postman-insights-agent
```

To uninstall the Insights Agent client from macOS, run the following:

```bash
brew uninstall postman-insights-agent
```

## Kubernetes

The Insights Agent uninstall on Kubernetes depends on whether you installed the Agent as a DaemonSet or [sidecar](#sidecar).

### DaemonSet

To remove the Insights Agent from your Kubernetes DaemonSet deployment, do the following:

1. Either delete all the created resources manually, or run the following command to delete the manifest file you downloaded:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f postman-insights-agent-daemonset.yaml
   ```

2. Remove the environment variables added in the service configs.

### Sidecar

To remove the sidecar from your Kubernetes sidecar deployment, do the following:

# Postman Insights data access and storage

Postman Insights practices responsible data access and storage. This means that the Postman Insights Agent does not access or store more data than it needs to perform its function.

Uploads of the obfuscated data to Postman are performed over HTTPS using TLS.

To learn more about data access and storage, check out the following resources:

* [Data access and handling](/docs/insights/data/access/)
* [Repro Mode data redactions](/docs/insights/data/redactions/)
* [Repro Mode security considerations](/docs/insights/data/repro-mode-security/)
* [DaemonSet security considerations](/docs/insights/data/daemonset-security/)


# Data access and handling

Learn how and why Postman accesses, processes, transmits, and stores the data generated during tests.

## Access

The Postman Insights Agent monitors raw network traffic between services to automatically infer API endpoints. This data is only visible to the Postman Insights Agent and never leaves the host. No network traffic is shared; the Postman cloud only receives the results of the inspection.

The agent does not use the elevated privilege that would allow it to sniff traffic, to send, or to alter traffic.

## Processing

The Postman Insights Agent processes witnesses locally, on the host or test worker. The Postman Cloud then processes and analyze the witnesses producing API definitions and endpoint insights. Postman stores metadata about individual requests in a time-series database table.

## Transmission

All communication between the Postman Insights Agent and the Postman Cloud is done over HTTPS with TLS 1.2. Authentication and authorization are handled by a Postman API key. The owner of the API key must have edit access to the corresponding Insights workspace.

## Storage

All test witnesses and artifacts are stored in the Postman Cloud using on-disk encryption and are only accessed using secure methods and encryption whenever possible. Postman automatically deletes raw request and response data after 30 days. Data deletion or purging of sensitive information is available upon request. Contact the Postman Insights team at [observability-support@postman.com](mailto:observability-support@postman.com) to make a deletion request. The Postman Insights team provides a five-business-day SLA for all deletion requests.


# Repro mode data redactions

Postman Insights treats handling of user data seriously. This page describes the set of default fields and values that Postman Insights redacts, replacing with `*REDACTED*`, to help ensure compliance with security and privacy requirements.

* [Default keys](#default-keys) - Predefined, case-insensitive field names that are automatically redacted, such as `accessToken`, `auth-key`, and `x-api-key`. These fields are considered sensitive and are masked to ensure data security.

* [Default regular expressions](#default-regular-expressions) - Regular expressions applied by default to field values to identify and redact patterns matching sensitive information, such as tokens, private keys, and authentication details.

* [Optional regular expressions](#optional-regular-expressions) - Optional regular expressions applied to field values to identify and redact patterns matching other sensitive data, such as credit cards, emails, and phone numbers. You can edit these regular expressions to fit your needs.

Postman Insights also allows users to define additional redacted fields and values. See the [Settings](/docs/insights/reference/app/settings-tab/) tab for instructions.

## Default keys

Sensitive keys are not case sensitive. They include the following:

* `accessToken`
* `api-key`
* `api_key`

# Repro Mode security considerations

When Repro Mode is enabled, the Postman Insights Agent uploads the header and payload data from requests with errors. This information is stored in the Postman Cloud and shown to any user with the Viewer access to the Postman Insights project.

Authentication data and any known credential formats are redacted before transmission, as well as any fields that you redact in the project **Settings**. However, the payload data that contains other types of sensitive information, or an authentication header not recognized by the Postman scanner, may be sent to Postman and stored for up to 30 days.

## When Repro Mode is off

When Repro Mode is turned off, the Insights Agent client drops all data values from the observed traffic before sending it to Postman. This includes query parameters, headers in requests and responses, and values (but not identifiers) in JSON and YAML request and response values. All data-format inference happens on the client side, before the data is removed. The Postman cloud doesn't see the raw values.

## When Repro Mode is on

When Repro Mode is enabled via the `--repro-mode` flag, the Insights Agent additionally retains payload data for HTTP requests with a response code of 4xx or 5xx. The Insights Agent has a built-in list of [sensitive keywords](/docs/insights/data/redactions/) (such as x-api-key) that redacts, headers, query, parameters, and request/response body portions. Insights transforms the body into the string `*REDACTED*`.

The Insights Agent client drops all data values from the observed traffic before sending it to Postman. All data-format inference happens on the client side, before the data is removed. Shared values aren't sent to the Postman cloud. Uploads of the obfuscated data to Postman are performed over HTTPS using TLS.

For extra security, you can create a dedicated workspace for your Insights project and make it visible only to the users who are allowed to view the payloads. To learn more about internal workspaces, see [Create a workspace in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) and [Manage team resources in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/).


# DaemonSet security considerations

DaemonSet (multi-namespace) uses the Kubernetes API and the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/) to obtain information on the running pods and containers. This includes environment variables, which may contain authentication credentials or other secrets. If the Postman Insights Agent is compromised, these values can be exfiltrated.

The CRI also has no read-only mode. The permissions allow the Postman Insights Agent to start containers and evade the usual monitoring capabilities imposed at the Kubernetes layer.

The CRI defines the main [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) protocol for the communication between the [node components kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/#node-components) and [container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes).

While installing the agent, Postman creates a service account and assigns a cluster role to that service. The Insights Agent then belongs to this service account. This role only has the Kubernetes default view access.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  This represents the same access that Kubernetes monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic agents use.

To learn more about debugging endpoint errors with Repro Mode, see [Debug with Insights](/docs/insights/debug/). You can also learn more about how to [redact your own data for Repro Mode](/docs/insights/customize/#redact-your-own-data-for-repro-mode) and [show or hide your filtered endpoints](/docs/insights/customize/#show-or-hide-your-filtered-endpoints).

## Fields to redact

When rerunning requests in Repro Mode, Postman Insights automatically redacts a set of sensitive values, including authentication tokens. See the [full list](/docs/insights/data/redactions/).

You can do either of the following:

* Match a field name, and redact anything that's present in such a field.
* Match the data using a regular expression, and redact anything that matches that regular expression.

To learn more, see [Redact your own data for Repro Mode](/docs/insights/customize/#redact-your-own-data-for-repro-mode).

## Activate Repro Mode

To make it possible to make API calls using real user data, toggle on **Activate Repro Mode**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Only a Workspace Admin can enable **Repro Mode**.
</Info>

<img alt="Activate repro mode" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/insights-repro-v11.60.png" />

Read and confirm the message to proceed with Repro Mode activation.

## Show IP hosts and health checks

APIs carry health check endpoints, such as `/health`, `/healthz`, `/ping`, and similar endpoints used for pinging the health of a service and downtime detection only. You can decide to filter them out using the **Health Checks** toggle. This setting also hides or shows IP hosts to all users of the Insights project. To learn more, see [Show or hide your filtered endpoints](/docs/insights/customize/#show-or-hide-your-filtered-endpoints).

The toggle only controls whether to display IP hosts and health check endpoints and not whether to collect the requests. You can toggle it on and off for any project, regardless of its age.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Feature availability:** The **IP hosts & health checks** toggle isn't available on Postman desktop v11.54.3 or earlier. However, if you're on one of these versions, you can still view your endpoints and errors. Update your version to get this option.

# Frequently asked questions about Postman Insights

The following are some frequently asked questions you might have about Postman Insights.

## Why Insights if I already use New Relic and Sentry?

Just like Sentry makes it easier to debug certain errors even if you have New Relic, we're aiming to make it easier to debug API errors even if you have other tools installed.

## Will the Agent slow down my application?

The short answer is no. The Insights Agent is not a proxy and doesn't sit in the path of traffic. Instead, the agent passively watches traffic using the Berkeley Packet Filter (BFP). For more information, see Footprint of the Postman Insights Agent.

## How much memory does the agent use?

The Postman Insights Agent takes up about 500 MB of memory. The actual amount of memory depends on the volume of API calls the agent is watching. If you have concerns, please [email the Postman Insights team](mailto:observability-support@postman.com) to help you decide if you should increase your memory limits. Coming soon: memory limits on the agent.

## Are there risks of running the Agent to uptime for my production service?

For Kubernetes, to the best of our knowledge we're completely isolated, so we shouldn't affect your service’s performance or uptime.

For Elastic Beanstalk, the agent shares the same memory pool as the rest of the application, so there's a chance of running out of memory.

* Current mitigation: increasing memory.
* Coming soon: memory limits on the agent.

## What happens in Repro Mode to access tokens and other request values?

Insights scrubs a set of default fields. For more information, see [Repro mode data redactions](/docs/insights/data/redactions/).

If there are additional values you'd like to scrub, you may specify additional fields, values, and regular expressions to redact in **Settings**.

## What happens to the data when Repro Mode is off?

If Repro Mode is off, all payloads are obfuscated. For more information, see [Repro mode data redactions](/docs/insights/data/redactions/).

## How do I prevent everybody from viewing the Repro Mode payloads?

Create a dedicated workspace for your Insights project and make it visible only to the users who are allowed to view the payloads. To learn more about internal workspaces, see [Create a workspace in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/) and [Manage team resources in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/).


# Explore and Publish to the Postman API Network

The *Postman API Network* enables API publishers to share their public workspaces, collections, APIs, and Flows with their API's consumers. Publishers can help their API's consumers to discover and consume their APIs directly in Postman. The Postman API Network enables API consumers to discover new and popular public workspaces and elements to use in their own workspaces.

As an API consumer, you can get started by exploring and using public workspaces and elements on the Postman API Network. To learn more, see [Explore APIs on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/explore/overview/).

As an API publisher, you can get started by sharing your public workspaces to the Postman API Network. Learn about [best practices and tips for sharing public workspaces](#become-an-api-publisher-and-showcase-your-public-apis) to the Postman API Network.

<img alt="The Postman API Network interface" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-network-v11-18.jpg" />

## Benefits of the Postman API Network

The Postman API Network benefits both API consumers and publishers in the following ways:

* **Consumers** - The Postman API Network enables you to search for, discover, and identify public workspaces and elements you'd like to use in your organization. You can fork collections from a variety of publishers, and build on their APIs in your own workspace. The Postman API Network also gives you access to the latest API workflows directly from publishers.

* **Publishers** - The Postman API Network enables you to share your workspaces and elements with your API's consumers, and collect feedback from them through metrics and comments. Sharing APIs on the Public API Network increases your API's discovery in organic and Postman search results. Customize your public team profile to promote your workspaces and social media all in one place. You can improve your API's onboarding experience with detailed documentation, organized workspace resources, and more.

## Become an API publisher and showcase your public APIs

To succeed as an API publisher, focus on API consumer success. This starts with getting your API consumers to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. To learn more, see the following:

* **Prepare your public APIs** - Before you publish your API to the Postman API Network, spend time [preparing them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/overview/) by creating and [curating](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/) your publisher team, workspace, and collections.

* **Publish your public APIs** - Once you've prepared your public APIs for your API consumers, you're ready to [publish them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/) by making your workspace public and sharing and promoting your APIs on the Postman API Network.

* **Maintain your public APIs** - Once you've published your APIs to the Postman API Network, continue to [maintain them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/) and give your API consumers access to your API's latest features and documentation.

# Consume public APIs from the Postman API Network

Before you consume a public API, learn how to choose one from a verified team. A public API from a verified team offers you the best developer experience. You can then fork their elements to your own workspace and use them there. Remember to watch elements to get notified when there's a change.

## Choose public elements

Postman recommends you choose a public API from a verified team. You can identify a verified team by its verification badge  <img alt="Verified badge icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-verified-badge-v11.jpg#icon" width="18px" />. If Postman verifies a team, it means Postman confirmed the following:

* The team owns the API and its services.
* The team actively maintains its public workspaces, and documents its collections well.
* The team's public APIs offer [Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/), which offers you the best developer experience.

It's safe to choose a public API from a non-verified team. If you choose an API from such a team, Postman recommends you go to the company's official website and review their official documentation. Then, compare their official URLs to the URLs they use in their public workspaces.

If a team isn't verified, it may mean the team isn't active in Postman, their collections aren't well-documented, or their verification is pending.

To learn more about the verification process, see [Verify your team for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/).

## Use public elements

If you've not used Postman before or would like to get to your first 200 OK response quickly, use the **Start here** wizard in the request **Overview** tab. The wizard steps you through the requirements needed to send your request. The options vary depending on the API's auth type, variables, and request method.

![Send first public API request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-network-start-here-v11.48.png)

Start by adding your authorization. Whether you use [Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/) or another method to authenticate, Postman recommends you store your authentication credentials in [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/).

Next, add your variables, params, and headers. If the API has environment variables for the collection you're interested in, for example, variables for a development environment, you can select them from the environment selector in the top right of the request.

If you've selected a POST, POST, or PATCH request, the wizard also features a step to populate the content of the request body.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  All wizard options link to the relevant parts of the request, so you don't have to waste time looking for them.
</Info>

When you're ready, click **Send** to get a test response.

Once you've chosen a public API, Postman recommends you get started by [forking one of the team's collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/). Verified teams walk you through the process with great documentation. If you prefer, you can [create the request yourself](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/request-basics/).

Similarly, you can [copy a flow](/docs/postman-flows/build-flows/create/clone-flows/) or [create the flow yourself](/docs/postman-flows/get-started/overview/).

## Subscribe to receive updates through team channels

You can receive updates to public workspaces and collections through Slack. To receive updates in your Slack channel, click <img alt="Slack icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/brandLogo-slack.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Connect** in the workspace overview.

You can also interact with an update from a Slack message. To learn more, see [Respond to a workspace update](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/#respond-to-a-workspace-update).

## Watch public elements

You can watch public workspaces and collections to get notified about changes. To watch a workspace or collection, in the upper-right corner, select <img alt="View icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-view-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Watch**.

To learn more, see [Watch a workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#watch-a-workspace) or [Watch a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#watch-a-collection).


# Showcase your public APIs on the Postman API Network

Introduce your public APIs to over 40 million users from around the globe. To start your API publisher journey, you'll use Postman to collaborate and curate your publisher team, workspace, and collections for the Postman API Network.

![Publish to the Postman API Network](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-network-publish.svg)

Postman Collections are where API consumers start their API journey. A collection is a callable blueprint of your APIs that's designed to help you catalog, document, organize—and showcase—your requests. API consumers can fork your collections like a Git repository, and start using them in their own projects.

With Postman's [MCP Generator](https://www.postman.com/explore/mcp-generator), you can also [create an MCP server with your public APIs](/docs/postman-ai/mcp-servers/overview/), and use Postman to improve your server's developer experience.

## Prepare your public APIs

Before you publish your APIs to the Postman API Network, you'll prepare them by creating and curating your publisher team, workspaces, and collections in Postman. This creates a frictionless developer experience for your API consumers.

To learn more, see [Prepare your public APIs for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/overview/).

## Publish your public APIs

When you're ready to publish your APIs to the Postman API Network, you'll make your workspace public and give API consumers access to your public APIs. From then on, you'll focus on maintaining them to deliver your API's latest changes to your API consumers.

To learn more, see [Publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/overview/).

## Explore your publisher tools

As an API publisher, you can access your publisher tools from the [Postman API Network's landing page](https://www.postman.com/explore/). You can also create a public workspace and Run in Postman button from the same page.

To learn more, see [Explore your publisher tools on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/overview/).


# Prepare your public APIs for the Postman API Network

Get started on your API publisher journey by preparing and curating your publisher team, workspaces, and collections for the Postman API Network. When you're ready to [publish your APIs](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/overview/), you'll [make your workspace a public](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/#make-your-workspace-public), and give API consumers access to your public APIs.

## Prepare and verify your publisher team

Get your publisher team verified by Postman and earn a verification badge next to your team's name. A verification badge communicates trust to API consumers—and helps you stand out.

To learn more, see [Become a verified publisher on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/).

## Prepare your public workspace

Your public workspace is where API consumers find your public APIs, learn what they're capable of, and can fork your public collections to their workspace. To get started, create a workspace and invite team members to it.

To learn more, see [Prepare your public workspace for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/).

## Prepare your public collections

First, you'll create an API reference collection. Then, you'll create another collection that serves as a starting point for your API consumers. When you publish your public APIs, you can invite your API consumers to fork these collections.

To learn more, see [Prepare your public collections for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/).

## Curate your public collections

It's not enough to add requests to your collections. API consumers expect well-curated collections that introduce your public APIs to them, communicate their capabilities, and deliver a great developer experience.

To learn more, see [Curate your public collections for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/).

## Prepare your team workspace

It's good practice to draft your next release in a nonpublic space, where you can collaborate with, and get reviews from, your team. When your next iteration is ready for the public, you can merge a pull request to share your latest changes with your API consumers.

To learn more, see [Prepare your team workspace for team collaboration](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/).


# Become a verified publisher on the Postman API Network

Get verified to stand out and grow your public API's reach. When you're a verified publisher, you earn Postman's <img alt="Verified badge icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-verified-badge-v11.jpg#icon" width="18px" /> verification badge. You'll also get exclusive access to [Publisher Analytics](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/analyze-developer-engagement/), where you can analyze developer engagement.

# Prepare your public workspace for the Postman API Network

Your public workspace is a landing page for your public APIs. It's where API consumers find your public APIs, learn about them, and can [fork your public collections to their own workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/), where they can start using them.

Before you [make your workspace public](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/#make-your-workspace-public), you'll prepare it, [prepare your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/), [curate them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/), and [prepare your team workspace for team collaboration](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/).

## Create your public workspace

Depending on your team's workflow, you can create a private or team workspace (you'll make it public later). If you want to limit access to invited team members, create a private workspace. If you want to invite everyone from your team, create a team workspace.

You'll make your workspace public when you're ready to [publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/).

To create your public workspace, do the following:

1. From the Postman header, click **Workspaces** > **Create Workspace**.

# Prepare your public collections for the Postman API Network

Create a public *API reference collection* and *overview collection* for your API consumers. When you [publish your public APIs](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/), you can invite your API consumers to [fork your public collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/), and get them to their first 200 OK response fast.

An API reference collection contains your public API's endpoints and their HTTP methods. An overview collection compliments your API reference collection and serves as a starting point for your API consumers.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:**
  Protect your sensitive data. If Postman detects any API keys, tokens, or similar, it replaces them with placeholders. To learn more, see [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).
</Info>

## Create your public API reference collection

An API reference collection is a comprehensive list of your public API's endpoints and their HTTP methods, which define your API's operations. It's often based on an API specification, such an OpenAPI definition.

Postman recommends you [import your OpenAPI definition to create your API reference collection](#import-your-openapi-definition-to-create-your-api-reference-collection). If you don't have an OpenAPI definition, you can [manually create your API reference collection](#manually-create-your-api-reference-collection).

### Import your OpenAPI definition to create your API reference collection

To import your OpenAPI definition to create your API reference collection, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click **Import**.
2. Use one of the options to import your OpenAPI definition.
3. Click **Postman Collection**.
4. (Optional) Click <img alt="Setting icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-setting-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View Import Settings** and edit your settings.
5. Click **Import**.

Postman turns your OpenAPI definition into a Postman Collection. You can continue to edit your API reference collection as your public APIs evolve and you [curate your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/).

To learn more, see [Import an API into Postman](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/importing-an-api/).

### Manually create your API reference collection

If you don't have an OpenAPI definition, you can manually create your API reference collection.

To manually create your API reference collection, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click <img alt="Collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-collection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collections**.
2. Select <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new collection** > <img alt="New collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-newCollection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Blank collection**.
3. [Name your collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-overview/#name-your-collection) and [write a description for it](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-overview/#write-a-description-for-your-collection).
4. [Add requests to your collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-requests/#add-requests-to-your-collection) and [examples to your requests](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-requests/#add-examples-to-your-requests).
5. [Document your requests](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-requests/#document-your-requests).
6. [Organize your collection with folders](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-requests/#organize-your-collection-with-folders).

You can continue to edit your API reference collection as your public APIs evolve and you [curate your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/).

To learn more, see [Create a new collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/).

## Create your public overview collection

An overview collection compliments your API reference collection. It's a starting point for your API consumers. Use an overview collection to summarize your public APIs and get your API consumers to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. You can also showcase your public APIs with common use cases and popular workflows.

To create your public overview collection, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click <img alt="Collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-collection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collections**.

# Curate your public collections for the Postman API Network

Curate your public collections for the Postman API Network and get your API consumers to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. Introduce your public APIs, communicate their capabilities, and create a great developer experience.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:**
  Protect your sensitive data. If Postman detects any API keys, tokens, or similar, it replaces them with placeholders. To learn more, see [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).
</Info>

## Curate your public collection's overview

Introduce your APIs with a name that communicates their purpose. Then, write a description that gets your API consumers started and to their first 200 OK response.

To learn more, see [Curate your public collection's overview for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-overview/).

## Curate your public collection's requests

Communicate your public API's capabilities with your requests. Add examples and documentation to each request to show how each request works. Then, organize your collection with folders to further streamline your collection.

To learn more, see [Curate your public collection's requests for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-requests/).

## Curate your public collection's developer experience

Curate your API's developer experience with Postman. Set up authentication and authorization to reduce friction. Create variables and environments to make your collections dynamic. Write scripts to automate tasks and write tests to catch errors.

To learn more, see [Curate your public collection's developer experience for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-developer-experience/).


# Curate your public collection's overview for the Postman API Network

You can curate your collection's overview to introduce your public APIs to your API consumers. A well-curated collection invites your API consumers to [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) and use your APIs—and gets them to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible.

## Name your collection

Open your collection's **Overview** tab, click the collection's name, and rename your collection.

To learn more, see [Configure a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#configure-a-collection).

Name your collection something that communicates its purpose. For example, if you're renaming your [API reference collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-api-reference-collection), choose a name that communicates it's the API reference for the public APIs in your workspace. If you're renaming your [overview collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-overview-collection), choose a name that communicates it's the starting point for the public APIs in your workspace.

Use the following guidance to choose a name:

* **Use keywords that speak to your target audience.** Choose words and phrases that your API consumers may search for, such as those that relate to what your API does, specific use cases, and common industry terms. For example, instead of "Data API", name your collection "Financial Market Data API" or "Get started with the Financial Market Data API".

* **Choose a descriptive yet concise name.** Convey what your API does in the fewest words possible. Use action-oriented language and avoid vague terms. For example, instead of "User API", name your collection "Create customer accounts API".

* **Be consistent across your workspace and collections.** Consistency improves your API consumer's ability to scan and navigate your workspace and collections. For example, if you name a collection "Financial Market Data API", name a similar collection "Financial Market News API" (and not "APIs for finance news").

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Tip:** Use 🤩 emojis to make your collection name stand out.
</Info>

## Write a description for your collection

Open your collection's **Overview** tab, click the collection's description, and write a new description.

To learn more, see [Configure a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/create-collections/#configure-a-collection).

Write a description that gets your API consumers to their first API request and 200 OK response in the fewest steps possible. Use the following guidance to write a description:

* **Introduce your APIs and the services they offer.** Give your API consumers an overview of your APIs. You can add screenshots, videos, and links. List your APIs, highlight their value, explain what each does, and define any key concepts your API consumers need to understand. Help your users navigate your collection with a table of contents that links to folders and requests within your collection.

* **Get your API consumers started.** Focus on the steps each API consumer must complete to get their first 200 OK response, and document these steps for them. For example, if they must sign up for an account, give them a link to where they can sign up. If you host "Get started" documentation elsewhere, link to it.

* **Explain authentication and authorization.** Often, authentication and authorization introduce the most friction between your API consumers and your APIs. Outline the steps someone must complete to make their first successful API call.

* **Link to further documentation, such as tutorials.** If you have integration guides and tutorials, link to them to let your users know what to do once they get their first 200 OK response.

* **Link to help and the community.** Add links to your support channels, forums, and community resources. This ensures your API consumers know where to go when something goes wrong.


# Curate your public collection's requests for the Postman API Network

You can curate your collection's requests to communicate your public API's capabilities to your API consumers. A well-curated collection invites your API consumers to [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) and use your APIs—and gets them to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Your API consumers will be able to get to their first 200 OK using the **Start here** wizard in the request **Overview** tab. The content for this wizard is autogenerated. To get it customized, go to the [Postman Support Center](https://www.postman.com/support/) and click **Submit a request**. To learn about the consumer side of this onboarding experience, see [Use public elements](/docs/postman-api-network/explore/consume/#use-public-elements).
</Info>

## Add requests to your collection

Next to your collection, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**. Then, select **Add request**.

To learn more, see [Add API requests to Postman Collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/add-requests-to-collections/).

Add the requests that matter the most to your API consumers. For example, if you're adding requests to your [API reference collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-api-reference-collection), add all your public API's endpoints and their HTTP methods. If you're adding requests to your [overview collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-overview-collection), add requests to help your API consumers get started and understand your public API's capabilities.

Use the following guidance to add requests:

* **Add one request per operation or use case.** Don't overwhelm your API consumers with multiple requests for the same operation. [Add examples](#add-examples-to-your-requests), instead.

* **Showcase use cases and workflows.** To showcase specific use cases and workflows, add such requests to your overview collection. Such requests show your API consumers how to use your public API in the real world.

## Add examples to your requests

Open a request and click **Send**. Then, in the response pane, click <img alt="Example icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-example-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Save Example**.

To learn more, see [Create examples of request responses to illustrate API use cases](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/examples/).

Add examples that show your API consumers how your API works. For example, if you can create a variety of marketing campaigns with a single operation, add one request. Then, add examples to that request to show how to create such marketing campaigns.

## Document your requests

Click the collection's **Overview** tab and click **View complete documentation**. To rename a request, click its name and rename it. To write a new description, click the request's description and write a new description. Make sure the description isn't overly long, to ensure the request onboarding wizard can be seen by your API consumers. Repeat for each request.

To learn more, see [Document your APIs in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/).

For consistency, use the same guidance for [naming your collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-overview/#name-your-collection) and [writing a description for it](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-overview/#write-a-description-for-your-collection).

## Organize your collection with folders

Next to your collection, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**. Then, select **Add folder**. To add subfolders, next to each folder, you can do the same by clicking <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** > **Add folder**.

To learn more, see [Add folders to a collection](/docs/collections/use-collections/manage-collections/#add-folders-to-a-collection).

Organize your collection to streamline it, make it more scannable, and help your API consumers navigate your API requests. If you're organizing your [overview collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-overview-collection), use the following guidance to organize your collection:

* **Mirror your onboarding steps.** Go back to your collection description and the steps you outlined there and mirror those steps with your folders and subfolders. For example, if you use multiple API requests to set up an account, put those in a folder called "Set up an account".

* **Cover the basics, such as authentication and authorization.** Ensure you cover the basics, such as authentication and authorization and any API request that gets your API consumers to their first 200 OK response.

* **Showcase important use cases and workflows.** Create folders to group your API requests by use case and workflow. For example, if you want to showcase your e-Commerce APIs, create "Add to cart" and "Check out" folders.

* **Consider adding a support folder.** Create a folder that's dedicated to addressing common issues. Such a folder could include examples of typical errors and how to resolve them.

* **Research what your users need.** Before you finish preparing your collection, review your support channels, forums, and community resources. Identify your API consumers' most common challenges and address them directly in your collection.


# Curate your public collection's developer experience for the Postman API Network

You can curate your public collection's developer experience for your API consumers by setting up authentication and authorization, variables and environments, and scripts and tests.

A collection with a great developer experience invites your API consumers to [fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) and use your APIs. It also gets them to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:**
  Protect your sensitive data. If Postman detects any API keys, tokens, or similar, it replaces them with placeholders. To learn more, see [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).
</Info>

## Set up authentication and authorization for your collection

Postman recommends you set up Guided Auth with OAuth 2.0 for your domain. Once you set it up, and an API consumer uses an endpoint on your domain, Postman prompts them to authenticate through Guided Auth. This is the fastest way to authenticate and creates the best developer experience.

If necessary, Postman supports a variety of authorization types, which you can also set up.

To learn more, see [API authentication and authorization in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization/).

### Set up Guided Auth for your domain

From the Postman header, select **Team > Team Settings** and then **[Guided Auth](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/api-authentication)**. Enter a name for your API, its base URL, and select OAuth 2.0. You must verify your domain and enter your API's authentication and authorization details.

You can also select one of the other authorization types.

To learn more, see [Set up Guided Auth for public APIs in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/setting-up-authentication-for-public-apis/).

### Set up auth for your collection

If you're not ready to set up Guided Auth, you can set up authorization for your collection. All requests in the collection inherit the authorization details you set up.

Open your collection's **Authorization** tab and select an **Auth Type**. Enter your API's authorization details. When your API consumers fork your collection, they'll complete the remainder of the details.

To learn more, see [Add API authorization details to requests in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/specifying-authorization-details/).

## Create variables and environments for your collection

You can create variables in your workspace to improve the developer experience. For example, you can create a variable for an API consumer's API key and use the variable throughout your requests. An API consumer can later update the variable's value with their API key in one place.

You can set up variables for different scopes, such as your collection or an environment.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Note:**
  API consumers can't fork your global variables. Don't use them in your public workspace. Use collection and environment variables instead.
</Info>

To learn more, see [Reuse data with variables and environments in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/).

### Create collection variables

To create a collection variable, open your collection's **Variables** tab. Then, click **Add new variable**.

To learn more, see [Store and reuse values using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/).

### Create environments and environment variables

An environment is a set of variables specific to a context. For example, you can create two environments, one for your sandbox environment and one for production. Then, you can create variables where you expect the value to be different for each environment, such as an API key. When your API consumer switches environments, the value switches for them.

To create an environment, from the Postman sidebar, click <img alt="Environment icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-environment-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Environments**. Then, click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create new environment**. To create an environment variable, click **Add new variable**.

To learn more, see [Group sets of variables in Postman using environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/).

### Pin your environments to your collection

If an API consumer forks your collection and you've pinned environments to it, by default, the API consumer also forks your pinned environment.

To pin environments to your collection, open your collection. From the Postman workbench, click the environment selector. Then, hover over the environment and click <img alt="Pin icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pin-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Pin to collection**. Repeat for each collection and environment combination.

You can set one pinned environment as the [default pinned environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/pinned-environments/#set-a-default-pinned-environment) for your collection. When an API consumer forks a collection that has a default pinned environment, Postman automatically makes it the active environment in their forked collection.

To learn more, see [Pin environments to collections](/docs/sending-requests/variables/pinned-environments/).

## Write scripts and tests for your collection

You can use pre-request and post-response scripts to enhance your API consumer's developer experience. You can write scripts to automate tasks, transform data, add conditional logic, and give your API consumers immediate feedback, such as how to address errors.

For example, you can write a script that formats dates to the API's expected format, or validates whether a response's key-value pair is present. If your API uses access tokens, you can write a script that takes the token from a response and uses it in later requests.

To learn more, see [Test APIs and write scripts in Postman](/docs/tests-and-scripts/tests-and-scripts/).

### Write pre-request and post-response scripts

Open a request, folder, or collection and select the **Scripts** tab. Then, click **Pre-request** or **Post-response** and write your script.

To learn more, see [Use scripts to add logic and tests to Postman requests](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/).


# Prepare your internal workspace for team collaboration

You can use an internal workspace to draft and organize your work, and [collaborate with your team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/). To prepare your internal workspace, you'll fork [your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/) from [your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/) to your internal workspace.

When your public API's next iteration is ready to publish, you can [create a pull request](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/#create-a-pull-request-to-merge-to-your-public-collection) and [merge your changes](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/#review-approve-and-merge-the-pull-request-to-your-public-collection) to [your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/). This makes your latest changes available to your API consumers on the Postman API Network.

If you prefer to use one workspace to manage your public APIs, you can skip the following sections and [publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/).

## Create your internal workspace

Depending on your team's workflow, you can create a workspace that's visible only to you and specific people or your entire team.

To create your private or team workspace, do the following:

1. From the Postman header, click **Workspaces** > **Create Workspace**.
2. If you want to use a [workspace template](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace), select one.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Name your workspace.
5. Click <img alt="Team icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-team-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Internal**. Then, click **Everyone in *team*** or **Only you and invited people**.
6. Click **Create**.

To learn more, see [Edit workspace details](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#edit-workspace-details).

## Fork your public collections from your public workspace

To fork your public collections from your public workspace, do the following:

1. Open your public workspace.
2. From the Postman sidebar, click <img alt="Collection icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-collection-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Collections**.
3. Next to your collection, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions**. Then, select **Create a fork**.
4. Select your team workspace. Then, click **Fork Collection**.
5. Repeat these steps for each of your public collections.

Your team workspace is ready to serve as your public API's source of truth.

To learn more, see [Create a fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork).


# Publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network

Publish your APIs to the Postman API Network and make them publicly available to any API consumer around the world. Maintain them and give your API consumers access to your API's latest changes.

## Publish your public APIs

Once you've prepared your public APIs for your API consumers, you're ready to make your workspace public and share your APIs on the Postman API Network.

To learn more, see [Publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/).

## Add a Run in Postman to your developer content

Once you've published your public APIs, add a Run in Postman button to your developer website, API reference, documentation, and each of your public collection's overview pages. Successful API publishers use the Run in Postman to grow adoption and curate the developer experience for their API consumers.

To learn more, see [Streamline the developer onboarding experience with the Run in Postman button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/).

## Showcase your public APIs

Showcase your public APIs with interactive articles. With Postman Notebooks, you combine your documentation, code, and APIs in one place, where you guide your API consumers to their first 200 OK response.

To learn more, see [Showcase your public APIs with Postman Notebooks](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/overview/).

## Maintain your public APIs

Once you've published your APIs to the Postman API Network, continue to maintain them and give your API consumers access to your API's latest features and documentation.

To learn more, see [Maintain your public APIs for the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/).

## Create a public API collaboration strategy

The most successful publishers on the Postman API Network focus on:

* Making APIs discoverable
* Eliminating onboarding friction for developers
* Building community engagement that creates lasting relationships with developers
* Improving APIs based on real usage data

For guidance on building your collaboration strategy, see [Public API collaboration best practices](https://www.postman.com/postman-best-practices/public-api-collaboration/).


# Publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network

Once you've [prepared your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/), [prepared your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/), [curated them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/), and [prepared your team workspace for team collaboration](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/), you're ready to publish your public APIs.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  **Important:**
  Protect your sensitive data. If Postman detects any API keys, tokens, or similar, it replaces them with placeholders. To learn more, see [Postman Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/overview/).
</Info>

## Evaluate the developer experience

Before you make your workspace public, and begin to share and promote your public APIs, walk yourself through the steps you outlined in your [overview collection](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/#create-your-public-overview-collection). Invite others on your team to do the same.

If you haven't already, [create a team workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/#create-your-internal-workspace) and [fork your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/team-workspace/#fork-your-public-collections-from-your-public-workspace). Even if you decide to use one workspace to manage your public APIs, the exercise will walk you through your API consumer's steps.

Gather feedback and iterate to [curate your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/). Continue to iterate until you're satisfied you can get your new users to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible.

## Pin your collections to your workspace overview

To pin your collection to your workspace overview, do the following:

1. From the Postman sidebar, click your workspace's name.
2. Click <img alt="Pin icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-pin-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Pin Collections** or <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" />, and pin your collection.
3. Choose an environment for your collection.

When an API consumer selects your pinned collection, Postman opens it and sets the environment for them.

To learn more, see [Pin collections to workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/use-workspaces/#pin-collections-to-workspaces).

## Make your workspace public

To make your workspace public, do the following:

1. Open your public workspace.
2. If your workspace's <img alt="Overview icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/descriptive-overview-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Overview** tab isn't open, from the Postman sidebar, click your workspace's name. Then, click **Settings**.
3. Under **Workspace type**, click **Change**.
4. Click <img alt="Published icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-published-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Public**.

# Streamline the developer onboarding experience with the Run in Postman button

Once you've [prepared your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/), [curated them](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/overview/), and [published your public APIs](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/), create a *Run in Postman* button. Then, add it to your developer website, API reference, documentation, and each of your public collection's overview pages.

The Run in Postman button makes your public APIs more discoverable. With one click, an API consumer can start their API journey with your public APIs and get to their first 200 OK response.

Successful API publishers use the Run in Postman button to grow adoption and curate the developer experience for their API consumers.

If you'd like to learn more about becoming a great API publisher, see [Showcase your public APIs on the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/overview/).

![Run in Postman button](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/run-in-postman.svg)

## Create a Run in Postman button

When someone clicks your Run in Postman button, they're prompted to [fork your public collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/). You can also include an [environment](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/) with your collection to help users get to their first 200 OK response in the fewest steps as possible. Postman also makes them a [watcher](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#watch-a-collection) of your collection, which means they'll get notified when you update your collection.

To learn more, see [Create a Run in Postman button for your API consumers](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/).

## Customize your Run in Postman button

Further customize the developer experience for your API consumers with custom code.

To learn more, see [Customize your Run in Postman button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/customize-run-button/).


# Create a Run in Postman button for your API consumers

Create a **Run in Postman** button to enable users to instantly fork your Postman collections into their workspaces. You can embed the button in your website or a README to enable developers to interact with your API.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  The **Run in Postman** button is only available for collections containing HTTP requests.
</Warning>

Active **Run in Postman** buttons are automatically updated with any changes in the original collection. This provides your consumers with the most recent version of your collection, without publishers having to manually update the collection's link. For example, you can click the following **Run in Postman** button to fork the most recent version of the Postman API collection:

<center>
  [<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Run in Postman" role="img" />](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a?action=collection%2Ffork\&source=rip_markdown\&collection-url=entityId%3D12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D405e0480-49cf-463b-8052-6c0d05a8e8f3)
</center>

To create a **Run in Postman** button, your collection must be in a public workspace. If it isn't, you'll need to [change the workspace visibility to public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#convert-an-existing-workspace-to-a-public-workspace) or [move the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/manage-workspaces/#move-elements-to-workspaces) to a public workspace.

<Note title="Note">
  You can also create a **Run in Postman** button from API specification formats like OpenAPI and RAML. First, convert the file to a collection by [importing it into Postman](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/), or by generating a collection from your API in [the API Builder](/docs/design-apis/api-builder/develop-apis/adding-api-elements/#generate-a-new-collection-from-your-api-definition) or [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/generate-collections/).
</Note>

## Create a Run in Postman button

To create a **Run in Postman** button, do the following:

1. Access the [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/). If you're on a paid plan, you can click **API Network** in the Postman header, then select <img alt="Published icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/state-published-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" role="img" /> **Postman API Network**.

2. Click <img alt="Add icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-add-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Create New** in the left menu, then select <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run in Postman button**.

3. Search for and select a public collection you want to share. To replace the collection, click **Choose a different collection**.

4. (Optional) Select an environment.

5. Click **Next**.

6. Choose an embed code format that's HTML or Markdown friendly:

   * **HTML friendly** --- This embed code uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so you can customize the button for a website. You can [customize](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/customize-run-button/) the embed code to dynamically create and update environments and add environment variables to a user's workspace.

   * **Markdown friendly** --- This embed code uses Markdown, so you can display it in a README, blog, or other Markdown document.

7. Click <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-copy-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Copy Code**.

8. Embed the code where you'd like to display the button, such as your organization's public API documentation.

<Tip title="Tip">
  You can click **Collections** in the sidebar of a public workspace, then select <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions > Share** next to the collection. Then, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> and select **Run in Postman**.
</Tip>

## Use a Run in Postman button

Click the **Run in Postman** button to open the page where you can fork the collection to your workspace. [Forking the collection](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) into your workspace lets you contribute to the source collection using pull requests.

You can also view the collection in a public workspace and import a copy of the collection using the provided links. All collections shared with **Run in Postman** buttons come with [fork counts](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#view-fork-information) that help you and your consumers understand how developers use the API.

Published **Run in Postman** buttons are automatically updated with changes in the original collection. This enables your consumers to always get the most recent version of your collection, without publishers having to manually update the collection's link.


# Customize your Run in Postman button

As an API publisher, you can dynamically inject information as environment variables into the [**Run in Postman** button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/). You can customize and embed this button in your website's client-side code so users can begin making calls to your API using Postman's `_pm()` method. The **Run in Postman** button enables users who click it to [fork](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/#use-a-run-in-postman-button) your collection and environment into their Postman workspace.

## Create a new environment

Create a new, empty environment using the `env.create` method:

```javascript
_pm('env.create', 'environment_name', {key: value}, runButtonIndex);
```

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  You can't use this method to duplicate environments. Any calls made using existing environment names will fail.
</Warning>

Create a new environment using API keys entered by your user:

```javascript
function () {
  var stagingKey = document.getElementById('staging-key-input').value,
    productionKey = document.getElementById('production-key-input').value,
    runButtonIndex = 0,
    envData = {
      stagingKey: stagingKey,
      productionKey: productionKey
    };

  _pm('env.create', 'API Keys', envData, runButtonIndex);
}
```

The `env.create` method returns the total number of environments associated with **Run in Postman** buttons on the page on success and `false` on failure.

<Note title="Note">
  This creates an environment, but doesn't set it as the active environment.
</Note>

## Pass a user's sign-in credentials

Create an environment that contains the user's sign-in credentials:

```javascript
_pm('env.create', 'Spotify', {
  user_id: 'spotifyuser',
  authorization: 'Bearer 1234xyzd'
});
```

## Edit an existing environment

Update an environment using the `env.assign` method:

```javascript
_pm('env.assign', 'environment_name', {key: new_value, new_key: value}, preventOveride, runButtonIndex);
```

This method works for environments included in the **Run in Postman** button on creation, or environments added using the `env.create` method.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  You can't use this method to create new environments. Any calls made using the `env.assign` method fail if the environment doesn't already exist.
</Warning>

Update an environment's API keys:

```javascript
function () {
  var stagingKey = document.getElementById('staging-key-input').value,
    productionKey = document.getElementById('production-key-input').value,
    preventOveride = true,
    runButtonIndex = 0,
    envData = {
      stagingKey: stagingKey,
      productionKey: productionKey
    };

  _pm('env.assign', 'API Keys', envData, preventOveride, runButtonIndex);
}
```

The `env.assign` method returns `true` on success and `false` on failure.

## Replace an existing environment

Replace the entire contents of an environment using the `env.replace` method:

```javascript
_pm('env.replace', 'environment_name', {key: value}, runButtonIndex);
```

The `env.replace` method returns `true` on success and `false` on failure.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  You can't use this method to replace an environment which doesn't exist.
</Warning>

## Remove an existing environment

Remove an existing environment using the `env.remove` method:

```javascript
_pm('env.remove', 'environment_name', runButtonIndex);
```

The `env.remove` method returns `true` on success or `false` on failure.

<Warning title="Important" class="important-callout">
  The environment must exist or this method will fail.
</Warning>

## Use multiple buttons with separate environments

You can embed multiple buttons on a single page. To include a different environment for each **Run in Postman** button, enable the `segregateEnvironments` property:

```javascript
_pm('_property.set', 'segregateEnvironments', true);
```

If you enable `segregateEnvironments`, you must use `runButtonIndex` in all `_pm()` methods to reference each button according to its position in your page [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model):

```javascript
var runButtons = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.getElementsByClassName('postman-run-button')),
  runButtonIndex = runButtons.indexOf(elem);
```

<Note title="Note">
  Because `segregateEnvironments` is deactivated by default, `runButtonIndex` is optional by default.
</Note>

### Use the index for jQuery

Use the following to return a jQuery object containing an index of all elements matching the `postman-run-button` query:

```javascript
var runButtonIndex = $('postman-run-button').index(elem);
```

The response contains the index location for all elements that match.

## Get all environments

Use the `get()` method to retrieve all environments:

```javascript
_pm('_property.get', 'environments');
```

This returns a response containing an array of the available environments:

```json
[
  {
    "button_index": 0,
    "name": "env1",
    "values": [
      {
        "key": "testKey",
        "value": "testValue",
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

   </Warning>

4. Name your input block.

5. (Optional) Define a default value.

## Reference your input block

You can reference your input block by name. For example, if you name your input block "email", you can reference it in text, another input block, or a [request block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-request-blocks/) with the syntax `{{email}}`. Or you can reference it in a [script runner block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-code-runner-blocks/) with the syntax `$email`.

To reference your input block, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. Get your input block's name.
3. Reference your input block:

   * To reference your input block in text, another input block, or a request block, use the syntax `{{inputBlockName}}`.
   * To reference your input block in a script runner block, use the syntax `$inputBlockName`.


# Add request blocks to your notebook

You can add API requests and reference their responses elsewhere in your notebook to create an interactive experience. For example, you can [add an input block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-input-blocks/) for your API consumer's email address and use a request block to send them a welcome message.

## Add a request block

To add a request block, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. Place your cursor where you want to add the request block. Then, type a forward slash ("/"). Postman displays a block menu.
3. Choose <img alt="Request icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-request-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Request Block**.
4. Search for your public request or paste its URL or UUID. Then, select it. Postman displays the request, any variables you or your API consumers may need to define, a way for you or your API consumer to define the request body, and a button to send the request.
5. Name your request block.
6. If necessary, define the variables. These may include query and path parameter values, or other values defined in the request.
7. (Optional) Define an override. This overrides the request's body.
8. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Send**.

Postman sends the request and returns the response.

If the request changes, you can refresh the request block. To refresh it, next to the endpoint, click <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-refresh-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Refresh**. To start over, click <img alt="Clear icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-clear-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Clear**.

## Reference your request block

You can reference your request block by name. For example, if you name your request block "getUser", you can reference its response in another request block with the syntax `{{getUser}}`. Or you can reference it in a [script runner block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-code-runner-blocks/) with the syntax `$getUser`.

Furthermore, you can use dot notation to reference data within a response. For example, in another request block, you can reference the user's first email with the syntax `{{getUser.emails.0}}`. Or in a [script runner block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-code-runner-blocks/), you can reference the same value with the syntax `$getUser.emails[0]`.

To reference your request block, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. Get your request block's name.
3. Reference your request block:

   * To reference your request block in an input or another request block, use the syntax `{{requestBlockName}}` or `{{requestBlockName.path.to.data}}`.
   * To reference your request block in a script runner block, use the syntax `$requestBlockName` or `$requestBlockName.path.to.data`.

## Send requests in sequence

If you can use the data from one response in the request of another, you can send those requests in sequence. For example, you can get a user's email from a response and use it to send a different request.

To send requests in sequence, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. In the first request block, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Send**.
3. In the second request block, reference the first request block with the syntax `{{requestBlockName.path.to.data}}`. Then, click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Send**.

Postman uses the first request's response to send the second request. You can add more requests to the sequence.


# Add script runner blocks to your notebook

You can write JavaScript code and reference its output elsewhere in your notebook to create an interactive experience. For example, you can add a script runner block that generates a random number and use that number in a [request block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-request-blocks/) that accepts one. You can also [import external libraries](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/packages/external-package-registries/) and [visualize your data](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-reference/pm-visualizer/).

## Add a script runner block

To add a script runner block, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. Place your cursor where you want to add the script runner block. Then, type a forward slash ("/"). Postman displays a block menu.
3. Choose <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Script Runner**.
4. Name your script runner block.
5. Write your code.
6. Click <img alt="Run icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-run-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Run**.

Postman runs the code and returns the result. To see the logs, open the **Logs** tab.

## Reference your script runner block

You can reference your script runner block by name. For example, if you name your script runner block "randomNumber", you can reference its output in a [request block](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/notebooks/draft/add-request-blocks/) with the syntax `{{randomNumber}}`. Or you can reference it in another script runner block with the syntax `$randomNumber`.

To reference your script runner block, do the following:

1. Open your notebook or [create a new one](https://www.postman.com/notebook/new).
2. Get your script runner block's name.
3. Reference your script runner block:

   * To reference your script runner block in an input or request block, use the syntax `{{scriptRunnerName}}`.
   * To reference your script runner block in another script runner block, use the syntax `$scriptRunnerName`.

# Analyze developer engagement across your public APIs

Publisher analytics give you a full view into how developers engage with your public collections, forked collections, workspace updates, and your publisher profile, from discovery to adoption. You can view user activity over the last 6-month period by weeks or months. It’s your hub for insights into API visibility, usability, and engagement.

To access these metrics, navigate to the [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/) and, in the left sidebar, click **Analytics** in the **Publish** section.

## Key metrics and insights

Analytics provides the following metrics and insights.

### Users

This section tracks how many developers interact with your content and how deeply they engage. The user breakdown is especially useful for identifying onboarding effectiveness and potential friction points.

* **Active users** - Anyone who viewed, forked, or made API calls during the selected time period. This is your broadest indicator of reach.
* **API users** - Active users who sent at least one request to your API with a Postman Collection. These users have progressed beyond interest to actual usage.
* **New API users** - Users calling your API for the first time. Tracking this metric helps you measure growth and new adoption.
* **Successful users** - Users who received at least one 2XX response. These users likely onboarded successfully and are able to use your API.
* **Error-only users** - Users who made API calls but never received a successful response. High numbers can signal usability problems, often with auth setup or documentation.

### Companies

Verified publishers will see a breakdown of API Calls and API Callers by company, as derived from the email domain of the API users. This can be useful to understand usage trends in specific industries or among individual customers, and provides insight into the reach of publisher content on the Postman API Network.

This data is only available to verified publishers. [Get verified](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/).

### Views

Views reflect how often developers discover and engage with your content. This is a key indicator of visibility. Consistently high or growing view counts suggest strong discoverability and interest, while drops may highlight areas that need promotion or updates. Views include public collections in your public workspaces as well as forked collections in users' internal workspaces. You can click the different data sources on a graph to turn them on or off to get different views of the data. For example, in the views by content type graph, you can click **Collections** to hide the line representing views by collections, then click it again to show it.

To increase views, consider the following:

* [Getting verified](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/verify-publisher-team/) improves visibility in search and explore.
* [Publishing updates](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/internal-workspaces/workspace-updates/) when collections change keeps your users alert and informed.
* [Promoting your content](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) across docs, portals, and social media incites engagement from developers and other potential users.

### Forks

Forks are a strong signal that developers are ready to test and build with your API. By forking, your users save a copy of one of your collections to their own workspace so they can explore it, while simultaneously keeping up with the original collection updates.

Forks originate from the following places:

* **Public workspaces** - When developers discover and fork a collection directly from your public facing workspace.
* **Run in Postman button** - When users click a button embedded in your docs or website that instantly forks a collection into their workspace.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  [Adding Run in Postman buttons](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/) can significantly boost forks and accelerate onboarding by letting developers get started wherever they discover your API.
</Info>

### API calls

API calls show how often developers are using your API through Postman.

You’ll see the total call volume, which collections are driving the most traffic, and where requests are coming from, including forks, your public workspace, notebooks, or autocomplete suggestions.

This metric can help you understand what content leads to the most meaningful API interaction.

### API errors

This section surfaces issues that may block successful onboarding or API usage.

You’ll view error rate trends over time and a list of collections with the most client-side (4XX) errors. High error rates, especially from new users, may indicate gaps in documentation or auth configuration.

To reduce friction, you can do the following:

* Add a collection focused on [authentication or setup](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/curate/public-collections-developer-experience/).
* Use [environment variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) to streamline configuration.
* Enable [Guided Auth](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authentication-for-public-apis/) to simplify user input.

## Turn insights into action

Publisher analytics isn’t just about tracking, but about growth as well. Use this report to accomplish the following:

* Demonstrate the impact of your presence on the Postman API Network.
* Understand what’s working.
* Uncover where users are getting stuck.

These endpoints enable you to create temporary workspaces to test, which you can then delete when you're finished. You can also save a backup of another workspace or specific resources (such as collections or APIs) using the Postman API.

### Collections

Use the [Collections APIs](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/b7pojjp/collections) to manage your [Postman Collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) and simplify collection-related workflows. You can use these endpoints to add, delete, or update your collections. You can also use these endpoints to:

* Update an entire collection or a collection's requests, folders, and responses.
* Transfer collection items between collections or folders.
* Manage your collection forks, pull requests, and [published documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/).
* Manage [collection access keys](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/#collection-access-keys).

You can also use these endpoints to import an OpenAPI definition to create a collection or transform an existing collection into an OpenAPI definition. This lets you automatically generate a collection from your source code or API definition so you can then automatically sync it with Postman. Any resources that depend on that collection, such as monitors or mock servers, will also see the updated requests and responses.

### Environments and variables

The [Environments API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/t1fblas/environments) enable you to programmatically manage your [Postman environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/). You can use this API to manage your [global variables](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/pfngjbr/global-variables), which scope your work to different environments (such as local development, testing, or production). You can also manage [collection variables](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/augwzgq/update-part-of-a-collection), which are available throughout a collection's requests.

### APIs

You can use these endpoints to integrate your onboarding process and automatically provision users and groups.

### API security and governance

The [API Security API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/31xluzv/api-security) enables you to manage your API's security by running security checks and tracking your API definition's governance and security rule violations. For example, you can use the [API definition security validation endpoint](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/1kl63um/api-definition-security-validation) to validate an OpenAPI definition. You can also use it to publish a new version of your API.

### Audit logs

Use the [Audit Logs API](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/tl4rymv/audit-logs) to monitor and analyze your Postman Enterprise teams. [Admins](/docs/administration/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can review audit logs, filter by specific criteria, and get information about:

* When users were added to, removed from, or invited to your team.
* Which user performed a specific action—and when they did so.

## Deprecated endpoints

Deprecated Postman API endpoints reside in the [DEPRECATED](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/folder/0a4bnwe/deprecated) folder of the Postman API collection. In the [Postman API OpenAPI definition](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/api/72a32ca3-f06a-4e83-a933-2821a0e6616f/definition/d429098b-1789-4c62-b77b-cf02024aba53?view=documentation), they're marked by the `deprecated: true` property or, in some cases, removed from the definition.

Deprecated endpoints are unsupported and don't receive any updates. At a future time they will be removed and no longer be available. **It's recommended that you don't use deprecated endpoints.**

### About v9 API Builder endpoints

The format for the API Builder endpoints in Postman changed in Postman v10. The Postman API only supports endpoints for working with APIs created in v10 and later. The endpoints for working with APIs created in v9 are **deprecated**.


# Generate and use Postman API keys

The Postman API and [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) use API keys for authentication. A Postman API key tells the server that the request came from you. You can use API keys to manage and access various resources and elements you create in Postman, which enables you to integrate Postman into your development toolchain.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Enterprise Admins can manage Postman API keys at scale with the Postman API key management dashboard. To learn more, see [Managing API keys](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/).
</Info>

## Generate a Postman API key

To generate a Postman API key, do the following:

1. Click your avatar in the Postman header, then click **Settings**. In the [account settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/account/) page, click [**API keys**](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).

2. If you don't have a key, you'll be prompted to create one. Click **Generate API Key**.

   <img alt="Generate API Key" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/no-api-keys-generate-v10.jpg" />

3. Enter a name for your key and click **Generate API Key**.

4. Copy your key.

   <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/copy-your-api-key-v10.jpg" alt="Copy your API key" />

Once you generate your API keys you can manage them in your workspace. Click <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px" /> more actions next to a key to regenerate, rename, or delete it.

![View your API keys](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-keys-regenerate-rename-delete-v10-2.jpg)

Use **API key settings** to specify expiration periods for your keys.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/postman-api-key-settings-v10.jpg" alt="API key settings" />

### Use your Postman API key

After you have a Postman API key, you must authenticate your requests to the Postman API by sending your API key in the `X-API-Key` header of every request you make. Your API key provides access to any Postman data you have permissions for.

You can also store your API key as a `postman-api-key` [variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/). By doing this the [Postman API collection](https://api.postman.com/) will automatically use your API key for each call to the Postman API.

## Generate a collection access key

With a collection access key you can securely grant other users read-only access to a single collection. You will generate a new collection access key every time you share a collection using the Postman API. To learn more, see [Share using the Postman API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#share-using-the-postman-api).

Your [API keys page](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) displays all of your generated keys in the **Collection access keys** section. This section includes information about which collection the key belongs to, who created the key, and when it was created. This section also displays any collection access keys created by other members of the team that you are logged in to.

To revoke a collection access key, hover over it and click **Delete**.

# Track Postman API call limits

Postman's API access rate limits are applied at a per-user basis in unit time.

Access to the API using a key is limited to 300 requests per minute. Every API response includes headers to identify the status of your consumption. The response headers vary, depending on the API called:

| Header                                                     | Description                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RateLimit: limit=300, remaining=###, reset=##`            | The current rate limit, the number of calls remaining, and the time until the current rate limit resets, in seconds. |
| `RateLimit-Policy: 300;w=60`                               | The current rate limit policy and rate limit reset window (`w`), in seconds.                                         |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Limit`                     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute.                                    |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Remaining`             | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.                                                   |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `RateLimit-Reset`                     | The time until the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch seconds.                                           |
| `X-RateLimit-RetryAfter`, `RetryAfter`                     | If the current rate limit is exceeded, the time left until you can resume making requests, in seconds.               |
| `RateLimit-Limit-Month`, `X-RateLimit-Limit-Month`         | The total number of requests permitted per month, based on the [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).             |
| `RateLimit-Remaining-Month`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Month` | The number of requests remaining in the current month.                                                               |

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free Postman API calls per month. You can check your usage limits with the [Postman API](https://api.postman.com/) or the [resource usage page](https://go.postman.co/billing/add-ons/overview).

To learn more about the resources included with your Postman plan and what happens when you reach your usage limits, see [About resource usage](/docs/billing/resource-usage/#postman-api-usage).


# Access Postman data programmatically

The Postman API enables you to programmatically access data stored in your Postman account. You can use the API to perform actions such as managing your collections, APIs, workspaces, and more.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The access rate limits for your Postman account depend on your Postman plan. For more information, see [Postman API rate limits](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).
</Info>

This tutorial shows you how to make your first call to the Postman API. You can also learn more about the Postman API by reading the [Postman API documentation](https://api.postman.com/). There you will find information to help you get started and information about each endpoint and operation.

## Get your API key

Before you can use the Postman API, you'll need an API key. An API key is a way to identify who you are when you make a request to the Postman API endpoints. It also lets the system know what you can do with the Postman API. For more details, see [Generate and use Postman API keys](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).

## Store your API key

After you create your API key, store it in your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) as a vault secret. You can then reuse it in your local instance of Postman. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and they aren't synced to the Postman cloud.

If you want to share sensitive data with collaborators, you can store it in an environment and set the [environment variable](/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) as sensitive data. Make sure you follow these security best practices:

* Store your API key as a [variable set as sensitive data](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#set-a-value-as-sensitive-data).
* Store your API key as a [local value](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-variables) so you don't share it with other team members.

  ![Set the API key as an environment secret](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-environment-key-v11-56-3.jpg)

## Make your first request

For your first request, you'll use the `/me` endpoint. This is a basic GET endpoint that doesn't change any data. It returns information about the user that owns the API key that's being used to authenticate the call.

### Fork the Postman API collection

Before you call the `/me` endpoint, fork the [Postman API collection](https://api.postman.com/). [Forking](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) creates a copy of the collection that you can change but doesn't affect the parent element.

To fork the collection, click **Run in Postman**:

<center>
  [<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg" alt="Fork the Postman API collection" />](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a?action=collection%2Ffork\&source=rip_markdown\&collection-url=entityId%3D12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D405e0480-49cf-463b-8052-6c0d05a8e8f3)
</center>

Follow the prompts. Enter a label for your forked Postman API collection in the **Fork label** box. Then in the **Workspace** box, select the workspace in which to create the forked collection.

Click **Fork Collection** to create the fork. Postman redirects you to the workspace you selected to create the forked Postman API collection.

### Make the API call

1. In the forked Postman API collection, select the **Users** folder. This folder contains the **Get authenticated user** (`/me`) endpoint.

   <img alt="The Postman API collection's folders" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-collection-folders-v11.27.jpg" width="285" />

2. Select the **Get authenticated user** request, then click **Send**. Postman returns an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` response. This is because the endpoint requires authorization before it returns information about the API key's owner.

   ![The Invalid API Key authentication error](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-401-error-v11.27.jpg)

3. Use the API key that you stored in your Postman environment. To do this, select the environment where you stored your API key.

   <img alt="Select the Postman environment" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-environment-select-v11.27.jpg" width="280px" />

4. Click **Send**. The Postman API returns a successful response.

   ![A successful Get authenticated user endpoint response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-success-response-v11.27.jpg)

Congratulations! You have made your first call to the Postman API.


# Use AI agents with the Postman API

The [Postman Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/collection/681dc649440b35935978b8b7) enables AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code to help you manage your Postman resources, including [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/), [collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/), [specifications](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/), [mocks](/docs/design-apis/mock-apis/overview/), and [monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/). The server translates your natural language commands into API workflows behind the scenes. With [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), you can build AI agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs using the tools and context provided by the servers.

Communication between the Postman API and the AI agent happens through the following methods:

* [*Remote Server*](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/set-up-postman-mcp-server/#remote-server) - Securely links the agent to the server over streamable HTTPS at `https://mcp.postman.com/mcp` and `https://mcp.eu.postman.com` for EU, without requiring any extra agent setup. Great for using the Postman MCP server with your preferred IDE or AI agent. It supports two tool configurations to better serve different use cases:
  * *Minimal* - Only includes essential tools for basic Postman operations, available at `https://mcp.postman.com/minimal`. This offers faster performance and simplifies use for those who only need basic Postman operations.
  * *Code* - Includes tools to generate client code from public and internal API definitions, available at `https://mcp.postman.com/code`. This configuration is ideal for users who need to consume APIs or get context about APIs to their agents.
  * *Full* - Includes all available Postman API tools (100+ tools), available at `https://mcp.postman.com/mcp`.
* [*Local Server*](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/set-up-postman-mcp-server/#local-server) - Runs the MCP server locally on the agent machine with STDIO. Requires downloading and running the source code yourself or spinning up a local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image.

For a complete list of the Postman MCP Server's tools, see the [Postman MCP Server collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/collection/681dc649440b35935978b8b7). This collection offers both the remote [full](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/mcp-request/6821a76b17ccb90a86df48d3) and [minimal](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/mcp-request/689e1c635be722a98b723238) servers, and the [local server](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/mcp-request/6866a655b36c67cc435b5033).

## Use cases

* **Code synchronization** - Effortlessly keep your code in sync with your [collections](/docs/collections/collections-overview/) and specifications.
* **Collection management** - Create and [tag](/docs/collections/use-collections/collaborate-with-collections/#tag-a-collection) collections, update collection and request [documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/), add [comments](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/comments/), or perform actions across multiple collections without leaving your editor.
* **Workspace and environment management** - Create [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/) and [environments](/docs/sending-requests/variables/managing-environments/), plus manage your environment variables.
* **Automatic spec creation** - Create [specifications](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/) from your code and use them to generate Postman collections.

## Get started with agents

Follow the [Postman MCP server setup guide](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/set-up-postman-mcp-server/) to get up and running. Then, explore [best practices and tips](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/postman-mcp-server-tips/) for getting the most out of its features.


# Set up the Postman MCP Server

The Postman MCP Server supports both [remote servers](#remote-server) through streamable HTTP and [local servers](#local-server) with STDIO. The remote server is available at `https://mcp.postman.com/` and `https://mcp.eu.postman.com` for the EU, and the local server is available in the [Postman MCP Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server). You can also fork the [Postman MCP collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/collection/681dc649440b35935978b8b7) from the Postman Public Workspace.

Postman also offers servers as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@postman/postman-mcp-server) and as a [Docker image](#install-in-docker).

# Tips and best practices for using the Postman MCP server

With the Postman MCP server, you empower AI agents (such as Cursor, Claude, or VS Code) to manage your Postman resources. You can request complex workflows and API interactions, and let the AI take care of the heavy lifting. This document covers some useful tips for working with agents and prompts you can use to get started with the Postman MCP server.

## Tips and best practices

AI agents can make mistakes, so when using agents with the Postman MCP server, follow these best practices:

* **Specify the MCP server to interact with Postman resources.** Some LLM models try to interact with Postman using curl or the Postman CLI. To prevent this, it’s good practice beginning your prompts with a clear “When interacting with Postman resources, use the Postman MCP server you have access to” statement.
* **Always review and confirm operations.** When performing operations that make changes or are destructive, such as updating or deleting resources, always validate responses before you accept them from the agent.
* **Pass resource IDs to reduce API calls.** For example, to operate with a specific workspace, get the workspace’s ID and be clear when you state it. Otherwise, the LLM has to fetch all the workspaces, then select the specific one you want to work with, which can result in multiple API requests.

## Postman API server prompts

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The following examples use VS Code's [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
</Info>

The following provide examples of useful prompts you can use to work with and manage your Postman elements:

### Managing environments

In this use case, the user wants to update an environment variable’s value.

**Prompt**: Change the value of my Postman environment variable "baseUrl" in the "Local" environment to use `http://localhost:8001`.

**Response**: After passing the prompt, the agent returns the following response, confirming the variable change:

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-mcp-server-tips-1.jpg" alt="The agent's response confirming the environment variable is updated" />

### Create an OpenAPI and sync the spec with Postman

In this example, the user is working on a back end Django REST Framework API and wants to keep it in sync with Postman.

**Prompt**: This repository contains a Django REST Framework API. We’ve implemented a CRUD API for a resource called "Customer". We already have a Postman workspace called "Customers". I want you to:

* Infer an OpenAPI definition for my API (Customers CRUD), based on the model fields.
* Retrieve my workspace "Customers" ID. Use the Postman MCP server tools.
* Create a Postman Spec in the existing “Customers” workspace.
* Create the collection from the spec.

**Response**: The agent confirms that it created the API specification and its related collection:

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-mcp-server-tips-2.jpg" alt="The agent's response confirming the spec and collection were created" />

### Update a collection’s documentation

In this example, the user updated their Postman Collection and wants to update its documentation to match the changes they've made.

**Prompt**: Update my collection "Customer API Collection" information to: "CRUD operations on the customers table. These endpoints require authentication and permissions on the Customer table."

**Response**: Here, the agent used the PATCH `/collection/{collectionId}` endpoint. It was able to fetch all the collections, then get the specific collection by name:

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-mcp-server-tips-3.jpg" alt="The agent confirms that it's updated the collection documentation" />

### Perform a back end change based on Postman Spec changes

This example assumes the user is working with a Django REST Framework app. They're also an employee of an API design-first company, and want to make the changes in Postman's [Spec Hub](/docs/design-apis/specifications/overview/). The back end developers will then use the specification to implement the changes.

**Prompt**: I’ve updated the Postman Spec called "Customer API" and I’ve added some new fields to the Customer resources. Analyze the changes in the spec (retrieve it from Postman using the Postman MCP server you have access to) and reflect them in the Django code (model and serializer).

**Response**: The agent performs several requests to get the workspace, then the list of specifications, and gets the specific spec. After analyzing the spec and model, the agent makes the proper changes in the code:

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-api-mcp-server-tips-4.jpg" alt="The agent confirms that it's made the adjustments and requests the user's confirmation" />


# Test requests in Postman using the Echo API

You can use the Postman Echo service to test requests in Postman. The Echo service returns a JSON response that includes all details from the request you sent, including any data items you included.

Many Postman learning resources, including the Postman docs, use the Echo service. This is because it provides a quick way to send a request without worrying about authentication or request configuration. If you want to learn how to do something in Postman without connecting to a "real" API, you can use the Echo service.

## Using the Echo API

The Echo API includes endpoints to test different request methods, parameters, authentication, and a variety of supporting utilities.

To test the Echo API in a REST request, do the following:

1. Open a new request in Postman and enter `https://postman-echo.com/get` in the URL box.
2. Select the **GET** method, then click **Send**.

The Echo API will return a JSON object that has details from the request.

![Postman Echo response](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v11/postman-echo-api-response-v11.jpg)

## Echo for other protocols

You can also use the Postman echo service with protocols other than REST:

* GraphQL - `graphql.postman-echo.com/graphql`
* gRPC - `grpc.postman-echo.com`
* WebSocket - `wss://ws.postman-echo.com/raw`
* SocketIO - `wss://ws.postman-echo.com/socketio`
* MCP - `https://postman-echo-mcp.fly.dev/`

## Next steps

To continue working with the Echo service:

* View the full documentation for the Echo service at [https://postman-echo.com/](https://postman-echo.com/) to learn more about advanced Echo service features.
* You can fork the [Echo collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/published-postman-templates/documentation/ae2ja6x/postman-echo?ctx=documentation) to use pre-built requests to the API. You can also edit the requests in the forked collection to suit your needs.


# Create and manage collections using the Collection SDK

The Collection SDK is a Node.js module that enables you to work with Postman [Collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) and build them dynamically into your API project pipeline.

With the Collection SDK, you can create and manipulate, and export collections. You can then run them with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) and the [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) command-line collection runner.

## Accessing the Collection SDK

The Collection SDK is an open-source project. [Visit the repo](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection) for more detail on using the module in your own projects. The [SDK documentation](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/) provides an overview of the available objects and methods within the SDK, and an intro to the related [concepts](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/tutorial-concepts.html).

You can install the SDK from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-collection) or directly from the repo. The following excerpt demonstrates using the SDK to read a file and parse it into a collection object in JavaScript:

```js
var fs = require('fs'),
  Collection = require('postman-collection').Collection,
  myCollection;

myCollection = new Collection(JSON.parse
  (fs.readFileSync('sample-collection.json').toString()));

console.log(myCollection.toJSON());
```

The Collection SDK provides an interface for working with the data structures defined by the [Postman Collection Schema](https://schema.postman.com/). You can use the SDK methods to create and manipulate collection elements, define request detail, variables, and authentication.

Get started with the Collection SDK from the [project repo](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection), installing it and using the methods to build collections in a way that suits your development or testing project. You can also fork and contribute to the project, or create issues for any problems or feature requests.

## Next steps

If you're working with the Collection SDK to automate part of your collection run workflow, you can integrate your Collection SDK development with the Postman CLI or with Newman.

* To learn more about integrating your Collection SDK development with the Postman CLI, visit [Explore Postman's command-line companion](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).
* To learn more about running collections with Newman, visit [Run and test collections from the command line using Newman CLI](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).


# Configure request and collection runs using the Postman Runtime library

The Postman Runtime library is an [open-source Node.js project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-runtime/) you can use for low-level configuration over request sending in your API development and testing projects. It supports request sending and [collection running](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) in Postman and other interfaces including the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).

## Accessing the Postman Runtime library

To get started with the Runtime library, check out the repo's [README](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-runtime).

You can install the library from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-runtime). The following example code shows a simplified outline of using the Runtime library in conjunction with the [Collection SDK](/docs/developer/collection-sdk/):

```js
runtime = require('postman-runtime');
var runner = new runtime.Runner();

// Collection object constructed using the Collection SDK
var collection = new sdk.Collection();

runner.run(collection, {
  data: [],
  timeout: {
    request: 30000,
    script: 5000
  },
  iterationCount: 1,

  //other options...

},
function (err, run) {
  // Callbacks to run as the collection runs
  run.start(callbacks);
});
```

You can use the Runtime library if you need a detailed configuration of your request runs. For example, it can be used as part of an automation workflow to integrate Postman Collection runs into your development pipeline.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Note that if you only need to run collections, you can use [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/), Postman's command-line tool.
</Info>

## Next steps

After you've gotten started with the Runtime library, you might also want to use the Postman API in your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow:

* To learn more about incorporating Postman into your CI/CD workflow, visit [CI with Postman API](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/continuous-integration/).

## Store variables

You can store and reuse variables in the VS Code extension. Each collection, environment, and global variable has an [initial value and a current value](#variable-values) you can define for different uses. You can [set a global or environment variable as secret type](#set-a-variable-as-secret-type), masking the initial and current values. You can also learn more about [sharing variable values with your team](#share-variable-values).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  The steps for defining and sharing variable values are different in the Postman app. Learn about [variable values in the Postman app](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#variable-values).
</Info>

### Variable values

Define the current value for a variable to use it locally with your requests. You can define the initial value for a variable to share it with your team and use it with Postman features that run on the cloud. Make sure you understand the differences between current and initial values before adding your own data.

* **Initial value** - The initial value is synced to the Postman cloud and shared with your team. The initial value is also used when sending requests from scheduled collection runs, monitors, the Postman CLI, and Newman. Learn more about [sharing variable values](#share-variable-values) in the VS Code extension.

* **Current value** - The current value is only available locally in your instance of Postman and used to send requests. It isn't synced to the Postman cloud. Current values enable you to develop and test using private credentials or experimental values, without risk of exposing sensitive data to others on your team. Learn how to [define a current value for your variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables/#defining-variables).

### Set a variable as secret type

You can set the variable type for global and environment variables as default type or secret type. When you create a variable, its type is automatically set to default type. You can set the variable to secret type to mask the initial and current values.

* **Default type** - Default type is automatically assigned to variables. This type displays as plain text and doesn't have extra properties.

* **Secret type** - Secret type masks the initial and current values. This helps you avoid unintentionally sharing sensitive tokens, for example, during screen sharing or live streaming.

To set a variable to secret type, click the **Type** dropdown list next to a global or environment variable, and select **secret**. To change the variable back to default type, click the **Type** dropdown list, and select **default**.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  Postman recommends that you use your [Postman Vault](/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) to store sensitive data, such as API keys, as encrypted vault secrets. Only you can access and use values associated with your vault secrets, and they aren't synced to the Postman cloud.
</Info>

### Share variable values

Provide an initial value for a variable to sync its value with the Postman cloud and share it with your team. Even if you've shared an initial value, you can continue to update your current value without affecting the initial value.

You can choose to sync your current value with the Postman cloud. Enter a new initial value or you can persist your current value, sharing it with your team. To persist the current value to the initial value, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a variable and select **Persist**. This updates the variable's initial value based on your current value.

You can also reset your current value, returning it to the value shared in the initial value. Click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** next to a variable and select **Reset**.

To persist or reset all variables, click <img alt="Options icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/action-options-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **View more actions** at the top of the column, then select **Persist all** or **Reset all**.

## Troubleshoot with the Postman Console

You can use the Postman Console to [troubleshoot your requests](/docs/sending-requests/response-data/troubleshooting-api-requests/). You can also use the Console to debug [pre-request scripts](/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) and [tests scripts](/docs/developer/vs-code-extension/tests-and-scripts/test/), logging output to the Console.

# Use AI agents with the Postman API from the Postman VS Code extension

With the Postman VS Code extension, you can integrate the [Postman Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/collection/681dc649440b35935978b8b7) with your AI agent in VS Code. This enables you to manage your Postman resources, like [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/overview/) and [collections](/docs/collections/use-collections/use-collections-overview/), with your agent using the Postman API. This integration uses the [streamable HTTP Postman MCP server](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/set-up-postman-mcp-server/#remote-server) with the minimal tool configuration mode, which includes tools for basic Postman operations.

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also [manually integrate the Postman MCP server with VS Code](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/set-up-postman-mcp-server/#manual-installation).
</Info>

## Create the Postman MCP server integration

To get started, integrate the Postman MCP server with your AI agent in VS Code. An API key is generated to authenticate with Postman, giving your AI agent permission to manage your Postman resources with the Postman API. Learn about [using AI agents in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

To integrate the Postman MCP server with VS Code, do the following:

1. Click <img alt="MCP icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-mcp-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add / Update Postman MCP**.
2. Click **Add MCP** in the in-app notification.

An API key is generated for your user account. If the API key isn't generated for you, learn how to [manually generate an API key](#manually-generate-an-api-key).

Learn about [tips and best practices](/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-mcp-server/postman-mcp-server-tips/) for using the Postman MCP server.

### Manually generate an API key

If the API key isn’t generated when you set up the Postman MCP server, you can create one instead.

1. Click <img alt="MCP icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-mcp-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add / Update Postman MCP**.

2. Click **Add MCP** in the in-app notification.

3. Choose one of the following in the in-app notification:

   * Click **Generate API Key** to open Postman and [create a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key).
   * Click **I already have a key** if you already have a Postman API key you'd like to use.

4. Enter your Postman API key then press **Return** or **Enter**.

## Update your Postman API key

Update the Postman API key you're using to authenticate with Postman. Make sure to delete Postman API keys you're no longer using.

To update your Postman API key, do the following:

1. Create a new [Postman API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).
2. Click <img alt="MCP icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/entity-mcp-stroke.svg#icon" width="16px" /> **Add / Update Postman MCP**.
3. Click **Update API Key** in the in-app notification.
4. Enter your new Postman API key then press **Return** or **Enter**.

## Use language model tools

The Postman VS Code extension provides language model tools that make the AI agent context-aware about the extension's state and enable the AI agent to interact with the extension.

To view the available tools, open the **Chat** view and select the **Configure Tools** button. You can specify the tool to use with your prompt or let the AI agent infer the tool you need for your task. For example, you can ask it to add some requests to your current workspace using the **getCurrentWorkspace** tool. To learn more, see [Use tools in your prompts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-tools#_use-tools-in-your-prompts).

# Generate client code for your API collections

You can generate client code for your API collections in Postman. Postman's Node.js code generator module converts a request into client code for your target language in conjunction with the [Collection SDK](/docs/developer/collection-sdk/).

The code generator takes a Collection SDK [request object](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/Request.html) and turns it into code to make the same request in a client app using the specified language and framework.

You can install the code generator library from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-code-generators) or by cloning it from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators). To get started, check out the code generator module [README](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators/blob/develop/README.md#getting-started).

<Info class="iconless-callout">
  You can also generate client code for a request or collection [in Postman](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/generate-code-snippets/).
</Info>

## Generate code programmatically

The following simplified code excerpt demonstrates using `convert` to build a client code snippet from a `Request` object with the Collection SDK, targeting Node.js:

```js
var codegen = require('postman-code-generators'),
  sdk = require('postman-collection'),
  request = new sdk.Request('https://www.google.com'),
  language = 'nodejs',
  variant = 'request',
  options = {
    indentCount: 3,
    indentType: 'Space',
    trimRequestBody: true,
    followRedirect: true
  };
codegen.convert(language, variant, request, options,
  function(error, snippet) {
    if (error) {
      //  handle error
    }
    //  handle snippet..
});
```

You can use the `getOptions` method to find config options for your target language:

```js
var codegen = require('postman-code-generators'),
  language = 'nodejs',
  variant = 'Request';

codegen.getOptions(language, variant, function (error, options) {
  if (error) {
    // handle error
  }
  console.log(options);
});
```

The `getLanguageList` method returns available languages your request client code can target:

```js
var codegen = require('postman-code-generators'),
  supportedCodegens = codegen.getLanguageList();
  console.log(supportedCodegens);
```

## Supported languages

The code generator module is an open-source project. If there is a language or framework you'd like to generate client code for, but it isn't provided, you can add it by [contributing to the project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). This lets other users access your contribution both in the repo and in Postman itself.

## Next steps

If you're using Postman to work with client applications, you can also capture request data. Learn more about [capturing request data](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/).


# Convert API formats into Postman Collections

The API convertors enable you to convert API definitions in OpenAPI, Swagger, RAML, GraphQL, or WSDL schema formats into the [Postman Collection Format](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/getting-started/overview/). Each convertor is available as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) module that you can automate in your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Access the API convertors

The API convertors are open-source projects that can be used as Node.js modules in your application. They're available through npm or by cloning them directly from the GitHub repository.

To learn how to install and use each API convertor, see the GitHub repository for the format you need to convert from:

* [OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1, and Swagger 2.0 to Postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/openapi-to-postman)
* [RAML 1.0 to Postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/raml1-to-postman)
* [GraphQL to Postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/graphql-to-postman)
* [WSDL to Postman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/wsdl-to-postman)

## Next steps

After learning how to automate your API definition conversions in your CI/CD pipeline, you can do the following:

* [Import your collections into Postman](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/#import-postman-data).
* Use the Postman API to run your collections in your CI/CD pipeline with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-run-collection/#run-a-collection-in-cicd) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/continuous-integration/).
