# Prepare your internal workspace for team collaboration

You can use an internal workspace to draft and organize your work, and [collaborate with your team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaborate-in-postman-overview/). To prepare your internal workspace, you'll fork [your public collections](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-collections/) from [your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/) to your internal workspace.

When your public API's next iteration is ready to publish, you can [create a pull request](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/#create-a-pull-request-to-merge-to-your-public-collection) and [merge your changes](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/maintain-public-apis/#review-approve-and-merge-the-pull-request-to-your-public-collection) to [your public workspace](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/prepare/public-workspace/). This makes your latest changes available to your API consumers on the Postman API Network.

If you prefer to use one workspace to manage your public APIs, you can skip the following sections and [publish your public APIs to the Postman API Network](/docs/postman-api-network/showcase/publish/public-apis/).

## Create your internal workspace

2. If you want to use a [workspace template](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/create-workspaces/#apply-a-template-to-a-workspace), select one.
