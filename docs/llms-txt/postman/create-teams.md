Create a team in Postman
========================

On a Postman free plan, teams of up to three can work together at no cost. To collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, see [Plans and Pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

Create a team in Postman to collaborate with others in your organization. You can create a team [during Postman onboarding](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-up-for-postman/) or create new teams after onboarding. You can choose to keep workspaces in your Postman account separate from the teams you join. You can be a member of up to ten Postman teams, regardless of the [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

If an Enterprise team within your organization implements [domain capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/), you won't be able to remain on or join extra Postman teams with your captured accounts.

## Create new teams

To create new teams, do the following:

1. Click ![Image 1: Down Large icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/aether-icons/direction-down-large.svg#icon) next to **Team** (if you're on a paid plan) or **Upgrade** (if you're on a free plan), then click **Create team** or **Create Free team**, respectively.
2. Provide a team name and, optionally, specify the type of work your team will be working on.
3. Click **Continue**.
4. (Optional) Invite collaborators to your team by email or by adding people from a contacts file.
5. Click **Create Team**.

You can edit your URL and logo, and decide if you want to turn on team discovery in [Team Settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/).

On Postman's [free plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), teams of up to three can work together at no cost. If you want to collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, you can [upgrade](/docs/billing/billing/#changing-your-plan) to a paid plan. To do so, click **Upgrade** in the upper-right corner.

If you have an account and create a Postman team through the flow mentioned above, you can choose to transfer your workspaces and the associated data to the team or keep them separate. Your workspaces and data may transfer to your team automatically in some situations. See [Join a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#join-a-team) for details.

When you leave a team, your workspaces within the team and their data will remain with the team and no longer be available to you in some situations. See [Leave a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/use-teams/#leave-a-team) for details.
