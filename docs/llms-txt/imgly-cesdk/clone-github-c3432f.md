## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

### Development Environment

- **Node.js**: 18.0 or later
- **React Native**: 0.73 or later
- **Expo CLI**: Latest version
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with React Native extensions
- **Git CLI** for version control

### Platform Requirements

- **iOS**: 16.0+ (Xcode 26.0.1+, Swift 6.2+)
- **Android**: 7.0+ (API level 24+)

### License

- A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)), pass `null` to run in evaluation mode with watermark.

### Verify Your Setup

Run the following command to verify your React Native installation:

```bash
npx react-native --version
```

This command checks your React Native installation and reports any issues to resolve before proceeding.

> **Note:** Always use native code when customizing the CreativeEditor SDK for React Native (Swift/Kotlin), and refer to the [configuration overview section](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/user-interface/customization-72b2f8/).

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

First, navigate to your preferred working directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your preferred directory
cd ~/Downloads  # or any directory of your choice
```

Clone the official IMG.LY React Native examples repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgly/cesdk-react-native-examples.git
cd cesdk-react-native-examples
```

### Repository Structure

The cloned repository contains:

```
cesdk-react-native-examples/
├── showcases/           # Main React Native app with multiple examples
├── shared/             # Shared configuration files
├── scripts/            # Build and deployment scripts
├── fastlane/           # CI/CD configuration
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── package.json        # React Native dependencies
└── app.json            # Expo configuration
```

## Step 2: Configure Your License Key

The examples require a valid CreativeEditor SDK license key to function.

### 2.1 Locate the Secrets File

Navigate to the main React Native app directory:

```bash
cd showcases
```

The license configuration is in `src/secrets/secrets.ts`:

```typescript title="secrets.ts"
export class Secrets {
  // Enter your license here.
  static license = String.fromEnvironment("SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE", defaultValue: "");
}
```

### 2.2 Set Your License Key

You have two options for setting your license key:

**Option A: Direct in secrets file (for testing)**
Since this is a cloned repository for testing, you can add your license key directly:

```typescript title="secrets.ts"
export class Secrets {
  // Enter your license here.
  static license = String.fromEnvironment("SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE", defaultValue: "your_actual_license_key_here");
}
```

**Option B: Environment variable (recommended)**
Pass the license key as an environment variable when running:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE=your_actual_license_key_here npx expo start
```

> **Security Note**: For production projects, always use environment variables or secure key management systems. Direct key placement is only recommended for testing and learning purposes.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the React Native dependencies:

<Install />

This downloads and installs all required packages, including the CreativeEditor SDK.

## Step 4: Configure Platform-Specific Settings

The repository includes pre-configured platform settings, but you may need to verify them:

### 4.1 Android Configuration

The Android configuration is already set up with:

- Minimum SDK: 24
- Kotlin version: 1.9.10
- IMG.LY Maven repository
- Required permissions

Verify the configuration by running:

```bash

gradle clean
cd ..
```

### 4.2 iOS Configuration

The iOS configuration is already set up with:

- Deployment target: 16.0
- Framework linkage: dynamic (useFrameworks)
- Required permissions (camera, microphone)
- Swift support

Install iOS dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Step 5: Run the Examples

Now you can run the React Native examples on your device:

### 5.1 List Available Devices

```bash
npx expo start
```

This command shows available devices and simulators.

### 5.2 Run on Android Device

```bash
# Run with license key
EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE=your_actual_license_key_here npx expo start --android

# Or run on specific device
EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE=your_actual_license_key_here npx expo start --android -d your_device_id
```

### 5.3 Run on iOS Device

```bash
# Run with license key
EXPO_PUBLIC_SHOWCASES_LICENSE_REACT_NATIVE=your_actual_license_key_here npx expo start --ios
