Learn how to get the recorded videos from the `CameraReactionResult` and `CameraRecordingResult` type of the `openCamera` function.

## Success

A `Recording` has a `duration` and contains an array of `Video`s. The array contains either one `Video` (for single camera recordings or a video that was reacted to) or two `Video`s (for dual camera recordings.)

Each `Video` has:

- A `uri` to the video file that is stored in a temporary location. Make sure to copy the file to a permanent location if you want to access it later.
- A `rect` that contains the position of each video as it was shown in the camera preview. For dual camera recordings, you can use these `CGRect`s to arrange the videos as they were laid out in the camera.

### Standard and Dual Camera

If the user has recorded videos, the `openCamera` will return a `CameraRecordingResult` which will contain an array of `Recording`s, each representing a segment of the recorded video.

```typescript
result.recordings.forEach(recording => {
  console.log(recording.duration);
  recording.videos.forEach(video => {
    console.log(video.uri);
    console.log(video.rect);
  });
});
```

### Video Reaction

If the user has recorded a reaction, the `openCamera` will return a `CameraReactionResult` which will contain the video that was reacted to and an array of `Recording`s, each representing a segment of the recorded video.

```typescript
console.log(result.video.duration);
result.video.videos.forEach(video => {
  console.log(video.uri);
  console.log(video.rect);
});

result.recordings.forEach(recording => {
  console.log(recording.duration);
  recording.videos.forEach(video => {
    console.log(video.uri);
    console.log(video.rect);
  });
});
```

## Cancellation

If the user has cancelled the camera session the `openCamera` function will return `null`.

```typescript
if (result === null) {
  console.log('The editor has been cancelled.');
  return;
}
```

## Failure

The `openCamera` function will throw if the user has not allowed accessing their camera and/or microphone or any other parsing/argument error occurred.

```typescript
console.log(`Error occurred in the camera session: ${error}.`);
```

## Full Code

Here's the full code for both files:

### recordings\_camera\_solution.ts

```typescript
import IMGLYCamera, { CameraSettings } from '@imgly/camera-react-native';

export const recordings_camera_solution = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const settings: CameraSettings = {
    license: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
  };

  try {
    const result = await IMGLYCamera.openCamera(settings);
    if (result === null) {
      console.log('The editor has been cancelled.');
      return;
    }
    result.recordings.forEach(recording => {
      console.log(recording.duration);
      recording.videos.forEach(video => {
        console.log(video.uri);
        console.log(video.rect);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Error occurred in the camera session: ${error}.`);
  }
};
```

### recordings\_reaction\_camera\_solution.ts

```typescript
import IMGLYCamera, { CameraSettings } from '@imgly/camera-react-native';

export const recordings_reaction_camera_solution = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const settings: CameraSettings = {
    license: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
  };

  try {
    const result = await IMGLYCamera.openCamera(
      settings,
      require('MY_VIDEO_SOURCE'),
    );
    if (result === null) {
      console.log('The editor has been cancelled.');
      return;
    }
    console.log(result.video.duration);
    result.video.videos.forEach(video => {
      console.log(video.uri);
      console.log(video.rect);
    });

    result.recordings.forEach(recording => {
      console.log(recording.duration);
      recording.videos.forEach(video => {
        console.log(video.uri);
        console.log(video.rect);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Error occurred in the camera session: ${error}.`);
  }
};
```
