## What is the Video Editor Solution?

The Video Editor is a prebuilt solution powered by the CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) that enables fast integration of high-performance video editing into web, mobile, and desktop applications. It’s designed to help your users create professional-grade videos—from short social clips to long-form stories—directly within your app.

Skip building a video editor from scratch. This fully client-side solution provides a solid foundation with an extensible UI and a robust engine API to power video editing in any use case.

## Supported Platforms

Using a common graphics engine for both iOS and Android, React Native guarantees smooth performance on both of these platforms. This ensures uniform rendering across all platforms, compatible designs, and consistent functionality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your environment satisfies the following requirements

- React Native: 0.73+
- iOS: 16+
- Swift: 6.2 (Xcode 26.0.1)
- Android: 7+

Add the `@imgly/editor-react-native` package to your project to get started.

## Supported Media Types

[IMG.LY](http://img.ly/)'s Creative Editor SDK enables you to load, edit, and save **MP4 files** directly on the device without server dependencies.

### Importing Media

### Exporting Media

### Importing Templates

For detailed information, see the [full file format support list](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/file-format-support-3c4b2a/).

## Understanding CE.SDK Architecture & API

The following sections provide an overview of the key components of the CE.SDK video editor UI and its API architecture.

If you're ready to start integrating CE.SDK into your React Native application, check out our [Implementation Guide](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/prebuilt-solutions/video-editor-9e533a/).

### CreativeEditor SDK Mobile Video UI

The CE.SDK video editor UI is a specific configuration of the CreativeEditor SDK, focusing on essential video editing features. It includes robust tools for video manipulation, customizable to suit different use cases. Key components include:

- **Canvas:** The main workspace where users interact with their video content.
- **Timeline:** Provides control over the sequence and duration of video clips, images, and audio tracks.
- **Tool Bar:** Provides essential editing options like adjustments, filters, effectsi, layer management or adding text or images in order of relevance.
- **Context Menu:** Presents relevant editing options for each selected element, simplifying the editing process for users.

Learn more about interacting with and customizing the video editor UI in our design editor UI guide.

### CreativeEngine

At the core of CE.SDK is the CreativeEngine, which handles all rendering and video manipulation tasks. It can be used in headless mode or alongside the CreativeEditor UI. Key features and APIs provided by CreativeEngine include:

- **Scene Management:** Create, load, save,
  and manipulate video scenes programmatically.
- **Block Management:** Manage video clips,
  images, text, and other elements within the timeline.
- **Asset Management:** Integrate and manage
  video, audio, and image assets from various sources.
- **Variable Management:** Define and
  manipulate variables for dynamic content within video scenes.
- **Event Handling:** Subscribe to events
  like clip selection changes or timeline updates for dynamic interaction.

## Customizing the React Native Mobile Video Editor

CE.SDK provides extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the UI and functionality to meet your specific needs. This can range from basic configuration settings to more advanced customizations involving callbacks and custom elements.

### Basic Customizations

Configure the editor by passing a configuration object during initialization:

```typescript
const settings = new EditorSettingsModel({ license: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' });
```

Explore further customization options by visiting the [configuration guide.](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/user-interface/customization-72b2f8/)

## Framework Support

CreativeEditor SDK’s video editor is compatible with React Native, making it easy to integrate into your application.
