Headless Mode lets you use the CreativeEditor SDK's Engine directly. No prebuilt editor UI required. You initialize the Engine, load or build scenes programmatically, and export to images/PDF/video entirely in code. This is ideal for custom UIs, automation, server-triggered rendering, or batch exports.

## What You'll Learn

- What "Headless / Engine-only" means and how it differs from the UI editor.
- When to choose Headless Mode (and when not to).
- How to initialize the Engine for headless use in Kotlin.
- How to load/build a scene and modify blocks programmatically.
- How to export (PNG/JPEG/PDF, and notes on video) without launching the UI.

## When to Use It

**Pick Headless Mode when you need:**

- A fully custom UI: You're building your own editing interface or integrating into an existing app layout.
- Programmatic rendering: Generate images/PDFs from templates or data—no user interaction.
- Automation & batch work: Merge data at scale, pre-render previews, or run background exports.
- Export-only flows: Quickly render a scene without ever opening the editor.

**Avoid Headless Mode when:**

- You want turnkey editing UX out of the box (use the standard Editor for that).
- You don't want to create selection, gestures, or tool panels yourself.

### Quick Comparison

|Scenario | Headless (Engine-only) | Standard UI Editor |
|---|---|---|
|Automate design generation from code|✅|❌|
|Export scenes without user interaction|✅|❌|
|Let users visually edit with ready-made panels|❌|✅|
|Build a custom editor interface|✅|⭘ (extend via config)|

### How Headless Mode Works

With the prebuilt editors, user actions call the **Engine** API through the UI. In Headless Mode, you start the Engine and work entirely in Kotlin to:

- Scene management: create/load scenes; add pages; read/write properties
- Blocks: create text/graphics/shapes; set fills, sizes, transforms; append to parents
- Assets: register sources, resolve URIs, add media programmatically
- Templates & data: load scene archives/JSON, update text variables, swap images
- Export: render blocks or pages to PNG/JPEG/PDF (and trigger video exports where appropriate)

### Initialize the Engine in Headless Mode (Kotlin)

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch
import ly.img.engine.Engine

class HeadlessRenderer {
    private lateinit var engine: Engine

    fun startEngine(license: String, userId: String) = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
        engine = Engine.getInstance(id = "ly.img.engine.example")
        engine.start(
            license = license,
            userId = userId
        )
        // Bind offscreen for headless rendering (no UI needed)
        engine.bindOffscreen(width = 1080, height = 1920)
    }
}
```

This is "headless" because you never instantiate or present the editor UI. You only create an Engine and use its APIs. The `bindOffscreen` method creates an offscreen rendering surface—perfect for headless scenarios where no visible View is needed.

### Create and Export a Scene (Kotlin)

Below is a minimal, end-to-end example that works with the preceding class to:

- Create a scene with a single page.
- Add a rectangle filled with a remote image.
- Add a text block.
- Export the page as PNG data.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext
import ly.img.engine.DesignBlockType
import ly.img.engine.FillType
import ly.img.engine.MimeType
import ly.img.engine.ShapeType
import ly.img.engine.SizeMode
import java.nio.ByteBuffer

data class ExportResult(
    val pngData: ByteBuffer,
    val suggestedFilename: String
)

suspend fun HeadlessRenderer.buildAndExport(): ExportResult = withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
    // 1) Create an empty scene and a page
    val scene = engine.scene.create()
    val page = engine.block.create(DesignBlockType.Page)

    // Set page size
    engine.block.setWidth(page, value = 800f)
    engine.block.setHeight(page, value = 600f)

    // Attach page to scene root
    engine.block.appendChild(parent = scene, child = page)

    // 2) Add an image rectangle
    val rect = engine.block.create(DesignBlockType.Graphic)
    val shape = engine.block.createShape(ShapeType.Rect)
    engine.block.setShape(rect, shape = shape)

    val imageFill = engine.block.createFill(FillType.Image)
    engine.block.setString(
        block = imageFill,
        property = "fill/image/imageFileURI",
        // Use your own asset URL or registered source URI
        value = "https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg"
    )
    engine.block.setFill(rect, fill = imageFill)

    // Position & size the rect
    engine.block.setPositionX(rect, value = 100f)
    engine.block.setPositionY(rect, value = 100f)
    engine.block.setWidth(rect, value = 400f)
    engine.block.setHeight(rect, value = 300f)

    engine.block.appendChild(parent = page, child = rect)

    // 3) Add text
    val text = engine.block.create(DesignBlockType.Text)
    engine.block.replaceText(text, text = "Hello, From Headless Mode!")
    engine.block.setPositionX(text, value = 100f)
    engine.block.setPositionY(text, value = 450f)
    engine.block.setWidthMode(text, mode = SizeMode.AUTO)

    engine.block.appendChild(parent = page, child = text)

    // 4) Export the page to PNG
    val pngData = engine.block.export(page, mimeType = MimeType.PNG)

    ExportResult(pngData = pngData, suggestedFilename = "headless-output.png")
}
```

### Saving the File (optional)

After creating the image, you may want to save it. Here is a minimal code example to save the file to the app's files directory and return the file path.

```kotlin
import android.content.Context
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext
import java.io.File

suspend fun savePNG(context: Context, result: ExportResult): File = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val outputDir = context.filesDir
    val destinationFile = File(outputDir, result.suggestedFilename)

    destinationFile.outputStream().channel.use { channel ->
        channel.write(result.pngData)
    }

    destinationFile
}
```

![The output image from the example code.](assets/headless-ios-1-161.png)

The example code creates this `.png` image.

Some variations to the preceding code depending on your workflow might be:

- Export as different file format such as `.jpeg` or `.pdf` by changing the `mimeType` argument.
- Export a sub-tree instead of the entire page. Passing a block's ID exports just that block and its children.

### Working with Assets (Headless)

- Default sources: `engine.addDefaultAssetSources()` wires up built-in sources so URIs like `"fill/image/imageFileURI"` can resolve to remote/local assets.
- Your own sources: In production, you'll typically register a custom source (from your server, local storage, or device gallery) and then set block properties to URIs your source resolves.
- Local files: Use `file://` URLs or Android content URIs that your asset source understands.
- Fonts: Bundle or register your fonts the same way. The Engine needs them available for text layout before export.

### Templates & Data-Driven Generation

Headless Mode pairs well with:

- Scene templates (ZIP/JSON): load and then swap images or set text (update `text/text` or variable placeholders).
- Text variables / placeholders: bind your app's data model to text fields and render many variants in a loop.
- Batching: loop through data rows → set properties → export → repeat.

> **Note:** Keep content keys ("text/text", "fill/image/imageFileURI", etc.) stable across templates or use helper methods, so your code doesn't change when designers iterate.

## Troubleshooting

**❌ I'm getting nothing on export (empty data or errors)**:

- Verify you export a renderable block (the page or scene root's child).
- Ensure remote image URIs are reachable and network permissions are set in AndroidManifest.xml.
- For debugging, try a known good URL, then swap.

**❌ Images don't load or are missing in output**:

- Confirm your asset source can resolve the URI you set.
- If using remote URLs, ensure INTERNET permission is declared in AndroidManifest.xml.
- Check CORS/network security configuration if using custom domains.

**❌ Text looks wrong or uses fallback fonts**:

- The Engine needs the exact font used by the text style. Register/bundle the font and ensure it's discoverable before export.

**❌ Memory spikes on big batches**:

- Reuse a single Engine instance when possible.
- Export, write to disk, and release large buffers before rendering the next item.
- Call `engine.stop()` when completely done to free resources.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of headless mode, below are some topics to help you expand your knowledge:

- [Templates & Variables](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/android/create-templates/overview-4ebe30/) – Design tokenized templates and drive them from data.
- [Exporting](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/android/export-save-publish/export-82f968/) – PNG/JPEG/PDF exports, plus format options and best practices.
- [Standard Editor vs Headless](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/android/engine-interface-6fb7cf/) – If you need turnkey UI, start here and decide whether to drop to headless for specific flows.
