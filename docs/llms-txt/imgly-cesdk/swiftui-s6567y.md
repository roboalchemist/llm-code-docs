This guide walks you through integrating the CE.SDK into a brand-new SwiftUI project. You'll be able to add professional-grade video and photo editing to your app with just a few simple steps.

## Requirements

To work with the SDK, you'll need:

- A Mac running a recent version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial))

## Creating a new Xcode Project

**1.** Launch Xcode and use the `File` menu to select `New` -> `Project...`.

**2.** Make sure the `iOS` tab is selected, and highlight the `App` template. Click `Next`.

![Screen grab of the template chooser](assets/template-chooser-ios.png)

**3.** Enter a name for your app and an identifier for your organization. These will be combined to be the bundle identifier of your app. A team is not required to deploy your app to the simulator. Then click `Next`.

When you want to run on a physical device, you'll need to add a team. Learn how to [set up teams](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev60b6fbbc7) at Apple's help site.

**4.** Choose a location to save the project and click `Create`.

## Add the CE.SDK Swift package

**1.** With your Xcode project open, use the `File` menu to select `Add Package Dependencies...`

![Screen grab of the dependencies menu option](assets/dependencies-menu.png)

**2.** Copy the following package URL and paste it into the Search field, at the top right of the modal:

https://github.com/imgly/IMGLYUI-swift

![Image of the packages modal screen](assets/add-package.png)

**3.** Once you see the IMGLY UI package information in the window, click `Add Package`

**4.** After downloading the package and its dependencies, you'll be presented with a list of libraries. For this demo choose the `IMGLYUI` library to add to your project target. This adds all of the capabilities of the SDK to your project. For a production app, you can include only those libraries that contain the functions you need to help conserve app space.

## Add Code to Use the CE.SDK

**1.** Open the `ContentView.swift` file in your project. Import the SDK by adding the following below `import SwiftUI`:

```swift
import IMGLYDesignEditor
```

**2.** Create a variable to hold the engine for the editor. Just below the line to create the `ContentView` struct and before the declaration of the body, add this code, and update it with your actual license key and user ID. Pass `nil` for the license parameter to run the SDK in evaluation mode with a watermark.

```swift
let engineSettings = EngineSettings(license: "<your license>", // pass nil for evaluation mode with watermark
                                     userID: "<your unique user id>")
```

**3.** In the `body` variable of `ContentView`, replace the existing code with a `DesignEditor` that uses the `engineSettings`. It needs to be wrapped in a navigation-capable container, which is necessary for toolbars and controls to display properly.

```swift
NavigationView {
  DesignEditor(engineSettings)
}
.navigationViewStyle(.stack)

```

> Note: Avoid using layout containers like `VStack`, `ZStack`, or `ScrollView` as the direct parent of `DesignEditor`. These do not provide navigation context and will result in missing toolbars or UI elements.

When you're done, your `ContentView.swift` should look similar to this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import IMGLYDesignEditor

struct ContentView: View {
  let engineSettings = EngineSettings(license: "<your license key>", // pass nil for evaluation mode with watermark
                                       userID: "<your unique user id>")

  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      DesignEditor(engineSettings)
    }
    .navigationViewStyle(.stack)
  }
}
```

Now select an iOS device or a Simulator, and Build and Run.

## Using Your App

When the app launches you'll see a blank page with a toolbar at the bottom. Use the different buttons to add assets to your creation. You can add pages to your creation using the button in the top toolbar. Use the share button to export your creation as a pdf.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, here are some common problems and solutions. For additional help, [visit our support page](https://img.ly/company/contact-us).

#### Import Errors: 'EngineSettings' or 'DesignEditor' Not Found

![Import error message](assets/import-error.png)

Make sure that every Swift file that uses the editor has an `import` statement before the first line of code. Like this one, for example `import IMGLYDesignEditor`

#### Build Errors: Missing Modules

![Examples of build errors](assets/missing-package.png)

Make sure that you didn't accidentially choose the wrong target when you added the SDK to your project. You can check a target's imports on the `General` tab of the target settings.

![Screen shot showing the settings pane with the right imports](assets/check-import.png)

If the SDK is missing, you can add it using the `+` button at the bottom of the list.

#### License Key Error at Runtime

![Modal of the error for a missing license](assets/license-error.png)

Double-check that your `EngineSettings` has the exact license key with proper capitalization. If you don't have a license, [register for a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) to get a demonstration license.

#### Missing Toolbars or Controls

![Simulator screen with no top controls](assets/missing-controls.png)

Ensure the `DesignEditor` is wrapped in a `NavigationView`. Do **not** place it directly in a `VStack` or as the root of the view hierarchy.

Don’t do this:

```swift
var body: some View {
  DesignEditor(engineSettings)
}
```

Or this:

```swift
var body: some View {
  VStack {
    DesignEditor(engineSettings)
  }
}
```

Instead, wrap it in a `NavigationView` as shown above with the `.stack` style.

### What’s Next?

Now that your integration is working, you can explore more advanced features like custom templates, user uploads, and localized UI. Check out our [documentation site](https://img.ly/docs) for more tutorials and guides.
