CE.SDK's headless Node.js SDK supports multiple import methods to bring designs into the engine. Load saved **scene files** or self-contained **archives**, create editable scenes from images and videos for server-side processing, batch operations, and automation workflows.

This guide covers how to load saved CE.SDK scenes and create scenes from media files in a Node.js environment.

## Understanding Import Methods

CE.SDK provides several approaches for importing designs in headless mode:

- **Scene files** – Load lightweight JSON files that reference assets by URL
- **Archives** – Load self-contained packages that bundle scenes with all assets ([See dedicated guide](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/node/open-the-editor/import-design/from-archive-dde9fa/))
- **Media imports** – Create editable designs from source images or videos

## Import from other Design Tools

CE.SDK provides specialized importers that convert files from Photoshop (`.psd`) and InDesign (`.indd`) into editable scenes. These importers preserve layers, text, effects, and design structure.

## Load Saved CE.SDK Scenes

Load previously saved scenes to resume editing work. CE.SDK provides three methods depending on your source.

### From a URL

Use `engine.scene.loadFromURL()` to load scenes from a server or cloud storage. This works well for cloud-based processing where scenes are stored remotely.

```typescript highlight-load-from-url
  // URL to a saved CE.SDK scene file
  const sceneUrl =
    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v3/ly.img.template/templates/cesdk_postcard_1.scene';

  // Load the scene from remote URL
  await engine.scene.loadFromURL(sceneUrl);

  // The scene is now loaded and ready for editing
  // All blocks and properties from the saved scene are restored
```

The engine fetches the scene file asynchronously and replaces the current scene with the loaded content. All asset URLs referenced in the scene must remain accessible for the scene to render correctly.

### From a String

Use `engine.scene.loadFromString()` when you have scene content as a string from a database, file system, or a previous `engine.scene.saveToString()` call.

```typescript highlight-load-from-string
  // Scene content as a string (from saveToString() or storage)
  const savedSceneString = sceneString;

  // Load the scene from string content
  await engine.scene.loadFromString(savedSceneString);

  // The scene is restored from the string representation
```

This approach works well for scenes stored in databases or when integrating with custom storage systems that return scene data as strings.

### From an Archive

For self-contained packages that bundle the scene with all assets, use archives. See the [Import Design from Archive](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/node/open-the-editor/import-design/from-archive-dde9fa/) guide for complete details on working with archive files.

## Create Scenes from Media

Create editable scenes directly from images or videos.

### From Images

Use `engine.scene.createFromImage()` to create a design based on an existing image. This creates a scene sized to the image dimensions with the image as the primary content.

```typescript highlight-create-from-image
  // Create a scene based on an existing image
  const imageUrl = 'https://img.ly/static/ubq_samples/sample_1.jpg';

  // Create a scene sized to the image with the image as content
  await engine.scene.createFromImage(imageUrl);

  // The scene is ready for editing with the image as the base
```

The scene is ready for editing. You can add text, shapes, effects, and other design elements on top of the base image.

### From Videos

Use `engine.scene.createFromVideo()` to create a scene configured for video mode with timeline controls.

```typescript highlight-create-from-video
  // Create a scene configured for video editing
  const videoUrl =
    'https://cdn.img.ly/assets/demo/v3/ly.img.video/videos/pexels-drone-footage-of-a-surfer-barreling-a-wave-18069232.mp4';

  // Create a video scene with timeline support
  await engine.scene.createFromVideo(videoUrl);

  // The scene is set up for video editing with timeline controls
```

The scene is set up for video editing with timeline support and video-specific features.

## Choosing the Right Import Method

Choose your import method based on your source and requirements:

- **Resuming previous work?** Use `engine.scene.loadFromURL()` or `engine.scene.loadFromString()` for scenes you previously saved with CE.SDK.

- **Need self-contained files?** Use archives that bundle scenes with all assets ([see guide](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/node/open-the-editor/import-design/from-archive-dde9fa/)).

- **Coming from design tools?** Use the respective importers to convert Photoshop or InDesign files.

- **Starting from media?** Use `engine.scene.createFromImage()` or `engine.scene.createFromVideo()` to build editable scenes from source files.

## Best Practices

Follow these recommendations for reliable and maintainable import workflows:

### Error Handling

Always wrap import operations in try-catch blocks to handle failures gracefully:

```typescript
try {
  await engine.scene.loadFromURL(sceneUrl);
} catch (error) {
  // Log error and handle gracefully
  console.error('Failed to load scene:', error);
  // Optionally fall back to a default scene
  await engine.scene.create();
}
```

Provide specific error handling based on failure type (network errors, invalid files, missing assets).

## Working with Loaded Scenes

Modify loaded scenes immediately using CE.SDK's editing APIs. All blocks are accessible for modification.

```typescript highlight-modify-loaded-scene
  // Modify the loaded scene - all blocks are accessible
  const pages = engine.block.findByType('page');
  const page = pages[0];

  if (page) {
    // Find all graphic blocks in the scene
    const graphics = engine.block.findByType('graphic');

    // Modify properties of the first graphic if it exists
    if (graphics.length > 0) {
      const graphic = graphics[0];

      // Example: Adjust opacity
      engine.block.setOpacity(graphic, 0.8);

      // Example: Adjust position
      const currentX = engine.block.getPositionX(graphic);
      engine.block.setPositionX(graphic, currentX + 10);
    }
  }
```

Scene loads can be reverted using `engine.editor.undo()` if you need to return to the previous state.

## Performance Considerations

Consider these factors when importing designs in Node.js environments:

### File Size and Loading Time

- **Scene files** are typically small (10-100KB) and load quickly since they only contain structure and asset references
- **Archives** can be large (1MB-100MB+) depending on bundled assets, requiring more time to download and extract
- **Image/video imports** depend on source media size - a 4K image may take several seconds to process

### Network Performance

When loading from URLs:

- Use CDN-hosted resources for faster downloads and reduced latency
- Consider compression for scene files stored on your servers
- Implement retry logic for network failures
- Cache frequently loaded scenes to avoid redundant network requests

### Memory Management

- Large scenes with many blocks and high-resolution assets consume more memory
- Archives extract their contents into memory during loading
- Video imports may require significant memory for processing
- Consider limiting the number of simultaneous scene loads in batch processing scenarios

### Optimization Strategies

Improve import performance with these approaches:

- **Preload frequently used scenes** during application startup
- **Compress source media** before creating scenes to reduce file sizes
- **Use appropriate formats** - archives for portability, scene files for speed
- **Implement caching** to avoid re-downloading unchanged scenes
- **Process in batches** when handling multiple imports to manage memory usage

## Troubleshooting

**Scene fails to load with asset errors**

When a scene loads but displays missing images or fonts, the asset URLs referenced in the scene are likely inaccessible. Check that:

- All asset URLs are still valid and return the resources
- CORS headers allow fetching assets from their URLs (for cross-origin requests)
- Network connectivity allows reaching the asset servers

**Design tool import fails**

Import failures from Photoshop or InDesign files typically occur when:

- The file format isn't supported (verify `.psd` for Photoshop, `.indd` for InDesign)
- The file is corrupted or incomplete
- The importer service isn't properly configured

**Media file fails to load**

When `createFromImage()` or `createFromVideo()` fails:

- Verify the media URL is accessible and returns the file
- Check that the file format is supported (common formats: JPG, PNG, MP4, WebM)
- Ensure CORS headers allow fetching the media resource for cross-origin requests
