This guide will walk you through downloading and running a pre-built CreativeEditor SDK (CE.SDK) Vue.js integration project from GitHub. It's the fastest way to get started with CE.SDK without the need to build anything from scratch.

## Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is designed for developers who:

- Want to explore CE.SDK without the hassle of configuring a custom environment.
- Prefer getting started with a ready-made Vue.js sample project.
- Are familiar with Git and Node.js for setting up local development environments.

## What You’ll Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Clone the CE.SDK Vue.js integration project from GitHub.
- Install the required dependencies and run the project on your local machine.
- Launch a fully functional image and video editor directly in your browser.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Git**: Needed to clone the project from GitHub. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **The latest LTS version of Node.js and npm**: Required for installing dependencies and running the local server. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)).

## Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

Clone the CE.SDK examples repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgly/cesdk-web-examples.git
```

Then navigate to the Vue integration folder:

```bash
cd cesdk-web-examples/integrate-with-vue
```

## Step 2: Install the Dependencies

Once inside, install the necessary dependencies via npm by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will download and install all the packages listed in the project’s `package.json` file.

## Step 3: Set Your CE.SDK License Key

Open the `App.vue` component and replace the placeholder license key with your valid CE.SDK key:

> **Note:** **Note:** The cloned repository includes an example-specific license key for
> demonstration purposes only. You must replace this with your own valid license
> key for production use. [Get a free trial
> license](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial).

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: { CreativeEditor },
  data() {
    return {
      editorConfig: {
        license: '<YOUR_CE_SDK_LICENSE>', // replace this with your CE.SDK license key
        // ...
      },
    };
  },
};
```

This configuration will be passed down as a prop to the CE.SDK editor component (imported from `components/CreativeEditor.vue`).

## Step 4: Run the Project

Launch the local [Vite](https://vite.dev/) development server by executing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the Vue.js application will be available on your localhost at `http://localhost:5173/`. Open this URL in your browser to see the creative editor component in action.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

❌ **Issue**: `Module not found` or missing packages

- Make sure you’ve run `npm install` and that it completed successfully without any errors.

❌ **Error**: `'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`

- Confirm that you ran `npm install` before running `npm run dev`. This step also installs Vite, which is necessary to run the project locally.

❌ **Error**: `Editor engine could not be loaded: The License Key (API Key) you are using to access CE.SDK is invalid`

- Ensure your CE.SDK license key is valid, hasn’t expired, and has been properly passed to the `CreativeEditor` component's props.

❌ **Issue**: The editor doesn’t load

- Check the browser’s console for any specific error messages.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated CE.SDK with Vue.js. When you're ready, explore the SDK and move on to the next steps:

- [Perform Basic Configuration](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/vue/user-interface/overview-41101a/)
- [Configure the Callbacks](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/vue/actions-6ch24x/)
- [Serve assets from your own servers](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/vue/serve-assets-b0827c/)
- [Add Localization](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/vue/user-interface/localization-508e20/)
- [Adapt the User Interface](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/vue/user-interface/appearance/theming-4b0938/)
