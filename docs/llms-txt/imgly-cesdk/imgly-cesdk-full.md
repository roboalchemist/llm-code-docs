## What Our Clients Say About Us

Integrating IMG.LYâs editor meant we didnât have to build or maintain a complex editing layer ourselves. That kept our team focused on our core AI ad engine and saved us countless development hours â while still giving our customers the ability to polish and customize creatives at scale.

Hikari Senju@CEO@Omneky

With IMG.LY we built a central creative portal that now powers over 140 dealer campaigns across multiple automotive brands. Before this, asset creation was slow and inconsistent. IMG.LY gave us the scale and flexibility we needed to grow.

Martin RÃ¶hr@Product Owner@Digitas

By embedding IMG.LYâs editor we were able to hit key RFP requirements and deliver a template-based creative experience that now serves 1,000+ customers. It helped us win more deals and exceed enterprise expectations without needing to hire dedicated design teams.

Rob Driscoll@Director of PM@Optimizely

Since integrating IMG.LYâs editor, we now deliver 30,000+ ad creatives per month dramatically shorten time-to-launch, and help our clients cut design spend by up to $10,000 per month.This capability has been essential to delivering on our promise of fast, scalable creative production.

Logan Welbaum@Founder@Plai

IMG.LYâs solution engineers did a deep dive on our business case and helped us implement a custom print kiosk UI.

AndrÃ© Albrecht@Digital Solution Manager@Brother

Our customers create over a million personalized postcards each year choosing from over hundreds of templates with IMG.LYâs SDK. Itâs the only solution that allows us to build our own specialized, on-brand UI that integrates seamlessly with our platform.

Jeanine Zaalberg@Product Manager@Swiss Post

Our app has photo-editing at the very core of its experience and the editor has been invaluable in making that vision happen. There are no other tools on the market up to the quality of PE.SDK.

Toby Green@Lead Developer@Elbi

From a developerâs perspective, the most powerful feature of the photo editor is the integration process. It was completely flawless, quick, and easy to integrate.

Stefano Fornari@CTO@Funambol/Zefiro

Our developers loved that the integration was really straightforward and that everything you need like APIs and documentation is easy to find and of excellent quality.

Thomas Witt@Head of Product@Infopark

I believe that it is one of the easiest to use and most powerful editors on the market and the integration possibilities into our solution are awesome.

Marcus Burk@Head of Marketing@dirico.io

We compared PhotoEditor SDK with other solutions and found that it would be the best fit for us since it provides all the features that are crucial for our use case.

## FAQs

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor. Furthermore our SDK features are extendible allowing for hooks where permissions can be checked and the editor behavior customized accordingly.

### Can we integrate our own assets (Sticker, Frames, Overlays)?

Yes, absolutely! Please refer to our [documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) for more information on that topic.

### Can I decide on which features to implement?

Yes, you have full control over which features you decide to use. You can configure the toolbar on mobile and on web you can interface with the API directly to build the exact feature you need.

### Which platforms/ frameworks are supported?

Our IMG.LY SDK is suitable for web and mobile (Android & iOS). Supported frameworks are React-Native, Flutter, Ionic, and Cordova for mobile and React, Angular, Svelte and Vue.js for web. For more information, please visit our [Guides](https://img.ly/docs/vesdk/guides/) .

### Can I import existing designs files into the SDK?

You can always import individual elements as PNG, JPG or SVG, we are currently working on importers for PDF and the most common design file formats.

### Which export file formats for print do you support?

All CreativeEditor SDKÂ scenes can be exported in PNG, JPEG, TGA, binary, and PDF. See the export guide in the documentation for more information on [exporting scenes](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/) .

### Can I enable/ disable a function by default?

Yes, you have full control over the Editorâs UI and functionality. You can also take full control over the editing process with smart templates, lockable designs and placeholders.

### Do you offer integration support?

Yes, apart from accessing our complete [CreativeEngine documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/get-started/overview-e18f40/) you can also contact our support team. Our solutions team offer different levels of support based on your license type.  To explore your use case and potential solutions with us simply [get in touch.](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales)

### Which server-side technologies do you support?

You can run the CreativeEngine in a Node.js environment and deploy it on any platform with Node.js support. See [this guide](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/node/automation/multi-image-generation-2a0de4/) on how to deploy on AWS for reference.

### Can I try your Editors to see how it works?

Yes, we offer a free trial for all our products. You can get your [free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) right now.

### Can my users edit their photos using IMG.LY SDKs when they are offline?

As the editor works client-side, a permanent internet connection isn't necessary for the editor to run properly. Once the device reconnects, available updates can be installed and the export tracking will be communicated. However, if you require the SDK to work in a purely offline environment please [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) to request an offline license.

## Terms of Service

Version 2025.04

## â 1. Subject Matter

1.1 These Terms of Service (together with any applicable Order Form the " Agreement ") govern all rights granted by Licensor to use and commercially exploit any of the IMG.LY SDKs (the " Software "), namely the CreativeEditor SDK and/or PhotoEditor SDK and/or VideoEditor SDK and/or imglyKit SDK.

1.2 The Agreement is entered into by and between IMG.LY GmbH, KortumstraÃe 19-21, 44787 Bochum, Germany (the " Licensor ") and the entity identified in the Order Form (the " Licensee ", together with Licensor the " Parties ") as of the effective date the Order Form is last signed on.

1.3 This Agreement shall govern the use of the Software for commercial purposes. To the extent the Software is intended to be used for non-commercial purposes only, an alternative licensing scheme may be available upon Licensor's discretion.

## 2. Order Form

2.1 An " Order Form " may either be executed (i) by the Parties upon individual negotiation or (ii) via an online order issued by Licensee via Licensor's website at [img.ly](https://img.ly) (the " Website ") that has been confirmed by Licensor. Online orders not confirmed within 14 days after issuance shall be considered denied.

2.2 No rights shall be granted to Licensee by virtue of these Terms of Service alone as such grant requires the execution of an Order Form making reference to these Terms of Service.

2.3 The Order Form shall specify the environment for the Software that shall be licensed by Licensee. The Software is currently available for integration in the following environments, but is not limited to: (i) Web, (ii) iOS, (iii) Android, and (iv) Node.js.

2.4 The Order Form shall specify (i) the Subscription Term and (ii) the License Fees. Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, the Subscription Term shall be based on monthly or annual periods for payment of the License Fees (the " Payment Periods ").

2.5 Licensor may choose to offer Licensee a trial period specified by Licensor to test the Software in a dedicated testing environment not subject to License Fees (the " Trial Period ") . Licensor may also choose to offer Licensee extended trial periods subject to License Fees (âExtended Trial Periodâ). These Trial Periods and/or Extended Trial Periods will automatically end upon completion and do not require termination. Licensee acknowledges that converting from a Trial Period and/or Extended Trial Period to a regular Subscription Term may require additional steps, as outlined in the Order Form. Upon expiration of the Trial Period and/or Extended Trial Period, the right to test the Software shall cease without further notice. Licensee shall then be required to execute an Order Form to obtain a License for a Subscription Term in case the Software shall be further used.

2.6 The Order Form can include usage-based pricing models based on factors such as monthly active users or number of exports. The pricing can also be based on Licenseeâs company size. Licensee shall not make any false statements in regard to the eligibility thresholds stated on the Order Form or relevant for pricing. Further Licensee is solely responsible to keep Licensor informed about any changes on its part with respect to the eligibility thresholds or aspects relevant for pricing stated on the Order Form.

2.7 Licensee shall inform Licensor of any "agency relationshipâ, if necessary under a Non-Disclosure Agreement, under which Licensee effectively shall not be the entity making use of the Software but intends to source the Software for use by a third party. In such case, Licensor shall be free to execute an Agreement with the entity effectively making use of the Software as Licensee only.

## 3. Grant of Rights

3.1 Licensor shall grant to Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use the Software subject to the terms of this Agreement, in particular with the specifications as set out in the Order Form (the " License ").

3.2 The License shall pertain to the Software in object code format as well as to content data (fonts, stickers, stock images, etc.) included therein. In order to enable integration of the Software, parts of the Software may be provided in source code format if agreed upon in the Order Form individually or if offered by Licensor in its free discretion; in such case, the License shall also pertain to the Software in source code format.

3.3 The License shall be limited to the right (i) to copy and â in case of disclosure in source code format â modify the Software solely for integration into one of Licensee's products (website or app) (the " Licenseeâs Product ") in accordance with the requirements of interfaces and implementation guidelines as issued by Licensor (the " Integrated Software ") and (ii) to copy, distribute and make available the Integrated Software to Licensee's end customers in object code format (the License does not cover distribution, making available or disclosure of the Software or any part thereof in source code format).

## 4. Obligations and Restrictions

4.1 Licensee shall not reproduce, disassemble, or reverse assemble any portion of the Software or otherwise derive its source code, except to the extent that such activity is specifically permitted by this Agreement or by statutory law.

4.2 Licensee shall not redistribute the Software or its modifications other than by integrating the Software into Licensee's Product. Use in context of more than one of Licensee's Products shall require multiple Licenses accordingly via respective Order Forms. Licensee's Product shall have a substantially different functionality than the Software (i.e. must not be described as a photo editor and/or video editor, respective development kit, library, or product commercially competing with the Software); otherwise, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

4.3 Licensee shall not use the Software in connection with or to promote any products, services, or materials that constitute or promote spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code, unsolicited mass distribution of email (spam), defamatory, pornographic, abusive or otherwise offensive content; otherwise, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

4.4 Licensor shall be entitled to verify and validate Licensee's use of the Software in line with this Agreement via respective functionalities of the Software. In particular, Licensor is entitled to make access to the Software dependent from successful remote validation (via API) of a license key allocated to an active Subscription Term and covering the intended access and use.

4.5 Licensor shall be entitled to use server-side monitoring tools to analyze use of the Software by users. Licensee shall safeguard that such monitoring by Licensor can be performed in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection law via respective notices and, if required, opt-in procedures. Licensor will support Licensee to the extent required by providing required information and instruction.

## 5. Proprietary Rights

5.1 All rights not expressly granted to Licensee are reserved by Licensor. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all rights to modifications of the source code made by Licensee to enable integration of the Software shall belong to the Licensor as part of the Software; the Licensee shall assign all respective rights to Licensor or, in case no assignment is feasible under applicable law, Licensee shall grant a worldwide, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable right to use such modifications without any restrictions. Licensee shall have no rights to use, copy, or reproduce the Software except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

5.2 No rights shall be granted with regard to trademarks, trade names, trade dress and trade secrets to Licensee except for the limited right of use provided under the License.

6.1 The Software implements components licensed under open source licenses (" OSS Components ") and further software components and content data (fonts, stickers, stock images, etc.) provided by third parties under applicable licensing terms (" Third Party Components "). The use of the OSS Components and the Third Party Components is subject to the applicable separate licensing terms. A list of the OSS Components and Third Party Components with reference to the applicable licensing terms is accessible online via [https://img.ly/acknowledgements](https://img.ly/acknowledgements) . Licensor does not act as sublicensor or agent in this regard and assumes or acknowledges no warranty or liability for the OSS Components and the Third Party Components.

6.2 Licensee shall only use further third party software components or content data (fonts, stickers, stock images, etc.) with the Software to the extent that Licensee is entitled to such use. Licensor shall not be liable or responsible for any use of third party software components or content data by Licensee. Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor from any third-party claims caused by Licensee's actions involving third party software components or content data.

## 7. Payment

7.1 The license fees as specified in the Order Form (the " License Fees ") shall be due and payable in line with the Payment Periods. To the extent the due date is not specified in the Order Form, the License Fees shall be due upon the execution of the Order Form and then upon the commencement of each further Payment Period for all of the Subscription Term.

7.2 Licensor shall invoice the License Fees to Licensee. Invoices are payable without deduction within 14 days of the date of the invoice and may be made by direct payment on the Website via credit card, if a respective option is provided by Licensor. If Licensee is in default of payment, the outstanding amount shall bear interest as applicable under statutory law. Licensor reserves all further rights resulting from default.

7.3 Unless specified otherwise in the Order Form, the License Fees shall be paid in Euros. All amounts stated in the Order Form are excluding any applicable value added tax (VAT), unless explicitly specified otherwise. Licensee shall be responsible for any applicable sales, use, value added or similar taxes payable with respect to the licensing of the Software, or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, other than taxes levied or imposed based upon Licensor's income or gross revenues. If Licensee has tax-exempt status, Licensee shall provide written evidence of such status to Licensor. Upon Licensor's request, Licensee shall provide its VAT identification number or other identification information required for invoicing purposes.

7.4 The license fees specified in the Order Form (the "License Fees") are subject to price adjustments in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") published by the European Central Bank ( [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/) ). Corresponding License Fee adjustments are made at renewal for annual Subscription Terms and after every 12 months for other Subscription Terms.

7.5 Licensee shall bear all bank transfer fees or related charges imposed by Licenseeâs or intermediary banks in connection with payments made via bank transfer. Such fees shall not reduce the amounts payable to Licensor under this Agreement. Any deducted fees may be added to the next invoice or otherwise reimbursed by Licensee. This provision shall not apply to payments made via credit card or other online payment methods provided by Licensor, for which Licensor remains responsible for transaction costs.

## 8. Delivery and Maintenance

8.1 The Software shall be delivered via download from designated package repositories. The designated link for such download shall be provided in the Order Form. The use of the Software in a Subscription Term requires a key that shall be provided upon the initial payment of the License Fees, subject to the terms agreed upon in the Order Form. The key required for a Trial Period shall be provided upon commencement and deactivated upon expiration of the Trial Period.

8.2 The Software and Documentation shall be provided in English language.

8.3 Licensee shall be responsible for installing the Software and providing the system environment required to operate the Software in accordance with the requirements as set forth in the Documentation.

8.4 Subject to any other specification in the Order Form, Licensor shall not provide any support and maintenance services other than the issuance of such updates, upgrades or patches for the Software as made available via the Website. Licensor shall have no obligation to provide support or maintenance for the Integrated Software or any modifications to the Software made by Licensee for integration into one of Licensee's Products.

8.5 Licensor may choose to offer Licensee a separate Service Level Agreement detailing specific availability commitments against additional remuneration. Such availability commitments always exclude downtime due to planned maintenance and downtime outside Licensorâs control. In case of planned maintenance leading to downtime exceeding three hours, Licensor will notify Licensee via email.

## 9. Term and Termination

9.1 The term of the License shall be determined in the Order Form (the " Subscription Term "). The License shall commence upon initial payment of the License Fees and expire upon the end of the Subscription Term(s). Unless stated otherwise in the Order Form, the initial Subscription Term shall automatically be extended by further consecutive Subscription Terms unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intent not to extend the License prior to the end of the current Subscription Term. For monthly Subscription Terms, the notification must be given one week prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term in order to be valid. For other Subscription Terms, the notification must be given one month prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term in order to be valid. Upon expiration of the Subscription Term(s), the right to use the Software shall cease without further notice. To the extent the Subscription Term is not specified in the Order Form, Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement and revoke the License at any time.

9.2 Either Party shall be entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement or suspend any rights granted hereunder upon notice to the other in the event that: (i) the other Party breaches any material term of this Agreement, Licensor may particularly revoke the License in case of default or other non-payment of License Fees or use of the Software in breach of Sections 3.3 or 5.1; or (ii) upon the other Party's dissolution, liquidation, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent for the Party's business or property. A change of control of Licensee, the sale of all or more than 50% of Licensee's assets, or a merger or reorganization of Licensee in which Licensee is not the surviving organization is considered dissolution of Licensee. In the event that Licensor terminates this Agreement for breach, all amounts due or to become due under this Agreement shall immediately become due and payable.

9.3 Upon expiration of the Subscription Term or termination, each Party shall promptly remit to the other all unpaid monies due, or to become due, under this Agreement. Licensee shall return to Licensor or destroy all copies of the Software in its possession and provide written confirmation to that effect; this particularly applies to the Software in source code format in case such disclosure has occurred. In case of termination or revocation of the License, paid monies or due payments for any commenced Payment Periods shall not be refunded to Licensee.

9.4 In addition to those provisions which by their nature are intended to survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any license granted hereunder, Sections 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall specifically survive such expiration or termination.

9.5 In the event of termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, the Licensee is obliged to promptly cease use of and remove the Software from all of its products. Until the Software is confirmed to be completely removed from all of the Licensee's products, Licensor reserves the right to continue to charge the Licensee the agreed License Fees. The Licensee must provide satisfactory evidence of the complete removal of the Software upon request of the Licensor.

## 10. Warranty Claims

10.1 Product descriptions shall not be deemed guaranteed unless separately agreed in writing.

10.2 Rights in case of defects shall be excluded in case of minor or immaterial deviations from the characteristics of the Software or in the case of only slight impairment of use. Licensor shall further not be responsible for defects which are caused by improper use or operation. Licensor shall not be responsible for ensuring that any modifications made by Licensee to the Software for integration into one of Licensee's Products will work other versions of the Software.

10.3 Any claims for damages are subject to the limitations set forth under Section 11 of this Agreement.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

11.1 Licensor shall be liable without restriction for damages caused intentionally or with gross negligence by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Licensor shall also be liable without restriction for death, personal injury or damage to health caused by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Furthermore, Licensor shall be liable without restriction for damages in accordance with the German Product Liability Act.

11.2 Licensor shall be liable for damages caused by breach of its primary obligations under this Agreement by Licensor, its legal representatives or assistants in performance. Primary obligations are such duties that form the essence of the Agreement, which were decisive for the conclusion of the Agreement and on the performance of which Licensee may rely. If Licensor breaches its primary obligations with simple negligence, then its liability shall be limited to the amount which was foreseeable for Licensor at the time when the respective duty was performed. Any further liability of Licensor shall be excluded on the merits. In particular, any liability of Licensor for initial defects of the Software already present at the start of the Subscription Term shall be excluded.

11.3 The right to set off a claim shall be limited to such claims that are uncontested or have been finally established with legal effect.

## 12. Confidentiality

12.1 Each Party may be granted access to confidential information of the other Party during the term of this Agreement. Confidential information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the other party, (ii) is rightfully acquired by the recipient from a third party that was not under an obligation to hold the information in confidence, (iii) is independently developed by the recipient or, (iv) is previously known to the recipient without non-disclosure obligations. The terms of this Agreement and the source code to the Software shall constitute confidential information under this Agreement.

12.2 Neither Party shall use any confidential information of the other Party other than for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under this Agreement or disclose to any third party any confidential information of the other Party except as permitted under this Agreement. Disclosure of confidential information shall not be precluded if such disclosure is in response to a valid order of a court or other governmental body or is otherwise required by statutory law.

12.3 Subject to the exceptions under Section 12.2., Licensee shall not disclose the terms of this Agreement to any third party.

12.4 Non-disclosure agreements executed by the Parties independent from this Agreement shall remain in force.

## 13. Final Provisions

13.1 Licensor shall be entitled to identify Licensee as a customer and to refer to Licensee and its business by name, trademark and trade name, if applicable, on the Website and in Licensor's marketing materials.

13.2 Licensor shall not accept, and this Agreement does not operate as an acceptance of, any different or additional terms and conditions, and this Agreement shall prevail over any such different or additional provisions, of any Licensee's order.

13.3 All notices or reports shall be in writing or sent by email.

13.4 Licensee may not assign this Agreement, in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of Licensor.

13.5 Amendments or additions to this Agreement must be made in writing to be effective. This shall also apply to amendments of this written form requirement.

13.6 This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany; the regulations of the UN Sales Convention shall be excluded.

13.7 The courts for Licensor's registered office shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes under and in connection with this Agreement.

13.8 Should any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining terms. In such event, the Parties shall be obliged to cooperate in the creation of terms which achieve such legally valid result as comes closest commercially to that of the invalid provision. The above shall apply accordingly to the closing of any gaps in the Agreement.

# Bridging Technology & Design

IMG.LY is building the creative engine that brings beautiful video and photo editing to your applications. From Fortune 100 businesses to new startups, our SDKs power hundreds of applications.

## Democratize Design

Creating beautiful designs is a challenge for many, often consisting of repetitive, time-consuming tasks. IMG.LY removes these barriers, helping developers build applications that bring the world never before seen content.

## Giving Back

As tech and design enthusiasts, gamers, and creators, we benefit from creations and communities that power our world, so it is time to give back!   DESIGN Ã TECHNOLOGY (DXT)  In our annual [DXT conference](https://dxt.ruhr/) , we gather creatives in various fields, from creative coders to branding experts, to discover new trends and open new grounds.   Supporting Open Source   Smart code powers ideas, so we love connecting with masterminds who contribute to the community (e.g. sponsoring [EnTT on GitHub](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) ).

## Our Story

In 2009, IMG.LY was the most popular photo-sharing tool for Twitter. When Twitter built their own, it rendered our first product obsolete.  â  During that time, customers of our holding company asked for tools around image processing. So we built and released PhotoEditor SDK. With the explosion of the visual web, it caught the eye of major tech companies, resulting in our rapid growth. This success continued with our release of VideoEditor SDK in 2019.  â  Today, we use machine learning and computer vision to bridge design and technology, building the creative engine that will power the next generation of creative tools.

We offer a wrapper for React Native and examples for a couple of others. You can find those on our [developers page](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/) . As our forte lies in working with native environments as opposed to hybrid-frameworks, we can't offer full support for all framework options out there. However, we will always help you to the best of our ability. Also, to ensure full compatibility in all cases you will need to have a license for every platform you want to use the SDKs on.

#### How does the integration process work?

You can find all the details on how to integrate our editors for all available platforms in the respective documentations for [CreativeEditor SDK](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/) , [PhotoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/docs/pesdk/guides/)  and [VideoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/docs/vesdk/guides/) .

#### Is the video editor for web compatible with VE.SDK on iOS and Android?

No, the video editor for web is part of CE.SDK and exported scenes are only compatible with CE.SDK's mobile video editors.

#### Do you offer technical support and if so, where can I find it?

We provide two different levels of technical [Support](https://img.ly/support) for our different plans. Depending on the plan selected, support consists of a ticket-based service desk or enterprise support via a direct Onboarding and personalized commmunication. Get in touch with our [Sales Team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) to elaborate your options.

#### Do I need a paid account to receive support?

Generally yes. However, we understand that you need to implement and test our SDKs before you can make your decision on whether we are the right solution for your project. To receive assistance, just visit our trial support [here](https://img.ly/support) . We'll be glad to help.

#### Can my users edit their photos using IMG.LY SDKs when they are offline?

As the editor works client-side, a permanent internet connection isn't necessary for the editor to run properly. Once the device reconnects, available updates can be installed and the export tracking will be communicated. However, if you require the SDK to work in a purely offline environment please [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) to request an offline license.

#### Where can I find my license keys?

You can find your license key in your [personal dashboard](https://img.ly/login) . Simply add your app identifiers, download the file, drop it into the SDK and you are good to go.

#### How can I add features or platforms to my existing subscription?

Please get in touch via our [Support Team](https://img.ly/support) . We are happy to assist you with upgrading your subscription.

#### Can I use my paid license for my testing environment as well as the production environment?

Yes, you can add multiple app identifiers per license to allow for this.

#### For how many products is my PhotoEditor SDK or VideoEditor SDK license valid?

Each subscription and its respective license keys are valid for one commercial product instance only. If you have multiple use cases or multiple product instances you want to use our editors for, please [contact us](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) so we can discuss your requirements and find the perfect solution for you.

#### Will my subscription renew automatically?

Yes, unless otherwise contracted, every license renews itself by an additional year or month, depending on the performance period interval you chose. You can cancel monthly contracts a week and yearly contracts one month before the end of the performance period. For more on that please, refer to our [Terms of Service](https://img.ly/tos) .

#### Why do you only offer licenses for CreativeEditor SDK, PhotoEditor SDK and VideoEditor SDK on a subscription basis?

To ensure high performance, we continually maintain and further improve our SDKs. We also provide ongoing support for our editors to guarantee technical compatibility with new devices and browsers of all kinds. We create long-lasting and mutually beneficial business relationships with our customers instead of just selling a product. That's why we chose a subscription model over a one-time fee.

#### What kind of data is transmitted to your servers?

The number of exported images or videos as well as a verification of a license's validity are the only information sent to our servers. No images, videos, or personal data is being handled or gathered in any way. For more information please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://img.ly/privacy-policy) .

#### Why are you offering native SDKs for mobile?

Our goal is always to deliver the best and smoothest user experience possible for all of our products. Providing native SDKs for Android and iOS is therefore the logical consequence to ensure top-of-the-line quality for your users.

#### What is included in an Enterprise License?

An Enterprise license comes with turned-off server communication, and custom license terms. On top of that, there are additional options for an Enterprise subscription, our [Sales Team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) is happy to assist with a custom offer.

#### Why do I need Enterprise Support?

Enterprise Support offers faster and prioritised response times as well as direct communication during the onboarding phase (up to 6 weeks).

#### When do I need a Reseller License?

A Reseller license is meant for use cases in which our editors are being made available to your customer's clients to be used in their products. A good example of this are website builders that allow the end-user to implement one of our editors into their websites.

#### When do I need Custom License Terms?

In case you have individual requirements regarding license terms governing contracts with vendors and partners - like many larger companies do - and therefore can't agree to parts of our Terms of Service. Simply reach out to our sales team through our [contact form](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) and we'll get in touch with you.

#### What is included in a Service Level Agreement?

We offer Service Level Agreements to our Enterprise customers to accommodate their specific business and support requirements. Service Level Agreements may include guaranteed uptime of our services, guarantees of specific response times for technical support requests, etc.

#### Which methods of payment do you offer?

For our Business and Small Business plan, we only offer monthly and yearly payments via an automated debit to your credit card. For our Enterprise customers, we also offer payments via wire transfer.

#### How can I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription. Please keep the cancellation period in mind, notifying us at least one month (one week in case of a monthly Subscription Term) before the end of your current Subscription Term.

### Be Flexible When Handling Actions and Common Tasks

CE.SDK now introduces new Actions and Utils APIs that simplify how you manage editor workflows.

With the Actions API , tasks like save, export, load, or upload are managed centrally instead of across multiple places. This reduces repetition and makes it easier to customize how users interact with the editor.

The Utils API adds ready-to-use defaults for dialogs, file handling, exporting, and scene management. These save time and cut boilerplate while still letting you override behavior when needed.

Explore the [Actions API](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/actions-6ch24x?ref=img.ly) and [Utils API](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/api/cesdk-js/classes/utilsapi/?ref=img.ly) .

### Stay Flexible with iOS 26

Appleâs new Liquid Glass design system in iOS 26 changes safe-area handling, toolbar sizing, and system banners. CE.SDK v1.60 prepares you for this shift: choose whether to embrace the new look or preserve your current layout.

By default, when you build against the iOS 26 SDK , our editor automatically uses the new system visuals and behaviors for seamless alignment with Appleâs latest design language.

If you continue building with a preâiOS 26 SDK, nothing changes: your app continues to look and behave as before, and our SDK maintains the previous experience.

If you want to build with the iOS 26 SDK but temporarily keep the classic UI , Apple provides an Info.plist switch: UIDesignRequiresCompatibility to enable UI [compatibility mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/BundleResources/Information-Property-List/UIDesignRequiresCompatibility) .

When this is present, your app wonât adopt Liquid Glass, and our SDK will mirror that choice to remain consistent with the rest of your app.

Note: Apple hasnât published a deprecation date for this compatibility key; plan your migration accordingly.

Resources:  â [Apple Documentation - Liquid Glass Introduction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/TechnologyOverviews/liquid-glass)  â [Apple Documentation - Adopting Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/TechnologyOverviews/adopting-liquid-glass)

### Integrate a User-Friendly Editor

We've made enhancements for a more user-friendly editor setup of CE.SDK.

To enhance legibility and perception of our UI elements, we have reworked our UI colors , making sure they meet the minimal contrast requirements for an improved experience. Additionally, the active state of settings is now more apparent than it was previously.

Next, libraries  and  all  inspectors open on the same side of our default editor now, instead of on both sides. This reduces mouse travel, saves space, and streamlines workflows .

Additionally, you can now resize images more easily by dragging from any side, not just using the handles. This same feature is also applicable when cropping your image.

Lastly, elements stay selected after grouping or ungrouping. In the past, changing group settings would deselect your elements.

### Quickly Add Editors to Mobile Apps with UI Packages

In the past, integrating our editors into your app required developers to manually collect code from our showcases and piece together the UI. This not only demanded effort but also necessitated frequent updates to ensure compatibility with each of our new releases.

These packages include a wide range of options, from a fully equipped Video Editor (iOS) and Camera UI (iOS) to specialized examples like an Apparel Editor or Postcard Editor.

We maintain UI packages for you, ensuring compatibility across devices and development environments. Now, you can immediately  start with fully featured editors, staying up-to-date with just a click, and without manual intervention.

# Make the World More Creative and Expressive.

Why Our vision is to excite, empower, and connect people so that they can make the world more creative and expressive.

How We bridge the gap between technology and design.

What We build creative platforms and tools that make design easier and more accessible.

## Design

Creating appealing designs remains a challenge for most of us, and there are many reasons for that. But tools, such as computers, allow us to finish more tasks in a shorter amount of time and with fewer resources. Even more importantly, said tools also rid us of repetitious work, enabling us to shift our attention to more exciting tasks, paving the way for us to experiment and create rather than repeat.   Proper visual design attracts, engages, and persuades; it helps convey stories and facilitates communication.

## Technology

We are building the creative engine of the digital world â UBQ, a platform for creative editing. We double down on our core belief that design can benefit a lot from technological advancements.   Since releasing our first [PhotoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/photo-sdk) in 2015, it quickly found its way into the hands of thousands of application developers. The demand allowed us to ramp up our efforts to expand our SDK to cover more platforms, add features and launch [VideoEditor SDK](https://img.ly/products/video-sdk) .  At the same time, two striking things happened to us. Read more about our UBQ engine.

## Community

We love to power great ideas and people who power ours, which is why we started sponsoring Open Source projects like [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) .   To celebrate interdisciplinary and open knowledge exchange DXTÂ :Â DESIGNÂ x TECHNOLOGY conference will take place in 2021 in Bochum. To stay in the loop, participate and join engaging meetups along the way, sign up for our newsletter and Meetup group. We can't wait to see you!

If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated personal data (e.g., contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship.

Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g., due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.

Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion.

### Umfang und Zweck der Datenerhebung

Wenn Sie uns eine Bewerbung zukommen lassen, verarbeiten wir Ihre damit verbundenen personenbezogenen Daten (z.Â B. Kontakt- und Kommunikationsdaten, Bewerbungsunterlagen, Notizen im Rahmen von BewerbungsgesprÃ¤chen etc.), soweit dies zur Entscheidung Ã¼ber die BegrÃ¼ndung eines BeschÃ¤ftigungsverhÃ¤ltnisses erforderlich ist. Rechtsgrundlage hierfÃ¼r ist Â§ 26 BDSG nach deutschem Recht (Anbahnung eines BeschÃ¤ftigungsverhÃ¤ltnisses), Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO (allgemeine Vertragsanbahnung) und â sofern Sie eine Einwilligung erteilt haben â Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

AnschlieÃend werden die Daten gelÃ¶scht und die physischen Bewerbungsunterlagen vernichtet. Die Aufbewahrung dient insbesondere Nachweiszwecken im Falle eines Rechtsstreits. Sofern ersichtlich ist, dass die Daten nach Ablauf der 6-Monatsfrist erforderlich sein werden (z.Â B. aufgrund eines drohenden oder anhÃ¤ngigen Rechtsstreits), findet eine LÃ¶schung erst statt, wenn der Zweck fÃ¼r die weitergehende Aufbewahrung entfÃ¤llt.

Eine lÃ¤ngere Aufbewahrung kann auÃerdem stattfinden, wenn Sie eine entsprechende Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) erteilt haben oder wenn gesetzliche Aufbewahrungspflichten der LÃ¶schung entgegenstehen.

## FAQs

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor. Furthermore our SDK features are extendible allowing for hooks where permissions can be checked and the editor behavior customized accordingly.

### Can we integrate our own assets (Sticker, Frames, Overlays)?

Yes, absolutely! Please refer to our [documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) for more information on that topic.

### Can I decide on which features to implement?

### Can I import existing designs files into the SDK?

You can always import individual elements as PNG, JPG or SVG, we are currently working on importers for PDF and the most common design file formats.

### Which export file formats for print do you support?

All CreativeEditor SDKÂ scenes can be exported in PNG, JPEG, TGA, binary, and PDF. See the export guide in the documentation for more information on [exporting scenes](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/) .

### Can I enable/ disable a function by default?

Yes, you have full control over the Editorâs UI and functionality. You can also take full control over the editing process with smart templates, lockable designs and placeholders.

### Do you offer integration support?

### Can I try your Editors to see how it works?

Yes, we offer a free trial for all our products. You can get your [free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) right now.

### Can my users edit their photos using IMG.LY SDKs when they are offline?

As the editor works client-side, a permanent internet connection isn't necessary for the editor to run properly. Once the device reconnects, available updates can be installed and the export tracking will be communicated. However, if you require the SDK to work in a purely offline environment please [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) to request an offline license.

## What Our Clients Say About Us

Integrating IMG.LYâs editor meant we didnât have to build or maintain a complex editing layer ourselves. That kept our team focused on our core AI ad engine and saved us countless development hours â while still giving our customers the ability to polish and customize creatives at scale.

Hikari Senju@CEO@Omneky

Rob Driscoll@Director of PM@Optimizely

Since integrating IMG.LYâs editor, we now deliver 30,000+ ad creatives per month dramatically shorten time-to-launch, and help our clients cut design spend by up to $10,000 per month.This capability has been essential to delivering on our promise of fast, scalable creative production.

## FAQs

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor. Furthermore our SDK features are extendible allowing for hooks where permissions can be checked and the editor behavior customized accordingly.

### Can we integrate our own assets (Sticker, Frames, Overlays)?

Yes, absolutely! Please refer to our [documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) for more information on that topic.

### Can I decide on which features to implement?

Yes, you have full control over which features you decide to use. You can configure the toolbar on mobile and on web you can interface with the API directly to build the exact feature you need.

### Which platforms/ frameworks are supported?

Our IMG.LY SDK is suitable for web and mobile (Android & iOS). Supported frameworks are React-Native, Flutter, Ionic, and Cordova for mobile and React, Angular, Svelte and Vue.js for web. For more information, please visit our [Guides](https://img.ly/docs/vesdk/guides/) .

### Can I import existing designs files into the SDK?

You can always import individual elements as PNG, JPG or SVG, we are currently working on importers for PDF and the most common design file formats.

### Which export file formats for print do you support?

All CreativeEditor SDKÂ scenes can be exported in PNG, JPEG, TGA, binary, and PDF. See the export guide in the documentation for more information on [exporting scenes](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/export-save-publish/export/overview-9ed3a8/) .

### Can I enable/ disable a function by default?

Yes, you have full control over the Editorâs UI and functionality. You can also take full control over the editing process with smart templates, lockable designs and placeholders.

### Do you offer integration support?

Yes, apart from accessing our complete [CreativeEngine documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/get-started/overview-e18f40/) you can also contact our support team.

### Can I try your Editors to see how it works?

Yes, we offer a free trial for all our products. You can get your [free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) right now.

### Can my users edit their photos using IMG.LY SDKs when they are offline?

As the editor works client-side, a permanent internet connection isn't necessary for the editor to run properly. Once the device reconnects, available updates can be installed and the export tracking will be communicated. However, if you require the SDK to work in a purely offline environment please [contact our sales team](https://img.ly/forms/contact-sales) to request an offline license.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can we integrate our own assets (Sticker, Frames, Overlays)?

Yes, absolutely! Please refer to our [documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/import-media/from-remote-source/unsplash-8f31f0/) for more information on that topic.

### Can I decide on which features to implement?

Yes, you have full control over which features you decide to use. You can configure the toolbar on mobile and on web you can interface with the API directly to build the exact feature you need.

### Which platforms/ frameworks are supported?

### Can I import existing designs files into the SDK?

You can always import individual elements as PNG, JPG or SVG, we are currently working on importers for PDF and the most common design file formats.

### Which export file formats for print do you support?

### Can I enable/ disable a function by default?

Yes, you have full control over the Editorâs UI and functionality. You can also take full control over the editing process with smart templates, lockable designs and placeholders.

### Do you offer integration support?

Yes, apart from accessing our complete [CreativeEngine documentation](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/js/get-started/overview-e18f40/) you can also contact our support team.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

## FAQs

### Can I scale GPU rendering in Docker?

Yes. The SDK supports NVIDIA GPU acceleration out of the box. You can run multiple GPU-enabled containers in parallel, scale across nodes, or integrate with any orchestrator (Kubernetes, ECS, Nomad) for high-throughput workloads.

â

### How do I migrate from CE.SDK?

Itâs seamless. You can reuse your existing CE.SDK templates, scenes, assets, and automation logic without modification. The Renderer uses the same engine as the UI editor, ensuring pixel-perfect output and eliminating inconsistencies between client and server.

â

### Is there an on-prem license?

Yes. You can fully self-host the video rendering engine in your own infrastructureâon-premise, VPC, or air-gapped environments. Enterprise SLAs and support are available.

â

### Do I still need FFmpeg or After Effects?

No. The Renderer eliminates the need for FFmpeg scripting, browser-based rendering, or queue-heavy After Effects farms. Encoding, compositing, transitions, and timeline logic all run natively inside the Renderer.

â

### Is video export legally compliant?

Yes. The AV-licensed version includes fully compliant H.264/H.265 encoding powered by Fluendo, covering all relevant patents. This significantly reduces the legal risks associated with open-source or unlicensed encodersâespecially for high-volume or commercial video publishing.

### What file formats are supported?

The Renderer outputs MP4 (H.264 / H.265) for video and supports PNG, JPEG, and PDF for design scenes. Support for additional formats is available depending on licensing tier.

### Does the output match what users see in the editor?

Yes. Rendering uses the same CE.SDK engine as the browser editor. You get frame-perfect accuracy for text, typography, animations, effects, layers, and templatesâcritical for automated creative production.

### How do I use my own data (CSV, JSON, API) in templates?

You can bind external data sources to CE.SDK templates in Node.js or your backend workflow. Each data row becomes a new scene, which is passed to the Renderer for automated batch exportâideal for ads, localized campaigns, catalogs, and personalization.

### Does it support async rendering and queues?

Not out of the box. The Renderer currently performs one-time, synchronous operations - scene in, export out.If you need async job handling, queueing, or distributed processing, you can layer your own orchestration around the CLI (e.g., using a job runner or message queue).

### Can I integrate this into my CMS, DAM, or AI pipeline?

Yes, as long as your system can trigger CLI commands in a Docker environment. The Renderer runs purely as a CLI inside a Docker container - no REST API or Node.js SDK at the moment. Teams typically integrate it by calling the container with parameters from their CMS, DAM, or AI pipeline.

### What kind of infrastructure do I need?

Youâll need an NVIDIA GPU for full hardware-accelerated rendering. The Renderer runs as a Docker container with no additional OS or codec setup required, and can run on CPU-only machines - but performance will be significantly slower without an NVIDIA GPU.

### Is there a free version?

Yes. The open-source edition includes unlicensed codecs for testing, prototyping, and internal workflows. For production-grade video, H.264/H.265 patent-licensed encoding is available through the Fluendo-powered enterprise edition.

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor. Furthermore our SDK features are extendible allowing for hooks where permissions can be checked and the editor behavior customized accordingly.

### Can I import existing designs files into the SDK?

## FAQs

### What is the difference between creative automation and variable data printing?

Creative automation refers to the general process of programmatically creating or editing designs, all aspects of a design are subject to change whether colors, fonts or element position. In addition a data source can be used to update dynamic elements of the design.  Variable data printing refers specifically to using data to create variations of a specific design template. The designs thus created are then further processed in a down-stream printing workflow producing physical prints.

### Can I implement roles and permissions using the SDK?

While there is no functionality included with theÂ editor that allows implementing roles and permissions you can use any backend technology or framework to control access to the editor.

# How Halio.ai Creates 30 Days Of Content In 30 Minutes with IMG.LY

Discover how Halio streamlined social media content creation with IMG.LYâs CreativeEditor SDK, enabling financial advisors to effortlessly generate branded assets and scale their online presence.

*March 20, 2025*

*min read*

#### On this Page

At IMG.LY, we love to see how our SDK looks out in the wild. Recently, our team sat down with Mark Lamb to take a closer peek at the world of social media management. Mark is the co-founder of [Halio](https://www.halio.ai/) (previously Sisoma), an up-and-coming social media management company that has been utilizing CreativeEditor SDK to help their clients easily create and generate assets.

Halio is a UK-based company that initially provided support to financial advisors. Over time, Halio expanded its services to include social media management, catering to the growing demand among financial advisors for a more efficient content creation process. The company has transformed from a manual service using tools like Canva into a sophisticated SaaS platform that leverages AI and automation to enhance the social media presence of its clients.

## The Challenge: Scalable and Customizable Content Creation

Before adopting IMG.LY, Halio faced significant challenges in creating and customizing social media content efficiently. Financial advisors needed consistent, branded content, but the manual process of creating assets was time-consuming and not feasible for scaling.

Halio developed an innovative platform designed to streamline the creation and management of social media content. The platform uses AI to generate custom content and integrates seamlessly with IMG.LYâs CreativeEditor SDK to provide a robust, user-friendly design editor.

Mark Lamb explains,

`"We needed a tool that could grow with us, and IMG.LY was the perfect fit."`

## The Solution: Integration with IMG.LY

Halio integrated IMG.LYâs CreativeEditor SDK into their platform, transforming their content creation process. The integration allowed users to customize pre-built design templates effortlessly and generate branded graphics quickly.

`"With IMG.LY, our users can easily create, edit, and schedule posts directly within our platform. The flexibility of IMG.LYâs editor has been crucial. Users can add their logos, modify text, and even change images seamlessly."`

By automating the content creation process, Halio reduced the time needed to produce social media posts from hours to minutes. The platform supports large-scale content generation, making it ideal for clients with high demands. The ability to customize templates to fit specific branding needs has been a game-changer for Halio's clients. The editorâs user-friendly interface ensures that even users with minimal design experience can create professional-quality graphics.

`"IMG.LYâs ongoing updates and new features have been invaluable. We don't have the resources to develop these features in-house, so having a partner that continuously improves the product is essential."`

## Halioâs Enhanced Workflow

The integration of IMG.LY's CreativeEditor SDK has not only improved the efficiency of Halio's content creation but also enhanced their entire workflow. Users can sign up for Halioâs platform and provide their branding details, such as logos and preferred color schemes. Using Halioâs AI-driven tool, they can then select from a variety of content ideas and themes, with the AI suggesting post ideas based on trending topics and the advisor's specific needs.

Clients choose a template within the âCreate a Postâ tool, starting from scratch or using a pre-designed template. The integration with IMG.LYâs editor allows for easy customization of graphics, including adding logos, changing images, and modifying text. Once the design is finalized, customers can schedule posts directly through Halioâs platform, with automation features ensuring that posts are published at optimal times without requiring manual intervention.

`"Our users love the fact that they can either just edit an existing template and that's it or the ones who do feel that they've got the design skills to go in and prove it. They love the design build it it's super easy and not overwhelming."`

For collaborative teams, Halio offers a review and approval workflow, allowing advisors to share drafts with team members or clients, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments using the IMG.LY editor. The platform also includes analytics tools that track the performance of social media posts, showing metrics like engagement rates and audience reach, which allows users to refine their strategies over time. Based on performance data, they can iterate on their content, and the seamless integration with IMG.LYâs editor means that new graphics can be quickly generated and updated, keeping social media feeds fresh and engaging.

## Results and Future Plans

Since integrating IMG.LY, Halio has seen a marked improvement in client satisfaction and engagement. Their clients have a reliable tool to maintain a consistent and professional social media presence, driving better results with less effort.

`"Weâre excited about future enhancements. Weâre working on incorporating video content and further automating our processes to provide even more value to our clients."`

Halioâs experience demonstrates the transformative power of the right technology. They have not only improved their operational efficiency but also positioned themselves for continued innovation and growth.

# From 15-minute slide prep to 2-minute brand-safe assets - ImageBank X + IMG.LY SDK

Learn how ImageBankâ¯X added seamless in-platform editing with IMG.LYâs SDKs, turning everyday creative tasks into quick wins.

*July 1, 2025*

*4*

*min read*

#### On this Page

### Introduction

[ImageBankâ¯X](https://imagebankx.com/) , developed by Tampereâbased Mediasignal, is a cloudânative digital asset management (DAM) platform built for marketing teams that want a tidy, selfâservice workspace rather than a heavyweight enterprise suite. Users catalogue product shots, videos, design files and consent forms, search them with AIâbased similarity filters, and share approved assets straight to tools such as Microsoftâ¯365, Sharepoint, WordPress, Shopify and PIM systems.

Everyday edits such as cropping a hero image, trimming a teaser video or applying house fonts run inside the browser via IMG.LYâs photo and video components, sparing teams from hopping to desktop software. That lightâtouch integration lets ImageBankâ¯X focus on its core roadmap, access control, metadata governance and analytics, while still giving customers the quick fixes they expect in a modern DAM.

### From Cloud Folder to Full DAM

During its early years, ImageBankâ¯X was a lightweight, cloudâbased imageâstorage solution rather than a fully fledged DAM. A full rewrite three years ago turned it into a modern DAM with roles, permissions and APIâfirst integrations. That move unlocked significant growth mostly in Finland, Norway and Sweden with the first U.S. clients now coming aboard.

`âCustomers tell us they pick ImageBank X because it feels modern and costs a fraction of the enterprise vendors,â says Sales Director Joni Heinonen. âKeeping that promise means giving them all the core tools in one login.â`

### Why IMG.LY Made Sense

IMG.LYâs SDKs landed for four practical reasons. First, they dropped into the existing React frontâend in days, not months. Second, admins could preload house fonts and fixed logo placements so users could not accidentally break brand rules. Third, the business model matched ImageBank Xâs midâmarket pricing, avoiding perâuser surprises. And finally, IMG.LYs editors felt familiar to nonâdesigners and enabled marketers to encode brand guidelines directly within the editor.

`"â¦The placement tool in the photo editor has proven to be such a useful piece of tech. Especially with consistent placement. Itâs so much easier. I can get it done in seconds, instead of spending 10 minutes trying to figure out the right placement based on the brand guidelines.â`

This is important when, as Sales Agent Beck puts it, âMarketing loves brand books and sales never reads them. The editorâs constraints are the brand book.â

### Creating Wow Moments During Demos

After the rollout, the sales narrative shifted. Heinonen notes

`âA lot of the wow moments in demos now come from the editors.â`

Prospects who might have hesitated over features they considered commodity, storage, metadata or search moved forward once they saw live editing.

On the customer side, design work sped up significantly. Beck gives a concrete example: creating branded PowerPoint slides used to take fifteen minutes in desktop software; users now finish the same task in roughly two minutes inside the DAM. Over the course of a campaign that difference runs into hours saved.

`The editors also closed a branding pain point. Because each template can lock down colours, fonts and image placement, regional teams no longer improvise their own design language. âItâs like handing them a sandbox with the rules baked in,â Beck says.`

### Build Versus Buy - A Retrospective

Looking back, management is blunt about the makeâorâbuy calculation. Heinonen says: â I do believe that itâs critical to understand that we don't necessarily have the manpower to do it ourselves..â By outsourcing the creative layer, ImageBank X engineers can keep their roadmap focused on AI, consent management and integrations with e.g. M365 and [](http://monday.com) Shopify, work that directly differentiates the DAM.

### Next on the roadmap

The company plans to add IMG.LYâs CreativeEditor SDK to bring templateâbased PDF and print design into the same single login. That shift will move ImageBank X from straightforward DAM toward full brandâasset management, putting competitors such as Papirfly and Bynder within reach.

### Closing thought

Embedding IMG.LYâs editors cost ImageBank X a few days of engineering effort and no ongoing maintenance burden. In return the platform gained faster user workflows, a stronger sales demo and a clear path into bigger, templateâdriven deals. For a midâmarket vendor that wins on simplicity and speed, that small decision continues to deliver outsized results.

# How Digitas Germany Powers 140+ Dealer Campaigns Across 10 Automotive Brands with IMG.LY

How Digitas Germany scaled 140+ dealer campaigns with IMG.LYâs SDK, automating brand-compliant assets and empowering dealers to create localized content fast.

*January 5, 2026*

*4*

*min read*

#### On this Page

Digitas Germany, a leading digital agency, built a campaign portal to streamline marketing content creation across multiple automotive brands. The goal: empower hundreds of car dealers to generate brand-compliant assets, social, print, and video without relying on external agencies.

By integrating [IMG.LY](http://IMG.LY) âs CE.SDK , Digitas delivered a customizable, multilingual, and automation-ready design experience. Within months of launch, the platform became the central hub for campaign creation, with over 140 campaigns running and with overwhelmingly positive feedback from users at every level from users.

## The Story of Digitas Germany

Digitas Germany serves major international brands with data-driven creative and marketing solutions. When one of their automotive clients sought to modernize campaign execution for its dealer network, Digitas saw an opportunity to automate a notoriously manual, expensive process.

Previously, each campaign asset such as social posts, print flyers or banners was produced by external agencies. The client wanted to reduce this dependency, unify workflows across 9â10 brands , and allow 600+ dealers to generate and personalize assets independently in German, French, and Italian .

Digitas needed a technology foundation that could enable all this while remaining intuitive, flexible, and future-proof.

## The Challenge: Manual Processes and Rising Costs

Before building out the customer platform with CE.SDK, Digitasâ clientsâ marketing workflow was fragmented and agency-dependent. Each campaign required:

The clientâs objective was to harmonize these processes and to create assets âwithin a few clicksâ while maintaining brand consistency and localization quality.

As Senior Project Manager Martin RÃ¶hr recalls:

`âThe wish by the customer was that they can do the whole assets themselves, with a minimum of manual work, to automate and harmonize processes for all brands.â`

This required not just an editing interface, but a deeply integrated, template-driven creative engine capable of variable substitution, localization, and automated asset generation.

## Why They Chose CE.SDK

During early workshops, Digitas explored building an in-house editor. But when the scope grew from text edits to full template control, multi-language support, and video, the team quickly realized they needed an existing SDK with the flexibility to scale.

After evaluating several options, Martin discovered [IMG.LY](http://IMG.LY) âs CE.SDK :

`âI saw you have an editor that you can configure for different media types, it was not a hard decision. We did the checklist, what we need, what you can do, and everything matched.â`

CE.SDKâs template engine , variable system , and server-side rendering capabilities aligned perfectly with Digitasâ requirements:

The team also valued CE.SDKâs future-readiness , with built-in support for video templating and AI-driven workflows.

## How They Implemented CE.SDK

Digitas began implementation in mid-2024, aiming for a full production launch within a year. What started as a simple proof of concept soon evolved into a full-fledged creative automation platform.

`âThere was no real plan in the beginning,â Martin admits. âWe found CE.SDK, which could solve every problem we had, videos, social media, templates, and then we figured out how to integrate it into every workflow.â`

Over the course of the project:

Despite the extended timeline, the outcome far exceeded expectations:

`âWe shipped a much better product than initially planned,â says Martin. âBuilding something like this ourselves would have taken years or ten times the budget.â`

Throughout the integration, Digitas repeatedly praised [IMG.LY](http://IMG.LY) âs customer success and support teams :

`âYou offered us your support, and our developers always got quick responsesâsometimes even hints that helped us rethink how we do things. Nothing bad to say about the whole experience.â`

## The Results

By early 2025, the campaign portal was live and fully adopted by the clientâs marketing managers and dealer network. Within weeks:

`âIn all meetings, we had no negative feedbackâabsolutely nothing. Dealers are downloading, managers are happy, and weâre already planning the next automation features.â`

The business impact was immediate: agencies were reduced or removed from the process altogether, while dealers gained full creative autonomy to produce and personalize their own assets. Campaigns that once took days to adapt across brands and languages could now be duplicated and localized within seconds , transforming both the speed and scalability of the clientâs marketing operations.

One marketing manager reportedly said:

`âI built a better-looking asset in the portal than the agency ever did.â`

## Overall Impact

The CE.SDK-powered campaign portal transformed both how Digitas delivered creative services and what their client could achieve.

A process once dependent on external agencies became an internalized, scalable creative engine âdriven by templates, variables, and automation.

For Digitas, this meant tighter client relationships, greater technical ownership, and new opportunities to apply the same model across other accounts:

`âI showed the project internally to hundreds of colleagues,â Martin said. âEveryone wants to use it for other clients. Itâs a no-brainer once you see whatâs possible.â`

The collaboration also demonstrated CE.SDKâs strength as an enabler of digital transformation ânot just for editors, but for entire creative ecosystems.

# Optimizely Unlocks Template-Based Banner & Ad Creation for 1,000+ Customers - Without Hiring Designers with IMG.LY

Learn how Optimizely saw significant improvements in key performance indicators by using the brand template editor built on IMG.LYâs SDK.

#### On this Page

We sat down with Rob Driscoll, Principal Product Manager at Optimizely, a company synonymous with A/B testing since the beginnings of web 2.0. Optimizely has evolved to offer a broader suite of tools for marketers to experiment with and personalize their websites and apps. With more than 1,000 customers, including Gap, StubHub, IBM, and The Wall Street Journal, Optimizely continues to be a leading name in the industry.

â

â

In 2020, Optimizely was acquired by Episerver, a company founded in Stockholm in 1994 that offers tools for marketers to manage their digital content. In a joint statement, they expressed: âEpiserver and Optimizely have a shared vision to optimize every customer touchpoint through the use of experimentation. Together, we will enable our customers to do more testing, in more places, with greater ease than ever before.â

## The Challenge

Optimizely had been a long-time customer of PE.SDK for image editing. However, simple image editing fell short of customer demand. Their sales team started missing out on deals because their prospects RFPs included support for templating, specifically for brand designs such as banner ads. Competitors, such as Bynder, have their own brand template editor, putting Optimizely at a disadvantage.

Rob Driscoll noted:

`âOne of the biggest things for us was that we wanted to enable our smaller customers to be able to build and use templates, people without expertise, people without design teams.â`

To address this gap, Optimizely needed to quickly implement a professional brand template editor to reach parity with competitors, while managing time and budget constraints.

## The Solution

Optimizelyâs Content Marketing Platform (CMP) is a comprehensive solution for the entire content and campaign lifecycleâfrom planning and creation to storage, distribution, and analysisâgeared towards the needs of marketing teams. One of its unique selling points is the collaborative creation and ideation process. Teams can collaborate on ideas, assign workflow steps, leave annotations and comments, and supplement content production with AI.

Once a brand template has been finalized and agreed upon by all key stakeholders, assets can be stored in Optimizelyâs DAM, a centralized repository, enabling easy reuse of brand-approved assets.

IMG.LYâs editor integrates seamlessly with this workflow. Optimizelyâs roles and permissions concept can be mapped onto CE.SDK placeholders and constraints, enabling fine-grained control over what elements of a template others can edit . This ensures more stakeholders can collaborate without compromising on brand integrity.

Rob Driscoll praised the integration process:

`âYeah, so I think it was one of the quickest projects we've worked on. Our engineers found the documentation super helpful, and anytime they needed support, they got the answers quickly. It was a super smooth process for us, and not all of our processes are super smooth.â`

## Adoption and Customer Success

For any feature to be successful, user empowerment is crucial. Optimizely promoted adoption of their brand template feature by tightly integrating it into the CMP. Users could access brand templates within the asset library and the task manager, reinforcing them as reusable design assets rather than one-off creatives.

The task manager seamlessly integrates template creation into the project planning module, assigning responsibilities for the design and deployment phases, such as adapting and approving designs for publication, into the core workflow. This ensures that users cannot overlook this feature as a hidden add-on but can instead unlock its value during their regular work processes.

The publication and adaptation workflow integrates smoothly with CE.SDK's editor rules for adopters and creators. 'Creators' have access to advanced design features and can design without constraints, while 'adopters' work within creator-defined constraints, making smaller edits and filling placeholders with content.

In addition to making the new feature easily accessible, Optimizely proactively educated customers on its best uses by providing an in-depth walk-through video and detailed documentation . Design editing can be daunting for users who are not professional designers or have not been exposed to design tools. IMG.LYâs SDK is tailored for these use cases, making design intuitive and accessible without the need for explicit training.

However, users often require the reassurance of a handbook and knowledge base when tackling specific tasks, as not everyone is comfortable exploring software capabilities through trial and error. This is where Optimizelyâs user support help center excels, offering concise yet comprehensive documentation of the core features users need. This is supported by product graphics and examples that reflect common tasks their users need to solve.

## Results

The brand template editor built on IMG.LYâs SDK led to significant improvements in key performance indicators for Optimizely. The closing rate of deals increased as the new feature met prospects' RFP requirements, and customer retention rates went up . Customers now have a library of adaptable templates, making content more reusable and reducing the need for design team intervention.

Optimizelyâs success with the CreativeEditor SDK is a testament to their understanding of their product and customer needs. Rob Driscoll echoed this sentiment:

`"I really appreciated the collaboration in helping me get it signed off internally. I was very passionate about IMG.LY because it fulfilled a crucial part of the brief that I didnât think would be feasible. This collaboration enabled us to integrate template creation into the platform, something I didn't think was possible. It was great to work collaboratively with the IMG.LY team."`

# A Complete Design-to-Print Workflow Inside 1 App - Postbuddy Powered by IMG.LY SDK

See how Postbuddy modernized direct mail marketing by integrating IMG.LYâs Editor SDK, enabling e-commerce brands to create, personalize, and automate postcard campaigns as seamlessly as email.

*March 20, 2025*

*min read*

#### On this Page

We sat down with Christian Vestergaard and Hans Christian BÃ¸ggild from Postbuddy.

Postbuddy is a Denmark-based startup seeking to modernize offline, direct mail marketing by giving e-commerce businesses a new way to reconnect with dormant customers. Unlike conventional direct mail processes, Postbuddy integrates fully with online workflows, allowing brands to automate postcards and track performance metrics in much the same way they do with email.

Co-Founder Hans Christian BÃ¸ggild explained the motivation:

`âOffline marketing lags behind because itâs not caught up with the personalizations we see in digital marketing. We wanted a way for brands to send data-driven postcardsâcomplete with the advanced targeting and A/B testing they rely on for email.â`

Postbuddy had an existing product concept that blended Shopify and other e-commerce connectors with printing and mailing operations. However, they needed an embedded design editor for users to create postcards with proper bleeds and while allowing creative automation on the backend to easily insert customer names, coupon codes, and other dynamic fields.

## Adoption and Customer Success

Postbuddyâs approach hinges on user empowerment and minimal friction. By offering a straightforward in-app editor, they aim to make direct mail accessible to ânon-technicalâ users, many of whom have limited design skills. BÃ¸ggild noted:

`âWhen customers feel even the slightest friction, they postpone or abandon direct mail campaigns. We needed to reduce friction around design by making it easy and familiarâlike creating an email or a social post.â`

Postbuddy highlights that the ability to personalize each postcard is essential for driving return on investment. They rely on variable interpolationâmail mergeâfor thousands of postcards at a time. Making these personalization features readily accessible within the editor is a cornerstone of their user experience.

They also introduced a feature for A/B testing two postcard designs within the same campaign. According to BÃ¸ggild, one customer recently saw a fourfold difference in results between a simple text-only design and a more polished layout. By giving marketers the freedom to test and iterate, Postbuddy sees increased campaign success and stronger adoption of its platform.

## The Challenge

Initially, Postbuddy evaluated several ways to offer an in-platform design experience. They considered developing a proprietary editor, but the scope was large, and ongoing maintenance would be significant. They also examined a few âweb-to-printâ solutions but found them either too rigid or too expensive.

Vestergaard and BÃ¸ggild pointed out that while most existing design tools focus on online output (e.g., social graphics), Postbuddyâs customers needed postcards conforming to strict print specifications. Adopting an external design tool would have forced Postbuddy to do substantial clean up of incoming files for printing.

`âItâs almost impossible to imagine we could have built this company without an SDK. Doing it from scratch wouldâve been a time sink, and weâd have to maintain everything ourselves. Thatâs not feasible for a startup.â`

The team also required an interface that felt fully native to Postbuddy so that customers would not sense they were using an external plug-in. They wanted tight control over colors, fonts, layout, and brand elements, plus ways to handle variable data seamlessly.

## The Solution

Postbuddy integrated the IMG.LY Editor SDK into its platform to streamline postcard design. Early on, they completed a âplug-and-playâ proof of concept, embedding the basic editor for layout creation and variable placeholders. Once the mail merge functionality was live, users could upload a CSV of recipient data and auto-generate thousands of personalized postcards.

`âWe can insert variable fields on the design, export, and merge each field on the final postcard,â Vestergaard said. âThat was crucial. Otherwise, we could have just let people design elsewhere.â`

During a second phase, Postbuddy overhauled the editorâs front-end, customizing CSS, color schemes, and additional UI elements to match their branding. The team built a small template library to guide users who are new to design. They also created a checklist overlay inside the editor to remind marketers of best practices, such as variable usage and minimal text, to enhance campaign results.

To improve user acceptance, Postbuddy integrated the editor with their workflow tools so that creating, testing, and finalizing designs happen under one roof. By aligning UI controls (like adding brand colors or controlling bleeds) with Postbuddyâs existing printing logic, the company maintained consistent, print-ready files at scale.

## Implementation Notes

BÃ¸ggild found that Postbuddyâs developers could rely on IMG.LYâs documentation, but the biggest advantage came from the responsive support channels:

`âWe could speak directly with technical people. Itâs rare to have that kind of quick help. Every time we asked a question, we got a near-immediate answer. That eliminated a lot of guesswork.â`

He especially emphasized how helpful and unique it was that engineers could ask follow-up and integrations questions in a dedicated Slack channel. Meanwhile, the Editor SDK continued to release new featuresâsuch as advanced plugin architectureâwhich Postbuddy can adopt over time to offer custom design features.

`âWe like that we can add new plugins. Every improvement you build, we can fold in easily,â BÃ¸ggild said.`

## Results

With the editor in place, Postbuddy has streamlined its operations and realized tangible benefits:

1. Reduced User Friction

Postbuddyâs customers no longer have to learn a separate design program or send PDFs back and forth. They can complete design tasks within the same app they use to plan and deploy campaigns.

2. Stronger ROI Through Personalization

Variable data fields and simple A/B testing have helped users see higher response rates in direct mail. In one instance, a text-only design significantly outperformed a polished layout, underlining the importance of experimentation.

3. Lower Maintenance Burden

Postbuddy avoided building and maintaining a fully custom editor. IMG.LYâs continuous improvements to the Editor SDK help Postbuddy stay competitive without adding technical debt.

4. Scalability Across Europe

Having solved the design and personalization pieces, Postbuddy can focus on establishing print partnerships in new regions. They have already expanded to Sweden and Norway, with plans to move into larger European markets.

`âItâs hard to imagine we could have launched Postbuddy without a design editor SDK,â BÃ¸ggild said. âCustomers want an integrated experience, and we needed to channel our limited resources into our core mission, not a custom editor.â`

## Moving Forward

Postbuddy is steadily adding new template options and exploring deeper customization of the editorâs UI, aiming to further reduce friction for less tech-savvy users. Plans also include a more dynamic plugin-based onboarding system. By leveraging IMG.LYâs ongoing product updates, Postbuddy can continue refining features that matter most to its direct mail audience.

For now, the integration with the Editor SDK supports Postbuddyâs core objective: to bring data-rich personalization to direct mail campaigns in a way that feels as straightforward as email. Through a combination of advanced functionality and steady user guidance, the platform now helps businesses of all sizes run marketing campaigns that stand out, even in a crowded digital landscape.

## Introduction

[Plai](https://plai.io/) , the AI-powered advertising platform founded by growth marketer Logan Welbaum , helps businesses of all sizes launch ads across 11 platforms with ease. From global acts like Green Day and Red Hot Chili Peppers to local service providers, Plaiâs promise is simple: fast, automated, high-performing campaigns.

When Plai sought to speed up creative production without outsourcing design, [IMG.LY](https://img.ly) âs Creative Editor SDK became the solution. Since adopting it, Plai has grown to 30,000+ creative exports per month , cut time-to-launch dramatically, and helped clients save $1,000â$10,000 per month in design costs .

â

## The Story of Plai

Logan Welbaum built his career at Meta and Google before turning his expertise to founding Plai. Known for early growth-hacking experiments on TikTok-where he built a following of 450k-Logan recognized a recurring challenge for marketers: ad creative was slow, expensive, and inconsistent.

Plaiâs mission: make ad creation as simple as typing in a prompt. Businesses paste in their website, and Plai automatically generates brand-aligned creative across multiple platforms. But to deliver on this promise, Plai needed an embedded design editor that was powerful, customizable, and seamless.

## The Challenge: Edit AI Generated Assets

While Plai already excelled at generating highly on-brand images and videos with AI, the product quickly ran into a common limitation: AI can create assets, but it canât finish them.

Even with strong generation quality, users still needed to tweak layouts, adjust text, fix proportions, refine colors, or make brand-specific edits the model couldnât reliably control. Without an integrated editing layer, they had no way to do that inside Plai.

This introduced new friction:

`Logan explains it simply: âThe most important part of an ad is what people see. Before IMG.LY, we couldnât give customers the flexibility to edit and optimize AI-generated assets quickly. That slowed them down and hurt results.â`

By integrating IMG.LY, Plai bridged that gap. Now, users can directly adjust, personalize, and finalize AI-generated creative within the same flow without the need for tool switching or sacrificing brand accuracy.

## Why Plai Chose IMG.LY

Loganâs team evaluated alternatives like Canva , but friction was a dealbreaker. Requiring users to create separate accounts or leave the Plai platform wasnât an option.

Instead, IMG.LY offered:

As Logan puts it:

`âIf youâre not a design-first company, youâll pull your hair out trying to build an editor yourself. IMG.LY already has nearly every editing function youâd need, and it feels native inside our product.â`

## How Plai Uses IMG.LY

Within Plai, the editor powers several workflows:

Importantly, Plai leads demos with the editor . Logan noted, âCustomersâ eyes light up when they see it-they know theyâd otherwise have to hire a designer or buy Canva.â

## The Results

Since adopting IMG.LYâs editor, Plai has seen measurable improvements:

As Logan summarizes:

`âFast to launch, thatâs the biggest thing. Building this ourselves wouldâve taken months. With IMG.LY, it was live in a month and now drives thousands of ad campaigns.â`

## Outlook

Looking ahead, Plai plans to deepen its creative automation, especially in video editing and AI audio . With IMG.LYâs evolving feature set, like AI sound generation and video prompting, the partnership is set to expand.

`âOur goal is simple: get clients' results. IMG.LY helps by making sure the creative-the most important part of an ad-performs at scale.â`

# Omneky: 10x Growth in 30 Days: How the Company Took Its AI Ad Engine to the Next Level with IMG.LY

Discover how Omneky leveraged IMG.LYâs Creative Editor SDK to transform the way AI-generated ads are edited, customized, and launched at scale, all while helping them focus on their core strength: building the best-performing AI for ad generation.

*June 30, 2025*

*min read*

#### On this Page

We sat together with Hikari Senju, founder and CEO of [Omneky](https://www.omneky.com/) , a rapidly growing AI-powered platform for performance advertising that turns brand assets and campaign data into creatives. Omneky empowers marketers to generate, test, and launch high-quality ads across channels like Meta, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok, to name a few, helping teams move faster while maintaining brand consistency.

As competition intensifies in the adtech and creative automation space, Omneky is standing out by combining generative AI with precise, data-informed targeting and a powerful editing layer that ensures brand control at scale.

## The Challenge

Omnekyâs platform uses campaign performance data and brand inputs to generate ad creatives automatically. However, customers still require the ability to review and adjust these assets before launch. Adjustments like editing copy, applying brand fonts, or adapting layouts for specific audiences need to happen within the same workflow as AI generation to avoid introducing delays or fragmentation.

Initially, the team faced a build-versus-buy decision. Developing a full-featured editor with support for layer manipulation, video, font controls, and brand asset integration would require significant engineering investment. This would have shifted focus away from their core product: AI-driven content generation and campaign optimization.

As CEO Hikari Senju explained,

`âIt's a lot of work to create the image video editing platform. And we just didn't want to, we wanted to focus on our core differentiation, which is really the AI component.â`

## The Solution

Omneky integrated [IMG.LYâs CE.SDK](https://img.ly/products/creative-sdk) directly into their platform to serve as the editing layer across both image and video workflows. The integration allows AI-generated creatives to be parsed into editable components such as background images, text layers, and layout elements. These, in turn, can then be customized by the end user through an intuitive interface.

This editing step is embedded within Omnekyâs existing creative approval and publishing flow. The AI generates ads based on a structured brief, informed by omnichannel performance data. These ads are automatically converted into CE.SDK-based templates, enabling teams to apply feedback or brand adjustments without restarting the process or switching tools.

`âWeâre able to generate an ad from scratch, parse it into layers, and give customers full control to customize or build variations,â Hikari explained.`

The SDK also supports additional workflows such as versioning, localization, font replacement, and brand asset management, all critical for Omnekyâs customers, especially agencies working at scale. For video content, Omneky is extending its workflow to support segmentation and layered editing using the same SDK foundation.

By offloading editing infrastructure to CE.SDK, Omneky was able to maintain its product velocity and focus on its core AI and analytics capabilities while providing users with a stable, high-performance editing experience fully embedded in their existing tools.

## Adoption and Customer Success

Before the integration, creative revisions often required manual intervention or external design tools, introducing friction into the customer workflow. Now, with CE.SDK embedded directly into Omnekyâs platform, users can edit messaging, adapt visuals for a regional campaign, or apply last-minute feedback to AI-generated creatives in one place.

This improved creative control has made Omnekyâs workflow more efficient, especially for agencies that require an approval loop. Comments and feedback can be addressed within the same editing interface, eliminating the need to pass files between teams or re-export creatives.

Hikari Senju shared,

`"We are seeing the real breakthrough over the past couple of months, it's quite a hockey stick growth. We saw a 10x increase in new signups month over month in May, that was the fact that you can now auto-generate really beautiful looking ads from scratch with our technology and that level of quality was not there previously."`

The SDKâs support for text placeholders, font matching, and visual consistency has also helped Omneky maintain brand integrity at scale. Customers gain flexibility without sacrificing quality, which is an essential requirement in performance-driven campaigns.

## Results

Integrating CE.SDK allowed Omneky to streamline the entire ad lifecycle, from AI-powered generation to final deployment. With a single tool handling both creation and customization, Omneky reduced time-to-publish across platforms, simplified QA and review processes, and enabled non-designers to make meaningful creative updates.

Hikari said,

`âThe partnership with IMG.LY lets us focus on building the best AI, the best data-driven engine, the best advertising integrations,Â  and the best ad generation. And then we can sleep easily that the image editing and video editing portions of the platform are well taken care of and well supported on the IMG.LY side. It's a partnership that we continue to be excited about growing and scaling.â`

The decision to integrate rather than build also reduced internal development overhead. Omneky did not need to allocate engineering resources to build and maintain a high-performance editor, especially one with evolving requirements around video support, layered design, and brand control.

`"Thereâs a kind of network effect in working with IMG.LYâ¦ feedback from other companies helps improve the product for us, too."`

The partnership has proven particularly effective in keeping Omnekyâs editor up-to-date. As IMG.LY improves CE.SDK, whether through performance enhancements, [new AI tools](https://img.ly/use-cases/ai-editor) , or expanded media support, Omneky benefits automatically.

## Looking Ahead

Omneky continues to expand its feature set on top of the CE.SDK foundation. One current focus is adapting the same editing precision used for static images to video workflows like segmenting AI-generated videos into editable components. The goal is to offer customers the same level of control for motion content as they have today for image-based ads.

The team is also exploring new AI capabilities, such as multimodal prompt composition and visual prompting within the editor itself, which could further shorten the time from idea to execution.

`"Weâre confident enough in our product that we offer a free 7-day trial. That wouldnât be possible if we didnât have a seamless experience across both AI generation and creative editing." Said Hikari Senju.`

With IMG.LYâs SDK embedded in their workflow, Omneky is able to deliver a unified, end-to-end ad creation experience that balances automation with creative control, helping customers launch better-performing campaigns, faster.

## What Our Clients Say About Us

Integrating IMG.LYâs editor meant we didnât have to build or maintain a complex editing layer ourselves. That kept our team focused on our core AI ad engine and saved us countless development hours â while still giving our customers the ability to polish and customize creatives at scale.

Hikari Senju@CEO@Omneky

With IMG.LY we built a central creative portal that now powers over 140 dealer campaigns across multiple automotive brands. Before this, asset creation was slow and inconsistent. IMG.LY gave us the scale and flexibility we needed to grow.

Martin RÃ¶hr@Product Owner@Digitas

By embedding IMG.LYâs editor we were able to hit key RFP requirements and deliver a template-based creative experience that now serves 1,000+ customers. It helped us win more deals and exceed enterprise expectations without needing to hire dedicated design teams.

Rob Driscoll@Director of PM@Optimizely

Since integrating IMG.LYâs editor, we now deliver 30,000+ ad creatives per month dramatically shorten time-to-launch, and help our clients cut design spend by up to $10,000 per month.This capability has been essential to delivering on our promise of fast, scalable creative production.

Logan Welbaum@Founder@Plai

IMG.LYâs solution engineers did a deep dive on our business case and helped us implement a custom print kiosk UI.

AndrÃ© Albrecht@Digital Solution Manager@Brother

Our customers create over a million personalized postcards each year choosing from over hundreds of templates with IMG.LYâs SDK. Itâs the only solution that allows us to build our own specialized, on-brand UI that integrates seamlessly with our platform.

Jeanine Zaalberg@Product Manager@Swiss Post

Our app has photo-editing at the very core of its experience and the editor has been invaluable in making that vision happen. There are no other tools on the market up to the quality of PE.SDK.

Toby Green@Lead Developer@Elbi

From a developerâs perspective, the most powerful feature of the photo editor is the integration process. It was completely flawless, quick, and easy to integrate.

Stefano Fornari@CTO@Funambol/Zefiro

Our developers loved that the integration was really straightforward and that everything you need like APIs and documentation is easy to find and of excellent quality.

Thomas Witt@Head of Product@Infopark

I believe that it is one of the easiest to use and most powerful editors on the market and the integration possibilities into our solution are awesome.

## What Our Clients Say About Us

Integrating IMG.LYâs editor meant we didnât have to build or maintain a complex editing layer ourselves. That kept our team focused on our core AI ad engine and saved us countless development hours â while still giving our customers the ability to polish and customize creatives at scale.

Hikari Senju@CEO@Omneky

With IMG.LY we built a central creative portal that now powers over 140 dealer campaigns across multiple automotive brands. Before this, asset creation was slow and inconsistent. IMG.LY gave us the scale and flexibility we needed to grow.

Martin RÃ¶hr@Product Owner@Digitas

By embedding IMG.LYâs editor we were able to hit key RFP requirements and deliver a template-based creative experience that now serves 1,000+ customers. It helped us win more deals and exceed enterprise expectations without needing to hire dedicated design teams.

Rob Driscoll@Director of PM@Optimizely

Since integrating IMG.LYâs editor, we now deliver 30,000+ ad creatives per month dramatically shorten time-to-launch, and help our clients cut design spend by up to $10,000 per month.This capability has been essential to delivering on our promise of fast, scalable creative production.

Jeanine Zaalberg@Product Manager@Swiss Post

Our app has photo-editing at the very core of its experience and the editor has been invaluable in making that vision happen. There are no other tools on the market up to the quality of PE.SDK.

Toby Green@Lead Developer@Elbi

From a developerâs perspective, the most powerful feature of the photo editor is the integration process. It was completely flawless, quick, and easy to integrate.

Stefano Fornari@CTO@Funambol/Zefiro

Our developers loved that the integration was really straightforward and that everything you need like APIs and documentation is easy to find and of excellent quality.

Thomas Witt@Head of Product@Infopark

I believe that it is one of the easiest to use and most powerful editors on the market and the integration possibilities into our solution are awesome.
