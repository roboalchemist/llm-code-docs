## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

### Development Environment

- **Flutter SDK**: 3.16.0 or later
- **Dart SDK**: 2.12.0 or later
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter extensions
- **Git CLI** for version control

### Platform Requirements

- **iOS**: 16.0+ (Xcode 26.0.1+, Swift 6.2+)
- **Android**: 7.0+ (API level 24+)

### License

- A valid **CE.SDK license key** ([Get a free trial](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial)), pass `null` to run in evaluation mode with watermark.

### Verify Your Setup

Run the following command to verify your Flutter installation:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your Flutter installation and reports any issues to resolve before proceeding.

> **Note:** You can customize the CreativeEditor SDK for Flutter exclusively through
> native code (Swift/Kotlin), as described in the
> [configuration overview section](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/flutter/user-interface/customization-72b2f8/).

## Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project

First, verify your Flutter installation and version:

```bash
flutter --version
```

Start by creating a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI:

```bash
flutter create cesdk_flutter_app
cd cesdk_flutter_app
```

### Project Creation Options

You can customize your project creation with common options:

```bash
# For specific platforms only
flutter create --platforms=ios,android cesdk_flutter_app

# With a specific organization identifier
flutter create --org com.example cesdk_flutter_app

# With a specific template
flutter create --template=app cesdk_flutter_app
```

This creates a new Flutter project with the following structure:

```
cesdk_flutter_app/
├── android/              # Android-specific configuration
├── ios/                  # iOS-specific configuration
├── lib/                  # Dart source code
│   └── main.dart         # Main application entry point
├── test/                 # Unit and widget tests
├── pubspec.yaml          # Project dependencies and configuration
├── pubspec.lock          # Locked versions of dependencies
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
```

### Initial Project Setup

After creating and entering the project, run these commands to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the project to verify setup
flutter run
```

<ImageContainer image="flutter-project-structure.png" />

## Step 2: Add the CreativeEditor SDK Dependency

Add the CreativeEditor SDK to your project by updating the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  imgly_editor: ^1.53.0
```

Alternatively, you can add the dependency using the Flutter CLI:

```bash
flutter pub add imgly_editor
```

Then run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

> **Note**: The `flutter pub get` command downloads and installs all dependencies specified in your `pubspec.yaml` file. This is required whenever you add new dependencies or when you first clone a project.

### Troubleshooting Dependency Issues

If you encounter dependency conflicts or installation issues:

```bash
# For verbose output to debug issues
flutter pub get --verbose

# Clean and reinstall dependencies
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Check for newer versions of dependencies
flutter pub outdated
```

> **Important**: Some SDKs require additional platform-specific configuration. After adding `imgly_editor`, you may need to configure iOS and Android settings as outlined in the platform-specific sections below.

<ImageContainer image="pubspec-dependencies.png" />

## Step 3: Configure Android Platform

The CreativeEditor SDK requires specific Android configuration. Follow these steps to ensure proper integration:

### 3.1 Update Minimum SDK Version

Open `android/app/build.gradle.kts` and set the `minSdk` to at least 24:

```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.example.cesdk_flutter_app"
    compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"  // Required for CE.SDK

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId = "com.example.cesdk_flutter_app"
        minSdk = 24  // Required for CE.SDK
        targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion
        versionCode = flutter.versionCode
        versionName = flutter.versionName
    }
}
```

> **Note**: The `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions` ensure compatibility with the CreativeEditor SDK and prevent common build issues.

<ImageContainer image="android-minsdk-config.png" />

### 3.2 Add IMG.LY Maven Repository

Open `android/build.gradle.kts` and add the IMG.LY maven repository:

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://artifactory.img.ly/artifactory/maven") }
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://artifactory.img.ly/artifactory/maven") }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: The Maven URL is correct and complete. This repository contains the CreativeEditor SDK dependencies for Android.

<ImageContainer image="maven-repository-config.png" />

### 3.3 Update Kotlin Version

Open `android/settings.gradle.kts` and ensure the Kotlin version is at least 1.9.10:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

plugins {
id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "1.9.10" apply false
    // Note: Ensure this Kotlin version is compatible with your Flutter version
}
```

> **Note**: The Kotlin version must be compatible with your Flutter version. Version 1.9.10 is recommended for recent Flutter releases.

<ImageContainer image="kotlin-version-config.png" />

### 3.4 Verify Android Configuration

After making changes to your Android configuration, verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# Navigate to the Android directory
cd android

# Clean and build the project
./gradlew clean
```

If you encounter any build issues, check that:

- All Maven repositories are accessible
- The Kotlin version is compatible with your Flutter version
- The minimum SDK version is set to 24 or higher

> **Note**: You may see a warning about NDK version mismatch. If so, update the `ndkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to `"27.0.12077973"` as shown in the configuration above.

### 3.5 ProGuard Rules (Optional)

If you're using ProGuard for release builds, add these rules to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```proguard
# CreativeEditor SDK ProGuard rules
-keep class ly.img.** { *; }
-keep class com.example.cesdk_flutter_app.** { *; }
```

## Step 4: Configure iOS Platform

The iOS configuration requires minimal setup for the CreativeEditor SDK:

### 4.1 Update iOS Deployment Target

Open `ios/Podfile` and ensure the iOS deployment target is set to 16.0 or later:

```ruby
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '16.0'
```

### 4.2 Update iOS Project Settings

The easiest way to configure iOS settings is through Xcode:

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select the Runner project
3. In the General tab, set "Minimum Deployments" to iOS 16.0

Alternatively, you can update `ios/Flutter/AppFrameworkInfo.plist`:

```xml
<key>MinimumOSVersion</key>
<string>16.0</string>
```

### 4.3 Add Required Permissions

The CreativeEditor SDK may require certain permissions depending on which features you use. Add the relevant permissions to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to take photos for editing</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for video recording and voiceovers</string>

<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to import images for editing</string>
```

Note: The photo library permission is optional. By default, CE.SDK uses the system photos picker which doesn't require permissions. Only add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` if you explicitly enable full photo library access using `PhotoRollAssetSource(engine: engine, mode: .fullLibraryAccess)` in your iOS code.

### 4.4 Swift Support (Required)

The CreativeEditor SDK requires Swift support. If your project doesn't have Swift files, create a bridging header:

```bash
# Create a Swift bridging header if the project doesn't have one
touch ios/Runner/Runner-Bridging-Header.h
```

### 4.5 Verify iOS Configuration

After making changes, verify your iOS setup:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
flutter clean
flutter run --release
```

> **Note**: The CreativeEditor SDK for Flutter requires camera, microphone, and photo library permissions along with Swift support. These are essential for the editor to function properly.

## Step 5: Implement the Creative Editor

Now let's implement the CreativeEditor SDK in your Flutter application:

### 5.1 Create Configuration File

First, create a secure configuration file for your license key. Create `lib/secrets/secrets.dart`:

```dart
class Secrets {
  // License key will be provided via environment variable
  static const String license =
      String.fromEnvironment("SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER", defaultValue: "");
}
```

> **Important**: Add `lib/secrets/secrets.dart` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your license key to version control.

Add this line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
lib/secrets/secrets.dart
```

### Setting Your License Key

Always pass your license key as an environment variable when running your app:

```bash
# For development
flutter run --dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=your_actual_license_key_here
# Example: flutter run --dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=1eleI20eS2ot6_GzA22CKighDuOlXVZs-8oQAdqawTSQb-hBTsGNeRNyglfFJvJ2

# For release builds
flutter build apk --dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=your_actual_license_key_here
flutter build ios --dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=your_actual_license_key_here
```

> **Security Best Practice**: Never include license keys in your source code, even in files excluded from version control. Always use environment variables or secure key management systems.

### 5.2 Create the Editor Service

Create a new file `lib/services/editor_service.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:imgly_editor/imgly_editor.dart';
import '../secrets/secrets.dart';

class EditorService {
  /// Opens the CreativeEditor with basic configuration
  static Future<void> openEditor() async {
    try {
      // Validate license key
      if (Secrets.license.isEmpty) {
        throw Exception('Please set your IMG.LY license key using --dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=your_key');
      }

            final settings = EditorSettings(
        license: Secrets.license, // pass null for evaluation mode with watermark
        userId: "YOUR_USER_ID"
      );
      final result = await IMGLYEditor.openEditor(
          preset: EditorPreset.design, settings: settings);

      if (result != null) {
        print('Editor completed successfully');
        // Process the result based on your needs
        // result contains the edited content that you can save or upload
      } else {
        print('Editor was cancelled');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      print('Error opening editor: $error');
      rethrow;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Update the Main Application

Update your `lib/main.dart` file to include a button that launches the editor:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cesdk_flutter_app/services/editor_service.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'CE.SDK Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'CE.SDK Flutter Demo'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _mounted = true;

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _mounted = false;
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text(
              'Welcome to CE.SDK Flutter Integration',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 20),
            const Text(
              'Tap the button below to open the Creative Editor',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 30),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () async {
                try {
                  await EditorService.openEditor();
                } catch (error) {
                  if (_mounted) {
                    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                      SnackBar(
                        content: Text('Failed to open editor: ${error.toString()}'),
                        backgroundColor: Colors.red,
                      ),
                    );
                  }
                }
              },
              style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 30, vertical: 15),
              ),
              child: const Text(
                'Open Creative Editor',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Dependency Resolution Errors

**Error:**

```
Because cesdk_flutter_app depends on imgly_editor x.xx.x which doesn't match any versions, version solving failed.
```

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you're using a valid version of the CreativeEditor SDK. Check the latest version in the [pub.dev registry](https://pub.dev/packages/imgly_editor).
2. Run `flutter pub get` to refresh dependencies.
3. Check your internet connection and try again.

#### 2. Android Build Errors

**Error:**

```
minSdk (API level 21) < 24
```

**Solution:** Update your `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to set `minSdk = 24`.

#### 3. iOS Build Errors

**Error:**

```
iOS deployment target '12.0' is less than the minimum deployment target '16.0'
```

**Solution:** Update your `ios/Podfile` to set `platform :ios, '16.0'`.

#### 4. License Key Errors

**Error:**

```
Invalid license key
```

**Solution:**

1. Ensure you have a valid license key from [IMG.LY](https://img.ly/forms/free-trial) (or pass `null` for evaluation mode with watermark).
2. Verify the license key is correctly configured in your `lib/secrets/secrets.dart` file.
3. Check that the license key is for the correct platform (Flutter).
4. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the license key.
5. Make sure you're passing the license key with `--dart-define=SHOWCASES_LICENSE_FLUTTER=your_key`.
