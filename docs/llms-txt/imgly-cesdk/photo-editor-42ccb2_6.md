Rich image and editing experiences can be created directly within your React
Native applications with the help of the React Native Mobile Image Editor SDK.

React Native, with its ability to create cross-platform applications from a single codebase, is a perfect match for IMG.LY's CreativeEditor SDK. Whether your app targets social media, marketing, or eCommerce, implementing a image editor gives users a creative tool set and improves the whole experience.

## What is the Photo Editor Solution?

The Photo Editor is a fully customizable CE.SDK configuration focused on photo-centric use cases. It strips down the editor interface to include only the most relevant features for image adjustments — giving users a focused and responsive experience. Whether your users need to fine-tune selfies, prepare product photos, or create profile images, this solution makes it easy.

Get a powerful photo editor into your app with minimal setup. The Photo Editor runs entirely client-side — which helps reduce cloud computing costs and improve privacy.

## Supported Platforms

Using a common graphics engine for both iOS and Android, React Native guarantees smooth performance on both of these platforms. This ensures uniform rendering across all platforms, compatible designs, and consistent functionality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your environment satisfies the following requirements

- React Native: 0.73+
- iOS: 16+
- Swift: 6.2 (Xcode 26.0.1)
- Android: 7+

Add the `@imgly/editor-react-native` package to your project to get started.

## Supported File Types

The SDK supports various image formats for loading, editing, and exporting within your React Native application.

### Importing Media

### Exporting Media

### Importing Templates

For detailed information, see the [full file format support list](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/file-format-support-3c4b2a/).

## Understanding CE.SDK Architecture & API

The following sections provide an overview of the key components of the CE.SDK photo editor UI and its API architecture.

If you're ready to start integrating CE.SDK into your React Native application, check out our Implementation Guide.

### CreativeEditor SDK Mobile Photo UI

The CE.SDK photo editor UI is a streamlined configuration of the CreativeEditor SDK, focusing on essential photo editing features. This configuration is fully customizable, allowing developers to adjust the UI and functionality to suit different use cases. Key components include:

- **Canvas:** The primary workspace where users interact with their photo content.
- **Inspector Bar:** Offers tools for adjusting properties like size, position, and effects for selected elements.
- **Asset Library:** A collection of media resources available for use within the photo editor, including images and stickers.

Learn more about interacting with and customizing the photo editor UI in our design editor UI guide.

### CreativeEngine

At the heart of CE.SDK is the CreativeEngine, which powers all rendering and photo manipulation tasks. It can be used in headless mode or in combination with the CreativeEditor UI. Key features and APIs provided by CreativeEngine include:

- **Scene Management:** Create, load, save,
  and manipulate photo scenes programmatically.
- **Block Management:** Manage images, text,
  and other elements within the photo editor.
- **Asset Management:** Integrate and manage
  photo and image assets from various sources.
- **Variable Management:** Define and
  manipulate variables for dynamic content within photo scenes.
- **Event Handling:** Subscribe to events
  like image selection changes or editing actions for dynamic interaction.

## Customizing the React Native Mobile Image Editor

CE.SDK provides extensive [customization options](https://img.ly/docs/cesdk/react-native/user-interface-5a089a/), allowing you to tailor the UI and functionality to meet your specific needs. This can range from basic configuration settings to more advanced customizations involving callbacks and custom elements.

### Basic Customizations

Configure the editor by passing a configuration object during initialization:

```typescript
const settings = new EditorSettingsModel({
  license: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
  userId: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
});
```
