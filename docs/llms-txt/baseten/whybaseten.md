## Mission-critical inference

Built for high-performance workloads, our platform optimizes inference performance across modalities, from state-of-the-art transcription to blazing-fast LLMs.
Built-in autoscaling, model performance optimizations, and deep observability tools ensure efficiency without complexity.
Trusted by top ML teams serving their products to millions of users, Baseten accelerates time to market for AI-driven products by building on four key pillars of inference: performance, infrastructure, tooling, and expertise.

#### Model performance

Baseten’s model performance engineers apply the latest research and custom engine optimizations in production, so you get low latency and high throughput out of the box.
Production-grade support for critical features, like speculative decoding and LoRA swapping, is baked into our platform.

#### Cloud-native infrastructure

[Deploy](/deployment/concepts) and [scale models](/deployment/autoscaling) across clusters, regions, and clouds with five nines reliability.
We built all the orchestration and optimized the network routing to ensure global scalability without the operational complexity.

#### Model management tooling

Love your development ecosystem, with deep [observability](/observability/metrics) and easy-to-use tools for deploying, managing, and iterating on models in production.
Quickly serve open-source and custom models, ultra-low-latency compound AI systems, and custom Docker servers in our cloud or yours.

#### Forward deployed engineering

Baseten’s expert engineers work as an extension of your team, customizing deployments for your target performance, quality, and cost-efficiency metrics.
Get hands-on support with deep inference-specific expertise and 24/7 on-call availability.

#### Model training and finetuning, all in one platform

Baseten Training provides a fast, scalable, and flexible platform for training and finetuning models. Deploy checkpoints immediately with the click of a button
to run end to end evals and seemlessly launch to prod.
