# Rate limits and budgets

> Rate limits and usage budgets for Model APIs

Baseten enforces two rate limits to ensure fair use and system stability:

* **Request rate limits**: Maximum API requests per minute.
* **Token rate limits**: Maximum tokens processed per minute (input + output combined).

Default limits vary by account status.

| Account                |                                         RPM |                                         TPM |

<Warning>
  If you exceed these limits, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

## Set budgets

Budgets let you control Model API usage and avoid unexpected costs. Budgets apply only to Model APIs, not dedicated deployments. Your team receives email notifications at 75%, 90%, and 100% of budget.

### Enforce budgets

Budgets can be enforced or non-enforced:

* **Enforced**: Requests are rejected when the budget is reached.
* **Not enforced**: You receive notifications but remain responsible for costs over the budget.
