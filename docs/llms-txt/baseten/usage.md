# Billing and usage

> Manage payments and track overall Baseten usage

The [billing and usage dashboard](https://app.baseten.co/settings/billing) provides a breakdown of model usage and costs, updated hourly. Usage is tracked per deployment, and any available credits are automatically applied to your bill.

## Billing

### Credits

* New workspaces receive free credits for testing and deployment.
* If credits run out and no payment method is set, models will be deactivated until a payment method is added.

### Payment method

* Payment details can be added or updated on the [billing page](https://app.baseten.co/settings/billing).
* Payment information is securely stored with our payment processor, not Baseten.

On the [billing page](https://app.baseten.co/settings/billing), you can set and update your payment method. Your payment information, including credit card numbers and bank information, is always stored securely with our payments processor and not by Baseten directly.

### Invoice history

* View past invoices and payments in the billing dashboard.
