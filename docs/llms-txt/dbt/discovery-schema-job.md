# Job object schema

The job object allows you to query information about a particular model based on `jobId` and, optionally, a `runId`.

If you don't provide a `runId`, the API returns information on the latest runId of a job.

The [example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query in this `job` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to see the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Example Query[​](#example-query "Direct link to Example Query")

You can use your production job's `id`.

  job(id: 940) {
    # Get all models from this job's latest run
    models(schema: "analytics") {
      uniqueId
      executionTime
    }

    # Or query a single node
    source(uniqueId: "source.jaffle_shop.snowplow.event") {
      uniqueId
      sourceName
      name
      state
      maxLoadedAt
