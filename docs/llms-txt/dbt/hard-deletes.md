## Description[​](#description "Direct link to Description")

The `hard_deletes` config gives you more control on how to handle deleted rows from the source. Supported options are `ignore` (default), `invalidate` (replaces the legacy `invalidate_hard_deletes=true`), and `new_record`. Note that `new_record` will create a new metadata column in the snapshot table.

You can use `hard_deletes` with dbt-postgres, dbt-bigquery, dbt-snowflake, and dbt-redshift adapters.

 When to use the hard\_deletes and invalidate\_hard\_deletes config?

**Use `invalidate_hard_deletes` (v1.8 and earlier) if:**

* Gaps in the snapshot history (missing records for deleted rows) are acceptable.
* You want to invalidate deleted rows by setting their `dbt_valid_to` timestamp to the current time (implicit delete).
* You are working with smaller datasets where tracking deletions as a separate state is unnecessary.

**Use `hard_deletes: new_record` (v1.9 and higher) if:**

* You want to maintain continuous snapshot history without gaps.
* You want to explicitly track deletions by adding new rows with a `dbt_is_deleted` column (explicit delete).
* You are working with larger datasets where explicitly tracking deleted records improves data lineage clarity.

warning

If you're updating an existing snapshot to use the `hard_deletes` config, dbt *will not* handle migrations automatically. We recommend either only using these settings for net-new snapshots, or [arranging an update](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/snapshot-configs.md#snapshot-configuration-migration) of pre-existing tables before enabling this setting.

## Default[​](#default "Direct link to Default")

By default, if you don’t specify `hard_deletes`, it'll automatically default to `ignore`. Deleted rows will not be tracked and their `dbt_valid_to` column remains `NULL`.

The `hard_deletes` config has three methods:

| Methods            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ignore` (default) | No action for deleted records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `invalidate`       | Behaves the same as the existing `invalidate_hard_deletes=true`, where deleted records are invalidated by setting `dbt_valid_to` to current time. This method replaces the `invalidate_hard_deletes` config to give you more control on how to handle deleted rows from the source. |
| `new_record`       | Tracks deleted records as new rows using the `dbt_is_deleted` meta field when records are deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Considerations[​](#considerations "Direct link to Considerations")

* **Backward compatibility**: The `invalidate_hard_deletes` config is still supported for existing snapshots but can't be used alongside `hard_deletes`.
* **New snapshots**: For new snapshots, we recommend using `hard_deletes` instead of `invalidate_hard_deletes`.
* **Migration**: If you switch an existing snapshot to use `hard_deletes` without migrating your data, you may encounter inconsistent or incorrect results, such as a mix of old and new data formats.

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

snapshots/schema.yml

```yaml
snapshots:
  - name: my_snapshot
    config:
      hard_deletes: new_record  # options are: 'ignore', 'invalidate', or 'new_record'
      strategy: timestamp
      updated_at: updated_at
    columns:
      - name: dbt_valid_from
        description: Timestamp when the record became valid.
      - name: dbt_valid_to
        description: Timestamp when the record stopped being valid.
      - name: dbt_is_deleted
        description: Indicates whether the record was deleted.
```

The resulting snapshot table contains the `hard_deletes: new_record` configuration. If a record is deleted and later restored, the resulting snapshot table might look like this:

| id | dbt\_scd\_id         | Status  | dbt\_updated\_at | dbt\_valid\_from | dbt\_valid\_to | dbt\_is\_deleted |
| -- | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1  | 60a1f1dbdf899a4dd... | pending | 2024-10-02 ...   | 2024-05-19...    | 2024-05-20 ... | False            |
| 1  | b1885d098f8bcff51... | pending | 2024-10-02 ...   | 2024-05-20 ...   | 2024-06-03 ... | True             |
| 1  | b1885d098f8bcff53... | shipped | 2024-10-02 ...   | 2024-06-03 ...   |                | False            |
| 2  | b1885d098f8bcff55... | active  | 2024-10-02 ...   | 2024-05-19 ...   |                | False            |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

In this example, the `dbt_is_deleted` column is set to `True` when the record is deleted. When the record is restored, the `dbt_is_deleted` column is set to `False`.
