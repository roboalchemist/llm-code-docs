# asset-paths

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
asset-paths: [directorypath]
```

## Definition[​](#definition "Direct link to Definition")

Optionally specify a custom list of directories to copy to the `target` directory as part of the `docs generate` command. This is useful for rendering images in your repository in your project documentation.

## Default[​](#default "Direct link to Default")

By default, dbt will not copy any additional files as part of docs generate. For example, `asset-paths: []`.

<!-- -->

Paths specified in `asset-paths` must be relative to the location of your `dbt_project.yml` file. Avoid using absolute paths like `/Users/username/project/assets`, as it will lead to unexpected behavior and outcomes.

* ✅ **Do**

  * Use relative path:

    <!-- -->

    ```yml
    asset-paths: ["assets"]
    ```

* ❌ **Don't**

  * Avoid absolute paths:

    <!-- -->

    ```yml
    asset-paths: ["/Users/username/project/assets"]
    ```

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Compile files in the `assets` subdirectory as part of `docs generate`[​](#compile-files-in-the-assets-subdirectory-as-part-of-docs-generate "Direct link to compile-files-in-the-assets-subdirectory-as-part-of-docs-generate")

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
asset-paths: ["assets"]
```

Any files included in this directory will be copied to the `target/` directory as part of `dbt docs generate`, making them accessible as images in your project documentation.
