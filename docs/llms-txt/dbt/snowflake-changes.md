## The `enable_truthy_nulls_equals_macro` flag[​](#the-enable_truthy_nulls_equals_macro-flag "Direct link to the-enable_truthy_nulls_equals_macro-flag")

The `enable_truthy_nulls_equals_macro` flag is `False` by default. Setting it to `True` in your `dbt_project.yml` file enables null-safe equality on the dbt equals macro, which is used in the incremental and snapshot materializations.

For example, when you compare NULL using `=` without the flag, it doesn't return `TRUE`, even when comparing `NULL = NULL`. Making it null safe allows for proper comparisons with `NULL`. If both values are `NULL`, it evaluates to `TRUE` instead of `UNKNOWN`.
