## Installing <!-- -->dbt-rockset

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-rockset`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-rockset<!-- -->

## Connecting to Rockset with **dbt-rockset**[​](#connecting-to-rockset-with-dbt-rockset "Direct link to connecting-to-rockset-with-dbt-rockset")

The dbt profile for Rockset is very simple and contains the following fields:

profiles.yml

```yaml
rockset:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: rockset
      workspace: [schema]
      api_key: [api_key]
      api_server: [api_server] # (Default is api.rs2.usw2.rockset.com)
```

## Caveats[​](#caveats "Direct link to Caveats")

1. `unique_key` is not supported with incremental, unless it is set to [\_id](https://rockset.com/docs/special-fields/#the-_id-field), which acts as a natural `unique_key` in Rockset anyway.
2. The `table` materialization is slower in Rockset than most due to Rockset's architecture as a low-latency, real-time database. Creating new collections requires provisioning hot storage to index and serve fresh data, which takes about a minute.
3. Rockset queries have a two-minute timeout. Any model which runs a query that takes longer to execute than two minutes will fail.
