## Installing <!-- -->dbt-cratedb2

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-cratedb2`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-cratedb2<!-- -->

For <!-- -->CrateDB<!-- -->-specific configuration, please refer to [CrateDB<!-- --> configs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/no-configs.md)

[CrateDB](https://cratedb.com/database) is compatible with PostgreSQL, so its dbt adapter strongly depends on dbt-postgres, documented at [PostgreSQL profile setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/postgres-setup).

CrateDB targets are configured exactly the same way, see also [PostgreSQL configuration](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/postgres-configs), with just a few things to consider which are special to CrateDB. Relevant details are outlined at [using dbt with CrateDB](https://cratedb.com/docs/guide/integrate/dbt/), which also includes up-to-date information.

## Profile configuration[​](#profile-configuration "Direct link to Profile configuration")

CrateDB targets should be set up using a configuration like this minimal sample of settings in your [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml) file.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
cratedb_analytics:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: cratedb
      host: [clustername].aks1.westeurope.azure.cratedb.net
      port: 5432
      user: [username]
      pass: [password]
      dbname: crate         # Do not change this value. CrateDB's only catalog is `crate`.
      schema: doc           # Define the schema name. CrateDB's default schema is `doc`.
```
