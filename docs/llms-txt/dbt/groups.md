# Add groups to your DAG

A group is a collection of nodes within a dbt DAG. Groups are named, and every group has an `owner`. They enable intentional collaboration within and across teams by restricting [access to private](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/access.md) models.

Group members may include models, tests, seeds, snapshots, analyses, and metrics. (Not included: sources and exposures.) Each node may belong to only one group.

### Declaring a group[​](#declaring-a-group "Direct link to Declaring a group")

<!-- -->

Groups are defined in `.yml` files, nested under a `groups:` key.

#### Centrally defining a group[​](#centrally-defining-a-group "Direct link to Centrally defining a group")

To centrally define a group in your project, there are two options:

* Create one `_groups.yml` file in the root of the `models` directory.

* Create one `_groups.yml` file in the root of a `groups` directory. For this option, you also need to configure [`model-paths`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/model-paths.md) in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

  ```yml
  model-paths: ["models", "groups"]
  ```

### Adding a model to a group[​](#adding-a-model-to-a-group "Direct link to Adding a model to a group")

Use the `group` configuration to add one or more models to a group.

* Project-level
* Model-level
* In-file

dbt\_project.yml

```yml
models:
  marts:
    finance:
      +group: finance
```

models/schema.yml

```yml
models:
  - name: model_name
    config:
      group: finance
```

models/model\_name.sql

```sql
{{ config(group = 'finance') }}

select ...
```

### Referencing a model in a group[​](#referencing-a-model-in-a-group "Direct link to Referencing a model in a group")

By default, all models within a group have the `protected` [access modifier](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/access.md). This means they can be referenced by downstream resources in *any* group in the same project, using the [`ref`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref.md) function. If a grouped model's `access` property is set to `private`, only resources within its group can reference it.

models/schema.yml

```yml
models:
  - name: finance_private_model
    config:
      access: private # changed to config in v1.10
      group: finance

  # in a different group!
  - name: marketing_model
    config:
      group: marketing
```

models/marketing\_model.sql

```sql
select * from {{ ref('finance_private_model') }}
```

```shell
$ dbt run -s marketing_model
...
dbt.exceptions.DbtReferenceError: Parsing Error
  Node model.jaffle_shop.marketing_model attempted to reference node model.jaffle_shop.finance_private_model, 
  which is not allowed because the referenced node is private to the finance group.
```
