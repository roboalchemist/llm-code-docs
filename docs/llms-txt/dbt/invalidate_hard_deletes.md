# invalidate\_hard\_deletes legacy

Legacy opt-in configuration to enable invalidating hard deleted records while snapshotting the query.

This is a legacy config — Use the [`hard_deletes`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/hard-deletes.md) config instead.

In dbt release tracks and dbt Core 1.9 and higher, the [`hard_deletes`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/hard-deletes.md) config replaces the `invalidate_hard_deletes` config for better control over how to handle deleted rows from the source.

For new snapshots, set the config to `hard_deletes='invalidate'` instead of `invalidate_hard_deletes=true`. For existing snapshots, [arrange an update](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/snapshot-configs.md#snapshot-configuration-migration) of pre-existing tables before enabling this setting.
