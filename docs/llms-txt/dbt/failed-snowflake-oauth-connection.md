# Receiving a \`Failed to connect to DB\` error when connecting to Snowflake

1. If you see the following error:

   ```text
   Failed to connect to DB: xxxxxxx.snowflakecomputing.com:443. The role requested in the connection, or the default role if none was requested in the connection ('xxxxx'), is not listed in the Access Token or was filtered. 
   Please specify another role, or contact your OAuth Authorization server administrator.
   ```

2. Edit your OAuth Security integration and explicitly specify this scope mapping attribute:

   ```sql
   ALTER INTEGRATION <my_int_name> SET EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SCOPE_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'scp';
   ```

You can read more about this error in [Snowflake's documentation](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/external-custom-oauth-error-the-role-requested-in-the-connection-is-not-listed-in-the-access-token).

1. If you see the following error:

   ```text
   Failed to connect to DB: xxxxxxx.snowflakecomputing.com:443. Incorrect username or password was specified.
   ```

   * **Unique email addresses** — Each user in Snowflake must have a unique email address. You can't have multiple users (for example, a human user and a service account) using the same email, such as `alice@acme.com`, to authenticate to Snowflake.
   * **Match email addresses with identity provider** — The email address of your Snowflake user must exactly match the email address you use to authenticate with your Identity Provider (IdP). For example, if your Snowflake user's email is `alice@acme.com` but you log in to Entra or Okta with `alice_adm@acme.com`, this mismatch can cause an error.
