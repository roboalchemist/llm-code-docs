## Installing <!-- -->dbt-athena

Use `pip` to install the adapter. Before 1.8, installing the adapter would automatically install `dbt-core` and any additional dependencies. Beginning in 1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations. Use the following command for installation:

`python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-athena`

## Configuring <!-- -->dbt-athena<!-- -->

For <!-- -->Athena<!-- -->-specific configuration, please refer to [Athena<!-- --> configs.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/athena-configs.md)

`dbt-athena` vs `dbt-athena-community`

`dbt-athena-community` was the community-maintained adapter until dbt Labs took over maintenance in late 2024. Both `dbt-athena` and `dbt-athena-community` are maintained by dbt Labs, but `dbt-athena-community` is now simply a wrapper on `dbt-athena`, published for backwards compatibility.

## Connecting to Athena with dbt-athena[​](#connecting-to-athena-with-dbt-athena "Direct link to Connecting to Athena with dbt-athena")

This plugin does not accept any credentials directly. Instead, [credentials are determined automatically](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) based on AWS CLI/boto3 conventions and stored login info. You can configure the AWS profile name to use via aws\_profile\_name. Check out the dbt profile configuration below for details.

\~/.dbt/profiles.yml

```yaml
default:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: athena
      s3_staging_dir: [s3_staging_dir]
      s3_data_dir: [s3_data_dir]
      s3_data_naming: [table_unique] # the type of naming convention used when writing to S3
      region_name: [region_name]
      database: [database name]
      schema: [dev_schema]
      aws_profile_name: [optional profile to use from your AWS shared credentials file.]
      threads: [1 or more]
      num_retries: [0 or more] # number of retries performed by the adapter. Defaults to 5
  target: dev
```
