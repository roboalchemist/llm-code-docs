# Job notifications

Set up notifications in dbt platform to receive alerts about the status of a job run. You can choose to be notified by one or more of the following job run statuses:

* **Succeeds** option — A job run completed successfully with no warnings or errors.
* **Warns** option — A job run encountered warnings from [data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests.md) or [source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/source-freshness.md) checks (if applicable).
* **Fails** option — A job run failed to complete.
* **Is canceled** option — A job run is canceled.

### Notification options[​](#notification-options "Direct link to Notification options")

dbt platform currently supports the following notification channels:

* [Email](#email-notifications) — Available for all users
* [Slack (user-linked)](#slack-notifications) — Available for all users
* [Slack (account-level)](#slack-notifications-account) — Available in beta. To request access, contact your account manager.
* [Microsoft Teams](#microsoft-teams-notifications) — Available in beta. To request access, contact your account manager.

Microsoft Teams without the beta

If you don’t have access to the native Microsoft Teams integration (available in beta), you can still send job notifications to a Teams channel by using the channel’s email address as an external email, as explained in the next section, Email notifications.

## Email notifications[​](#email-notifications "Direct link to Email notifications")

You can receive email alerts about jobs by configuring the dbt email notification settings.

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* You must be either a *developer user* or an *account admin* to configure email notifications in dbt. For more details, refer to [Users and licenses](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users.md).

  <!-- -->

  * As a developer user, you can set up email notifications for yourself.
  * As an account admin, you can set up notifications for yourself and other team members.

### Configure email notifications[​](#configure-email-notifications "Direct link to Configure email notifications")

1. Select your profile icon and then click **Notification settings**.

2. By default, dbt sends notifications to the email address that's in your **User profile** page.

   If you're an account admin, you can choose a different email address to receive notifications:

   1. Under Job notifications, click the **Notification email** dropdown.

   2. Select another address from the list. The list includes **Internal Users** with access to the account and **External Emails** that have been added.

   3. To add an external email address, click the **Notification email** dropdown

   4. Click **Add external email**.

   5. Enter the email address, and click Add user. After adding an external email, it becomes available for selection in the **Notification email** dropdown list. External emails can be addresses that are outside of your dbt account and also for third-party integrations like [channels in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/tip-send-email-to-a-channel-2c17dbae-acdf-4209-a761-b463bdaaa4ca) and [PagerDuty email integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/email-integration-guide).

      <!-- -->

      note

      External emails and their notification settings persist until edited or removed even if you remove the admin who added them from the account.

## Slack notifications (account) [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")[​](#slack-notifications-account "Direct link to slack-notifications-account")

info

Configuring Slack notifications at the account level is currently available in beta. To request access, contact your account manager. Only refer to these instructions if you have access to the beta feature.

Integrate Slack with dbt platform at the account level to receive job notifications in Slack. dbt integrates with Slack via OAuth to ensure secure authentication.

A single dbt platform account can integrate with one Slack workspace.

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-2 "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* You have a Slack workspace that you want to receive job notifications from.
* A dbt platform account admin must link the Slack app at the account level.
* Install the official dbt platform Slack app using the [steps outlined in the next section](#set-up-the-slack-integration-1).
* To install the Slack app to a workspace, your Slack org must permit app installations. In some orgs this requires a Slack admin approval.
* The integration only supports *public* channels in the Slack workspace.

After an account admin links the Slack app for the account, [any licensed user](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users.md) in the account can configure Slack job notifications so long as they are assigned to the **Account Admin**, **Owner**, or **Member** default [groups](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access.md#groups). IT licenses don't have access to configure Slack job notifications.

### Set up the Slack integration[​](#set-up-the-slack-integration-1 "Direct link to Set up the Slack integration")

The account-level Slack integration uses the official dbt platform Slack app, which is separate from the [user-linked Slack integration](#slack-notifications).

To use the beta Slack notifications, you must unlink the old Slack app and then connect the new official app:

1. Go to **Account settings** > **Integrations** > **OAuth**.
2. Click the **X** icon next to Slack and select **Unlink**.
3. In the same OAuth section, click **Link** to connect the official Slack app.

Until you do this, the account-level Slack option will not appear.

## Microsoft Teams notifications [Beta](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")[​](#microsoft-teams-notifications- "Direct link to microsoft-teams-notifications-")

info

Configuring Microsoft Teams notifications is currently in beta. To request access, contact your account manager.

You can receive Microsoft Teams alerts for your dbt jobs by connecting your Teams account to the dbt platform, and configuring your notification preferences.

dbt integrates with Teams through Microsoft Entra to provide secure authentication. Only refer to these instructions if you have access to the beta feature.

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-3 "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before you begin:

* You must have a dbt platform account
* You have a Microsoft Teams account that you want to receive job notifications from.
* Make sure you have permission to view the **Account integrations** and **Job notifications** pages in dbt platform.

### Set up Microsoft Teams[​](#set-up-microsoft-teams "Direct link to Set up Microsoft Teams")

To enable Microsoft Teams job notifications, complete the following sections:

1. [Link dbt platform account to Teams](#link-dbt-platform-account-to-teams) — A user-level connection that links an individual dbt platform account (or a dedicated service account) to a Microsoft Teams user profile within your tenant.
2. [Configure Teams notifications](#configure-teams-notifications) — Configures which Teams channels receive job notifications.
3. [Disable the Teams integration](#disable-the-teams-integration) (optional) — Remove or reset the connection between dbt platform and Microsoft Teams.
