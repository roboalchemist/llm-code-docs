# Do I need to add a YAML entry for column for it to appear in the docs site?

Fortunately, no!

dbt will introspect your warehouse to generate a list of columns in each relation, and match it with the list of columns in your `.yml` files. As such, any undocumented columns will still appear in your documentation!
