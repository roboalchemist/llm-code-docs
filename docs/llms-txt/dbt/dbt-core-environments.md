# dbt environments

dbt makes it easy to maintain separate production and development environments through the use of [targets](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target.md) within a [profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/profiles.yml.md). A typical profile, when using dbt locally (for example, running from your command line), will have a target named `dev` and have this set as the default. This means that while making changes, your objects will be built in your *development* target without affecting production queries made by your end users. Once you are confident in your changes, you can deploy the code to *production*, by running your dbt project with a *prod* target.

Running dbt in production

You can learn more about different ways to run dbt in production in [this article](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deployments.md).

Targets offer the flexibility to decide how to implement your separate environments – whether you want to use separate schemas, databases, or entirely different clusters altogether! We recommend using *different schemas within one database* to separate your environments. This is the easiest to set up and is the most cost-effective solution in a modern cloud-based data stack.

In practice, this means that most of the details in a target will be consistent across all targets, except for the `schema` and user credentials. If you have multiple dbt users writing code, it often makes sense for *each user* to have their own *development* environment. A pattern we've found useful is to set your dev target schema to be `dbt_<username>`. User credentials should also differ across targets so that each dbt user is using their own data warehouse user.
