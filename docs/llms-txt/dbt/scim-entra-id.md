SCIM available for Entra ID

dbt supports System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) with Microsoft Entra ID for user and group provisioning and profile updates.

Automatic license type mapping is not currently supported with Entra ID SCIM. See [mapped configuration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users.md#mapped-configuration) to manage license types within the dbt platform user interface.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* Available on [Enterprise or Enterprise+ plans](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing).
* You must use Entra ID as your single sign-on (SSO) provider and have it connected in the dbt platform.
* You must have [permissions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions.md) to configure the account settings in dbt platform.
* Complete [setup SSO with Entra ID](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-sso-microsoft-entra-id.md) before configuring SCIM settings.
* Complete the [Set up SCIM](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/manage-access/scim.md#set-up-dbt) to get your SCIM base URL and token.

You can now begin assigning users to your SCIM app in Entra ID!

## Assign users to SCIM app[​](#assign-users-to-scim-app "Direct link to Assign users to SCIM app")

The following steps go over how to assign users/groups to the SCIM app. Refer to Microsoft's [official instructions for assigning users or groups to an Enterprise App in Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/scim/aad#step-3-assign-users-and-groups-to-the-application) to learn more. Although the article is written for Databricks, the steps are identical.

1. Navigate to Enterprise applications and select the SCIM app.

2. Go to **Manage** > **Provisioning**.

3. To synchronize Microsoft Entra ID users and groups to dbt, click **Start provisioning**.
   <!-- -->
   [![Start provisioning to synchronize users and groups.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/access-control/scim-entraid-start-provision.png?v=2 "Start provisioning to synchronize users and groups.")](#)Start provisioning to synchronize users and groups.

4. Navigate back to the SCIM app's overview page and go to **Manage** > **Users and groups**.

5. Click **Add user/group** and select the users and groups.
   <!-- -->
   [![Add user/group.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/access-control/scim-entraid-add-users.png?v=2 "Add user/group.")](#)Add user/group.

6. Click the **Assign** button.

7. Wait a few minutes. In the dbt platform, confirm the users and groups exist in your dbt account.

   <!-- -->

   * Users and groups that you add and assign will automatically be provisioned to your dbt account when Microsoft Entra ID schedules the next sync.
   * By enabling provisioning, you immediately trigger the initial Microsoft Entra ID sync. Subsequent syncs are triggered every 20-40 minutes, depending on the number of users and groups in the application. Refer to Microsoft Entra ID's [Provisioning tips](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/scim/aad#provisioning-tips) documentation for more information.
   * You can also prompt a manual provisioning outside of the cycle by clicking **Restart provisioning**.

   [![Prompt manual provisioning.](/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/access-control/scim-entraid-manual.png?v=2 "Prompt manual provisioning.")](#)Prompt manual provisioning.
