# Blogs

> Create and manage blog-style pages for news updates and educational content with feed-based display options.

When using Curator, you may need to notify your audience about updates related to news in your business or may need to
help break down important concepts, and allow those updates to be highlighted in a specific area of your site.  If you
find yourself needing to really this type of information on your Curator pages, then the Blog flag is extremely useful.

All Curator pages can be marked as a "blog" allowing you to filter a subset of pages in a feed-type of display in the
various elements available on the page builder, whether you want to display blog pages in a list, a feed, tiles or any
other format.  While the page is not flagged as a blog, it will only be accessible via the menu or directly from the URL,
allowing you to have pages that are in a draft state priori to a go-live date.

**To mark a page as a blog:**

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Content** > **Pages** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Find the page in the list view or click "New Page" to create a new page.
4. At the bottom of the page, enable the "Blog" toggle, and save the page
