# Force SSL

> Configure Curator to enforce SSL/HTTPS connections for enhanced security.

Force SSL (https) will force all HTTP request to be https instead. This will require you to set up SSL certificates
first before enabling the feature. Otherwise, the site will run into an issue. To enable Force SSL (https):

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click on **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** in the left navigation.
4. Click on the "General" tab at the top of the main page content.
5. Click to switch on the "Force SSL" setting under the "Security" section and click the "Save" button.
