# Temporarily Disabling Connections

> Temporarily disable integration connections without removing configuration settings

If you need to temporarily turn off a connection, you can toggle off the **Enabled** switch when editing the connection
(Backend > Integrations > Connections > click a connection).

To re-enable the connection, just toggle the **Enabled** switch back on and save.

***Important* Note:** If your Curator licensing limits how many connections you can have in a single portal,
disabled/inactive connections are still counted toward those limits.  If you need to remove a connection from that count,
you'll need to fully delete the connection instead of disabling it.
