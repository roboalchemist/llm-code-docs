# Email Formatting

> Customize email templates and formatting for automated notifications, reports, and user communications.

## Requirements

Before moving on, it's important that you follow the [steps to configure email](/setup/email/email_configuration)
on Curator.

## Email Template Formatting

When users from both the front-end and back-end are notified via Curator, they will be notified via e-mail.  This will
include all notifications such as password reset, welcome-messages on first log in, backend administrators gaining
access, and scheduled report emails.

In order to modify the background, body-color, as well as adding a header image to your emails, you can find all the
available controls for email formatting on the left-hand menu under **Settings** > **Mail** > **Mail branding**.

## Email Content

If you would like to change the messages inside of your emails, you *can* modify the templates on the backend via
the left-hand menu under **Settings** > **Mail** > **Mail templates**.  **Proceed with caution if you are modifying
these templates - they require very exact specifications**.  If you need to reset your templates and are unable to do so
please reach out to Curator support.
