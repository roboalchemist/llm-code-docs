# Featuring Content 

> Promote and highlight important content using featuring options to increase visibility and user engagement.

The landing page typically shows an assortment of many different dashboards from the site. These displays will show
favorited and featured dashboards first before others. While Favorited dashboards is a feature that is driven by the user
we provide the ability to bump certain dashboards to the top using the Feature switch (requires a tiled homepage). The
dashboards that are shown will only ever be dashboards the user has permission to see.

***To feature a Dashboard:***

1. While editing the Dashboard, click on the "Misc" tab.
2. Scroll to the "Discovery" section.
3. Toggle on the switch labeled "Featured".
4. Click the "Save" button.
