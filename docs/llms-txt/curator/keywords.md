# Keywords 

> Assign and manage keywords for content organization and improved search and filtering capabilities.

Keywords can be associated with dashboards, pages, individual files, and menu items. These keywords can be utilized in
the Search and Explorer feature when pulling in results, as well as when determining which content to display on a page.
A keyword page can be set up that will pull in all content tagged with the keyword.

***To create a new keyword***

1. Navigate to the **Content** section in the backend of your Curator instance.
2. Select **Keywords** from the Content dropdown.
3. Click the **New Keyword** button.
4. Assign a title to the new keyword (this will be the keyword that is created)
5. From here you can check the box next to an existing piece of content to associate it with that keyword. This new
   keyword will now be available in the keywords list when creating new pieces of content as well.

***To link a keyword to a Dashboard:***

1. While editing a Dashboard, click on the **Misc** tab.
2. Scroll to the **Discovery** section.
3. Select the **Search Keywords** field.
4. Type in the text for the first keyword.
5. Check the box next to the desired keyword.
6. Click the **Save** button at the top-right corner of the page.

The above process is used for linking keywords to pages and files as well. To link a keyword to a menu item, first
create the menu item, then link it to the desired keyword in the **Keywords** section.
