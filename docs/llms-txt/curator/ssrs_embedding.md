# SSRS Embedding

> Embed SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports directly into Curator pages for integrated reporting.

## Getting the Report URL

In your web browser, navigate to the SSRS report you wish to embed within Curator.  Once the report has loaded, copy the
link in the URL bar of your browser.

### Adding SSRS to a Curator Page

Start by either creating a new page or editing an existing Curator page from Curator's backend.  Click on the plus (+)
icon in the Page Builder preview pane to add a new blank element to the page.  This blank element is a placeholder that
you'll use to embed the desired SSRS report by following these steps:

1. Hover your mouse over the blank element and click on the pencil icon.
2. Click on the **Analytic Elements** tab at the top of the pop-up.
3. Select the **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** option.
4. The pop-up will close and the SSRS settings will appear on the left.  Paste the link you copied above into the
   **Report URL** field. You should see the Page Builder preview update to show the SSRS report.
5. Once you're happy with the layout, click on the **Save** button.
