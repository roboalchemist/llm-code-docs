# Data Manager Notifications 

> Set up email notifications for Data Manager form submissions to stay informed of user data input and feedback.

To stay up-to-date on the data being submitted to Curator you can subscribe multiple users to receive email
notifications immediately after a form has been submitted.  These emails will also contain the data from the
form that has been submitted, allowing you to instantly review anything that comes in: whether it's a Contact
Us form, a Feedback form, or tracking your users favorite pizza, you'll know right away!

**NOTE**: Email configuration on Curator is required to use this email notification system.  If you have not
configured email on your Curator instance, please get in touch with your email administrator and [use these instructions](/setup/email/email_configuration)
to set up email.

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `https://www.curatorexample.com/backend` ).
2. Navigate to the **Data Manager** > **Data Groups** section from the left-hand menu.

4. Toggle ON the switch labelled "Email submissions"
