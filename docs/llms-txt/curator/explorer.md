# Explorer 

> Interactive tile layout element with search and filtering capabilities for dynamic content discovery and navigation.

Explorer is an interactive and dynamic tile layout element that can be added in the Page Builder. It provides users the
ability to search and filter displayed content. Filters utilize keywords to get the desired results. This layout is best
used when you have a lot of content on your site as the tiles are small.

## To add a Explorer page element

1. Navigate to the **Content** section in the backend of your Curator instance.
2. Select **Pages** from the Content dropdown.
3. Click the **New Page** button or edit an existing one.
4. Add a new row element and/or click the **Edit Content** button (pencil) icon of a row element.
5. In the element popup select Explorer under the Web Elements tab.

After this your Page will display the Explorer element. Since this uses the Keywords functionality please review the
subject [here](/site_content_design/content_discovery/keywords).
