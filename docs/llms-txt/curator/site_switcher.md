# Site Switcher

> Enable users to easily navigate between multiple Curator sites or environments through integrated site switching functionality.

Some Tableau Servers have different sites with different dashboards associated with those sites. The site switcher allows
a frontend user to filter the dashboards in the navigation by Tableau Site from a dropdown.

***To enable:***

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click on **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the "Features" tab at the top of the main page content.
5. Scroll to and expand the "Usability" section and then toggle on "Site Switcher".
6. Click "Save".
