## SaaS requirements

To use Curator SaaS, ensure you meet the following technical requirements:

* **Supported Browsers:** Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari
* **Network Access:** Ability for any of your hosted platforms (e.g. Tableau) to connect to Curator SaaS endpoints.
* **Data Security:** Compliance with your organization's data security policies, as Curator SaaS acts as a pass-through
  for your analytics content.

If you opt to use the legacy Self-Hosted deployment, please refer to the
[Self-Hosted Technical Requirements](https://curator.interworks.com/docs/installation/self_hosted_requirements) for
detailed specifications.

## SaaS vs. Self-Hosted

Not sure which deployment model is right for you? Here's a comparison:

| Feature                          | Curator SaaS            | Self-Hosted                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Expertise Required** | None                    | Moderate to High                          |
| **Infrastructure Management**    | Managed by InterWorks   | Customer managed                          |
| **Maintenance & Updates**        | Automatic               | Manual                                    |
| **Scalability**                  | Automatic               | Customer configured                       |
| **Pricing Model**                | Fixed cost, predictable | Variable infrastructure costs             |
| **Best For**                     | Most organizations      | Legacy systems, specific compliance needs |

<Note>
  **Recommendation:** Curator SaaS is the ideal choice for most organizations. Self-hosted deployments are primarily for existing customers or organizations with specific regulatory requirements.
