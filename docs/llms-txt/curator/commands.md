1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click on the "Integration" link at the top.
4. Click on "Manage Commands" in the left navigation.
5. Click on the "New Command" button at the top of the main page content.
6. Enter the name, description, and command type, arguments, schedule, etc. as needed and click "Create".
