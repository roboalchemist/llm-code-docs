# Series 2 DCI and SWD Programming Examples

The programming examples in this application note use the [Series 2 DCI and SWD Programming](#software-overview) platform example of GSDK v4.0.1. The hardware and software implementation may be different on other versions of the GSDK.

For more information about production programming steps, see section "_Overview_" in [Production Programming of Series 2 and Series 3 Devices](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/prod-programming-series2-and-series3/).

## Hardware Overview

The Wireless Starter Kit (WSTK) with the [BRD4182A Radio Board](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug430-brd4182a-user-guide.pdf) (EFR32MG22C224F512IM40) is used as the hardware platform of the DCI and SWD programmer.

The programmer uses GPIO to emulate the DCI and SWD to program the target device. The UART interface handles the user interface. The VCOM_TX and VCOM_RX are routed to the WSTK virtual COM port by setting the VCOM_ENABLE line high.

![Block Diagram of DCI and SWD Programmer](/efr32-dci-swd-programming/0.1/images/sld815-block-diagram-of-dci-and-swd-programmer.png)

**Resources of BRD4182A Used by Programmer**

|**GPIO (SoC Peripheral)**|**WSTK Peripheral**|**Function**|**EXP Header Connection**|
|---|---|---|---|
|PA01 (DBG_SWCLK)|DBG_TCK_SWCLK|Programmer debug SWCLK|—|
|PA02 (DBG_SWDIO)|DBG_TCK_SWDIO|Programmer debug SWDIO|—|
|PA05 (US1_TX)|VCOM_TX|WSTK Virtual COM port TX|Pin 12|
|PA06 (US1_RX)|VCOM_RX|WSTK Virtual COM port RX|Pin 14|
|PB04|VCOM_ENABLE|WSTK Virtual COM port enable|—|
|PC03|—|Target device RESETn|Pin 10|
|PD02|UIF_LED0|Target device SWCLK (shared with WSTK LED0)|Pin 11|
|PD03|UIF_LED1|Target device SWDIO (shared with WSTK LED1)|Pin 13|

The following figure shows the interconnection between programmer and target device. The programmer is the WSTK with the BRD4182A Radio Board and the target device is the WSTK with one of the Series 2 radio boards below.

- EFR32MG21A — BRD4181A (J101 P16 for SWCLK)
- EFR32MG21B — BRD4181C (J101 P16 for SWCLK)
- EFR32MG22 — BRD4182A (J101 P16 for SWCLK)
- EFR32FG23A — BRD4263B (J101 P20 for SWCLK)
- EFR32FG23B — BRD4263C (J101 P20 for SWCLK)

![Programmer Connection Diagram](/efr32-dci-swd-programming/0.1/images/sld815-programmer-connection-diagra.png)

The programmer powers the target device on the Series 2 radio board through VMCU. Therefore power switch (SW700) of the target device WSTK should be in the BAT position.

**Programmer Connection Diagram**

The programmer can work on other Series 2 radio boards or kits. However, the following limitations may apply.

- Some firmware images (`xg2*_app_image[] and xg2*_signed_imag[]`) in [Hard-coded Firmware Images](#firmware-images) are hardware-dependent (GPIOs for LEDs, push buttons, and UART). Therefore, they may not function properly on other radio boards or kits.
- The SWCLK and SWDIO of the target radio boards or kits may be on different pins or connectors. Therefore, the connection diagram above may not apply (refer to the board-specific schematics for details).

## Software Overview

Users must select the BRD4182A radio board to access the `Series 2 DCI and SWD Programming` platform example in Simplicity Studio 5. Click the `View Project Documentation` link to open the `readme` file. This file includes the procedures to create the project and run the example.

![View Project Documentation](/efr32-dci-swd-programming/0.1/images/sld815-image19.jpg)

### Bit-Bang

The main overhead on writing directly to MSC registers is to emulate the [SWCLK and SWDIO](#hardware-overview) signals by bit-banging GPIO pins. The programmer must use the GPIOs in the same port group (0-7 or 8-15) for SWCLK and SWDIO to speed up this emulation process. The software writes to the entire port at once when bit-banging the SWCLK and SWDIO signals. Therefore, the programmer cannot use the spare pins of this port for other purposes.

### Security Keys

The following table describes the security keys (hard-coded in `app_dci_task.c`) used in the programming examples. Users can modify these keys to adapt to the application requirements. The files (`.prv` and `.pem`) of security keys can be found in the Windows folder `C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\adapter_packs\secmgr\scripts\offline.`

**Hard-Coded Security Keys**

|**Array**|**Usage**|**Source**|

|public_command_key[]|Secure debug unlock and Disable tamper|A 64 bytes Public Command Key, the corresponding Private Command Key in cmd-unsafe-privkey.pem.|

The public key can be derived from the private key by using [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

```sh
openssl ec -in rootsign-unsafe-privkey.pem -pubout -text > public_sign_key.txt

## SWD Programming Examples

The following SWD programming examples are based on EFR32MG21B (BRD4181C) and EFR32MG22 (BRD4182A) as target devices ([Programmer Connection Diagram](#hardware-overview)). Software is compiled with -O2 optimization in the Simplicity IDE of Simplicity Studio 5.

If the secure boot option is enabled in the SE OTP or bootloader, the application firmware must be signed.

Some operations are implemented by the SE Manager APIs in an application firmware that is programmed to the target device.

- For more information about SE Manager, see [Series 2 Secure Debug](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/series2-secure-debug/).
- The SE Manager is available in Gecko SDK Suite 3.0.0 or later.
- The SE Manager APIs are fully described in the Silicon Labs online documentation located at [https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-plat-](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/service/api/group-sl-se-manager) [form/latest/service/api/group-sl-se-manager](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/service/api/group-sl-se-manager).

**Erase Main Flash**

- This example demonstrates the [mass erase](04-serial-wire-debug-swd-interface#flash-erase) operation through the SWD interface.

```sh
 + Current SWD task is ERASE MAIN FLASH.
 + Press ENTER to confirm or press SPACE to abort.
 . Connect to the target device through the SWD interface.
 + Initialize DP... OK - IDCODE = 0x6BA02477
 + Read AP... OK - IDR = 0x84770001
 + Set up AHB-AP and halt target... OK
 + Get device information... OK - Target device is EFR32MG21B010F1024 and unique ID is 0x14B457FFFE0F77CE
 . Erase main flash of the target device... OK (cycles: 1511120 time: 18889 us)
```

**Program Main Flash**

- This example demonstrates the [flash erase](04-serial-wire-debug-swd-interface#flash-erase), [flash write](04-serial-wire-debug-swd-interface#flash-write), and [flash verify](04-serial-wire-debug-swd-interface) operations through the SWD interface. In this example, an application firmware image [xg21_app_image[]](#firmware-images) is programmed to the target device main flash.

```sh
 + Current SWD task is PROGRAM MAIN FLASH.
 + Press ENTER to confirm or press SPACE to abort.
 . Connect to the target device through the SWD interface.
 + Initialize DP... OK - IDCODE = 0x6BA02477
 + Read AP... OK - IDR = 0x84770001
 + Set up AHB-AP and halt target... OK
 + Get device information... OK - Target device is EFR32MG21B010F1024 and unique ID is 0x14B457FFFE0F77CE
 . Program an application firmware image to the target device.
 + The xG21 application firmware image size is 9212 bytes and start address is 0x00000000.
 + Erase-Program-Verify the xG21 main flash for application firmware image... OK (cycles: 11388469 time: 142 ms)
 + Issue a soft reset to run the application firmware... OK
```

**Erase User Data (xG21 Devices)**

- For xG21 devices (BRD4181C), the user data can only be erased by issuing a command to the HSE through the SE Manager API.
- In this example, an application firmware image [erase_xg21_userdata[]](#firmware-images) (see source code below) is programmed to the target device main flash.

```sh
#include "em_chip.h"
#include "em_cmu.h"
#include "sl_se_manager.h"
#include "sl_se_manager_util.h"
/***************************************************************************//**
 * Main function

int main(void)
{
 // Command context
 sl_se_command_context_t cmd_ctx;
 // Switch SYSCLK to 38 MHz HFRCO
 CMU_HFRCODPLLBandSet(cmuHFRCODPLLFreq_38M0Hz);
 // Initialize SE Manager
 sl_se_init();
 // Erase user page
 sl_se_erase_user_data(&cmd_ctx);
 
 while (1) ;
}
```

- The original application firmware image on the application start address will be overwritten.
- Issue a soft reset to run the application above to erase the user data.

```sh
 + Current SWD task is ERASE USER DATA.
 + Press ENTER to confirm or press SPACE to abort.
 . Connect to the target device through the SWD interface.

 + Issue a soft reset to run the application firmware to erase the xG21 user data... OK
```

**Erase User Data (non xG21 Devices)**

- For non xG21 devices (BRD4182A), the user data can be erased the same way as any page in the main flash.

```sh
 + Current SWD task is ERASE USER DATA.
 + Press ENTER to confirm or press SPACE to abort.
 . Connect to the target device through the SWD interface.

- The original application firmware image on the application start address will be overwritten.

```sh
 + Current SWD task is UPGRADE SE FIRMWARE THROUGH APPLICATION FIRMWARE.
 + Press ENTER to confirm or press SPACE to abort.
 . Connect to the target device through the SWD interface.
 + Initialize DP... OK - IDCODE = 0x6BA02477
 + Read AP... OK - IDR = 0x84770001
 + Set up AHB-AP and halt target... OK
 + Get device information... OK - Target device is EFR32MG21B010F1024 and unique ID is 0x60A423FFFEA0773C
 . Program an application firmware image to the target device to upgrade the SE firmware.
 + The xG21 HSE upgrade application firmware image size is 6956 bytes and start address is 0x00000000.
 + Erase-Program-Verify the xG21 main flash for application to upgrade
 HSE firmware... OK (cycles: 8840993 time: 110 ms)
```

- A SE upgrade firmware image [xg21_hse_image[]](#firmware-images) is programmed to the target device main flash at [SE_START_ADDR](#compile-options). The application start address cannot overlap with `SE_START_ADDR`. This means the `SE_START_ADDR` must be greater than the application start address plus the size [6956 bytes](#firmware-images) of the application firmware image (`prog_xg21_hse_upgrade[]`).

```sh
 . Program a SE firmware image to the target device.
 + The xG21 HSE firmware image version: 00010209
 + The xG21 HSE firmware image size is 41125 bytes and start address is 0x00060000.
 + Erase-Program-Verify the xG21 main flash for HSE firmware image... OK (cycles: 52363897 time: 654 ms)
```

- Issue a pin reset to run the application firmware in `prog_xg21_hse_upgrade[]`.
- Check the SE firmware version after a few seconds to verify the SE firmware has been upgraded.

```sh
 + Issue a pin reset to run the application to upgrade the SE firmware.
 + Delay few seconds to check SE status... Done
 . Read target device SE status... OK
 + SE firmware version : 00010209
 + MCU firmware version : NA
 + Debug lock : Disabled
 + Debug lock state : False
 + Device Erase : Enabled
 + Secure debug : Disabled
 + Secure boot : Disabled and SE OTP is not configured
 + Boot status : 0x20 - Command successful.
```

- The SE firmware cannot be downgraded so the upgrade will be ignored if SE firmware with the same or a lower version is applied to the device.

## Benchmark

The application firmware in [Hard-coded Firmware Images on page 26](#firmware-images) is replaced by a 256 kB image for benchmarking. The test results in the following table are based on the conditions below.

- [Series 2 DCI and SWD Programming](#software-overview) platform example of GSDK v4.0.1
- Erase, program, and verify the main flash
- [Compile options](#compile-options) are set to default values
- Software is compiled with -O2 in Simplicity IDE (GNU ARM v10.2.1) of Simplicity Studio 5
- The programmer (EFR32MG22C224F512IM40) is running at 80 MHz
