# SE Command List

This application note does not include a complete list of commands for DCI. The following sections contain information about each command's operation and arguments for DCI production programming. The [command](03-debug-challenge-interface-dci#command) and [response](03-debug-challenge-interface-dci#response) payload may be device-specific (e.g., Initialize OTP and Get Status).

For more information about secure boot, see [Series 2 Secure Boot with RTSL](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/). For more information about debug lock and secure debug, see [Series 2 Secure Debug](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/series2-secure-debug/).

## SE Image Check

This command can be used to check the SE image before starting the upgrade process, in order to be able to abort early if the image is invalid or inapplicable.

> **Note**: This command is only available on SE firmware version ≥ v1.2.2 (xG21 or xG22 devices).

**SE Image Check Command**

|---|---|---|---|---|
|0x4302|0x00|0x00|Address in internal flash where the SE upgrade image is stored - 4 bytes:|None|

## SE Image Apply

This command can be used to perform an upgrade of the SE firmware where the existing firmware will be overwritten with the one stored in the internal flash if the upgrade image is valid and applicable. The system is restarted and no [response code](03-debug-challenge-interface-dci) is returned if the SE image is successfully upgraded.
