# No Universal Passwords

_The product shall not have a universal password; unique security credentials will be required for operation. Universal passwords allow an attacker to easily gain access to any device. Therefore, products shall either have a unique password or require the user to enter a new password immediately upon first use._

It is your responsibility to ensure that your product enforces the creation of a unique password before activation.

Silicon Labs’ products are designed to be configured by the manufacturer before being delivered to customers, and therefore passwords are outside of our scope. However, Silicon Labs tools are designed to support the various levels of security provided by the protocol in question. Most protocols offer different security levels, with tradeoffs between security level and other features such as ease of network formation. You need to review and decide on the level required by your application. For example:

- The EmberZNet Pro SDK supports a highly secure centralized trust-center-controlled method that replaces a device’s factory-programmed link key with a key that is unique to each device on the network.
- Z-Wave 700 products come with a factory-programmed unique S2 keypair on first power-up, and support SmartStart commissioning through a package QR code containing the public key.
- Bluetooth options range from an unsecured “Just Works” approach to a LE Secure Connections Pairing model. Application designers can implement additional device authentication methods, such as through the companion smartphone app, to help ensure secure pairing even for devices without a user interface.
