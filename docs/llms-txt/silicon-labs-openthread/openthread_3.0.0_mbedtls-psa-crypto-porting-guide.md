# Integrating Crypto Functionality Using PSA Crypto Compared to Mbed TLS

> **Note: This section replaces _AN1311: Integrating Crypto Functionality Using PSA Crypto Compared to Mbed TLS_. Further updates to this application note will be provided here**.

This application note describes how to integrate crypto functionality into applications using PSA Crypto compared to Mbed TLS. It includes a guide to migrating existing Mbed TLS implementations to PSA Crypto.

This document focuses on the Silicon Labs PSA Crypto implementations that support the RNG, symmetric and asymmetric keys, message digests, MAC, unauthenticated ciphers, AEAD, KDF, DSA, and ECDH.

This document assumes familiarity with the crypto algorithms discussed.
