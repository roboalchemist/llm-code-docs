# Enabling Secure Boot and Tamper Configuration

The Secure Boot feature verifies the integrity and authenticity of the host application before allowing it to execute. Enabling this feature is **IRREVERSIBLE**, which means once enabled, Secure Boot can no longer be disabled throughout the life of the device. The Secure Boot settings are written to the one-time-programmable (OTP) memory. They cannot be changed once programmed.

On HSE-SVH and Series 3 Secure Vault devices, the anti-tamper configuration is provisioned with Secure Boot settings. The anti-tamper configuration determines the response from the HSE-SVH device if a tamper event occurs.

**Notes**:

- All tamper-related information in the following sections is only valid on HSE-SVH devices.
- For more information about anti-tamper configuration, see [Anti-Tamper Protection Configuration and Use](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/efr32-secure-vault-tamper/).
- Except for the EFR32xG21B devices, other HSE-SVH devices require Simplicity Commander Version 1.12.2 or above for tamper configuration.
- Series 3 devices require Simplicity Commander Version 1.18.0, or higher

The `user_configuration.json` is a JSON file that contains the desired Secure Boot settings and anti-tamper configuration. Use the following command on the target device (e.g., EFR32MG21B010F1024) to generate a default configuration file.

```sh
commander security genconfig --nostore -o user_configuration.json --device EFR32MG21B010F1024
--serialno 440048205
```

```sh
DONE
```

> **Note**: The content of the JSON file is device dependent (`--device <device name>`).

The `security genconfig` command above generates a generic configuration file for **EFR32MG21B010F1024** consisting of the properties listed in the tables below. A text editor can be used to modify the default settings shown below to the desired configuration.

> **Note**: For `USER_CODE_AUTH` (user secure boot failed), recommended setting is 0 (Ignore) to avoid boot loops.

**Table: Secure Boot Items (mcu_flags) for Series 2 Devices**

|**Name**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE|If set, verifies the host image on the Cortex-M33 before releasing the Cortex-M33 from reset.|
|SECURE_BOOT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE|If set, requires certificate-based signing of the host image.|
|SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK|If set, prevents secure upgrading to a host image with a lower version than the image that is currently stored in flash.|
|SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW|If set, locks flash pages that have been validated by the Secure Boot process to prevent re-flashing by other means than through the SE. Write/erase locks pages from 0 through the page where the Secure Boot host image signature is located, not including the last page if the signature is not on a page boundary.|
|SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL|If set, locks flash pages that have been validated by the Secure Boot process to prevent re-flashing by other means than through the SE. Write/erase locks pages from 0 through the page where the Secure Boot host image signature is located, including the last page if the signature is not on a page boundary.|

> **Note**: The host image is usually the Gecko Bootloader (GBL).

The following command writes the Secure Boot settings and anti-tamper configuration in `user_configuration.json` file to the device. This command can be executed only once per device.

```sh
commander security writeconfig --configfile user_configuration.json --device EFR32MG21B010F1024
--serialno 440048205
```

```sh
================================================================================

THIS IS A ONE-TIME configuration: Please inspect file before confirming: user_configuration.json
Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:
================================================================================
continue
DONE
```

To check the device's Secure Boot settings and anti-tamper configuration, run the `security readconfig` command.

```sh
commander security readconfig --serialno 440048205
```
