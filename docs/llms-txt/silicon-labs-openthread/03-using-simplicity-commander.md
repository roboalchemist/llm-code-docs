# Using Simplicity Commander

The latest version of Simplicity Commander can be downloaded from [https://www.silabs.com/developers/mcu-programming-options](https://www.silabs.com/developers/mcu-programming-options).

2. The Simplicity Commander's Command Line Interface (CLI) is invoked by `commander.exe` in the Simplicity Commander folder. The location for Simplicity Studio 5 in Windows is `C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\adapter_packs\commander`. For ease of use, it is highly recommended to add the path of `commander.exe` to the system PATH in Windows.
3. If more than one Wireless Starter Kit (WSTK) is connected via USB, the target WSTK must be specified using the `--serialno <J-Link serial number>` option.
4. If the WSTK is in debug mode OUT, the target device must be specified using the `--device <device name>` option. For more information about Simplicity Commander, see [Simplicity Commander Reference Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-commander/latest/simplicity-commander-start/).
