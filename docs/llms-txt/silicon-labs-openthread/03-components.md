# Components

This section maps the various Gecko Bootloader components to the previously available plugins (in the AppBuilder workflow). Although the basic subgroups might remain the same, specific component locations are subject to change across various GSDK versions. Therefore, it is good practice to search for individual components by their names rather than the specific subgroups that they belong to.
