### Using Simplicity Commander

1. This application note uses Simplicity Commander v1.19.2. The procedures and console output may be different for the other versions of Simplicity Commander. The latest version of Simplicity Commander can be downloaded from [MCU Programming options](https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/mcu-programming-options).  
   > **Note**: It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of Simplicity Commander.  
   ```sh  
   commander --version  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Simplicity Commander 1v19p2b1907  
     
   JLink DLL version: 7.52d  
   Qt 5.12.10 Copyright (C) 2017 The Qt Company Ltd.  
   EMDLL Version: 0v17p19b0  
   mbed TLS version: 2.16.6  
     
   Emulator found with SN=440048205 USBAddr=0  
     
   DONE  
   ```
2. The Simplicity Commander's Command Line Interface (CLI) is invoked by `commander.exe` in the Simplicity Commander folder. The location for Simplicity Studio 5 in Windows is `C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\adapter_packs\commander`. For ease of use, it is highly recommended to add the path of commander.exe to the system PATH in Windows.
3. If more than one WSTK is connected via USB, the target WSTK must be specified using the `--serialno <J-Link serial number>` option.
4. If the WSTK is in debug mode OUT, the target device must be specified using the `--device <device name>` option. For more information about Simplicity Commander, see [Simplicity Commander Reference Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-commander/latest/simplicity-commander-start/).

### Using an External Tool

The [Secure Boot examples](#secure-boot) use the **OpenSSL** to sign the image files and certificates. The Windows version of OpenSSL can be downloaded from [https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). This application note uses OpenSSL Version 3.5.0 (Win64).

```sh
openssl version
```

```sh
OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025)
```

The OpenSSL's Command Line Interface (CLI) is invoked by `openssl.exe` in the OpenSSL folder. The location in Windows (Win64) is `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`. For ease of use, it is highly recommended to add the path of `openssl.exe` to the system `PATH` in Windows.

### Using a Platform Example

Simplicity Studio 5 includes the [SE Manager platform example](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/start-a-project#examples) for key provisioning and Secure Boot enabling. This application note uses platform example of SiSDK v2025.6.1. The console output may be different on other versions.

Refer to the corresponding readme file for details about each SE Manager platform example. This file also includes the procedures to create the project and run the example.

### Generate Key and Signing

This section describes how to generate a key to sign an image file or certificate for Secure Boot using Simplicity Commander or using an HSM with Simplicity Commander (Openssl). For production environments, it is strongly recommended to generate keys with an HSM.

#### Using Simplicity Commander

1. Run the `util genkey` command to generate the ECDSA-P256 Sign Key pair (`sign_key.pem` and `sign_pubkey.pem)` and Public Sign Key token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`). The Simplicity Commander can program the Public Sign Key in token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`) to the [top page of the main flash](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot).  
   ```sh  
   commander util genkey --type ecc-p256 --privkey sign_key.pem --pubkey sign_pubkey.pem  
   --tokenfile sign_pubkey.txt  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Generating ECC P256 key pair...  
   Writing private key file in PEM format to sign_key.pem  
   Writing public key file in PEM format to sign_pubkey.pem  
   Writing EC tokens to sign_pubkey.txt...  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The same procedure can apply to generate the bootloader certificate and application certificate key pairs for [Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).
2. Use the convert command with the Private Key (like sign_key.pem) from step 1 to sign an image file or certificate. Refer to [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) and [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) for more information about the Simplicity Commander signing process.

#### Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander

1. You can use HSM to generate the ECDSA-P256 Sign Key pair. The Private Sign Key is securely held in HSM and the Public Sign Key can be exported in a specific format (like `sign_pubkey.pem`).  
   > **Note**: The same procedure can apply to generate the bootloader certificate and application certificate key pairs for [Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).
2. Use the `util keytotoken` command to convert the Public Sign Key from step 1 to token format (`sign_pubkey.txt`). The Simplicity Commander can program the Public Sign Key in token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`) to the [top page of the main flash](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot).  
   ```sh  
   commander util keytotoken sign_pubkey.pem --outfile sign_pubkey.txt  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Writing EC tokens to sign_pubkey.txt...  
   DONE  
   ```
3. Use the `convert` command with `--extsign` option to prepare an unsigned image or certificate for HSM.
4. Use the Private Key from step 1 to generate a signature for the unsigned image or certificate from step 3.
5. Use the `convert` command with the signature from step 4 to generate a signed image or certificate. Refer to [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) and [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) for more information about the HSM and Simplicity Commander signing process.

> **Note**: The Simplicity Commander v1.11.0 or above supports signature in DER format. The older version of Simplicity Commander can only handle signatures in Raw format.

## Provision Public Sign Key and Secure Boot Enabling

The Public Sign Key in SE OTP is used to verify the host image signature or certificate during Secure Boot. You should provision this key before setting the Secure Boot enabled flag in SE OTP. On HSE-SVH devices, when anti-tamper functionality is needed, you need to provision the [anti-tamper protection configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/efr32-secure-vault-tamper/) with Secure Boot settings.

If you set the [SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK](#simplicity-commander) option with Secure Boot, the SE will store the version counter (4 bytes) for anti-rollback of GBL (SSB) to SE flash and check the bootloader version during an upgrade and on every boot. The version counter will not roll to 0 if it reaches the maximum value (bootloader cannot be upgraded anymore). The anti-rollback does not prevent flashing an older signed GBL hex image to the device.

The following table describes the anti-rollback protection on signed GBL when `SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK` is enabled or disabled.

- The GBL handles the anti-rollback protection when upgrading the GBL through the [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) (`.gbl`).
- The SE handles the anti-rollback protection (if `SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK` enabled) when booting the image.

|**Action**|**SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK Disable**|**SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK Enable**|
|---|---|---|
|Use a GBL upgrade image (`.gbl`) file (e.g., OTA)|Gecko Bootloader rejects upgrade if an equal or lower GBL version is detected.|Gecko Bootloader rejects upgrade if an equal or lower GBL version is detected.|
|Flash and boot a firmware image (`.s32`, `.hex`, `.bin`) directly (e.g., Simplicity Commander)|SE accepts the image to flash and boot regardless of the firmware image version.|The SE accepts and boots the firmware image if its version is equal to or higher than the stored version. A lower version will be blocked at boot.|

> **Note**: [Series 2 devices only] The device needs to execute a mass erase (`commander device masserase` or `commander security erasedevice` then reset) before flashing a GBL hex image (`.s37`) to the device if [SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW](#simplicity-commander) or [SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL](#simplicity-commander) option in SE OTP is enabled.

For simplicity, the [Secure Boot examples](#secure-boot) in this application note do not enable the following options for Secure Boot.

- `SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW`
- `SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL`

> **Note**: `SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW` and `SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL` are only available on Series 2 devices.

### Simplicity Commander

The following procedures assume the required files are in the same folder.

1. Follow the procedures in [Generate Key and Signing](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate the ECDSA-P256 Sign Key pair (`sign_key.pem` and `sign_pubkey.pem`) and Public Sign Key token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`).
2. Run the `security writekey` command to provision the Public Sign Key (`sign_pubkey.pem`) to the SE OTP slot. The Public Sign Key cannot be changed once written.  
   ```sh  
   commander security writekey --sign sign_pubkey.pem --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Device has serial number 000000000000000014b457fffe045b21  
     
   ================================================================================  
   Please look through any warnings before proceeding.  
   THIS IS A ONE-TIME command, all code to be run on the device must be signed by this key.  
   Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:  
   ================================================================================  
   continue  
   DONE  
   ```
3. Run the `security readkey` command to verify the Public Sign Key with the Public Sign Key in the token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`).  
   ```sh  
   commander security readkey --sign --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   C4AF4AC69AAB9512DB50F7A26AE5B4801183D85417E729A56DA974F4E08A562C  
   DE6019DEA9411332DC1A743372D170B436238A34597C410EA177024DE20FC819  
   DONE  
   ```
4. For Series 2 VSE devices (like EFR32MG22C224F512IM40), run the `flash` command to program the Public Sign Key in the token file (`sign_pubkey.txt`) to the top page of the main flash for [ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot). It is optional on Series 2 HSE and Series 3 devices.  
   ```sh  
   commander flash --tokengroup znet --tokenfile sign_pubkey.txt --device EFR32MG22C224F512IM40 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Writing 8192 bytes starting at address 0x0007e000  
   Comparing range 0x0007E000 - 0x0007FFFF (8 KiB)  
   Programming range 0x0007E000 - 0x0007FFFF (8 KiB)  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The MCU Series 2 devices (like EFM32PG22C200F512IM40) require Simplicity Commander Version 1.12.2 or above to support the `flash --tokengroup znet` command.
5. Run the `security genconfig` command to generate the `user_configuration.json` file for secure boot.  
   ```sh  
   commander security genconfig --nostore --outfile user_configuration.json --device EFR32MG21A010F1024  
   --serialno 440048205  
   DONE  
   ```  
   |**Name**|**Description**|  
   |---|---|  
   |SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE|If set, verifies the host image on the Cortex-M33 before releasing the Cortex-M33 from reset.|  
   |SECURE_BOOT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE|If set, requires certificate-based signing of the host image.|  
   |SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK|If set, prevents secure upgrading to a host image with an equal or lower version than the image that is currently stored in flash.|  
   |SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW|If set, locks flash pages that have been validated by the Secure Boot process to prevent re-flashing by other means than through the SE. Write/erase locks pages from 0 through the page where the Secure Boot host image signature is located, not including the last page if the signature is not on a page boundary.|  
   |SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL|If set, locks flash pages that have been validated by the Secure Boot process to prevent re-flashing by other means than through the SE. Write/erase locks pages from 0 through the page where the Secure Boot host image signature is located, including the last page if the signature is not on a page boundary.|  
   > **Notes**: The host image is the firmware in the device's flash starting address. It is usually the GBL.  
   >   
   > SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_NARROW and SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL are not available in Series 3 devices.
6. Use a text editor to modify the default secure boot settings to the desired configurations used in this application note.  
   ![Secure boot settings](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image26.jpg)  
   > **Note**: For devices prior to EFR32xG23, if `SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE` is set to false, the SE ignores the other four options regardless of their values, whereas on EFR32xG23 and future Series 2 devices, this configuration cannot be programmed to the SE OTP.
7. Follow the procedure in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) to flash a bootloader image for signature based secure boot.  
   OR  
   Follow the procedure in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to flash a bootloader image for certificate based secure boot.
8. Run the `security writeconfig` command to program the secure boot configuration to the SE OTP. You can execute this command once per device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security writeconfig --configfile user_configuration.json --device EFR32MG21A010F1024  
   --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   ================================================================================  
     
   THIS IS A ONE-TIME configuration: Please inspect file before confirming: user_configuration.json  
   Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:  
   ================================================================================  
   continue  
   DONE  
   ```
9. Run the `security readconfig` command to check the secure boot configuration of the device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security readconfig --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ![Secure Boot configuration](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image27.jpg)  
   > **Note**: Enabling Anti-rollback during development involves updating the firmware version every time you decide to flash a new image, this adds complexity. Therefore, it is recommended to enable Anti-rollback during production.

### SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example

1. Click the **View Project Documentation** link to open the readme file.  
   ![Key Provisioning Sample Application](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image28.jpg)
2. Modify the default Public Sign Key in `public_sign_key[PUB_KEY_SIZE]` array in `app_process.c` to the desired values.  
   ```sh  
   /// Public sign key  
   SL_ALIGN(4) static const uint8_t public_sign_key[PUB_KEY_SIZE] = {   
     0xc4, 0xaf, 0x4a, 0xc6, 0x9a, 0xab, 0x95, 0x12,  
   0xdb, 0x50, 0xf7, 0xa2, 0x6a, 0xe5, 0xb4, 0x80,   
   0x11, 0x83, 0xd8, 0x54, 0x17, 0xe7, 0x29, 0xa5,  
   0x6d, 0xa9, 0x74, 0xf4, 0xe0, 0x8a, 0x56, 0x2c,  
   0xde, 0x60, 0x19, 0xde, 0xa9, 0x41, 0x13, 0x32,  
   0xdc, 0x1a, 0x74, 0x33, 0x72, 0xd1, 0x70, 0xb4,  
   0x36, 0x23, 0x8a, 0x34, 0x59, 0x7c, 0x41, 0x0e,  
   0xa1, 0x77, 0x02, 0x4d, 0xe2, 0x0f, 0xc8, 0x19  
   };  
   ```
3. Modify the default secure boot settings in `init_se_otp_conf()` function in `app_se_manager_key_provisioning.c` to the desired configuration.  
   ```sh  
   // Overwrite secure boot options in SL_SE_OTP_INIT_DEFAULT if necessary.  
   otp_init.enable_secure_boot = true;  
   otp_init.verify_secure_boot_certificate = false;  
   otp_init.enable_anti_rollback = true;  
   otp_init.secure_boot_page_lock_narrow = false;  
   otp_init.secure_boot_page_lock_full = false;  
   ```  
   > **Note**: If `enable_secure_boot` is false, the SE will ignore the other four options regardless of whether they are true or false. The EFR32xG23 and higher Series 2 devices do not allow this setting to program to the SE OTP.
4. Follow the procedures in [Generate an Unsigned Application Image](#generate-an-unsigned-application-image) to generate the unsigned application image if the GBL is present in the device.
5. Build the project and run the application. Follow the procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) if a signed application image is required.
6. Then press **SPACE** to skip the programming of the AES-128 key (HSE devices only). Optional to press **ENTER** to program the hard-coded [GBL Decryption Key](#se-manager-key-provisioning-platform-example-2) to HSE OTP.

## Provision GBL Decryption Key

The GBL Decryption Key is used to decrypt the [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) payloads during firmware upgrade. You should provision this key before enabling the **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** option in AppBuilder plugin and [3.4.1.2 Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component).

The following figures and table show the available options, two for VSE and three for HSE, for selecting the GBL Decryption Key used to decrypt the GBL upgrade image (bootloader, SE, or application).

![App Builder Options](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image39.jpg)

![Bootloader Software Component Options](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image40.jpg)

|**Option for GBL Decryption Key Selection**|**GBL Decryption Key Storage**|
|---|---|
|1. Use symmetric key stored in Secure Element storage (HSE devices only and GSDK ≥ v3.0).|The 128-bit symmetric key stored in HSE OTP is used for GBL upgrade image file decryption.|
|2. Use symmetric key stored in Application Properties Struct (GSDK ≥ v4.1).|The 128-bit symmetric key stored in the GBL Application Properties Struct is used for GBL upgrade image file decryption. The key is stored in the Secure flash if TrustZone is implemented.|
|3. Default storage if none of the above options are selected.|The 128-bit symmetric key stored on the top page of the main flash is used for GBL upgrade image file decryption. The key is stored in the Non-secure flash if TrustZone is implemented.|

**Note**:

- Option 2 requires `ApplicationProperties_t` struct v1.2 or higher (defined in `application_properties.h` in the Windows folder `C:\Users\<PC USER NAME>\SimplicityStudio\SDKs\gecko_sdk\platform\bootloader\api`) in GSDK v4.1 or higher to store the GBL Decryption Key.

```c
/// Major version number of the ApplicationProperties_t struct #define APPLICATION_PROPERTIES_VERSION_MAJOR (1UL)
/// Minor version number of the ApplicationProperties_t struct #define APPLICATION_PROPERTIES_VERSION_MINOR (2UL)
```

```sh
/// Application Properties struct typedef struct {
/// @brief Magic value indicating this is an ApplicationProperties_t struct.
/// Must equal @ref APPLICATION_PROPERTIES_MAGIC uint8_t magic[16];
/// Version number of this struct uint32_t structVersion;
/// Type of signature this application is signed with uint32_t signatureType;
/// Location of the signature. Typically points to the end of the application uint32_t signatureLocation;
/// Information about the application ApplicationData_t app;
/// Pointer to information about the certificate ApplicationCertificate_t *cert;
/// Pointer to Long Token Data Section uint8_t *longTokenSectionAddress;
/// Parser Decryption Key const uint8_t decryptKey[16];
} ApplicationProperties_t;
```

- Option 2 must be implemented before signing the GBL image for [ECDSA-P256-SHA256](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [certificate-based](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) Secure Boot.
- The options for the GBL Decryption Key are mutually exclusive. Either one of the two (VSE) or three (HSE) key storages will be selected for decryption.
- From a security point of view, it is highly recommended to use or upgrade to option 1 for HSE devices and option 2 for VSE devices.
- If the GBL Decryption Key in the selected option is compromised, the simple way is to upgrade the GBL to option 2 (if the existing option is 1 or 3) with the new GBL Decryption Key.

### Simplicity Commander

The following procedures describe how to program the GBL Decryption Key for the options below. All procedures assume the required files are in the same folder.

- Use symmetric key stored in Secure Element storage (HSE devices only and GSDK ≥ v3.0)
- Use symmetric key stored in Application Properties Struct (GSDK ≥ v4.1)
- Default Storage on the Top Page of the Main Flash

1. Generate a 128-bit Symmetric Key.  
   Run the `util genkey` command to generate the token file for the GBL Decryption Key.  
   ```sh  
   commander util genkey --type aes-ccm --outfile aes_key.txt  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Using Windows' Cryptographic random number generator  
   DONE  
   ```
2. (**Use symmetric key stored in Secure Element storage**) Run the `security writekey` command to provision the GBL Decryption Key to the SE OTP slot. The GBL Decryption Key cannot be changed once written.  
   ```sh  
   commander security writekey --decrypt aes_key.txt --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440030580  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Device has serial number 0000000000000000000d6ffffead3d94  
     
   ================================================================================  
   Please look through any warnings before proceeding.  
   THIS IS A ONE-TIME command, any encrypting of GBL files must be done with this key.  
   Type 'continue' and hit enter to proceed or Ctrl-C to abort:  
   ================================================================================  
   continue  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: It cannot read back the GBL Decryption Key from the HSE OTP.
3. (**Use symmetric key stored in Application Properties Struct**) Run the `convert` command to program the GBL Decryption Key to the `Application Properties Struct` of the GBL.  
   ```sh  
   commander convert bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --aeskey aes_key.txt --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Parsing file bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
   Writing to bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
   Overwriting file: bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
   DONE  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - The `--aeskey` option in the `convert` command requires **Simplicity Commander v1.12.3 or above**.  
   - The GBL Decryption Key can only be added to the GBL with `Application Properties Struct` v1.2 or higher.
4. (**Default Storage on the Top Page of the Main Flash**) Run the `flash` command to program the GBL Decryption Key in the token file to the top page of the main flash.  
   ```sh  
   commander flash --tokengroup znet --tokenfile aes_key.txt --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440030580  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Writing 8192 bytes starting at address 0x000fe000  
   Comparing range 0x000FE000 - 0x000FFFFF (8 KB)  
   Programming range 0x000FE000 - 0x000FFFFF (8 KB)  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The MCU Series 2 VSE devices (like EFM32PG22C200F512IM40) require Simplicity Commander Version 1.12.2 or above to support the flash --tokengroup znet command.

### SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example

This example only applies to [option 1](#provision-gbl-decryption-key) for Series 2 and Series 3 HSE devices. Click the **View Project Documentation** link to open the readme file.

![Key Provisioning Sample Application](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image28.jpg)

1. Modify the default GBL Decryption Key in the `aes_key[16]` array in `app_process.c` to the desired values.  
   ```sh  
   /// 128-bit AES key  
   SL_ALIGN(4) static const uint8_t aes_key[16] = {   
   0x81, 0xa5, 0xe2, 0x1f, 0xa1, 0x52, 0x86, 0xf1,   
   0xdf, 0x44, 0x5c, 0x2c, 0xc1, 0x20, 0xfa, 0x3f  
   };  
   ```
2. Modify the `ciphertext[16]` array in `app_process.c` to the expected ciphertext for AES ECB on 16 bytes zero plaintext to verify the GBL Decryption Key in step 1.  
   ```sh  
   /// Ciphertext to verify 128-bit AES key static const uint8_t ciphertext[16] = {  
   0x66, 0xd2, 0x0f, 0x99, 0x65, 0x3e, 0xa8, 0xd0, 0x83, 0x05, 0xa6, 0x39, 0xd4, 0x4e, 0x98, 0xa6  
   };  
   ```
3. Follow the procedures in [Generate an Unsigned Application Image](#generate-an-unsigned-application-image) to generate the unsigned application image if the GBL is present in the device.
4. Build the project and run the application. Follow the procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) if a signed application image is required.
5. Then press ENTER to program the hard-coded GBL Decryption Key to HSE OTP.  
   ```sh  
   SE Manager Key Provisioning Example - Core running at 38000 kHz.  
   . SE manager initialization... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 9 time: 0 us)  
     
   . Get current SE firmware version... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 3578 time: 94 us)

   ```
6. Press **ENTER** to confirm the operation. The program either returns `SL_STATUS_OK` or `SL_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER` (already present) and performs AES ECB encryption to verify the GBL Decryption Key in HSE OTP.  
   ```sh  
   . Initialize 128-bit AES key... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 39059 time: 1027 us)  
     
   . Encrypt 16 bytes plaintext with 128-bit AES OTP key... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 11013 time: 289 us)  
   + Compare encrypted message with expected ciphertext... OK  
     
   . Press ENTER to program public sign key in SE OTP or press SPACE to skip.  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   . Initialize 128-bit AES key... SL_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (cycles: 4474 time: 117 us)  
     
   . Encrypt 16 bytes plaintext with 128-bit AES OTP key... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 11001 time: 289 us)  
   + Compare encrypted message with expected ciphertext... OK  
     
   . Press ENTER to program public sign key in SE OTP or press SPACE to skip.  
   ```
7. Press **SPACE** to skip the programming of the Public Sign Key.

   ```

## Secure Boot

You should usually not enable Secure Boot during the development phase to avoid a clash on [debugging](04-debugging-on-secure-boot-enabled-device#debugging-on-secure-boot-enabled-device). The Secure Boot feature is enabled near firmware release and uses the following sections to validate the configuration and system functionality.

### Generate an Unsigned GBL Image

There are two ways to configure the application firmware through a GBL project.

1. Use [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) (`.isc file`) in **GSDK v3.2 and lower**.
2. Use [Bootloader-core software component](#bootloader-core-software-component) (`.slcp` file) in **GSDK v4.0 and higher**, and **SiSDK v2024.6.0 and higher**.

The following notes apply to the AppBuilder and Bootloader-core software component.

- Enabling the **Allow use of public key from manufacturing token storage** option is mandatory on VSE devices (cannot be disabled in AppBuilder and is discarded in Bootloader-core software component) for [ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot).
- The HSE device ignores this default enabled option if the Public Sign Key has been provisioned in OTP.
- When the **Enable application rollback protection** option (GSDK ≥ v3.0) is enabled, the GBL stores an application version counter at the end of the bootloader space in flash. The GBL checks this version during upgrades and at every boot, but it does not prevent flashing an older image onto the device.
- The **Minimum application version allowed** option (GSDK ≥ v3.0) sets the lowest application version that can boot. This option maintains the version counter, which resets to 0 after upgrading the GBL.
- The **Enable application rollback protection** option is not applicable if the [SECURE_BOOT_PAGE_LOCK_FULL](#simplicity-commander) in SE OTP is enabled. See section "_Secure Boot with Application Rollback Protection_" in [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf) (for GSDK v3.2 and lower), [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/), or [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User’s Guide for Series 3 and Higher](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-series3-and-higher/) for details about the application rollback protection.
- The GBL size and starting address are device-dependent. For more information about the bootloader size and starting address on Series 2, see section "Memory Space For Bootloading" in [Bootloader Fundamentals](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-fundamentals/).

Refer to [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) to create GBL upgrade image file for the **Require signed firmware upgrade files** and **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** options. For simplicity, the Secure Boot examples in this application note do not enable these options. Refer to [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf), [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/), or [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User’s Guide for Series 3 and Higher](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-series3-and-higher/) for information about these options.

The following sections describe how to build the unsigned GBL image from the **UART XMODEM Bootloader** (GSDK < v4.1) or **Bootloader - NCP UART XMODEM** (GSDK ≥ v4.1).

![Bootloader options](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image41.jpg)

#### AppBuilder

This application note uses UART XMODEM Bootloader example v1.12.0 in GSDK v3.2.3. The procedures and pictures may be different for the other versions of this example.

1. Create a UART XMODEM Bootloader project.
2. The **Plugins** tab in AppBuilder (bootloader-uart-xmodem.isc) shows the default configurations for the UART XMODEM Bootloader example.
3. Use **Bootloader Core, provides API: core** in the **Plugins** tab to set up the application firmware configurations.  
   a. This application note uses the configuration below for [ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot).  
   ```c  
   ![ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot configuration](./resources/sld794-image42.jpeg)  
   ```  
   b. This application note uses the configuration below for [Certificate-based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).  
   ```c  
   ![Certificate-based Secure Boot configuration](./resources/sld794-image43.jpeg)  
   ```
4. Enter a higher version number (default is 0) to the macro **BOOTLOADER_VERSION_MAIN_CUSTOMER** → **Value** in the **Additional Macros** field on the **Other** tab for [anti-rollback protection](#provision-public-sign-key-and-secure-boot-enabling) of GBL.  
   ![Bootloader version macro](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image44.png)
5. The default setting of GBL will overwrite the existing application image when upgrading the GBL or SE. It forces to update the application image even without changes on the firmware. Use the AppBuilder settings below to keep the existing application image when upgrading the GBL or SE.  
   a. Enter the required application image size to the macro **BTL_APP_SPACE_SIZE** → **Value** in the **Additional Macros** field on the **Other** tab. Check the **-D?** checkbox to add this definition to the project.  
   ```c  
    This application note uses 507904 (496 kB) to replace the default value of ((FLASH_BASE + FLASH_SIZE) - BTL_APPLICATION_BASE).  
     
    ![Bootloader application size macro](./resources/sld794-image45.jpeg)  
   ```  
   b. The **Base address of bootloader upgrade image** ≥ (**BTL_APP_SPACE_SIZE** + size of the GBL). The example in this application note uses EFR32MG21A010F1024:  
   ```c  
    Base address of bootloader upgrade image = 507904 (496 kB) + 16384 (16 kB for GBL) = 524288 (512 kB)  
     
    ![Base address of bootlader upgrade image](./resources/sld794-image46.png)  
     
    > **Note**: The default value of Base address of bootloader upgrade image is 32768 (32 kB).  
   ```  
   c. The (**Base address of bootloader upgrade image** + size of the GBL or SE + upgrade file overhead) ≤ the available size of the device main flash for application use (see project linker file for details).  
   ```c  
    The example in this application note uses EFR32MG21A010F1024:  
     
    512 kB (Base address of bootloader upgrade image) + 16 kB (GBL) or 48 kB (SE) + overhead bytes \< 1024 kB (size of main flash)  
     
    For more information about the size of the GBL and SE, see section *Storage Space Size Configuration* in [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf).  
     
    > **Note**: It requires GBL v1.11.0 or above to support this feature.  
   ```
6. Click [**Generate**] in the right upper corner.
7. In the **Generation Successful** dialog, click [**OK**].
8. Build the project to generate the unsigned GBL image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`).
9. **(Optional)** Run the `util appinfo` command to check all available information (application properties) in an unsigned GBL image. The `App version` is the GBL version for the [SECURE_BOOT_ANTI_ROLLBACK](#simplicity-commander) option.

```sh
commander util appinfo bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37
```

```sh

> **Note**: For TrustZone-aware bootloaders, the unsigned GBL image is the combined image of Secure and Non-secure bootloaders. The **Bootloader-core** component is installed in the Secure bootloader.

### Generate an Unsigned Application Image

This section describes how to generate an unsigned application image for the GBL.

1. For Series 2 devices, the application image should be placed on the main flash page after the GBL. For more information about the application starting address, see section _Memory Space For Bootloading_ in [Bootloader Fundamentals](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-fundamentals/).
2. For Series 3 devices, the application image should be placed in the code region 1 next to the bootloader which is in region 0, see section _External Flash Architecture in Series 3 Devices_ in [Platform Memory Model](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/platform-memory-model/).
3. **(Simplicity Studio 5)** You can use the **Bootloader Application Interface** component to set up the start address of the application image. This application note uses **Platform - Blink Bare-metal** example in GSDK v3.2.3. The procedures and pictures may be different on other versions of the GSDK. The following steps can apply to other platform examples in GSDK and SiSDK.  
   a. Create a **Platform - Blink Bare-metal** project.  
   b. The **Software Components** tab shows the list of available components (`blink_baremetal.slcp`) that you can install in the project.  
   c. Select **Platform > Bootloader > Bootloader Application Interface**.  
   d. Click [**Install**].  
   ![Bootloader Application Interface](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image53.jpg)  
   > **Note**: For the wireless protocol stack example, the Bootloader Application Interface component is already present in the project.
4. The application image should contain an `ApplicationProperties_t` struct (defined in `application_properties.h` in the Windows folder below) declaring the application version, capabilities, and other metadata.  
   For GSDK v3.2 and lower: `C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\<GSDK VERSION>\platform\bootloader\api`  
   For SiSDK v2024.6.0 and higher, or GSDK v4.0 and higher: `C:\Users\<PC USER NAME>\SimplicityStudio\SDKs\gecko_sdk\platform\bootloader\api`  
   Below is an example source file `app_properties.c` with `ApplicationProperties_t` struct for Secure Boot on GSDK v3.2 and lower.  
   ```sh  
   #include <stddef.h>  
   #include "application_properties.h"  
     
   const ApplicationProperties_t sl_app_properties = {  
   .magic = APPLICATION_PROPERTIES_MAGIC,  
   .structVersion = APPLICATION_PROPERTIES_VERSION,  
   .signatureType = APPLICATION_SIGNATURE_NONE,  
   .signatureLocation = 0,  
   .app = {  
       .type = APPLICATION_TYPE_MCU,  
       .version = 1UL,  
       .capabilities = 0UL,  
       .productId = {0U},  
   },  
   };  
   ```  
   The `signatureType` and `signatureLocation` are filled by Simplicity Commander when signing the application image using the `convert` command.
5. The following table describes how to add the `app_properties.c` file in step 4 to **Platform - Blink Bare-metal** project. For the wireless protocol stack example, the `app_properties.c` file with `ApplicationProperties_t` struct is already present in the project.  
   **App properties for older Simplicity Studio and GSDK versions**  
   |**Simplicity Studio 4 & Simplicity Studio 5 with GSDK v3.2 and lower**|**Simplicity Studio 5 with GSDK v4.0 and higher**|  
   |---|---|  
   |Manually added|Automatically added after installing the Bootloader Application Interface component in step 3 to the project.|  
   > **Note**: Refer to the [Knowledge Article](https://community.silabs.com/s/article/what-are-the-steps-to-add-application-properties-to-a-application-project-x?language=en_US) in Silicon Labs Community to add `app_properties.c` to the project in Simplicity Studio 4.
6. **(Simplicity Studio 4 & Simplicity Studio 5 with GSDK v3.2 and lower)** Enter a higher version number to `.version` in `app_properties.c` for [anti-rollback protection](#generate-an-unsigned-gbl-image) (if enabled) of the application.
7. **(Simplicity Studio 5 with GSDK v4.0 and higher)** Click [**Configure**] in the **App Properties** component under **Platform** > **Bootloader** to open the **App Properties** configuration. The example below uses GSDK v4.0. The procedures and pictures may be different on other versions of the GSDK.  
   ![App Properties component](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image54.jpg)
8. Enter a higher version number to **Version number for this application** dialog box in **App Properties settings** for [anti-rollback protection](#generate-an-unsigned-gbl-image) (if enabled) of the application.  
   ![App properties version number dialog box](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image55.png)  
   > **Note**: The `app_properties.c` is in the Windows folder below.  
   >   
   > `C:\Users\<PC USER NAME>\SimplicityStudio\SDKs\gecko_sdk\platform\bootloader\app_properties`
9. Build the project to generate the unsigned application image file (`blink_baremetal.s37`).
10. **(Optional)** Run the `util appinfo` command to check all available information about `ApplicationProperties_t` struct in an un-signed application image. The App version is for the **Enable application rollback protection** option in the [AppBuilder](#appbuilder or [Bootloader-core software component](#bootloader-core-software-component).

```sh
commander util appinfo blink_baremetal.s37

For Series 2 devices: If the configuration flag SECURE_BOOT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE is set or a device has previously seen certificate based signing, it will not accept direct signing.
DONE
```

**Note:** For the TrustZone-aware applications, the unsigned application image is the combined image of Secure and Non-secure applications. The `ApplicationProperties_t` struct is located in the Secure application.

### Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot

The following figure describes the signing and verification for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot.

![ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Sign and Verify](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-ecdsa-p256-sha256-sign-verify.png)

> **Note**: The bootloader cannot access the Public Sign Key in VSE OTP to verify the application image. Therefore VSE devices need to store a [Public Sign Key copy](#simplicity-commander) on the top page of the main flash (see section _Key Storage_ in [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf)/[Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/)).

**Public Sign Key usage for VSE and HSE Devices**

|**Device**|**FSB to Verify the Bootloader Image**|**SSB to Verify the Application Image**|
|---|---|---|
|HSE|Use the Public Sign Key in HSE OTP|Use the Public Sign Key in HSE OTP|
|VSE|Use the Public Sign Key in VSE OTP|Use the Public Sign Key on the top page of the main flash|

The HSE device ignores the default enabled [Allow use of public key from manufacturing token storage option](02-secure-boot-process#application-firmware) once the Public Sign Key has been provisioned.

To have better protection on the Public Sign Key, the [certificate-based](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) Secure Boot is strongly recommended on VSE devices since the SSB does not require accessing the Public Sign Key to verify the application signature.

The following sections provide two methods to sign the bootloader image and application image files. All procedures assume the required files are in the same folder.

1. Using Simplicity Commander
2. Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander

#### Bootloader Image File

1. If Secure Boot flag is not enabled in SE OTP, follow the procedures in [Simplicity Commander](#simplicity-commander) to set up the ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot configuration for the bootloader.
2. Follow the procedures in [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) or [Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component) to set up the ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot configuration for the user application to generate an unsigned bootloader image.
3. The following steps show two methods to generate a signed bootloader image—either directly with Simplicity Commander (3a) or using an HSM with Commander (3b).  
   a. **(Using Simplicity Commander)** Run the `convert` command with **Private Sign Key** to overwrite the unsigned bootloader image file with the signed bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`).  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander	convert	bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37	--secureboot	--keyfile	sign_key.pem	--verify sign_pubkey.pem  
    --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
    ```  
     
    ```sh

    Writing to bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
    Overwriting file: bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
    DONE  
    ```  
   ```  
   b. **(Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander)** Run the `convert` command with `--extsign` option to generate an external signing bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign`).  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander convert bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --secureboot --extsign --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    Parsing file bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37... Found Application Properties at 0x00002b1c  
    Writing Application Properties signature pointer to point to 0x00002d08  
    Setting signature type in Application Properties: 0x00000001  
    Writing to bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign...  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Use an HSM containing the Private Sign Key to generate the signature for the external signing bootloader image. This example uses the [OpenSSL](#using-an-external-tool) with the **Private Sign Key** to simulate this process. The signature is in the `bl_signature.der`.  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign sign_key.pem -out bl_signature.der bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign  
    ```  
     
    Run the `convert` command with the **bootloader image signature** to overwrite the unsigned bootloader image file with the signed bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`).  
     
    ```sh  
    commander convert bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --secureboot --signature bl_signature.der  
    --verify sign_pubkey.pem --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
    ```  
     
    ```sh

    DONE  
    ```  
   ```
4. **(Optional)** Run the `util appinfo` command to check all available information about `ApplicationProperties_t` struct in a signed GBL image.  
   ```sh  
   commander util appinfo bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Parsing file bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...

   For Series 2 devices: If the configuration flag SECURE_BOOT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE is set or a device has previously seen certificate based signing, it will not accept direct signing.  
   DONE  
   ```
5. The signed bootloader image file (`.s37`) can be used for [production programming](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/prod-programming-series2-and-series3/) or for generating a [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for bootloader upgrade.
6. Run the `flash` command to program the signed bootloader image (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`) to the device if the device does not have a bootloader.  
   ```sh  
   commander flash bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh

4. The signed application image file (`.s37`) can be used for [production programming](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/prod-programming-series2-and-series3/) or for generating a [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for application upgrade.

### Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot

The following figure describes the signing and verification for certificate-based Secure Boot. You can freely switch between standard and advanced certificate-based Secure Boot by upgrading the application firmware without and with the application certificate.

#### Certificate

The following table describes the elements of a certificate.

|**Element**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Certificate structure version|The version of the certificate structure.|
|Reserved flags|Reserved in the current certificate structure version.|
|Certificate public key|ECDSA-P256 public key, X and Y coordinates concatenated, used to validate the image.|
|Certificate version|The version of the running certificate.|
|Certificate signature|ECDSA-P256 signature, used for the authentication of the public key and the certificate version.|

**Notes**:

- The `application_properties.h` file in the Windows folder below defines the parameters of the certificate structure (`ApplicationCertificate_t`).  
  For GSDK v3.2 and lower: `C:\SiliconLabs\SimplicityStudio\v5\developer\sdks\gecko_sdk_suite\<GSDK VERSION>\platform\bootloader\api`  
  For GSDK v4.0 and higher: `C:\Users\<PC USER NAME>\SimplicityStudio\SDKs\gecko_sdk\platform\bootloader\api`
- The certificate is not in X.509 format.

#### Private/Public Key Pair

The following table describes two Private/Public Key pairs used in certificates for certificate-based Secure Boot. You can use [Simplicity Commander or HSM](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate these key pairs.

|**Certificate**|**Private Key**|**Public Key**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Bootloader (bl_cert.bin) (1)|bl_cert_key.pem (Private Bootloader Key)|bl_cert_pubkey.pem (Public Bootloader Key)|The bootloader certificate is signed by the Private Sign Key corresponding to the Public Sign Key in SE OTP.|
|Application (app_cert.bin) (2)|app_cert_key.pem (Private Application Key)|app_cert_pubkey.pem (Public Application Key)|The application certificate is signed by the Private Bootloader Key corresponding to the Public Bootloader Key in the bootloader certificate.|

**Notes**:

1. a. Certificate version in the bootloader certificate < certificate version in SE flash - the certificate is rejected.  
   b. Certificate version in the bootloader certificate = certificate version in SE flash - the certificate is accepted.  
   c. Certificate version in the bootloader certificate > certificate version in SE flash - the certificate is accepted. The certificate version in SE flash is updated to match ([revocation mechanism](#certificate-revocation)).
2. The certificate version in the application certificate is compared with the certificate version in the bootloader certificate. The application certificate is accepted if its version is equal to or higher than the certificate version in the bootloader certificate.

The following sections provide two methods to sign the bootloader image and application image files. All procedures assume the required files are in the same folder.

1. Using Simplicity Commander
2. Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander

#### Bootloader Image File

1. If Certificated based Secure Boot flag is not enabled in SE OTP, follow the procedures in [Simplicity Commander](#simplicity-commander) to set up the certificate-based Secure Boot configuration for the bootloader.
2. Follow the procedures in [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) or [Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component) to set up the certificate-based Secure Boot configuration for the user application to generate an unsigned bootloader image.
3. The following steps show two methods to generate a bootloader certificate, either directly with Simplicity Commander (3a) or using an HSM with Commander (3b).  
   a. **(Using Simplicity Commander)** Run the `util gencert` command with **Public Bootloader Key** and **Private Sign Key** to generate the bootloader certificate (`bl_cert.bin`). Refer to the table abovefor details about the `--cert-version` for bootloader certificate.  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander util gencert --cert-type secureboot --cert-version 1 --cert-pubkey bl_cert_pubkey.pem  
    --sign sign_key.pem --outfile bl_cert.bin  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    Successfully signed certificate  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Run the `convert` command with **Bootloader Certificate** and **Private Bootloader Key** to overwrite the unsigned bootloader image file with the signed bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`).  
     
    ```sh  
    commander convert bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --secureboot --certificate bl_cert.bin  
    --keyfile bl_cert_key.pem --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
    ```  
     
    ```sh

    DONE  
    ```  
   ```  
   b. **(Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander)** Run the `util gencert` command with **Public Bootloader Key** and `--extsign` option to generate an external signing bootloader certificate (`bl_cert.extsign`). Refer to the table above for details about the `--cert-version` for bootloader certificate.  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander util gencert --cert-type secureboot --cert-version 1 --cert-pubkey bl_cert_pubkey.pem  
    --extsign --outfile bl_cert  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Use an HSM containing the Private Sign Key to generate the signature for the external signing bootloader certificate. This example uses the [OpenSSL](#using-an-external-tool) with the **Private Sign Key** to simulate this process. The signature is in the `bl_cert_signature.der`.  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign sign_key.pem -out bl_cert_signature.der bl_cert.extsign  
    ```  
     
    Run the `util signcert` command with the **bootloader certificate signature** to generate the bootloader certificate (`bl_cert.bin`).  
     
    ```sh  
    commander util signcert bl_cert.extsign --cert-type secureboot --signature bl_cert_signature.der  
    --verify sign_pubkey.pem --outfile bl_cert.bin  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    R = 065A58EA6CE6BBA44F3C59C6D255A901DBBC55FA97F261658B2026ABC8CD9680  
    S = 8A0011AA6393BC284B13C8313EE6772030DE07E213E74CA0FEA740F3D33E6518  
    Successfully verified signature Successfully signed certificate  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Run the `convert` command with **Bootloader Certificate** and `--extsign` option to generate an external signing bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign`).  
     
    ```sh  
    commander convert bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --secureboot --certificate bl_cert.bin --extsign  
    --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem  
    ```  
   ```
4. **(Optional)** Run the `util verifysign` command with **Public Sign Key** to verify that the **Bootloader Certificate and image** were correctly signed.  
   ```sh  
   commander util verifysign bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --verify sign_pubkey.pem  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Parsing file bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37... Found application properties at 0x00002d78 Found certificate at 0x00002cf0  
   Successfully verified certificate signature with verification key.  
   Using certificate key to verify application signature.  
   Successfully verified application signature.  
   DONE  
   ```
5. **(Optional)** Run the `util appinfo` command to check all available information about `ApplicationProperties_t` struct in a signed GBL image.  
   ```sh  
   commander util appinfo bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37  
   ```  
   ```sh

   DONE  
   ```
6. The signed bootloader image file (`.s37`) can be used for [production programming](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/prod-programming-series2-and-series3/) or for generating a [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for bootloader upgrade.
7. Run the `flash` command to program the signed bootloader image (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`) to the device if the device does not have a bootloader.

```sh
commander flash bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205
```

```sh

5. The signed application image file (`.s37`) can be used for [production programming](https://docs.silabs.com/iot-security/latest/series2-secure-debug/) or for generating a [GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for application upgrade.

### Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File

This section provides steps to create GBL files used to upgrade bootloader, application and/or SE firmware on Series 2 and Series 3 devices.

> **Note**: Series 3 devices support only GBLv4 files for firmware upgrade process.

- Follow the procedures in [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) or [Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component) to avoid overwriting the existing application image (if necessary) when upgrading the bootloader or SE.
- For a standalone bootloader with communication interface, you can only generate three separate GBL upgrade image files containing bootloader, SE, and application images.
- (Series 2 devices) For an application bootloader with storage, you can generate a single GBL upgrade image file (see example below) with a combination of bootloader, SE, and application images.

```sh
commander gbl create all.gbl --app app.s37 --bootloader bl.s37 --seupgrade se.seu
```

- A signed GBL upgrade image file is required if you enable the **Require signed firmware upgrade files** option in [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) or [Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component). The following table shows which private key(s) can be used to sign the GBL upgrade image file (bootloader, SE, or application) on VSE, HSE and Series 3 devices. The VSE devices store a [Public Sign Key](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) copy on the top page of the main flash to verify the GBL upgrade image file for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot.

**Private Key(s) usage to sign GBL upgrade image file**

|**Secure Boot**|**HSE and Series 3**|**VSE**|
|---|---|---|
|ECDSA-P256-SHA256|Private Sign Key|Private Sign Key (Public Sign Key in main flash)|
|Certificate-Based|Private Sign Key or Private Bootloader Key|Private Bootloader Key|

- An encrypted GBL upgrade image file is required if you enable the **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** option in [AppBuilder](#appbuilder) or [Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component). Refer to [Provision GBL Decryption Key](#provision-gbl-decryption-key) on how to provision the GBL Decryption Key for this option.
- [Only applicable for Series 2 devices] For an application bootloader with storage, you can enable the **Upgrade SE without using the staging area** option in **GSDK v4.1.1 or higher** to directly fetch the SE image from the GBL upgrade image file in storage instead of copying the image to the pre-configured upgrade location.

![Upgrade SE without using the staging area option](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image56.jpg)

To use the above option, the SE image cannot be in the encrypted part of the GBL upgrade image file if the **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** option is enabled. Use the `--seunencrypted` option in **Simplicity Commander v1.13.0 or higher** (see example below) to generate an encrypted GBL upgrade image file with a SE image outside the encrypted part of the file.

```sh
commander gbl create se-upgrade.gbl --seupgrade secure-element.seu --seunencrypted --app myapp.s37
--encrypt aes_key.txt
```

- In Series 3 devices, the storage bootloader supports direct SE upgrades from the GBL file without the need for staging.

The following sections provide two methods to sign the bootloader, Secure Engine, and application upgrade image files if the **Require signed firmware upgrade files** option is enabled.

1. Using Simplicity Commander
2. Using an HSM and Simplicity Commander

The sections also include encryption examples with an AES-128 key (like `aes_key.txt`) for the **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** option. All procedures assume the required files are in the same folder.

Series 3 devices require GBLv4. GBLv4 is a new format that supports more command line options than the upgrade file for series 2 devices which do not support GBLv4.

- To compress an upgrade file, append `--compress <compression algorithm>` to the command, supported algorithms are `lz4` and `lzma`.
- To add the product id, append `--productid <16-byte long identifier>` to the command.
- To add the bundle version and minimum version, append `--bundleversion <version number> --minversion <version number>` to the command.

Read more about GBLv4 files and the configurations supported in **Gecko Bootloader File Format v4** section of [Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for Series 3 and Higher](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-series3-and-higher/02-gecko-bootloader-file-format-v4).

- All `gbl create` and `gbl4 create` commands support both encrypted and unencrypted images. To create an unencrypted image, omit the `--encrypt` option. To create an encrypted image, append `--encrypt aes_key.txt` to the command.

   ```
3. Creating a signed GBL upgrade image using an HSM and Simplicity Commander:  
   a. Series 2 devices: Run the `gbl create` command with `--bootloader` and `--extsign` options to generate an external signing bootloader GBL upgrade image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign`) with the signed bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`) from [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander gbl create bootloader-uart-xmodem --bootloader bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --extsign  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    Initializing GBL file...  
    Adding bootloader to GBL...  
    Preparing GBL for external signing...  
    Writing GBL file bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign...  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Use an HSM containing the Private Sign Key or Private Bootloader Key to generate the signature for the external signing bootloader GBL upgrade image file. This example uses the [OpenSSL](#using-an-external-tool) with the **Private Sign Key** or **Private Bootloader Key** to simulate this process. The signature is in the gbl_signature.der.  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign sign_key.pem -out gbl_signature.der bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl	dgst	-sha256	-binary	-sign	bl_cert_key.pem	-out	gbl_signature.der	bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign  
    ```  
     
    Run the `gbl sign` command with the **signature** above to generate a signed bootloader GBL upgrade image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.gbl`).  
     
    ```sh  
    commander	gbl	sign	bootloader-uart-xmodem.extsign	--signature	gbl_signature.der	--verify  
    sign_pubkey.pem  
    --outfile bootloader-uart-xmodem.gbl

    ```  
   ```  
   b. Series 3 devices: Run the `gbl4 create` command with `--data` and `--extsign` options to generate an unsigned and manifest files (`bootloader.unsigned` and `bootloader.manifest`) with the signed bootloader image file (`bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`) from [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).  
   ```c  
    ```sh  
    commander gbl4 create bootloader --data bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --extsign --device SIMG301LIL

    After computing the signature of bootloader.manifest, assemble the GBL4 using:  
    commander gbl4 sign bootloader.unsigned --outfile bootloader --signature <signature.der>  
    DONE  
    ```  
     
    Use an HSM containing the Private Sign Key or Private Bootloader Key to generate the signature for the manifest file. This example uses the [OpenSSL](#using-an-external-tool) with the **Private Sign Key** or **Private Bootloader Key** to simulate this process. The signature is in the `gbl_signature.der`.  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign sign_key.pem -out gbl_signature.der bootloader.manifest  
    ```  
     
    ```sh  
    openssl dgst -sha256 -binary -sign bl_cert_key.pem -out gbl_signature.der bootloader.manifest  
    ```  
   ```

### Upload a GBL Upgrade Image File

This section describes how to use UART XMODEM Bootloader v2.0.0 in GSDK v4.0 and higher to upload a GBL upgrade image file (`.gbl`) to the device. The procedures and pictures may be different for the other versions of this example.

The GBL upgrade image file uses a proprietary format to store the upgrade image for a firmware upgrade. Use the gbl create command to generate the GBL upgrade image file for bootloader, application, and Secure Engine. Refer to [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf)/[Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/) and [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for more information about GBL upgrade image file creation.

You can use any terminal software that supports the XMODEM-CRC protocol for file transfer. This application note uses [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) as terminal software. The default serial port setting is 115200 bps 8-N-1.

1. Assume the [UART XMODEM Bootloader](#generate-an-unsigned-gbl-image) and application firmware had already flashed to the radio board on WSTK.
2. Press the **RESET** and **PB0** push buttons on the WSTK.
3. Release the **RESET** push button to run the UART XMODEM Bootloader.  
   ![Options in UART XMODEM Bootloader](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image57.png)
4. Release the **PB0** push button. Press 1 (`upload gbl`) in Tera Term to upload a GBL upgrade image file.  
   ![Upload GBL option](/series2-secure-boot-with-rtsl/0.3/images/sld794-image58.png)
5. Transfer a file through XMODEM-CRC in Tera Term, navigate to **File** > **Transfer** > **XMODEM** > **Send...**.

## Upgrade to Certificate-Based Secure Boot

You can upgrade the Series 2 and Series 3 devices deployed in the field from [ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) to [certificate-based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) even if the [SECURE_BOOT_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE](#simplicity-commander) option in SE OTP is disabled.

```sh
commander security readconfig --serialno 440048205
```

```sh
MCU Flags
Secure Boot                    : Enabled
Secure Boot Verify Certificate : Disabled
Secure Boot Anti Rollback      : Enabled
Secure Boot Page Lock Narrow   : Disabled
Secure Boot Page Lock Full     : Disabled
```

The following procedures for the upgrade to certificate-based Secure Boot is an **IRREVERSIBLE** process.

1. Follow the procedures in [Generate Key and Signing](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate an ECDSA-P256 bootloader certificate key pair.
2. Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed GBL image file with the bootloader certificate key pair in step 1. The bootloader certificate version `(--cert-version` in the `util gencert` command) in this signed GBL image file must be **equal to or higher than one (≥ 1)**.
3. Follow the procedures in [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) to upgrade the bootloader to certificate-based Secure Boot. Use the [Private Sign Key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot to sign the bootloader GBL upgrade image file if required.  
   SE will use the Public Bootloader Key to [validate](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) the bootloader image once SE identifies a bootloader certificate in the bootloader image. If the bootloader certificate version from step 2 is **higher than zero (> 0) and gets verified once**, SE will never again accept the [ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) signed bootloader image. Refer to the "_Secure Boot Procedure_" section in [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf)/[Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/) for more information.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE Firmware version : 1.2.9  
   Serial number	    : 000000000000000014b457fffe045a2d  
   Debug lock	        : Disabled  
   Device erase	    : Enabled  
   Secure debug unlock : Disabled  
   Tamper status	    : Not OK  
   Secure boot	        : Enabled  
   Boot status	        : 0x18 - Failed: Secure Boot requires cert, but none found  
   DONE  
   ```
4. **(Standard Certificate-Based)** Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed application image file with the Private Bootloader Key in step 1.
5. **(Advanced Certificate-Based)** Follow the procedures in [Generate Key and Signing](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate an ECDSA-P256 application certificate key pair.  
   Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed application image file with the application certificate key pair in this step and the Private Bootloader Key in step 1. The application certificate version (`--cert-version` in the `util gencert` command) in this signed application image file must be **equal to or higher** than the bootloader certificate version in step 2 ([Private/Public Key Pair](#privatepublic-key-pair)).
6. Follow the procedures in [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) to upgrade application with the signed image from step 4 or 5 for certificate-based Secure Boot. Use the [Private Sign Key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) or [Private Bootloader key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) in **step 1** for certificate-based Secure Boot to sign the application GBL upgrade image file if required.

## Certificate Revocation

The certificate revocation is the act of invalidating a certificate when its private key shows signs of being compromised. The following procedures describe how to revoke the Series 2 and Series 3 devices' bootloader certificates deployed in the field.

1. Follow the procedures in [Generate Key and Signing](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate a new ECDSA-P256 bootloader certificate key pair.
2. Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed GBL image file with the bootloader certificate key pair in step 1. The bootloader certificate version (`--cert-version` in the `util gencert` command) in this signed GBL image file must be **higher than** the certificate version in SE flash (see [Private/Public Key Pair](#privatepublic-key-pair)).
3. Follow the procedures in [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) to upgrade the bootloader with the signed image from step 2. Use the [Private Sign Key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) or **existing** [Private Bootloader Key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for certificate-based Secure Boot to sign the bootloader GBL upgrade image file if required.
4. **(Standard Certificate-Based)** Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed application image file with the Private Bootloader Key in step 1.
5. **(Advanced Certificate-Based)** Follow the procedures in [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate the signed application image file with the Private Bootloader Key in step 1. The application certificate version (--cert-version in the util gencert command) in this signed application image file must be **equal to or higher** than the bootloader certificate version in step 2 (see [Private/Public Key Pair](#privatepublic-key-pair)).  
   You should generate a new [ECDSA-P256 application certificate key pair](#generate-key-and-signing) if the Private Application Key for the application certificate is compromised.
6. Follow the procedures in [Generate a GBL Upgrade Image File](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) to upgrade the application with the signed image from step 4 or 5. Use the [Private Sign Key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) or [Private Bootloader key](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) in **step 1** for certificate-based Secure Boot to sign the application GBL upgrade image file if required.

## Upgrade to Secure Boot with RTSL

The following procedures describe upgrading Series 2 and Series 3 devices deployed in the field without Secure Boot to Secure Boot with RTSL.

1. **(Recommended)** Upgrade SE firmware to the latest version if available. See the _Gecko Bootloader Operation - Secure Engine Upgrade_ section in [UG266](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug266-gecko-bootloader-user-guide.pdf)/[Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/).
2. Follow the procedures in [AppBuilder](#) or [3.4.1.2 Bootloader-core Software Component](#bootloader-core-software-component) to prepare an unsigned GBL image with the required [Secure Boot configuration](02-secure-boot-process#application-firmware) for the application firmware.
3. Follow the procedures in [Generate Key and Signing](#generate-key-and-signing) to generate the ECDSA-P256 Sign Key pair for Secure Boot. The key pairs for the bootloader certificate and application certificate (advanced) are required if using [Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot).
4. Follow steps 1 to 2 in [SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example](#se-manager-key-provisioning-platform-example-2) if this HSE [GBL Decryption Key option](#provision-gbl-decryption-key) is selected. Use the Public Sign Key in step 3 and follow steps 1 to 3 in [SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example](#se-manager-key-provisioning-platform-example) to generate an **unsigned** image. Use this image to create an [application GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file).
5. The original GBL (application Secure Boot is disabled) boots into the **unsigned** SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example after upgrading the application with the image file in step 4.
6. Follow steps 5 to 8 in [SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example](#se-manager-key-provisioning-platform-example) to install the Public Sign Key to SE OTP and GBL Decryption Key (optional) to HSE OTP. Press **SPACE** instead of **ENTER** in step 9 to **BYPASS** the programming of the [Secure Boot configuration](02-secure-boot-process#ssb) in SE OTP.  
   ```sh  
   . Press ENTER to initialize SE OTP for secure boot configuration or press SPACE to skip.  
     
   . SE manager deinitialization... SL_STATUS_OK (cycles: 5 time: 0 us)  
   ```  
   **Notes**:  
   - Programming the [Public Sign Key](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) to the top page of the main flash (not included in this example) is required for the VSE device ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot.  
   - Programming the GBL Decryption Key to the top page of the main flash (not included in this example) is required if the [default storage option](#provision-gbl-decryption-key) for GBL Decryption Key is selected and the **Require encrypted firmware upgrade files** option is enabled in step 2.
7. Follow the signing procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) (Bootloader Image File section, skip the Secure Boot configuration for the bootloader) with the required key(s) generated in step 3 to sign the unsigned GBL image generated from step 2. Use this signed image to create a [bootloader GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file).
8. Follow the signing procedures in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) (Application Image File section) with the required key(s) generated in step 3 to sign the unsigned application image generated from step 4. Use this signed image to create an [application GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file).  
   > **Note**: For the application bootloader with storage, you can generate a [single GBL upgrade image file](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) for signed images from steps 7 and 8.
9. The Secure Boot in SE OTP is not yet enabled, so FSB does not verify the signature when upgrading to the signed GBL in step 7. The updated GBL (application Secure Boot enabled) verifies the signature when upgrading or booting to the signed SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example in step 8.
10. Follow steps 9 to 10 (use **SPACE** to skip previous steps for OTP key programming) in [SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example](#se-manager-key-provisioning-platform-example) to program the required [Secure Boot configuration](02-secure-boot-process#ssb) in SE OTP for signed GBL.
11. Update a **signed** custom application firmware to replace the signed SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example used for Secure Boot with RTSL upgrade.

**Notes**:

- Refer to the "_Enabling Secure Boot RTSL on Series 2 and Series 3 Devices_" section (either Standalone Bootloaders or Application Bootloaders with Storage) in _UG266: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User’s Guide for GSDK 3.2 and Lower_, [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher (series 1 and 2 devices)](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4/) or [Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User’s Guide for Series 3 and Higher](https://docs.silabs.com/mcu-bootloader/latest/bootloader-user-guide-series3-and-higher/) for details.
- The SE Manager Key Provisioning Platform Example used here is just for reference. You can modify or write a new application to automate the processes for the Secure Boot with RTSL upgrade.
- If the [Require signed firmware upgrade files](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) option is enabled in step 2, the GBL upgrade image files from steps 8 and 11 must be signed.
- If the [Require encrypted firmware upgrade files](#generate-a-gbl-upgrade-image-file) option is enabled in step 2, the GBL upgrade image files from steps 8 and 11 must be encrypted. And the GBL Decryption Key for the corresponding [option](#provision-gbl-decryption-key) in GBL must be in place.

## Recover Devices when Secure Boot Fails

If a Secure Boot process fails (meaning firmware image at device starting address validation fails), the only way to recover is to flash a correctly signed image.

There are two scenarios to recover the device from a Secure Boot failure:

1. Debug Lock
2. BUSLOCK

### DEBUG LOCK

The following table describes the different debug lock scenarios on recovering the Secure Boot failure device.

|**Secure Debug**|**Device Erase**|**Debug Lock**|**State**|**Recover from Secure Boot Failure**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Disabled|Enabled|Disabled|Unlock|Flash a correctly signed image.|
|Disabled|Enabled|Enabled|Standard debug lock|Flash a correctly signed image after standard debug unlocking the device.|
|Disabled|Disabled|Enabled|Permanent debug lock|There is no way to recover the device. Make sure the programmed image is correctly signed before locking the device.|
|Enabled|Disabled|Enabled|Secure debug lock|Flash a correctly signed image after secure debug unlocking the device.|

> **Note**: The error code in the **Boot status** of examples below depends on boot failure caused by the host image (GBL).

The following procedures describe how to recover the Secure Boot failure device from the lock states below.

- Unlocked
- Standard debug locked
- Secure debug locked

1. Follow the procedure in [Signing for ECDSA-P256-SHA256 Secure Boot](#signing-for-ecdsa-p256-sha256-secure-boot) or [Signing for Certificate-Based Secure Boot](#signing-for-certificate-based-secure-boot) to generate a correctly signed GBL.
2. **(Unlocked)** Run the `security status` command to get the boot status.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE Firmware version : 1.2.9  
   Serial number	    : 000000000000000014b457fffe045afd  
   Debug lock	        : Disabled

   Secure boot	        : Enabled  
   Boot status	        : 0x12 - Failed: Error while checking signature of host firmware  
   DONE  
   ```  
   Run the `flash` command to flash the correctly signed image (like `bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`). If a failed Secure Boot is detected, the device will be erased before flashing the new image.  
   ```sh  
   commander flash bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh

   ```
3. **(Standard debug locked)** Run the `security status` command to get the boot status.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE Firmware version : 1.2.9

   Boot status	        : 0x12 - Failed: Error while checking signature of host firmware  
   DONE  
   ```  
   Run the `security erasedevice` command to unlock the device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security erasedevice --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Successfully erased device  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: Issue a power-on or pin reset to complete the unlock process.  
   Run the `flash` command to flash the correctly signed image (like `bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`). If a failed Secure Boot is detected, the device will be erased before flashing the new image.  
   ```sh  
   commander flash bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh

   Programming range 0x00002000 - 0x00003FFF (8 KiB)  
   DONE  
   ```
4. **(Secure debug locked)** Run the `security status` command to get the boot status.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE Firmware version : 1.2.9  
   Serial number	    : 0000000000000000000d6ffffe0a3a5f  
   Debug lock	        : Enabled  
   Device erase	    : Disabled  
   Secure debug unlock : Enabled  
   Tamper status	    : Not OK  
   Secure boot	        : Enabled  
   Boot status	        : 0x12 - Failed: Error while checking signature of host firmware  
   DONE  
   ```  
   Run the `security unlock` command to unlock the device with the debug unlock token.  
   ```sh  
   commander security unlock --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Unlocking with unlock payload:

   Secure debug successfully unlocked  
   DONE  
   ```  
   Run the `flash` command with the `--noreset` option to flash the correctly signed image (like `bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37`).  
   ```sh  
   commander flash --noreset bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37 --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Parsing file bootloader-uart-xmodem.s37...  
   Writing 16384 bytes starting at address 0x00000000  
   Comparing range 0x00000000 - 0x00003FFF (16 KiB)

   Programming range 0x00000000 - 0x00001FFF (8 KiB)  
   Programming range 0x00002000 - 0x00003FFF (8 KiB)  
   DONE  
   ```  
   > **Note**: The `--noreset` option prevents the device from returning to the secure debug lock state before flashing.
5. Run the `security status` command to check the boot status. The example below is an unlocked device.  
   ```sh  
   commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   SE Firmware version : 1.2.9  
   Serial number       : 000000000000000014b457fffe045afd  
   Debug lock          : Disabled  
   Device erase        : Enabled  
   Secure debug unlock : Disabled  
   Tamper status       : OK  
   Secure boot         : Enabled  
   Boot status         : 0x20 - OK  
   DONE  
   ```

### BUSLOCK

When secure boot is enabled, the SE enforces the secure boot process through a hardware mechanism called BUSLOCK. This BUS-LOCK will halt the host-side (M33) bus so that it will not start the executing code. The BUSLOCK is enabled out of reset when secure boot is enabled.

- **BUSLOCK status for secure boot success**: BUSLOCK is enabled out of reset and is released only when the Secure boot process is successful and returns 0x20 - OK status code.

```sh
commander security status --device EFR32MG21A010F1024 --serialno 440048205
```

```sh
SE Firmware version : 1.2.9
Serial number       : 000000000000000014b457fffe045afd
Debug lock          : Disabled
Device erase        : Enabled
Secure debug unlock : Disabled
Tamper status       : OK
Secure boot         : Enabled
Boot status         : 0x20 - OK
DONE
```

- **BUSLOCK status for secure boot failure**: BUSLOCK remains applied when the Secure Boot process fails and returns anything but 0x20 - OK status code. This keeps the BUSLOCK intact, and the host CPU is frozen, resulting in halting firmware execution on the M33 core. The device can be recovered from the BUSLOCK state by following these steps:

1. Issue a `security erase` command to the SE:  
   ```sh  
   commander security erasedevice  
   ```  
   ```sh  
   Successfully erased device  
   DONE  
   ```
2. After issuing the `security erase` command to the SE, flash the correctly signed image to recover from a secure boot failure.
