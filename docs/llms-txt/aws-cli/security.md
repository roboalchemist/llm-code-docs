# Security in the AWS CLI

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a
        data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most
        security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The [shared responsibility
            model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
        
         describes this as security
            *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:

- 
            
**Security of the cloud** â AWS is
                responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS
                Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party
                auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the
                    [AWS
                    Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance
                    programs that apply to AWS Command Line Interface, see [AWS Services in Scope
                        by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).

- 
            
**Security in the cloud** â Your responsibility
                is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other
                factors including the sensitivity of your data, your companyâs requirements, and
                applicable laws and regulations. 

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when
        using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). The following topics show you how to configure the AWS CLI to
        meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use the AWS CLI to help
        you to monitor and secure your AWS resources.
