# Authenticating with short-term credentials
            for the AWS CLI

We recommend configuring your SDK or tool to use [IAM Identity
            Center authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.html) with extended session duration options. However, you can
        copy and use temporary credentials that are available in the AWS access portal. New
        credentials will need to be copied when these expire. You can use the temporary credentials
        in a profile or use them as values for system properties and environment variables.

- 
            
[Sign in to the AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosignin.html).

- 
            
Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtogetcredentials.html) to copy IAM role credentials
                from the AWS access portal.

For step 2 in the linked instructions, choose the AWS account and IAM
                        role name that grants access for your development needs. This role typically
                        has a name like **PowerUserAccess** or
                            **Developer**. 

- 
                    
For step 4, select the **Add a profile to your AWS
                            credentials file** option and copy the contents. 

        - 
            
Create or open the shared `credentials` file. This file is
                    `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS systems, and
                    `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` on Windows. For more
                information, see [Configuration and credential file settings in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-configure-files.html). 

- 
            
Add the following text to the shared `credentials` file.
                Replace the sample values with the credentials you copied. 

`[default] 
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE 
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
aws_session_token = IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZ2luX2IQoJb3JpZVERYLONGSTRINGEXAMPLE`
        
- 
            Add your preferred default region and format to the shared
                    `config` file. 

`[default]
region=us-west-2`
output=`json`

[profile user1]
region=`us-east-1`
output=`text`

When the SDK creates a service client, it will access these temporary credentials and
        use them for each request. The settings for the IAM role chosen in step 2a determine
            [how long the temporary credentials are valid](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtosessionduration.html). The maximum duration is twelve
        hours.

Repeat these steps each time your credentials expire.
