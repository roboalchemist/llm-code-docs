# Configuring environment variables for the
            AWS CLI

Environment variables provide another way to specify configuration options and
        credentials, and can be useful for scripting.

###### Precedence of options

- 
            
If you specify an option by using one of the environment variables described in
                this topic, it overrides any value loaded from a profile in the configuration file.

- 
            
If you specify an option by using a parameter on the AWS CLI command line, it
                overrides any value from either the corresponding environment variable or a profile
                in the configuration file.

For more information about precedence and how the AWS CLI determines which credentials to
        use, see [Configuring settings for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-configure.html).

## How to set environment variables

The following examples show how you can configure environment variables for the
            default user.

## AWS CLI supported environment variables

The AWS CLI supports the following environment variables.

                **

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`**

Specifies an AWS access key associated with an IAM account.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `aws_access_key_id`. You can't specify the access key ID
                        by using a command line option.

                **

`AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`**

Specifies the AWS account-based endpoint ID to use for
                        calls to supported AWS services. For more information on account-based
                        endpoints, see [Account-based
                endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-accountid).

This setting overrides the `[aws_account_id](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-aws_account_id)` setting. The `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE](#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE)` environment variable or
                                `[account_id_endpoint_mode](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-account_id_endpoint_mode)` setting must be set to
                            `preferred` or `required` to use this
                        setting.

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

`AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE`**

Specifies whether to use AWS account-based endpoint
                        IDs for calls to supported AWS services. For more information on
                        account-based endpoints, see [Account-based
                endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-accountid).

This setting can be set to the following:

- 
                            
**(default)**
                                **`preferred`** â The
                                endpoint should include account ID if available. 

- 
                            
**`disabled`** â A
                                resolved endpoint doesn't include account ID. 

- 
                            
**`required`** â The
                                endpoint must include account ID. If the account ID isn't available,
                                the SDK throws an error.

This setting overrides the `[account_id_endpoint_mode](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-account_id_endpoint_mode)` setting. To use
                        account-based endpoints, the ID must be set in the `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID](#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID)`
                        environment variable or `[aws_account_id](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-aws_account_id)` setting.

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

`AWS_CA_BUNDLE`**

Specifies the path to a certificate bundle to use for HTTPS certificate
                        validation.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `[ca_bundle](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-ca_bundle)`.
                        You can override this environment variable by using the `[--ca-bundle](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-ca-bundle)`
                        command line parameter.

                **`

AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT`**

Enables the auto-prompt for the AWS CLI version 2. There are two settings that can
                        be used:

- 
                            
**`on`** uses the full
                                auto-prompt mode each time you attempt to run an `aws`
                                command. This includes pressing **ENTER** after both a complete command or incomplete
                                command.

- 
                            
**`on-partial`** uses
                                partial auto-prompt mode. If a command is incomplete or cannot be
                                run due to client-side validation errors, auto-prompt is used. This
                                mode is useful if you have pre-existing scripts, runbooks, or you
                                only want to be auto-prompted for commands you are unfamiliar with
                                rather than prompted on every command.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the
                `[cli_auto_prompt](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-cli_auto_prompt)`
            profile setting. You can override this environment variable by using the `[--cli-auto-prompt](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-cli-auto-prompt)` and
                `[--no-cli-auto-prompt](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-no-cli-auto-prompt)` command line parameters.  For a list of standard
            encodings, see [Standard
              Encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) in the *Python
            Documentation*.

For information on the AWS CLI version 2 auto-prompt feature, see [Enabling and using command prompts in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html).

                **

`AWS_CLI_FILE_ENCODING`**

Specifies the encoding used for text files. By default encoding matches
            your locale. To set encoding different from the locale, use the
              `AWS_CLI_FILE_ENCODING` environment variable. For example, if you use
            Windows with default encoding `CP1252`, setting
              `aws_cli_file_encoding=UTF-8` sets the CLI to open text files using
              `UTF-8`. For a list of standard encodings, see [Standard
              Encodings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings) in the *Python
            Documentation*.

        **

`AWS_CLI_OUTPUT_ENCODING`**

Specifies the encoding used for the output for the AWS CLI. By default encoding
            matches your locale. For example, if you use Windows with default encoding
              `CP1252`, setting `AWS_CLI_OUTPUT_ENCODING=UTF-8` sets the CLI
            to open text files using `UTF-8`.

                **

`AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS`**

If the source and destination buckets are the same when using the `s3
                            mv` command, the source file or object can be moved onto itself,
                        which can result in accidental deletion of your source file or object. The
                            `AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS` environment variable
                        and `--validate-same-s3-paths` option specifies whether to
                        validate your access point ARNs or access point aliases in your Amazon S3 source
                        or destination URIs.

###### Note

Path validation for `s3 mv` requires additional API
                            calls.

                **

`AWS_CONFIG_FILE`**

Specifies the location of the file that the AWS CLI uses to store
                        configuration profiles. The default path is
                            `~/.aws/config`.

You can't specify this value in a named profile setting or by using a
                        command line parameter.

                **

`AWS_DATA_PATH`**

A list of additional directories to check outside of the built-in search
                        path of `~/.aws/models` when loading AWS CLI data. Setting
                        this environment variable indicates additional directories to check first
                        before falling back to the built-in search path. Multiple entries should be
                        separated with the `os.pathsep` character, which is
                            `:` on Linux or macOS and `;` on Windows.

                **

`AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT`**

Specifies the [output format](./cli-usage-output.html) to
                        use.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `output`. You can override this environment variable by
                        using the `--output` command line parameter.

                **

`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`**

The `Default region name` identifies the AWS Region whose
            servers you want to send your requests to by default. This is typically the Region
            closest to you, but it can be any Region. For example, you can type
              `us-west-2` to use US West (Oregon). This is the Region that all later
            requests are sent to, unless you specify otherwise in an individual command.

This
            setting is for the AWS CLI only, and is kept for backwards compatibility. It is suggested
            to use the AWS SDK compatible [AWS_REGION](#envvars-list-AWS_REGION) environment variable instead. 

###### Note

You must specify an AWS Region when using the AWS CLI, either
                            explicitly or by setting a default Region. For a list of the available
                            Regions, see [Regions and
                                Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html). The Region designators used by the AWS CLI are the
                            same names that you see in AWS Management Console URLs and service endpoints.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `region`. You can override this environment variable by
                        using the `--region` command line parameter
                            and the AWS SDK compatible `AWS_REGION` environment
                            variable.

                **

`AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED`**

Disables the use of the Amazon EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS). 

If set to true, user credentials or configuration (like the Region) are
                        not requested from IMDS.

                **

`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`**

Specifies the endpoint that is used for all service requests.  For more
                        information, see [Set global endpoint for all AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-global).

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_<SERVICE>`**

Specifies a custom endpoint that is used for a specific service, where
                            `<SERVICE>` is replaced with the AWS service identifier.
                        For example, Amazon DynamoDB has a `serviceId` of [`DynamoDB`](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/bcaf618c4b93c067efa0b85d3e92f3985ff60906/botocore/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/service-2.json#L10). For this service, the endpoint URL
                        environment variable is `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB`. 

For a list of all service-specific environment variables, see [List of
                    service-specific identifiers](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-service-specific-table).

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on

            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

`AWS_IGNORE_CONFIGURED_ENDPOINT_URLS`**

If enabled, the AWS CLI ignores all custom endpoint configurations. Valid
                        values are `**true**` and
                                `**false**`.  For more
                        information, see [Set global endpoint for all AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-global).

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as
                        the system or user environment variables, local AWS configuration files,
                        or explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter. For endpoint
                        precedence, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

###### Endpoint precedence

                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

[AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-max_attempts)**

Specifies a value of maximum retry attempts the AWS CLI retry handler uses,
                        where the initial call counts toward the value that you provide. For more
                        information on retries, see [AWS CLI retries in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-retries.html).

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profiles
                        setting `max_attempts`.

                **

`AWS_METADATA_SERVICE_NUM_ATTEMPTS`**

When attempting to retrieve credentials on an Amazon EC2 instance that has been
                        configured with an IAM role, the AWS CLI attempts to retrieve credentials
                        once from the instance metadata service before stopping. If you know your
                        commands will run on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can increase this value to make
                        AWS CLI retry multiple times before giving up.

                **

`AWS_METADATA_SERVICE_TIMEOUT`**

The number of seconds before a connection to the instance metadata service
                        should time out. When attempting to retrieve credentials on an Amazon EC2
                        instance that is configured with an IAM role, a connection to the instance
                        metadata service times out after 1 second by default. If you know you're
                        running on an Amazon EC2 instance with an IAM role configured, you can increase
                        this value if needed.

                **

[AWS_PAGER](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-cli_pager)**

Specifies the pager program used for output. By default, AWS CLI version 2 returns
                        all output through your operating systemâs default pager program.

To disable all use of an external paging program, set the variable to an
                        empty string. 

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `cli_pager`.

                **

[AWS_PROFILE](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-using-profiles)**

Specifies the name of the AWS CLI profile with the credentials and options
                        to use. This can be the name of a profile stored in a
                            `credentials` or `config` file, or
                        the value `default` to use the default profile. 

If defined, this environment variable overrides the behavior of using the
                        profile named `[default]` in the configuration file. You can
                        override this environment variable by using the `--profile`
                        command line parameter.

                **

`AWS_REGION`**

The AWS SDK compatible environment variable that specifies the AWS
                        Region to send the request to.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the values in the
                        environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` and the profile setting
                            `region`. You can override this environment variable by using
                        the `--region` command line parameter.

                **

`AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION`**

Specifies when a checksum is calculated for request payloads, and has the
                        following options: 

- 
                            
`when_supported` â **(Default)** The request payload checksum is calculated
                                when an operation either specifies a checksum algorithm in its
                                service model or requires request checksums.

- 
                            
`when_required` â The request payload checksum
                                is calculated when an operation requires request checksums or when a
                                user provides a `requestAlgorithmMember` that is modeled
                                by the AWS service.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profiles
                        setting [request_checksum_calculation](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-request_checksum_calculation).

                **

`AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION`**

Specifies when checksum validation is performed for response payloads, and
                        has the following options: 

- 
                            
`when_supported` â **(Default)** The response payload checksum validation
                                is performed when an operation specifies a response algorithm in its
                                service model that the AWS CLI supports.

`when_required` â The response payload checksum
                                validation is performed when an operation specifies a response
                                algorithm in its service model that the AWS CLI supports, and you set
                                the modeled `requestValidationModeMember` to
                                    `ENABLED` in the operation input.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profiles
                        setting [response_checksum_validation](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-response_checksum_validation).

                **

[AWS_RETRY_MODE](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-retry_mode)**

Specifies which retry mode AWS CLI uses. There are three retry modes
            available: `standard`
              (default), `legacy`, and `adaptive`. For more information on retries, see
              [AWS CLI retries in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-retries.html).

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profiles
                        setting `retry_mode`.

                **

`AWS_ROLE_ARN`**

Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with a web
                        identity provider that you want to use to run the AWS CLI commands.

Used with the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` and
                            `AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` environment variables.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting [role_arn](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-role_arn).
                        You can't specify a role session name as a command line parameter.

###### Note

This environment variable only applies to an assumed role with web
                            identity provider it does not apply to the general assume role provider
                            configuration.

For more information on using web identities, see [Assume role with web identity](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc).

                **

`AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`**

Specifies the name to attach to the role session. This value is provided
                        to the `RoleSessionName` parameter when the AWS CLI calls the
                            `AssumeRole` operation, and becomes part of the assumed role
                        user ARN: `
                                arn:aws:sts::123456789012`:assumed-role/`role_name`/`role_session_name`.
                        This is an optional parameter. If you do not provide this value, a session
                        name is generated automatically. This name appears in AWS CloudTrail logs for
                        entries associated with this session.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting [role_session_name](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-role_session_name).

Used with the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and
                            `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` environment variables.

For more information on using web identities, see [Assume role with web identity](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc).

###### Note

This environment variable only applies to an assumed role with web
                            identity provider it does not apply to the general assume role provider
                            configuration.

                **

`AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID`**

A single AWS account can be used by multiple customer applications to
                        make calls to AWS services. Application ID identifies which source
                        application made a set of calls using an AWS service. AWS SDKs and
                        services don't use or interpret this value other than to surface it back in
                        customer communications. For example, this value can be included in
                        operational emails to uniquely identify which of your applications is
                        associated with the notification.

By default, there is no value.

The Application ID is a string with maximum length of 50 characters.
                        Letters, numbers and the following special characters are allowed: 

`! $ % & * + - . , ^ _ ` | ~`
                    If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting [sdk_ua_app_id](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sdk_ua_app_id). You can't specify Application ID as
                        a command line option.

                **

`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`**

Specifies the secret key associated with the access key. This is
                        essentially the "password" for the access key.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `aws_secret_access_key`. You can't specify the secret
                        access key ID as a command line option.

                **

`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`**

Specifies the session token value that is required if you are using
                        temporary security credentials that you retrieved directly from AWS STS
                        operations. For more information, see the [Output section of the
                            assume-role command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/sts/assume-role.html#output) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `aws_session_token`.

                **

`AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`**

Specifies the location of the file that the AWS CLI uses to store access
                        keys. The default path is `~/.aws/credentials`.

You can't specify this value in a named profile setting or by using a
                        command line parameter.

                **

`AWS_SIGV4A_SIGNING_REGION_SET`**

Specifies the regions to use when signing with SigV4a using a
                        comma-delimited list. If this variable is not set, the AWS CLI uses the
                        default used by the AWS service. If the AWS service has no default, the
                        request signature becomes valid in all regions using a value of
                            `*`.

For more information on SigV4a, see [AWS Signature Version 4
                            for API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html) in the
                        *IAM User Guide*

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting [sigv4a_signing_region_set](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sigv4a_signing_region_set).

                **

`AWS_USE_DUALSTACK_ENDPOINT`**

Enables the use of dual-stack endpoints to send AWS requests. To learn
                        more about dual-stack endpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic,
                        see [Using Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/dual-stack-endpoints.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*. Dual-stack endpoints are available for
                        some services in some regions. If a dual-stack endpoint does not exist for
                        the service or AWS Region, the request fails. This is disabled by default.
                        For more information, see [Set to use dual-stack endpoints for all
                AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-dual-stack).

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

`AWS_USE_FIPS_ENDPOINT`**

Some AWS services offer endpoints that support [Federal Information
                            Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/) in some AWS Regions. When the
                        AWS service supports FIPS, this setting specifies what FIPS endpoint the
                        AWS CLI should use . Unlike standard AWS endpoints, FIPS endpoints use a TLS
                        software library that complies with FIPS 140-2. These endpoints might be
                        required by enterprises that interact with the United States government. For
                        more information see, [Set to use FIPs endpoints for all
                AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-fips).

If this setting is enabled, but a FIPS endpoint does not exist for the
                        service in your AWS Region, the AWS command may fail. In this case,
                        manually specify the endpoint to use in the command using the `[--endpoint-url](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-endpoint-url)` option or use [service-specific
                        endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-service-specific).

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on

            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                **

[AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE](./cli-configure-envvars.html)**

Specifies the path to a file that contains an OAuth 2.0 access token or
                        OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by an identity provider. The AWS CLI
                        loads the contents of this file and passes it as the
                            `WebIdentityToken` argument to the
                            `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` operation.

Used with the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and
                            `AWS_ROLE_SESSION_NAME` environment variables.

If defined, this environment variable overrides the value for the profile
                        setting `web_identity_token_file`. 

For more information on using web identities, see [Assume role with web identity](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc).

###### Note

This environment variable only applies to an assumed role with web
                            identity provider it does not apply to the general assume role provider
                            configuration.
