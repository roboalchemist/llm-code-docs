# Infrastructure Security for this AWS Product or Service

This AWS product or service uses managed services, and therefore is protected by the AWS
    global network security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects
    infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). To
    design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure
      Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS WellâArchitected
      Framework*.

You use AWS published API calls to access this AWS Product or Service through the network.
    Clients must support the following:

- 
          
Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- 
          
Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral
            Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems
            such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key
        that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) (AWS STS) to generate temporary
        security credentials to sign requests.

This AWS product or service follows the [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) 
  through the specific Amazon Web Services (AWS) services it supports. For AWS service security information, see the [AWS
  service security documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/?id=docs_gateway#aws-security) and [AWS services that are in scope of AWS compliance
  efforts by compliance program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).
