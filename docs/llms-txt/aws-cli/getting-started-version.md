# Installing past releases of the AWS CLI version 2

This topic describes how to install the past releases of the AWS Command Line Interface version 2 (AWS CLI) on
    supported operating systems. For information on the AWS CLI version 2 releases, see the [AWS CLI version 2 Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst)
    on GitHub.

AWS CLI version 2 installation instructions:

### Installation requirements

- 
            
You know which release of the AWS CLI version 2 you'd like to install. For a list of
              versions, see the [AWS CLI version 2
                Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst) on *GitHub*.

- 
            
You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package. If your operating
              system doesn't have the built-in `unzip` command, use an equivalent.

- 
            
The AWS CLI version 2 uses `glibc`, `groff`, and `less`.
              These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.

- 
            
We support the AWS CLI version 2 on 64-bit versions of recent distributions of CentOS,
              Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, Amazon Linux 2 and Linux ARM.

- 
            
Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories, we canât guarantee that
              they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.

### Installation instructions

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on Linux. 

We provide the steps in one easy to copy and paste group based on whether you use
            64-bit Linux or Linux ARM. See the descriptions of each line in the steps that
            follow.

- 
            
Download the installation file in one of the following ways:

- 
            
**(Optional) Verifying the integrity of your downloaded zip
                file**

If you chose to manually download the AWS CLI installer package
                `.zip` in the above steps, you can use the following steps to
              verify the signatures by using the `GnuPG` tool.

The AWS CLI installer package `.zip` files are cryptographically
              signed using PGP signatures. If there is any damage or alteration of the files, this
              verification fails and you should not proceed with installation.

Download and install the `gpg` command using your package manager.
                  For more information about `GnuPG`, see the [GnuPG website](https://www.gnupg.org/). 

- 
                
To create the public key file, create a text file and paste in the following
                  text.

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`
                For reference, the following are the details of the public key.

`Key ID:           A6310ACC4672
Type:             RSA
Size:             4096/4096
Created:          2019-09-18
Expires:          2026-07-07
User ID:          AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>
Key fingerprint:  FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511  ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C`
              
- 
                Import the AWS CLI public key with the following command, substituting
                    `public-key-file-name` with the file name of the public
                  key you created.

`$ ``gpg --import public-key-file-name``
gpg: /home/username`/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key A6310ACC4672475C: public key "AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
              
- 
                Download the AWS CLI signature file for the package you downloaded. It has the
                  same path and name as the `.zip` file it corresponds to, but has the
                  extension `.sig`. In the following examples, we save it to the current
                  directory as a file named `awscliv2.sig`.

- 
                
Verify the signature, passing both the downloaded `.sig`
                  and `.zip` file names as parameters to the `gpg`
                  command.

`$ ``gpg --verify awscliv2.sig awscliv2.zip`
                The output should look similar to the following.

`gpg: Signature made Mon Nov  4 19:00:01 2019 PST
gpg:                using RSA key FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511 ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C
gpg: Good signature from "AWS CLI Team <aws-cli@amazon.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: FB5D B77F D5C1 18B8 0511  ADA8 A631 0ACC 4672 475C`

###### Important

The warning in the output is expected and doesn't indicate a problem. It
                    occurs because there isn't a chain of trust between your personal PGP key (if
                    you have one) and the AWS CLI PGP key. For more information, see [Web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

          - 
            
Unzip the installer. If your Linux distribution doesn't have a built-in
                `unzip` command, use an equivalent to unzip it. The following example
              command unzips the package and creates a directory named `aws`
              under the current directory.

`$ ``unzip awscliv2.zip`
          
- 
            Run the install program. The installation command uses a file named
                `install` in the newly unzipped `aws`
              directory. By default, the files are all installed to
                `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symbolic link is created in
                `/usr/local/bin`. The command includes `sudo` to grant
              write permissions to those directories. 

`$ ``sudo ./aws/install`
            You can install without `sudo` if you specify directories that you
              already have write permissions to. Use the following instructions for the
                `install` command to specify the installation location:

Ensure that the paths you provide to the `-i` and `-b`
                  parameters contain no volume name or directory names that contain any space
                  characters or other white space characters. If there is a space, the installation
                  fails.

- 
                
`--install-dir` or `-i` â This option specifies
                  the directory to copy all of the files to.

The default value is `/usr/local/aws-cli`.

- 
                
`--bin-dir` or `-b` â This option specifies that
                  the main `aws` program in the install directory is symbolically linked
                  to the file `aws` in the specified path. You must have write
                  permissions to the specified directory. Creating a symlink to a directory that is
                  already in your path eliminates the need to add the install directory to the
                  user's `$PATH` variable. 

The default value is `/usr/local/bin`.

`$ ``./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli` -b `/usr/local/bin`

###### Note

To update your current installation of the AWS CLI version 2 to a newer version, add your
                existing symlink and installer information to construct the `install`
                command with the `--update` parameter.

`$ ``sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin` --install-dir `/usr/local/aws-cli` --updateTo locate the existing symlink and installation directory, use the following
                steps:

- 
                  
Use the `which` command to find your symlink. This gives you the
                    path to use with the `--bin-dir` parameter.

`$ ``which aws``
/usr/local/bin`/aws
                
- 
                  Use the `ls` command to find the directory that your symlink
                    points to. This gives you the path to use with the `--install-dir`
                    parameter.

`$ ``ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws``
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> /usr/local/aws-cli`/v2/current/bin/aws

          - 
            Confirm the installation with the following command. 

`$ ``aws --version``
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Linux/5.10.205-195.807.amzn2.x86_64 `
            If the `aws` command cannot be found, you might need to restart your
              terminal or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-troubleshooting.html).

### Installation instructions

To update your current installation of AWS CLI version 2 on Windows, download a new installer
          each time you update to overwrite previous versions. AWS CLI is updated regularly. To see
          when the latest version was released, see the [AWS CLI version 2
            Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst) on *GitHub*. 

- 
            
Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) in one of the
              following ways:

**Downloading and running the MSI installer:** To
                  create your download link for a specific version of the AWS CLI, append a hyphen and
                  the version number to the filename.

`https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-version.number`.msi
                For this example the filename for version `2.0.30`
                  would be `AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi` resulting in
                  the following link: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi). 

- 
                
**Using the msiexec command:** Alternatively, you
                  can use the MSI installer by adding the link to the `msiexec` command.
                  For a specific version of the AWS CLI, append a hyphen and the version number to the
                  filename.

`C:\> ``msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-version.number`.msi
                For this example the filename for version `2.0.30`
                  would be `AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi` resulting in
                  the following link [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi). 

`C:\> ``msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi`
                For various parameters that can be used with `msiexec`, see [msiexec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec) on the *Microsoft Docs*
                  website.

For a list of versions, see the [AWS CLI version 2
                Changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-cli/v2/CHANGELOG.rst) on *GitHub*.

          - 
            
To confirm the installation, open the **Start** menu, search for
                `cmd` to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the
                `aws --version` command. 

`C:\> ``aws --version``
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off`
            If Windows is unable to find the program, you might need to close and reopen the
              command prompt window to refresh the path, or follow the troubleshooting in [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-troubleshooting.html).
