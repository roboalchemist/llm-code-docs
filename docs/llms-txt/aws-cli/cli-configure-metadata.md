# Using Amazon EC2 instance metadata as credentials in the
            AWS CLI

When you run the AWS CLI from within an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, you can simplify
        providing credentials to your commands. Each Amazon EC2 instance contains metadata that the AWS CLI
        can directly query for temporary credentials. When an IAM role is attached to the
        instance, the AWS CLI automatically and securely retrieves the credentials from the instance
        metadata. 

To disable this service, use the [AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED)
        environment variable.

## Prerequisites

To use Amazon EC2 credentials with the AWS CLI, you need to complete the following:

- 
                
Install and configure the AWS CLI. For more information, see
                        [Installing or updating to the latest version of
            the AWS CLI](./getting-started-install.html) and [Authentication and access credentials for the
      AWS CLI](./cli-chap-authentication.html).

- 
                
You understand configuration files and named profiles. For more information,
                    see [Configuration and credential file settings in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-configure-files.html). 

- 
                
You've created an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has access to the resources
                    needed, and attached that role to the Amazon EC2 instance when you launch it. For
                    more information, see [IAM policies for Amazon
                        EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-for-amazon-ec2.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* and [Granting Applications That Run
                        on Amazon EC2 Instances Access to AWS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/role-usecase-ec2app.html) in the
                        *IAM User Guide*.

## Configuring a profile for Amazon EC2
                metadata

To specify that you want to use the credentials available in the hosting Amazon EC2
            instance profile, use the following syntax in the named profile in your configuration
            file. See the following steps for more instructions. 

`[profile profilename`]
role_arn = `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/rolename`
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
region = `region`

- 
                Create a profile in your configuration file.

`[profile profilename`]
            
- 
                Add your IAM arn role that has access to the resources needed.

`role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/rolename`
            
- 
                Specify `Ec2InstanceMetadata` as your credential source.

`credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata`
            
- 
                Set your Region.

`region = region`

        **Example**

The following example assumes the
                `marketingadminrole` role and uses the
                    `us-west-2` Region in an Amazon EC2 instance
            profile named `marketingadmin`.

`[profile marketingadmin`]
role_arn = `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole`
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
region = `us-west-2`
