# Configuring IAM Identity Center authentication with the AWS CLI

This topic provides instructions on how to configure the AWS CLI with AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) to
        retrieve credentials to run AWS CLI commands. There are primarily two ways to authenticate
        users with IAM Identity Center to get credentials to run AWS CLI commands through the
            `config` file: 

- 
            
**(Recommended)** SSO token provider
                configuration.

- 
            
Legacy non-refreshable configuration.

For information on using bearer auth, which uses no account ID and role, see [Setting up to
            use the AWS CLI with CodeCatalyst](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/set-up-cli.html) in the *Amazon CodeCatalyst User
            Guide*.

            commands in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-sso-tutorial.html).

## Prerequisites

- 
                
Install the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Installing or updating to the latest version of
            the AWS CLI](./getting-started-install.html).

- 
                
You must first have access to SSO authentication within IAM Identity Center. Choose one of
                    the following methods to access your AWS credentials.

Follow the instructions in [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*. This
                process activates IAM Identity Center, creates an administrative user, and adds an appropriate
                least-privilege permission set.

###### Note

Create a permission set that applies least-privilege permissions. We
                    recommend using the predefined `PowerUserAccess` permission set,
                    unless your employer has created a custom permission set for this purpose.

Exit the portal and sign in again to see your AWS accounts, programmatic
                access details, and options for `Administrator` or
                `PowerUserAccess`. Select `PowerUserAccess` when
                working with the SDK.

Sign in to AWS through your identity providerâs portal. If your Cloud
                Administrator has granted you `PowerUserAccess` (developer)
                permissions, you see the AWS accounts that you have access to and your
                permission set. Next to the name of your permission set, you see options to
                access the accounts manually or programmatically using that permission set. 

Custom implementations might result in different experiences, such as
                different permission set names. If you're not sure which permission set to use,
                contact your IT team for help. 

Sign in to AWS through your AWS access portal. If your Cloud Administrator
                has granted you `PowerUserAccess` (developer) permissions, you see
                the AWS accounts that you have access to and your permission set. Next to the
                name of your permission set, you see options to access the accounts manually or
                programmatically using that permission set. 

Contact your IT team for help.

After gaining access to IAM Identity Center, gather your IAM Identity Center information by performing the
            following:

- 
                
Gather your `SSO Start URL` and `SSO Region` values that
                    you need to run `aws configure sso`

In your AWS access portal, select the permission set you use for
                            development, and select the **Access keys**
                            link.

- 
                        
In the **Get credentials** dialog box,
                            choose the tab that matches your operating system. 

- 
                        
Choose the **IAM Identity Center credentials** method
                            to get the `SSO Start URL` and `SSO Region`
                            values.

            - 
                
Alternatively, starting with version 2.22.0, you can use the Issuer URL
                    instead of the Start URL. The Issuer URL is located in the AWS IAM Identity Center console in
                    one of the following locations:

On the **Dashboard** page, the Issuer URL
                            is in the settings summary.

                    - 
                        
On the **Settings** page, the Issuer URL
                            is in the **Identity source** settings.

            - 
                
For information on which scopes value to register, see [OAuth 2.0 Access scopes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/customermanagedapps-saml2-oauth2.html#oidc-concept) in the *IAM Identity Center User
                        Guide*.

## Configure your profile with the `aws
                    configure sso` wizard

###### To configure an IAM Identity Center profile for your AWS CLI:

- 
                
In your preferred terminal, run the `aws configure sso`
                    command.

- 
                
The AWS CLI attempts to open your default browser for the sign in process of
                    your IAM Identity Center account. This process may prompt you to allow the AWS CLI access to
                    your data. Since the AWS CLI is built on top of the SDK for Python, permission messages
                    may contain variations of the `botocore` name.

**If the AWS CLI cannot open the browser**,
                            instructions to manually start the sign in process are displayed based
                            on the type of authorization you are using.

            - 
                
Select the AWS account to use from the displayed list. If you are authorized
                    to use only one account, the AWS CLI automatically selects that account and skips
                    the prompt.

`There are 2 AWS accounts available to you.
> DeveloperAccount, developer-account-admin@example.com (123456789011`) 
  ProductionAccount, production-account-admin@example.com (`123456789022`)
            
- 
                Select the IAM role to use from the displayed list. If there is only one
                    role available, the AWS CLI automatically selects that role and skips the
                    prompt.

`Using the account ID 123456789011`
There are 2 roles available to you.
> ReadOnly
  FullAccess
            
- 
                Specify the [default output format](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-output),
                    the [default AWS Region](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-region) to send
                    commands to, and a [name for the
                        profile](./cli-configure-files.html). If you specify `default` as the profile name,
                    this profile becomes the default profile used. In the following example, the
                    user enters a default Region, default output format, and the name of the
                    profile.

`Default client Region [None]: ``us-west-2`**<ENTER>**
`CLI default output format (json if not specified) [None]: ``json`**<ENTER>**
`Profile name [123456789011_ReadOnly]: ``my-dev-profile`**<ENTER>**
            
- 
                A final message describes the completed profile configuration. You can now use
                    this profile to request credentials. Use the `aws sso login` command
                    to request and retrieve the credentials needed to run commands. For
                    instructions, see [Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session](#cli-configure-sso-login).

These steps result in creating the `sso-session` section and named
                    profile in the `config` file that looks like the
                    following:

## Configure only your `sso-session`
                section with `aws configure sso-session` wizard

###### Note

This configuration is not compatible with the legacy IAM Identity Center.

The `aws configure sso-session` command updates the
                `sso-session` sections in the `~/.aws/config` file.
            Run the `aws configure sso-session` command and provide your IAM Identity Center start URL
            or issuer URL and the AWS Region that hosts the IAM Identity Center directory. 

`$ ``aws configure sso-session``
SSO session name: ``my-sso`
`SSO start URL [None]: ``https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
`SSO region [None]: ``us-east-1`
`SSO registration scopes [None]: ``sso:account:access`

## Manual configuration using the
                    `config` file

        IAM Identity Center configuration information is stored in the `config` file and
            can be edited using a text editor. To manually add IAM Identity Center support to a named profile, you
            must add keys and values to the `config` file. 

The `sso-session` section of the `config` file
                    is used to group configuration variables for acquiring SSO access tokens, which
                    can then be used to acquire AWS credentials. The following settings are
                    used:

- 
                        
**(Required)**
                            `[sso_start_url](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_start_url)`

- 
                        
**(Required)**
                            `[sso_region](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_region)`

- 
                        
`[sso_account_id](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_account_id)`

- 
                        
`[sso_role_name](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_role_name)`

- 
                        
`[sso_registration_scopes](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_registration_scopes)`

You define an `sso-session` section and associate it to a profile.
                    The `sso_region` and `sso_start_url` settings must be set
                    within the `sso-session` section. Typically,
                        `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` must be set in
                    the `profile` section so that the SDK can request SSO credentials. 

The following example configures the SDK to request SSO credentials and
                    supports automated token refresh: 

`[profile dev`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole`

[sso-session `my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`This also allows `sso-session` configurations to be reused across
                    multiple profiles: 

`[profile dev`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole`

[profile `prod`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole2`

[sso-session `my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`However, `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` aren't
                    required for all scenarios of SSO token configuration. If your application only
                    uses AWS services that support bearer authentication, then traditional AWS
                    credentials are not needed. Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication
                    scheme that uses security tokens called bearer tokens. In this scenario,
                        `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` aren't required.
                    See the individual guide for your AWS service to determine if it supports
                    bearer token authorization.

Additionally, registration scopes can be configured as part of a
                        `sso-session`. Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an
                    application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more
                    scopes, and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the
                    scopes granted. These scopes define the permissions requested to be authorized
                    for the registered OIDC client and access tokens retrieved by the client. The
                    following example sets `sso_registration_scopes` to provide access
                    for listing accounts/roles: 

`[sso-session my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
sso_registration_scopes = `sso:account:access`The authentication token is cached to disk under the
                        `sso/cache` directory with a filename based on the
                    session name. 

###### Note

Automated token refresh isn't supported using the legacy non-refreshable
                        configuration. We recommend using the SSO token configuration.

To manually add IAM Identity Center support to a named profile, you must add the following
                    keys and values to the profile definition in the `config`
                    file.

- 
                        
`[sso_start_url](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_start_url)`

- 
                        
`[sso_region](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_region)`

- 
                        
`[sso_account_id](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_account_id)`

- 
                        
`[sso_role_name](./cli-configure-files.html#cli-config-sso_role_name)`

You can include any other keys and values that are valid in the
                        `.aws/config` file. The following example is an IAM Identity Center
                    profile:

`[profile my-sso-profile`]
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
sso_region = `us-west-2`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SSOReadOnlyRole`
region = `us-west-2`
output = `json`

        To run commands, you must first [Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session](#cli-configure-sso-login) to request
            and retrieve your temporary credentials.

For more information on the `config` and
                `credentials` files, see [Configuration and credential file settings in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-configure-files.html).

## Sign in to an IAM Identity Center session

###### Note

The sign in process may prompt you to allow the AWS CLI access to your data. Since
                the AWS CLI is built on top of the SDK for Python, permission messages may contain
                variations of the `botocore` name.

To retrieve and cache a set of IAM Identity Center credentials, run the following command for the
            AWS CLI to open your default browser and verify your IAM Identity Center log in. 

`$ ``aws sso login --profile my-dev-profile`
`SSO authorization page has automatically been opened in your default browser. 
Follow the instructions in the browser to complete this authorization request.
Successfully logged into Start URL: https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
        Your IAM Identity Center session credentials are cached and the AWS CLI uses them to securely retrieve
            AWS credentials for the IAM role specified in the profile. 

If the AWS CLI cannot automatically open your browser, instructions to manually
                    start the sign in process are displayed based on the type of authorization you
                    are using. 

You can also specify which `sso-session` profile to use when logging in
            using the `--sso-session` parameter of the `aws sso login`
            command. The `sso-session` option is not available for legacy IAM Identity Center.

`$ ``aws sso login --sso-session my-dev-session`
        Starting with version 2.22.0, PKCE authorization is the default. To use device
            authorization for signing in, add the `--use-device-code` option.

`$ ``aws sso login --profile my-dev-profile` --use-device-code
        The authentication token is cached to disk under the
                `~/.aws/sso/cache` directory with a filename based on the
                `sso_start_url`. 

## Run a command with your IAM Identity Center profile

Once logged in, you can use your credentials to invoke AWS CLI commands with the
            associated named profile. The following example shows a command using a profile:

`$ ``aws sts get-caller-identity --profile my-dev-profile`
        As long as you are signed in to IAM Identity Center and those cached credentials are not expired,
            the AWS CLI automatically renews expired AWS credentials when needed. However, if your
            IAM Identity Center credentials expire, you must explicitly renew them by logging in to your IAM Identity Center
            account again.

## Sign out of your IAM Identity Center sessions

When you are done using your IAM Identity Center profile, you can let your credentials expire or run
            the following command to delete your cached credentials.

`$ ``aws sso logout``
Successfully signed out of all SSO profiles.`
