# Getting started with the AWS CLI

This chapter provides steps to get started with version 2 of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and
    provides links to the relevant instructions. 

- 
      
**[Complete all
            prerequisites](./getting-started-prereqs.html)** - To access AWS services with the AWS CLI, you need at
        minimum an AWS account and IAM credentials.  To increase the security of your AWS
        account, we recommend that you do not use your root account credentials. You should create a
        user with least privilege to provide access credentials to the tasks you'll be running in
        AWS. 

- 
      
Install or gain access to the AWS CLI using one of the following methods:

**(Recommended)**
            [Installing or updating to the latest version of
            the AWS CLI](./getting-started-install.html).

- 
          
[Installing past releases of the AWS CLI version 2](./getting-started-version.html). Installing a specific version is primarily used
            if your team aligns their tools to a specific version.

- 
          
[Building and installing the AWS CLI from
      source](./getting-started-source-install.html). Building the AWS CLI from GitHub
            source is a more in-depth method that is primarily used by customers who work on
            platforms that we do not directly support with our pre-built installers.

- 
          
[Running the official Amazon ECR Public or Docker images for
      the AWS CLI](./getting-started-docker.html).

- 
          
Access the AWS CLI version 2 in the AWS console from your browser using AWS CloudShell. For more
            information, see the [AWS CloudShell User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/).

    - 
      
[After you have access to the AWS CLI,
          configure your AWS CLI  with your IAM credentials for first time use](./getting-started-quickstart.html).

###### Troubleshooting installer or configure errors

If you have issues after installing, uninstalling, or configuring the AWS CLI, see [Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-troubleshooting.html) for troubleshooting steps.
