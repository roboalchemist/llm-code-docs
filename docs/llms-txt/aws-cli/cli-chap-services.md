# Guided command examples for the AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that enables you to interact with a wide range
    of AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. This section provides guided
    examples that show how to leverage the AWS CLI to access some of the AWS services. This includes
    some of the custom AWS CLI commands, such as the high-level `aws s3` commands. These
    command examples demonstrate common actions used for some AWS services and provide additional
    resources for more information.

Whether you are an experienced AWS user or new to the AWS CLI, these guided examples serve
    as a resource for streamlining your AWS operations.

For a complete reference of all the available commands for each AWS service, see the
      [AWS CLI version 2 reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/index.html).
    Additionally, you can utilize the [built-in command line
      help](./cli-usage-help.html) to explore the array of AWS services, commands, options, and features in the
    AWS CLI.

For more command examples that are not available in this section, see the [AWS CLI command examples](./cli_code_examples.html) section. These are open source
    command examples that are also available in the
      [AWS CLI version 2 reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/index.html).
    Command examples are hosted in the [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/tree/develop/awscli/examples) repository on
      *GitHub*.

 For open source bash scripting examples, see [AWS CLI with Bash script code examples](./bash_code_examples.html). Bash
    scripting examples are hosted in the [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)
    on *GitHub*.
