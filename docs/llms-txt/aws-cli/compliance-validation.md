        interested in. For general information, see [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).

Your compliance responsibility when using AWS services is determined by the sensitivity
        of your data, your company's compliance objectives, and applicable laws and
        regulations. For more information about your compliance responsibility when using AWS services, see
