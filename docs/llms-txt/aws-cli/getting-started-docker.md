# Running the official Amazon ECR Public or Docker images for
      the AWS CLI

This topic describes how to run, version control, and configure the AWS CLI version 2 on Docker using
    either the official Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) or Docker Hub image. For more information on
    how to use Docker, see [Docker's
    documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

Official images provide isolation, portability, and security that AWS directly supports
    and maintains. This enables you to use the AWS CLI version 2 in a container-based environment without
    having to manage the installation yourself.

## Prerequisites

You must have Docker installed. For installation instructions, see the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/). 

To verify your installation of Docker, run the following command and confirm there is an
      output.

`$ ``docker --version`
`Docker version 19.03.1`

## Deciding between Amazon ECR Public and Docker Hub

    We recommend using Amazon ECR Public over Docker Hub for AWS CLI images. Docker Hub has stricter
      rate limiting for public consumers which can cause throttling issues. In addition, Amazon ECR Public
      replicates images in more than one region to provide strong availability and handle region
      outage issues. 

For more information on Docker Hub rate limiting see [Understanding Docker Hub Rate
        Limiting](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits/) on the *Docker* website.

## Run the official AWS CLI version 2 images

 The first time you use the `docker run` command, the latest image is
      downloaded to your computer. Each subsequent use of the `docker run` command runs
      from your local copy. 

To run the AWS CLI version 2 Docker images, use the `docker run` command.

This is how the command functions:

- 
        
`docker run --rm -it repository/name` â
          The equivalent of the `aws` executable. Each time you run this command, Docker
          spins up a container of your downloaded image, and executes your `aws` command.
          By default, the image uses the latest version of the AWS CLI version 2.

For example, to call the `aws --version` command in Docker, you run the
          following.

- 
        
`--rm` â Specifies to clean up the container after the command
          exits.

- 
        
`-it` â Specifies to open a pseudo-TTY with `stdin`. This
          enables you to provide input to the AWS CLI version 2 while it's running in a container, for
          example, by using the `aws configure` and `aws help` commands. When
          choosing whether to omit `-it`, consider the following:

If you are running scripts, `-it` is not needed. 

- 
            
If you are experiencing errors with your scripts, omitting `-it` from
              your Docker call might fix the issue.

- 
            
If you are trying to pipe output, `-it` might cause errors and omitting
                `-it` from your Docker call might resolve this issue. If you'd like to
              keep the `-it` flag, but still would like to pipe output, disabling the
                [client-side pager](./cli-usage-pagination.html#cli-usage-pagination-clientside) the AWS CLI
              uses by default should resolve the issue.

For more information about the `docker run` command, see the [Docker reference guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

## Notes on interfaces and backwards compatibility
        of the official images

- 
        
The only tool supported on the image is the AWS CLI. Only the `aws`
          executable should ever be directly run. For example, even though `less` and
            `groff` are explicitly installed on the image, they should not be executed
          directly outside of an AWS CLI command.

- 
        
The `/aws` working directory is user controlled. The image will not write
          to this directory, unless instructed by the user in running an AWS CLI command.

- 
        
There are no backwards compatibility guarantees in relying on the latest tag. To
          guarantee backwards compatibility, you must pin to a specific
            `<major.minor.patch>` tag as those tags are immutable; they will only ever
          be pushed to once.

## Use specific versions and tags

The official AWS CLI version 2 image has multiple versions you can use, starting with version
        `2.0.6`. To run a specific version of the AWS CLI version 2, append the appropriate tag to
      your `docker run` command. The first time you use the `docker run`
      command with a tag, the latest image for that tag is downloaded to your computer. Each
      subsequent use of the `docker run` command with that tag runs from your local copy. 

You can use two types of tags: 

- 
        
`latest` â Defines the latest version of the AWS CLI version 2 for the image.
          We recommend you use the `latest` tag when you want the latest version of the
          AWS CLI version 2. However, there are no backward-compatibility guarantees when relying on this tag.
          The `latest` tag is used by default in the `docker run` command. To
          explicitly use the `latest` tag, append the tag to the container image
          name.

- 
        
`<major.minor.patch>` â Defines a specific version of the AWS CLI version 2
          for the image. If you plan to use an official image in production, we recommend you use a
          specific version of the AWS CLI version 2 to ensure backward compatibility. For example, to run
          version `2.0.6`, append the version to the container image name.

## Update to the latest official image

Because the latest image is downloaded to your computer only the first time you use the
        `docker run` command, you need to manually pull an updated image. To manually
      update to the latest version, we recommend you pull the `latest` tagged image.
      Pulling the image downloads the latest version to your computer.

## Share host files, credentials, environment
        variables, and configuration

Because the AWS CLI version 2 is run in a container, by default the CLI can't access the host file
      system, which includes configuration and credentials. To share the host file system,
      credentials, and configuration to the container, mount the host systemâs
        `~/.aws` directory to the container at `/root/.aws`
      with the `-v` flag to the `docker run` command. This allows the AWS CLI version 2
      running in the container to locate host file information.

For more information about the `-v` flag and mounting, see the [Docker reference guide](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). 

###### Note

For information on `config` and `credentials`
        files, see [Configuration and credential file settings in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-configure-files.html).

### Example 1: Providing credentials and
          configuration

In this example, we're providing host credentials and configuration when running the
          `s3 ls` command to list your buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The below examples use
        the default location for AWS CLI credentials and configuration files, to use a different
        location, change the file path.

You can call specific system's environment variables using the `-e` flag. To
        use an environment variable, call it by name. 

### Example 2: Downloading an Amazon S3 file to your
          host system

For some AWS CLI version 2 commands, you can read files from the host system in the
        container or write files from the container to the host system. 

In this example, we download the `S3` object
          `s3://aws-cli-docker-demo/hello` to your local file system by mounting the
        current working directory to the container's `/aws` directory. By
        downloading the `hello` object to the container's `/aws` directory,
        the file is saved to the host systemâs current working directory also.

To confirm the downloaded file exists in the local file system, run the
        following.

**Linux and macOS**

`$ ``cat hello`
`Hello from Docker!`
      **Windows PowerShell**

`$ ``type hello`
`Hello from Docker!`

### Example 3: Using your AWS_PROFILE
          environment variable

      You can call specific system's environment variables using the `-e` flag.
        Call each environment variable you'd like to use. In this example, we're providing host
        credentials, configuration, and the `AWS_PROFILE` environment
        variable when running the `s3 ls` command to list your buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service
        (Amazon S3).

## Shorten the docker run command

To shorten the `docker run` command, we suggest you use your operating
      system's ability to create a [`symbolic
          link`](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/understanding-linux-links/) (symlink) or [`alias`](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/aliases-diy-shell-commands/) in
      Linux and macOS, or [`doskey`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/doskey) in Windows. To set the `aws` alias, you can run
      one of the following commands.

- 
        
For basic access to `aws` commands, run the following.

- 
        
For access to the host file system and configuration settings when using
            `aws` commands, run the following.

- 
        
To assign a specific version to use in your `aws` alias, append your
          version tag.

After setting your alias, you can run the AWS CLI version 2 from within a container as if it's
      installed on your host system. 

`$ ``aws --version``
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.7.3 Linux/4.9.184-linuxkit botocore/2.4.5dev10`
