# AWS CLI with Bash script code examples

The code examples in this topic show you how to use the AWS Command Line Interface with Bash script with AWS.

*Basics* are code examples that show you how to perform the essential operations within a service.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

*Scenarios* are code examples that show you how to accomplish specific tasks by calling multiple functions within a service or combined with other AWS services.

Some services contain additional example categories that show how
to leverage libraries or functions specific to the service.
