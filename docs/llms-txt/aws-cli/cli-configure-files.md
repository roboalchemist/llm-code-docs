# Configuration and credential file settings in the
            AWS CLI

You can save your frequently used configuration settings and credentials in files that are
        maintained by the AWS CLI. 

The files are divided into `profiles`. By default, the AWS CLI uses the settings
        found in the profile named `default`. To use alternate settings, you can create
        and reference additional profiles.

You can override an individual setting by either setting one of the supported environment
        variables, or by using a command line parameter. For more information on configuration
        setting precedence, see [Configuring settings for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-configure.html).

###### Note

For information on setting up your credentials, see [Authentication and access credentials for the
      AWS CLI](./cli-chap-authentication.html).

## Format of the configuration and credential
                files

The `config` and `credentials` files are organized into
            sections. Sections include *profiles*,
                    *sso-sessions*, and *services*. A section is a named collection of settings, and
            continues until another section definition line is encountered. Multiple profiles and
            sections can be stored in the `config` and
                `credentials` files.

These files are plaintext files that use the following format:

- 
                
Section names are enclosed in brackets [ ] such as `[default]`,
                        `[profile user1`], and
                        `[sso-session]`.

- 
                
All entries in a section take the general form of
                        `setting_name=value`. 

- 
                
Lines can be commented out by starting the line with a hash character
                        (`#`). 

###### The config and credentials files
            contain the following section types:

- 
[profile](#cli-configure-files-format-profile)

- 
[sso-session](#cli-configure-files-format-sso-session)

- 
[services](#cli-configure-files-format-services)

### Section type:
                        `profile`

Depending on the file, profile section names use the following format:

- 
                    
**Config file:**
                        `[default]`
                        `[profile user1`]

- 
                    
**Credentials file:**
                        `[default]`
                        `[user1`]

Do ***not***
                        use the word `profile` when creating an entry in the
                            `credentials` file.

Each profile can specify different credentials and can also specify different
                AWS Regions and output formats. When naming the profile in a
                    `config` file, include the prefix word
                "`profile`", but do not include it in the
                    `credentials` file.

The following examples show a `credentials` and
                    `config` file with two profiles, region, and output specified. The
                first *[default]* is used when you run a AWS CLI
                command with no profile specified. The second is used when you run a AWS CLI command
                with the `--profile user1` parameter.

For more information and additional authorization and credential methods see, see
                    [Authenticating using IAM user credentials for
            the AWS CLI](./cli-authentication-user.html).

### Section
                    type: `sso-session`

The `sso-session` section of the `config` file is
                used to group configuration variables for acquiring SSO access tokens, which can
                then be used to acquire AWS credentials. The following settings are used:

- 
                    
**(Required)**
                        `[sso_start_url](#cli-config-sso_start_url)`

- 
                    
**(Required)**
                        `[sso_region](#cli-config-sso_region)`

- 
                    
`[sso_account_id](#cli-config-sso_account_id)`

- 
                    
`[sso_role_name](#cli-config-sso_role_name)`

- 
                    
`[sso_registration_scopes](#cli-config-sso_registration_scopes)`

You define an `sso-session` section and associate it to a profile.
                    `sso_region` and `sso_start_url` must be set within the
                    `sso-session` section. Typically, `sso_account_id` and
                    `sso_role_name` must be set in the `profile` section so
                that the SDK can request SSO credentials. 

The following example configures the SDK to request SSO credentials and supports
                automated token refresh: 

`[profile dev`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole`

[sso-session `my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
            This also allows `sso-session` configurations to be reused across
                multiple profiles: 

`[profile dev`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole`

[profile `prod`]
sso_session = `my-sso`
sso_account_id = `111122223333`
sso_role_name = `SampleRole2`

[sso-session `my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
            However, `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` aren't
                required for all scenarios of SSO token configuration. If your application only uses
                AWS services that support bearer authentication, then traditional AWS
                credentials are not needed. Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme
                that uses security tokens called bearer tokens. In this scenario,
                    `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` aren't required. See
                the individual guide for your AWS service to determine if it supports bearer token
                authorization.

Additionally, registration scopes can be configured as part of a
                    `sso-session`. Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an
                application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more
                scopes, and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes
                granted. These scopes define the permissions requested to be authorized for the
                registered OIDC client and access tokens retrieved by the client. The following
                example sets `sso_registration_scopes` to provide access for listing
                accounts/roles: 

`[sso-session my-sso`]
sso_region = `us-east-1`
sso_start_url = `https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`
sso_registration_scopes = `sso:account:access`
            The authentication token is cached to disk under the
                    `~/.aws/sso/cache` directory with a filename based on the
                session name.

For more information on this configuration type, see [Configuring IAM Identity Center authentication with the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-sso.html).

### Section type:
                        `services`

The `services` section is a group of settings that configures custom
                endpoints for AWS service requests. A profile then is linked to a
                    `services` section. 

`[profile dev`]
services = `my-services`
            The `services` section is separated into subsections by
                    `<SERVICE> = ` lines, where `<SERVICE>` is the
                AWS service identifier key. The AWS service identifier is based on the API
                modelâs `serviceId` by replacing all spaces with underscores and
                lowercasing all letters. For a list of all service identifier keys to use in the
                    `services` section, see [Using endpoints in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-endpoints.html).
                The service identifier key is followed by nested settings with each on its own line
                and indented by two spaces. 

The following example configures the endpoint to use for requests made to the
                Amazon DynamoDB service in the `my-services`
                section that is used in the `dev` profile. Any immediately
                following lines that are indented are included in that subsection and apply to that
                service. 

`[profile dev`]
services = `my-services`

[services `my-services`]
dynamodb = 
  endpoint_url = `http://localhost:8000`
            For more information on service-specific endpoints, see [Using endpoints in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-endpoints.html).

If your profile has role-based credentials configured through a
                    `source_profile` parameter for IAM assume role functionality, the
                SDK only uses service configurations for the specified profile. It does not use
                profiles that are role chained to it. For example, using the following
                shared `config` file: 

`[profile A`]
credential_source = `Ec2InstanceMetadata`
endpoint_url = `https://profile-a-endpoint.aws/`

[profile `B`]
source_profile = `A`
role_arn = `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/roleB`
services = `profileB`

[services `profileB`]
ec2 = 
  endpoint_url = `https://profile-b-ec2-endpoint.aws`
             If you use profile `B` and make a call in your code to Amazon EC2, the
                endpoint resolves as `https://profile-b-ec2-endpoint.aws`. If your code
                makes a request to any other service, the endpoint resolution will not follow any
                custom logic. The endpoint does not resolve to the global endpoint defined in
                profile `A`. For a global endpoint to take effect for profile
                    `B`, you would need to set `endpoint_url` directly within
                profile `B`. 

## Where are configuration settings
                stored?

The AWS CLI stores sensitive credential information that you specify with `aws
                configure` in a local file named `credentials`, in a folder
            named `.aws` in your home directory. The less sensitive
            configuration options that you specify with `aws configure` are stored in a
            local file named `config`, also stored in the
                    `.aws` folder in your home directory. 

###### Storing credentials in the config file

You can keep all of your profile settings in a single file as the AWS CLI can read
                credentials from the `config` file. If there are credentials in
                both files for a profile sharing the same name, the keys in the credentials file
                take precedence. We suggest keeping credentials in the `credentials`
                files. These files are also used by the various language software development kits
                (SDKs). If you use one of the SDKs in addition to the AWS CLI, confirm if the
                credentials should be stored in their own file.

Where you find your home directory location varies based on the operating system, but
            is referred to using the environment variables `%UserProfile%` in Windows and
                `$HOME` or `~` (tilde) in Unix-based systems. You can specify
            a non-default location for the files by setting the `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and
                `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variables to another local
            path. See [Configuring environment variables for the
            AWS CLI](./cli-configure-envvars.html)
            for details. 

When you use a shared profile that specifies an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, the
            AWS CLI calls the AWS STS `AssumeRole` operation to retrieve temporary
            credentials. These credentials are then stored (in
                    `~/.aws/cli/cache`). Subsequent AWS CLI commands
            use the cached temporary credentials until they expire, and at that point the AWS CLI
            automatically refreshes the credentials.

## Using named profiles

If no profile is explicitly defined, the `default` profile is used.

To use a named profile, add the `--profile
                    profile-name` option to your command. The
            following example lists all of your Amazon EC2 instances using the credentials and settings
            defined in the `user1` profile.

`$ ``aws ec2 describe-instances --profile user1`
        To use a named profile for multiple commands, you can avoid specifying the profile in
            every command by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable as the
            default profile. You can override this setting by using the `--profile`
            parameter.

## Set and view configuration settings using
                commands

There are several ways to view and set your configuration settings using
            commands.

                **`[aws
                        configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/index.html)`**

Run this command to quickly set and view your credentials, Region, and
                        output format. The following example shows sample values.

`$ ``aws configure`
`AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`
Default region name [None]: `us-west-2`
Default output format [None]: `json`

                **`[aws configure
                        set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/set.html)`**
                
                    You can set any credentials or configuration settings using `aws
                            configure set`. Specify the profile that you want to view or
                        modify with the `--profile` setting. 

For example, the following command sets the `region` in the
                        profile named `integ`.

`$ ``aws configure set region us-west-2` --profile `integ`
                    To remove a setting, manually delete the setting in your
                            `config` and `credentials` files
                        in a text editor.

                **[`aws configure
                        get`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/get.html)**

You can retrieve any credentials or configuration settings you've set
                        using `aws configure get`. Specify the profile that you want to
                        view or modify with the `--profile` setting. 

For example, the following command retrieves the `region`
                        setting in the profile named `integ`.

`$ ``aws configure get region` --profile `integ``
us-west-2`
                    If the output is empty, the setting is not explicitly set and uses the
                        default value.

                **

[`aws configure
                            import`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/reference/configure/import.html)**

Import `CSV` credentials generated from the IAM web
                        console. This is not for credentials generated from IAM Identity Center; customers who use
                        IAM Identity Center should use aws configure sso. A CSV file is imported with the profile
                        name matching the username. The CSV file must contain the following
                        headers.

- 
                            
User Name

- 
                            
Access key ID

- 
                            
Secret access key

###### Note

During initial key pair creation, once you close the
                                **Download .csv file** dialog box, you cannot
                            access your secret access key after you close the dialog box. If you
                            need a `.csv` file, you'll need to create one
                            yourself with the required headers and your stored key pair information.
                            If you do not have access to your key pair information, you need to
                            create a new key pair.

`$ ``aws configure import --csv file://credentials.csv`

                **[`aws configure
                            list`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/list.html)**
                
                    To list configuration data, use the `aws configure list`
                        command. This command lists the profile, access key, secret key, and region
                        configuration information used for the specified profile. For each
                        configuration item, it shows the value, where the configuration value was
                        retrieved, and the configuration variable name.

For example, if you provide the AWS Region in an environment variable,
                        this command shows you the name of the region you've configured, that this
                        value came from an environment variable, and the name of the environment
                        variable. 

For temporary credential methods such as roles and IAM Identity Center, this command
                        displays the temporarily cached access key and secret access key is
                        displayed.

`$ ``aws configure list`
`NAME       : VALUE                : TYPE                    : LOCATION
profile    : <not set>            : None                    : None
access_key : ****************ABCD : shared-credentials-file : 
secret_key : ****************ABCD : shared-credentials-file : 
region     : us-west-2            : env                     : AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

                **[`aws configure
                            list-profiles`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/reference/configure/list-profiles.html)**
                
                    To list all your profile names, use the `aws configure
                            list-profiles` command.

`$ ``aws configure list-profiles`
`default
test`

                **`[aws configure
                            mfa-login](./cli-configure-sso.html)`**
                
                    Run this command to configure a new profile to use with multi-factor
                        authentication (MFA) and your IAM user credentials in the specified
                        profile. If no profile is specified, the MFA is based on the
                            `default` profile. If no default profile is configured, the
                            `mfa-login` command prompts you for you AWS credentials
                        before asking for your MFA information. The following command example uses
                        your default configuration and creates an MFA profile.

`$ ``aws configure mfa-login`
`MFA serial number or ARN: ``arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/MFADeviceName`
`MFA token code: ``123456`
`Profile to update [session-MFADeviceName]:
Temporary credentials written to profile 'session-MFADeviceName'

aws configure
                        export-credentials`**
                
                    Run this command to export currently set credentials in the specified
                        format. By default, the command exports the default credentials in the
                            `process` format, which is a JSON format supported by the
                        AWS SDKs and Tools credential format. 

`$ ``aws configure export-credentials`
`{
  "Version": 1,
  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

- 
[S3 Custom command settings](#cli-configure-files-s3)

The following settings are supported in the `config` file. The
            values listed in the specified (or default) profile are used unless they are overridden
            by the presence of an environment variable with the same name, or a command line option
            with the same name. For more information on what order settings take precendence, see
                [Configuring settings for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-configure.html)

### Global settings

                    **

                        `account_id_endpoint_mode`
                    **

Specifies
                            whether to use AWS account-based endpoint IDs for calls to supported
                            AWS services. For more information on account-based endpoints, see
                                [Account-based
                endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-accountid).

This setting can be set to the following:

- 
                                
**(default)**
                                    **`preferred`** â The
                                    endpoint should include account ID if available. 

- 
                                
**`disabled`** â A
                                    resolved endpoint doesn't include account ID. 

- 
                                
**`required`** â The
                                    endpoint must include account ID. If the account ID isn't
                                    available, the SDK throws an error.

Can be overridden by the `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE)` environment
                            variable. To use account-based endpoints, the ID must be set in the
                                    `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID)` environment variable or
                                    `[aws_account_id](#cli-config-aws_account_id)` setting.

`account_id_endpoint_mode = preferred`

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                    **

                        `aws_access_key_id`
                    **

Specifies the AWS access key used as part of the credentials to
                            authenticate the command request. Although this can be stored in the
                                `config` file, we recommend that you store this
                            in the `credentials` file. 

Can be overridden by the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment
                            variable. You can't specify the access key ID as a command line
                            option.

`aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`

                    **

                        `aws_account_id`
                        **
                    
                        Specifies the AWS account-based endpoint ID to use for calls to
                            supported AWS services. For more information on account-based
                            endpoints, see [Account-based
                endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-accountid).

Can be overridden by the `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID)` environment variable. The `[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_ENDPOINT_MODE)` environment variable
                            or `[account_id_endpoint_mode](#cli-config-account_id_endpoint_mode)` setting must be set to
                                `preferred` or `required` to use this
                            setting.

                    **

`aws_secret_access_key`**

Specifies the AWS secret key used as part of the credentials to
                            authenticate the command request. Although this can be stored in the
                                `config` file, we recommend that you store this
                            in the `credentials` file. 

Can be overridden by the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
                            environment variable. You can't specify the secret access key as a
                            command line option.

`aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

                    **

`aws_session_token`**
                    
                        Specifies an AWS session token. A session token is required only if
                            you manually specify temporary security credentials. Although this can
                            be stored in the `config` file, we recommend that you
                            store this in the `credentials` file. 

Can be overridden by the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment
                            variable. You can't specify the session token as a command line
                            option.

`aws_session_token = AQoEXAMPLEH4aoAH0gNCAPyJxz4BlCFFxWNE1OPTgk5TthT+FvwqnKwRcOIfrRh3c/LTo6UDdyJwOOvEVPvLXCrrrUtdnniCEXAMPLE/IvU1dYUg2RVAJBanLiHb4IgRmpRV3zrkuWJOgQs8IZZaIv2BXIa2R4Olgk`

                    **

`ca_bundle`**
                    
                        Specifies a CA certificate bundle (a file with the
                                `.pem` extension) that is used to verify SSL
                            certificates.

Can be overridden by the `[AWS_CA_BUNDLE](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_CA_BUNDLE)`
                            environment variable or the `[--ca-bundle](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-ca-bundle)` command line option. 

`ca_bundle = dev/apps/ca-certs/cabundle-2019mar05.pem`

                    **

`cli_auto_prompt`**
                    
                        Enables the auto-prompt for the AWS CLI version 2. There are two settings that
                            can be used:

- 
                                
**`on`** uses the full
                                    auto-prompt mode each time you attempt to run an
                                        `aws` command. This includes pressing **ENTER** after both a complete command
                                    or incomplete command.

`cli_auto_prompt = on`
                            
- 
                                **`on-partial`** uses
                                    partial auto-prompt mode. If a command is incomplete or cannot
                                    be run due to client-side validation errors, auto-prompt is
                                    used. This mode is particular useful if you have pre-existing
                                    scripts, runbooks, or you only want to be auto-prompted for
                                    commands you are unfamiliar with rather than prompted on every
                                    command.

`cli_auto_prompt = on-partial`

                        You can override this setting by using the `[aws_cli_auto_prompt](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-aws_cli_auto_prompt)` environment variable or the
                                    `[--cli-auto-prompt](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-cli-auto-prompt)` and `[--no-cli-auto-prompt](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-no-cli-auto-prompt)` command line
                            parameters.

For information on the AWS CLI version 2 auto-prompt feature, see [Enabling and using command prompts in the
            AWS CLI](./cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html).

                    **

`cli_binary_format`**

Specifies how the AWS CLI version 2 interprets binary input parameters. It can
                            be one of the following values:

- 
                                
**base64** â This is the
                                    default value. An input parameter that is typed as a binary
                                    large object (BLOB) accepts a base64-encoded string. To pass
                                    true binary content, put the content in a file and provide the
                                    file's path and name with the `fileb://` prefix as
                                    the parameter's value. To pass base64-encoded text contained in
                                    a file, provide the file's path and name with the
                                        `file://` prefix as the parameter's value.

- 
                                
**raw-in-base64-out** â
                                    Default for the AWS CLI version 1. If the setting's value is
                                        `raw-in-base64-out`, files referenced using the
                                        `file://` prefix is read as text and then the
                                    AWS CLI attempts to encode it to binary.

This entry does not have an equivalent environment variable. You can
                            specify the value on a single command by using the
                                `--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out` parameter.

`cli_binary_format = raw-in-base64-out`
                        If you reference a binary value in a file using the
                                `fileb://` prefix notation, the AWS CLI *always* expects the file to contain raw
                            binary content and does not attempt to convert the value. 

If you reference a binary value in a file using the
                                `file://` prefix notation, the AWS CLI handles the file
                            according to the current `cli_binary_format` setting. If that
                            setting's value is `base64` (the default when not explicitly
                            set), the AWS CLI expects the file to contain base64-encoded text. If that
                            setting's value is `raw-in-base64-out`, the AWS CLI expects the
                            file to contain raw binary content.

                    **

`cli_help_output`**

As of version `2.31.0` The display for the
                                `help` command is configured by the
                                `cli_help_output` setting, and has the following
                            values:

- 

                                    **(default)**
                                    `terminal` â Open the man page in the
                                    terminal.

- 
                                
`browser` â Open the man page as a local HTML
                                    file in your default browser. A notice is printed to your
                                    terminal when your default browser is being opened, and an error
                                    message if the AWS CLI cannot open your browser.

- 
                                
`url` â Print the URL to the online AWS CLI
                                    Reference Guide for the version of the AWS CLI you have installed.
                                    Settings for client-side paging, such as the
                                        `AWS_PAGER` environment variable, is
                                    respected.

`cli_help_output = browser`
                        For more information on the `help` command, see [Accessing help and resources for the AWS CLI](./cli-usage-help.html).

`cli_history`**

Disabled by default. This setting enables command history for the
                            AWS CLI. After enabling this setting, the AWS CLI records the history of
                                `aws` commands.

`cli_history = enabled`
                        You can list your history using the `aws history list`
                            command, and use the resulting `command_ids` in the `aws
                                history show` command for details. For more information see
                                [`aws history`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/history/index.html) in the *AWS CLI reference guide*.

                    **

`cli_pager`**

Specifies the pager program used for output. By default, AWS CLI version 2
                            returns all output through your operating systemâs default pager
                            program.

Can be overridden by the AWS_PAGER environment variable.

`cli_pager=less`

                    **

`cli_timestamp_format`**
                    
                        Specifies the output format of timestamp values. You can specify
                            either of the following values:

- 
                                
**iso8601** â The default
                                    value for the AWS CLI version 2. If specified, the AWS CLI reformats all
                                    timestamps in the output according to [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). ISO 8601 formatted timestamps look like
                                    the following examples. The following example demonstrates how
                                    the time is formatted by separating the date and time with a
                                        `T` and including a `Z` after the
                                    time.

`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`
                                The following examples shows a timestamp using the previous
                                    formatting.

`2024-05-08T15:16:43Z`
                            
- 
                                **wire** â The default
                                    value for the AWS CLI version 1. If specified, the AWS CLI displays all
                                    timestamp values exactly as received in the HTTP query response.

This setting does not have an equivalent environment variable or
                            command line option. This setting does not alter timestamp inputs, only
                            output formatting.

`cli_timestamp_format = iso8601`

                    **

`[credential_process](./cli-configure-sourcing-external.html)`**
                    
                        Specifies an external command that the AWS CLI runs to generate or
                            retrieve authentication credentials to use for this command. The command
                            must return the credentials in a specific format. For more information
                            about how to use this setting, see [Sourcing credentials with an external
            process in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-sourcing-external.html).

This entry does not have an equivalent environment variable or command
                            line option.

`credential_process = /opt/bin/awscreds-retriever --username susan`

                    **

`[credential_source](./cli-configure-role.html)`**
                    
                        Used within Amazon EC2 instances or containers to specify where the AWS CLI
                            can find credentials to use to assume the role you specified with the
                                `role_arn` parameter. You cannot specify both
                                `source_profile` and `credential_source` in
                            the same profile.

This parameter can have one of three values:

- 
                                
**Environment** â
                                    Specifies that the AWS CLI is to retrieve source credentials from
                                    environment variables.

- 
                                
**Ec2InstanceMetadata** â
                                    Specifies that the AWS CLI is to use the IAM role attached to
                                    the [EC2 instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) to get source
                                    credentials.

- 
                                
**EcsContainer** â
                                    Specifies that the AWS CLI is to use the IAM role attached to
                                    the ECS container as source credentials.

`credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata`

                    **

`duration_seconds`**
                    
                        Specifies the maximum duration of the role session, in seconds. The
                            value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session
                            duration setting for the role (which can be a maximum of 43200). This is
                            an optional parameter and by default, the value is set to 3600
                            seconds.

                    **

`endpoint_url`**

Specifies the endpoint that is used for all service requests. If this
                            setting is used in the [services](#cli-configure-files-format-services) section of the `config`
                            file, then the endpoint is used only for the specified service. For more
                            information, see [Set global endpoint for all AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-global).

The following example uses the global endpoint
                                `http://localhost:1234` and a service-specific endpoint
                            of `http://localhost:4567` for Amazon S3.

`[profile dev]
endpoint_url = http://localhost:1234
services = s3-specific

[services s3-specific]
s3 = 
  endpoint_url = http://localhost:4567`

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                    **

`ignore_configure_endpoint_urls`**

If enabled, the AWS CLI ignores all custom endpoint configurations
                            specified in the `config` file. Valid values are
                                    `**true**` and
                                    `**false**`.

`ignore_configure_endpoint_urls = true`

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                    **

`[external_id](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-xaccount)`**

Specifies a unique identifier that is used by third parties to assume
                            a role in their customers' accounts. This maps to the
                                `ExternalId` parameter in the `AssumeRole`
                            operation. This parameter is needed only if the trust policy for the
                            role specifies a value for `ExternalId`. For more
                            information, see [How to
                                use an external ID when granting access to your AWS resources to a
                                third party ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

                    **

`[max_attempts](./cli-configure-retries.html)`**

Specifies a value of maximum retry attempts the AWS CLI retry handler
                            uses, where the initial call counts toward the `max_attempts`
                            value that you provide. 

You can override this value by using the `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
                            environment variable.

`max_attempts = 3`

                    **

`[mfa_serial](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-mfa)`**
                    
                        The identification number of an MFA device to use when assuming a
                            role. This is mandatory only if the trust policy of the role being
                            assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value
                            can be either a serial number for a hardware device (such as
                                `GAHT12345678`) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
                            virtual MFA device (such as
                                    `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user`).

                    **

`output`**

Specifies the default output format for commands requested using this
                            profile. You can specify any of the following values:

- 
          
**[json](./cli-usage-output-format.html#json-output)** â The output is formatted as a [JSON](https://json.org/) string.

-       

    **[yaml](./cli-usage-output-format.html#yaml-output)** â The output is formatted as a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) string.

- 
          
**[yaml-stream](./cli-usage-output-format.html#yaml-stream-output)** â The output is streamed and formatted as a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) string. Streaming allows for faster handling of large data types.

- 
          
**[text](./cli-usage-output-format.html#text-output)** â The output is formatted as multiple lines of
            tab-separated string values. This can be useful to pass the output to a text
            processor, like `grep`, `sed`, or `awk`.

- 
          
**[table](./cli-usage-output-format.html#table-output)** â The output is formatted as a table using the
            characters +|- to form the cell borders. It typically presents the information in a
            "human-friendly" format that is much easier to read than the others, but not as
            programmatically useful.

Can be overridden by the `AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT` environment
                            variable or the `--output` command line option.

`output = table`

                    **

`parameter_validation`**
                    
                        Specifies whether the AWS CLI client attempts to validate parameters
                            before sending them to the AWS service endpoint.

- 
                                
**true** â This is the
                                    default value. If specified, the AWS CLI performs local validation
                                    of command line parameters.

- 
                                
**false** â If specified,
                                    the AWS CLI does not validate command line parameters before
                                    sending them to the AWS service endpoint.

This entry does not have an equivalent environment variable or command
                            line option.

`parameter_validation = false`

                    **

`region`**
                    
                        Specifies the AWS Region to send requests to for commands requested
                            using this profile.

- 
                                
You can specify any of the Region codes available for the
                                    chosen service as listed in [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

- 
                                
`aws_global` enables you to specify the global
                                    endpoint for services that support a global endpoint in addition
                                    to Regional endpoints, such as AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) and Amazon Simple Storage Service
                                    (Amazon S3).

You can override this value by using the
                                `AWS_REGION` environment
                                variable,
                            `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable, or the
                                `--region` command line option.

`region = us-west-2`

                    **

`request_checksum_calculation`**
                    
                        Specifies when a checksum is calculated for request payloads, and has
                            the following options: 

- 
                                
`when_supported` â **(Default)** The request payload checksum is
                                    calculated when an operation either specifies a checksum
                                    algorithm in its service model or requires request
                                    checksums.

- 
                                
`when_required` â The request payload
                                    checksum is calculated when an operation requires request
                                    checksums or when a user provides a
                                        `requestAlgorithmMember` that is modeled by the
                                    AWS service.

`request_checksum_calculation = when_supported`
                        The environment variable [AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION) overrides
                            this setting.

                    **

`response_checksum_validation`**

Specifies when checksum validation is performed for response payloads,
                            and has the following options: 

- 
                                
`when_supported` â **(Default)** The response payload checksum
                                    validation is performed when an operation specifies a response
                                    algorithm in its service model that the AWS CLI supports.

- 
                                
`when_required` â The response payload
                                    checksum validation is performed when an operation specifies a
                                    response algorithm in its service model that the AWS CLI supports,
                                    and you set the modeled `requestValidationModeMember`
                                    to `ENABLED` in the operation input.

`response_checksum_validation = when_supported`
                        The environment variable [AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION) overrides
                            this setting.

                    **

`[retry_mode](./cli-configure-retries.html)`**

Specifies which retry mode AWS CLI uses. There are three retry modes
              available: `standard`
                (default),
                `legacy`
                (default), and `adaptive`. For more information on retries, see
                [AWS CLI retries in the AWS CLI](./cli-configure-retries.html).

You can override this value by using the `AWS_RETRY_MODE`
                            environment variable.

`retry_mode = standard`

                    **

`[role_arn](./cli-configure-role.html)`**
                    
                        Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that you
                            want to use to run the AWS CLI commands. You must also specify one of the
                            following parameters to identify the credentials that have permission to
                            assume this role:

-

`[role_session_name](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-session-name)`**

Specifies the name to attach to the role session. This value is
                            provided to the `RoleSessionName` parameter when the AWS CLI
                            calls the `AssumeRole` operation, and becomes part of the
                            assumed role user ARN: `
                                    arn:aws:sts::123456789012`:assumed-role/`role_name`/`role_session_name`.
                            This is an optional parameter. If you do not provide this value, a
                            session name is generated automatically. This name appears in AWS CloudTrail
                            logs for entries associated with this session.

`role_session_name = maria_garcia_role`

                    **

`sdk_ua_app_id`**

A single AWS account can be used by multiple customer applications
                            to make calls to AWS services. Application ID identifies which source
                            application made a set of calls using an AWS service. AWS SDKs and
                            services don't use or interpret this value other than to surface it back
                            in customer communications. For example, this value can be included in
                            operational emails to uniquely identify which of your applications is
                            associated with the notification.

The Application ID is a string with maximum length of 50 characters.
                            Letters, numbers and the following special characters are allowed:
                                `! $ % & * + - . , ^ _ ` | ~` By default, no value is
                            assigned. 

`sdk_ua_app_id = prod1`
                        This setting can be overwritten by using the [AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID) environment variable. You
                            can't set this value as a command line parameter.

                    **

`sigv4a_signing_region_set`**

Specifies the regions to use when signing with SigV4a using a
                            comma-delimited list. If this variable is not set, the AWS CLI uses the
                            default used by the AWS service. If the AWS service has no default,
                            the request signature becomes valid in all regions using a value of
                                `*`.

`sigv4a_signing_region_set = us-west-2, us-east-1`

                                *IAM User Guide*

This setting can be overwritten by using the [AWS_SIGV4A_SIGNING_REGION_SET](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_SIGV4A_SIGNING_REGION_SET) environment
                            variable. You can't set this value as a command line parameter.

                    **

`[source_profile](./cli-configure-role.html)`**

Specifies a named profile with long-term credentials that the AWS CLI
                            can use to assume a role that you specified with the
                                `role_arn` parameter. You cannot specify both
                                `source_profile` and `credential_source` in
                            the same profile.

                    **

`[sso_account_id](./cli-configure-sso.html)`**
                    
                        Specifies the AWS account ID that contains the IAM role with the
                            permission that you want to grant to the associated IAM Identity Center user.

This setting does not have an environment variable or command line

                            This is separate from, and can be a different Region than the default
                            CLI `region` parameter.

                        A comma-delimited list of scopes to be authorized for the
                                `sso-session`. Scopes authorize access to IAM Identity
                            Center bearer token authorized endpoints. A valid scope is a string,
                            such as `sso:account:access`. This setting isn't applicable
                            to the legacy non-refreshable configuration.

`sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access`

                        Specifies the friendly name of the IAM role that defines the user's
                            permissions when using this profile. 

This setting does not have an environment variable or command line
                            option.

`sso_role_name = ReadAccess`

                    **

`[sso_start_url](./cli-configure-sso.html)`**
                    
                        Specifies the URL that points to the organization's AWS access
                            portal. The AWS CLI uses this URL to establish a session with the IAM Identity Center
                            service to authenticate its users. To find your AWS access portal URL,
                            use one of the following:

- 
                                
Open your invitation email, the AWS access portal URL is
                                    listed.

- 
                                
Open the AWS IAM Identity Center console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/). The AWS access
                                    portal URL is listed in your settings.

This setting does not have an environment variable or command line
                            option. 

`sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start`

`use_dualstack_endpoint`**
                    
                        Enables the use of dual-stack endpoints to send AWS requests. To
                            learn more about dual-stack endpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6
                            traffic, see [Using Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/dual-stack-endpoints.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*. Dual-stack endpoints
                            are available for some services in some regions. If a dual-stack
                            endpoint does not exist for the service or AWS Region, the request
                            fails. Valid settings are `true` and `false`. This
                            is disabled by default. For more information, see [Set to use dual-stack endpoints for all
                AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-dual-stack).

 This is mutually exclusive with the
                                `use_accelerate_endpoint` setting.

###### Endpoint precedence

Endpoint configuration settings are located in multiple places, such as the system or
            user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or explicitly declared on
            the command line as a parameter. The AWS CLI checks these endpoint settings in a
            particular order, and uses the endpoint setting with the highest precedence. For the
            endpoint precedence list, see [Endpoint configuration and settings
                precedence](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-precedence).

                    **

`use_fips_endpoint`**

Some AWS services offer endpoints that support [Federal Information
                                Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/) in some AWS Regions. When
                            the AWS service supports FIPS, this setting specifies what FIPS
                            endpoint the AWS CLI should use . Unlike standard AWS endpoints, FIPS
                            endpoints use a TLS software library that complies with FIPS 140-2.
                            These endpoints might be required by enterprises that interact with the
                            United States government. For more information see, [Set to use FIPs endpoints for all
                AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-fips).

If this setting is enabled, but a FIPS endpoint does not exist for the
                            service in your AWS Region, the AWS command may fail. In this case,
                            manually specify the endpoint to use in the command using the
                                    `[--endpoint-url](./cli-configure-options.html#cli-configure-options-endpoint-url)` option or use [service-specific
                                endpoints](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-service-specific).

###### Endpoint precedence

                    **

`[web_identity_token_file](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc)`**

Specifies the path to a file that contains an OAuth 2.0 access token
                            or OpenID Connect ID token that is provided by an identity provider. The
                            AWS CLI loads the contents of this file and passes it as the
                                `WebIdentityToken` argument to the
                                `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` operation.

The environment variable `[AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE)` overrides this
                            setting.

For more information on using web identities, see [Assume role with web identity](./cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-oidc).

                    **

`tcp_keepalive`**

Specifies whether the AWS CLI client uses TCP keep-alive packets.

This entry does not have an equivalent environment variable or command
                            line option.

`tcp_keepalive = false`

### S3 Custom command settings

            Amazon S3 supports several settings that configure how the AWS CLI performs Amazon S3
                operations. Some apply to all S3 commands in both the `s3api` and
                    `s3` namespaces. Others are specifically for the S3 "custom" commands
                that abstract common operations and do more than a one-to-one mapping to an API
                operation. The `aws s3` transfer commands `cp`,
                    `sync`, `mv`, and `rm` have additional settings
                you can use to control S3 transfers. 

All of these options can be configured by specifying the `s3` nested
                setting in your `config` file. Each setting is then indented on
                its own line. 

###### Note

These settings are entirely optional. You should be able to successfully use
                    the `aws s3` transfer commands without configuring any of these
                    settings. These settings are provided to enable you to tune for performance or
                    to account for the specific environment where you are running these `aws
                        s3` commands.

These settings are all set under a top-level `s3` key in the
                    `config` file, as shown in the following example for the
                    `development` profile.

`[profile development]
s3 =
  max_concurrent_requests = 20
  max_queue_size = 10000
  multipart_threshold = 64MB
  multipart_chunksize = 16MB
  max_bandwidth = 50MB/s
  use_accelerate_endpoint = true
  addressing_style = path`
            The following settings apply to any S3 command in the `s3` or
                    `s3api` namespaces.

                    **

`addressing_style`**

Specifies which addressing style to use. This controls whether the
                            bucket name is in the hostname or is part of the URL. Valid values are:
                                `path`, `virtual`, and `auto`. The
                            default value is `auto`.

There are two styles of constructing an Amazon S3 endpoint. The first is
                            called `virtual` and includes the bucket name as part of the
                            hostname. For example:
                                    `https://bucketname`.s3.amazonaws.com.
                            Alternatively, with the `path` style, you treat the bucket
                            name as if it is a path in the URI; for example,
                                    `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketname`.
                            The default value in the CLI is to use `auto`, which attempts
                            to use the `virtual` style where it can, but will fall back
                            to `path` style when required. For example, if your bucket
                            name is not DNS compatible, the bucket name cannot be part of the
                            hostname and must be in the path. With `auto`, the CLI will
                            detect this condition and automatically switch to `path`
                            style for you. If you set the addressing style to `path`, you
                            must then ensure that the AWS Region you configured in the AWS CLI
                            matches the Region of your bucket.

                    **

`payload_signing_enabled`**

Specifies whether to SHA256 sign sigv4 payloads. By default, this is
                            disabled for streaming uploads (`UploadPart` and
                                `PutObject`) when using HTTPS. By default, this is set to
                                `false` for streaming uploads (`UploadPart`
                            and `PutObject`), but only if a `ContentMD5` is
                            present (it is generated by default) and the endpoint uses HTTPS.

If set to true, S3 requests receive additional content validation in
                            the form of a SHA256 checksum which is calculated for you and included
                            in the request signature. If set to false, the checksum isn't
                            calculated. Disabling this can be useful to reduce the performance
                            overhead created by the checksum calculation. 

                    **

`use_accelerate_endpoint`**

Use the Amazon S3 Accelerate endpoint for all `s3` and
                                `s3api` commands. The default value is false. This is
                            mutually exclusive with the `use_dualstack_endpoint` setting. 

If set to true, the AWS CLI directs all Amazon S3 requests to the `S3
                                Accelerate` endpoint at
                                `s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com`. To use this endpoint, you
                            must enable your bucket to use `S3 Accelerate`. All requests
                            are sent using the virtual style of bucket addressing:
                                    `my-bucket`.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com.
                            Any `ListBuckets`, `CreateBucket`, and
                                `DeleteBucket `requests aren't sent to the S3 Accelerate
                            endpoint as that endpoint doesn't support those operations. This
                            behavior can also be set if the `--endpoint-url` parameter is
                            set to `https://s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com` or
                                `http://s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com` for any
                                `s3` or `s3api` command.

`use_dualstack_endpoint`**

Enables the use of dual-stack endpoints to send `s3` and
                                `s3api` requests. To learn more about dual-stack
                            endpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, see [Using Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/dual-stack-endpoints.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*. Dual-stack endpoints
                            are available for some services in some regions. If a dual-stack
                            endpoint does not exist for the service or AWS Region, the request
                            fails. Valid settings are `true` and `false`. This
                            is disabled by default. For more information, see [Set to use dual-stack endpoints for all
                AWS services](./cli-configure-endpoints.html#endpoints-dual-stack).

 This is mutually exclusive with the
                                `use_accelerate_endpoint` setting.

The following settings apply only to commands in the `s3` namespace
                command set.

                    **

`max_bandwidth`**

Specifies the maximum bandwidth that can be consumed for uploading and
                            downloading data to and from Amazon S3. The default is no limit.

This limits the maximum bandwidth that the S3 commands can use to
                            transfer data to and from Amazon S3. This value applies to only uploads and
                            downloads; it doesn't apply to copies or deletes. The value is expressed
                            as bytes per second. The value can be specified as:

- 
                                
An integer. For example, `1048576` sets the maximum
                                    bandwidth usage to 1 megabyte per second. 

- 
                                
An integer followed by a rate suffix. You can specify rate
                                    suffixes using: `KB/s`, `MB/s`, or
                                        `GB/s`. For example, `300KB/s`,
                                        `10MB/s`. 

In general, we recommend that you first try to lower bandwidth
                            consumption by lowering `max_concurrent_requests`. If that
                            doesn't adequately limit bandwidth consumption to the desired rate, you
                            can use the `max_bandwidth` setting to further limit
                            bandwidth consumption. This is because
                                `max_concurrent_requests` controls how many threads are
                            currently running. If you instead first lower `max_bandwidth`
                            but leave a high `max_concurrent_requests` setting, it can
                            result in threads having to wait unnecessarily. This can lead to excess
                            resource consumption and connection timeouts.

                    **

`max_concurrent_requests`**

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent requests. The default value
                            is 10.

The `aws s3` transfer commands are multithreaded. At any
                            given time, multiple Amazon S3 requests can be running. For example, when you
                            use the command `aws s3 cp localdir s3://bucket/ --recursive`
                            to upload files to an S3 bucket, the AWS CLI can upload the files
                                `localdir/file1`,
                                `localdir/file2`, and
                                `localdir/file3` in parallel. The setting
                                `max_concurrent_requests` specifies the maximum number of
                            transfer operations that can run at the same time. 

You might need to change this value for a few reasons:

- 
                                
Decreasing this value â On some environments, the
                                    default of 10 concurrent requests can overwhelm a system. This
                                    can cause connection timeouts or slow the responsiveness of the
                                    system. Lowering this value makes the S3 transfer commands less
                                    resource intensive. The tradeoff is that S3 transfers can take
                                    longer to complete. Lowering this value might be necessary if
                                    you use a tool to limit bandwidth. 

- 
                                
Increasing this value â In some scenarios, you might
                                    want the Amazon S3 transfers to complete as quickly as possible,
                                    using as much network bandwidth as necessary. In this scenario,
                                    the default number of concurrent requests might not be
                                    sufficient to use all of the available network bandwidth.
                                    Increasing this value can improve the time it takes to complete
                                    an Amazon S3 transfer.

                    **

`max_queue_size`**

Specifies the maximum number of tasks in the task queue. The default
                            value is 1000.

The AWS CLI internally uses a model where it queues up Amazon S3 tasks that
                            are then executed by consumers whose numbers are limited by
                                `max_concurrent_requests`. A task generally maps to a
                            single Amazon S3 operation. For example, a task could be a
                                `PutObjectTask`, or a `GetObjectTask`, or an
                                `UploadPartTask`. The rate at which tasks are added to
                            the queue can be much faster than the rate at which consumers finish the
                            tasks. To avoid unbounded growth, the task queue size is capped to a
                            specific size. This setting changes the value of that maximum
                            number.

You generally don't need to change this setting. This setting also
                            corresponds to the number of tasks that the AWS CLI is aware of that need
                            to be run. This means that by default the AWS CLI can only see 1000 tasks
                            ahead. Increasing this value means that the AWS CLI can more quickly know
                            the total number of tasks needed, assuming that the queuing rate is
                            quicker than the rate of task completion. The tradeoff is that a larger
                            max_queue_size requires more memory.

                    **

`multipart_chunksize`**

Specifies the chunk size that the AWS CLI uses for multipart transfers
                            of individual files. The default value is 8 MB, with a minimum of 5
                            MB.

When a file transfer exceeds the `multipart_threshold`, the
                            AWS CLI divides the file into chunks of this size. This value can be
                            specified using the same syntax as `multipart_threshold`,
                            either as the number of bytes as an integer, or by using a size and a
                            suffix.

                    **

`multipart_threshold`**

Specifies the size threshold the AWS CLI uses for multipart transfers of
                            individual files. The default value is 8 MB.

When uploading, downloading, or copying a file, the Amazon S3 commands
                            switch to multipart operations if the file exceeds this size. You can
                            specify this value in one of two ways:

- 
                                
The file size in bytes. For example,
                                    `1048576`.

- 
                                
The file size with a size suffix. You can use `KB`,
                                        `MB`, `GB`, or `TB`. For
                                    example: `10MB`, `1GB`. 

###### Note

S3 can impose constraints on valid values that can be used
                                        for multipart operations. For more information, see the
                                            [S3 Multipart
                                            Upload documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.
