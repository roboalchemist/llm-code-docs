# URL Block

The URL block is used to collect URLs from users. It validates the user's input to ensure that it is a valid URL.

You can use this block to ask users for website URLs, social media profiles, or any other web addresses.

## Configuration

The URL block has the following configuration options:

* **Store answer in variable**: The variable where the user's input will be stored.
* **Input required**: Whether the user's input is mandatory. If disabled, a Skip button will appear, allowing users to skip the input.
