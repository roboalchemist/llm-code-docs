> Learn how to set the visibility of your chatbot on specific pages.

Sometimes you may want to hide your chatbot on specific pages of your website. This could be for various reasons, such as maintaining a distraction-free environment on certain pages, or to comply with specific page requirements. Chatling provides a simple way to control the visibility of your chatbot by allowing you to specify URLs where the chatbot widget should not appear.

## How to hide the chatbot on specific pages

1. From the chatbot dashboard, go to `Settings`.

3. In the `Hide chatbot on specific pages` section, type the URL of the page where you want to hide the chatbot and press the Enter key.
4. Repeat the previous step for each page where you want to hide the chatbot.
5. Click `Save` to apply the changes.

You can also enter wildcard URLs to hide the chatbot on multiple pages. For example, if you want to hide the chatbot on the blog, you can enter `https://example.com/blog/*` to hide it from all pages in the blog.
