# Save contacts from chatbot conversations

You can collect user information at any point in your chatbot flow and save it as a contact using the [Create Contact](/chatbot/builder/blocks/action/create-contact) block. The contact is automatically associated with the user and retained across future chat sessions.

The example below shows a flow that collects the user's name, email, and phone number using a form. Once submitted, it is used to create a new contact.

All contacts created by the chatbot are displayed in the `Contacts` page in your dashboard.
