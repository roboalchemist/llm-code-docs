# Phone Block

> Learn about the Phone input block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The Phone block is used to collect phone numbers from users.

At the moment, the Phone block is not fully developed and doesn't have the ability to validate phone numbers or provide option for users to select their country code. We are working on improving this block and will update this documentation once the changes are live.
