# Set the language of your chatbot widget

> Set the language of your chatbot widget.

The chatbot is available in over 45 languages. You can customize the language of your chatbot to match your audience's preferences. This affects all text elements in the chatbot widget, including placeholders, buttons, and system messages.

By default, the language is set to `Auto`. This means that the chatbot will automatically detect the user's language based on their browser settings.

## Set the language

1. From your chatbot's dashboard, go to **Appearance**.
