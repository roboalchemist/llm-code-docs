> Learn how to use the Language condition block in Chatling

The Language condition block is used to define flows based on the user's browser language. This can be useful for creating multilingual bots that respond in the user's preferred language.

Let's say you want to create a bot that supports English, Spanish, and French languages. You can use the Language condition block to define different responses or actions based on the user's preferred language setting in their browser.

Below is an example of such a flow. The Else path is a fallback for users whose language is not supported by the bot. In this case, it falls back to the English language.
