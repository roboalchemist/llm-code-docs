# AI Actions

Actions unlock the true power of AI Agents. Instead of only generating replies, the agent can actively carry out tasks during a conversation. This might involve saving details of potential leads, interacting with external systems to fetch or store data, creating support tickets, and more.

By using actions, you give your agent the power to handle practical steps on its own. This transforms the chatbot experience from a simple Q\&A into an interactive assistant that can streamline processes, save time, and improve outcomes for both your team and your users.

## Available Actions

* **[Lead Form](/ai-agent/actions/lead-form)**: displays a form to collect the user's details and save them as a contact.
* **[Buttons](/ai-agent/actions/buttons)**: displays a set of buttons in the chat, such as URL buttons to open a webpage or text buttons to send preset replies that keep the flow moving.
* **[HTTP Request](/ai-agent/actions/http-request)**: sends a request to an external API to fetch or store data, or perform an action. This allows you to connect your agent to external tools and services.
* **[Cal.com Booking Widget](/ai-agent/actions/cal-booking)**: Lets users book appointments directly within the chat.
* **[Send Email](/ai-agent/actions/send-email)**: sends a custom email to any recipient.
