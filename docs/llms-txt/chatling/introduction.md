# Introduction

Welcome to the Chatling documentation. This is your end-to-end guide to the platform that explains core concepts, walks you through setup and deployment, and helps you get the most out of the platform.

## What is Chatling?

Chatling is a no-code platform that lets you build conversational AI agents in minutes, trained on custom data, such as business websites, company policies, knowledge bases and documents.

Deploy your agents seamlessly on your website and other channels to automate customer support, capture and qualify leads, and deliver accurate answers.

## Products

There are two types of products available in the Chatling platform.

### 1. AI Agents

Outcome-driven assistants that understand intent and act autonomously. Agents follow your instructions, use your knowledge, and invoke custom actions to fetch/store/update data and complete tasks—no flow building required.

### 2. AI Chatbots

Flow-based bots you design with a visual builder. Define steps, branches, and messages to create predictable, guided experiences (menus, FAQs, forms) with optional AI answers—ideal where tight control and consistency matter.
