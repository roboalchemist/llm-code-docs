# How to connect your WhatsApp Business account

When you create a WhatsApp chatbot, an onboarding is displayed to guide you through the process of connecting your WhatsApp Business account to Chatling. We'll walk you through the steps below.

## Before you start

The phone number you connect must not be in use by a WhatsApp account. If it's in use, you must delete the account from WhatsApp before continuing.

Here's how to delete a WhatsApp account:

1. Open the WhatsApp app.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Account` > `Delete my account`.
3. Type in your phone number for confirmation and tap on `Delete my account`.

Once deleted, the phone number can be used to connect a new WhatsApp Business account.
