# What happens when AI credits are exhausted?

When your AI credits are exhausted, users can still interact with the chatbot and send messages, but an error will be displayed saying "Insufficient AI credits".

When the usage exceeds the limit, you must top up your AI credits by purchasing the **Extra AI Credits** add-on from Billing & Usage > Add-ons page. Alternatively, you can upgrade your plan to get more credits.

You can enable the **AI Credit Usage** notification in your account to be alerted when your usage reaches a threshold such as 50%, 75%, 90% or 100%.
