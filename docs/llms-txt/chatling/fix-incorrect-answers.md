# Fix incorrect AI answers

> Learn how to fix incorrect AI responses using the fine-tuning feature in Chatling.

Although the AI is trained on the data you add to the knowledge base, it may not always get the answer right, such as when it's asked a question that is not in the knowledge base or when it hallucinates.

To fix this, you can use the fine-tuning feature on Chatling's conversations page. This feature is designed to help improve the chatbot's performance by refining incorrect responses.

When you're viewing a conversation, you'll see a "Fine-tune this answer" button below every AI response. This feature allows you to fix incorrect AI responses so that it will learn to answer correctly in the future.

## How to use the fine-tuning feature

1. From the chatbot dashboard, click on the "Conversations" menu.

5. Once done, click the `Finetune` button. The new answer will be added to the FAQ sources in the knowledge base and will be queued for processing.

Now, when the AI is asked a similar question, it will respond with the answer you provided.
