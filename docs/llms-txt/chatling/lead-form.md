# Lead Form

Collect qualified leads right inside the conversation. The Lead Form action lets your AI Agent present a form in chat, collect user's information, and save them as a contact.

Any contacts saved by the AI agent will be displayed in the `Contacts` page in your dashboard.

## Configuration

Below are the configuration options for the Lead Form action:

### `Mandatory`

Determines whether the form submission is mandatory. When enabled, the user will be required to submit the form before they can continue.

If the option is disabled, an "X" button will be displayed in the form to allow the user to dismiss the form.
