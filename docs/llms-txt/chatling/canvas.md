The canvas is where you design the conversational flow of your chatbot. You can add [blocks](/chatbot/builder/blocks/overview), connect them, and define the logic for how the chatbot responds to user inputs.

To move around the canvas, click and drag an empty area. To zoom in or out, use your mouse scroll wheel or the zoom controls in top toolbar.

All chatbots contain a default `Start` block, which is the entry point of the conversation. From there, you can add blocks to create the flow.
