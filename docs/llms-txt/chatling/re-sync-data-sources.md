# Re-sync data sources

> Learn how to re-sync data sources in the Knowledge Base.

If you've made changes to your Link data sources (websites/webpages) or want to update the information in the Knowledge Base, you can re-sync the data sources to fetch the latest data. This process will re-fetch the data from the source and update the information in the Knowledge Base.

## Supported data sources

Re-syncing is available for Links data sources only, which include websites and webpages. Other data sources like Documents, Text, and FAQs do not require re-syncing as they are static and do not change unless you manually update them.

## How to re-sync a data source

To re-sync data sources in the Knowledge Base, follow these steps:

* Go to the `Knowledge Base`.
* Click on the `Link` tab to view all the links you have added.
* Next to every link is a re-sync icon, as shown below. Click on the icon to queue the link for re-syncing.

## Re-sync data sources in bulk

To re-sync multiple data sources at once, click on the checkbox next to the links you want to re-sync. Then, click on the `Bulk action` dropdown and select `Re-sync links`.
