> There are two types of variables: System Variable and Custom Variable. Learn how to use them in your chatbot.

Variables in the Builder are of two types:

System variables are predefined variables that contain system information or which can be used to perform specific actions. These variables are automatically created by the Builder.

To learn what a specific system variable does, you can open it from the Variables menu in the [sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar) and read its description.

There are also additional system variables that aren't imported by default. To view and import them, go to the Variables menu from the [Sidebar](/chatbot/builder/sidebar) and click the `Import system variables` button.

## Custom Variable

These are variables that you create to store information specific to your chatbot.

For example, you can create a custom variable to store the user's query and pass it to the AI for generating a response from the knowledge base.
