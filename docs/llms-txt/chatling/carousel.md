# Carousel Block

> Learn about the Carousel block and how to set it up in the builder

The Carousel block allows you to display a carousel of cards to the user. Each card can contain an image, title, description, and buttons.

Carousels are a great way to showcase multiple products, services, or information in a visually appealing format.

## Adding a carousel

To add a carousel, you can create multiple cards within the block editor. For each card, you can set an image, title, description, and buttons.

You can add as many cards as you like to the carousel. Users can swipe through the cards to view the content.
