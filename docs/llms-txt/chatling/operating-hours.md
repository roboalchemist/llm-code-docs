# Operating hours

> Schedule the chatbot to be visible at certain times.

You can set the operating hours for your chatbot to define when it should be available to users. This is useful if you want to limit the chatbot's availability to certain times of the day or week, e.g during business hours or off-hours.

When outside of the operating hours, your chatbot will be automatically hidden, ensuring it's only live when you want it to be.

## Set operating hours

1. From your chatbot's dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.

5. Click the `Add` button to add the schedule.
6. Click the `Save` button to save the changes.

Once you define the operating hours, the chatbot will be visible during the specified times and hidden outside of these hours.

## Edit existing operating hours

To edit the operating hours, you have to delete one or more schedules that you want to edit and then add the new schedules.
