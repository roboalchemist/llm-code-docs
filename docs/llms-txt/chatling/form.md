> Learn about the Form input block and how to set it up in the Builder.

The Form block is used to collect multiple pieces of information from users in a structured way. You can use this block to create forms for lead generation, user feedback, surveys, and more.

You can add multiple fields to the form and configure each field to collect different types of information, such as text, email, phone number, and more.
