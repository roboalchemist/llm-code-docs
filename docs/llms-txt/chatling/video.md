# Video Block

> Learn about the Video block and how to set it up in the builder

The Video block allows you to display a video to the user in the conversation. You can add a video from YouTube, Vimeo, or any other video hosting platform, or you can paste the direct link to a video file.

For video platforms that support embedding, Chatling will automatically embed the video in the conversation. Here's an example:

## Adding a video

Adding a video is simple. Just paste the URL to the video in the block editor and the chatbot will automatically embed it in the conversation.
