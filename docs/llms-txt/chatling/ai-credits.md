# AI credits

> Understanding AI credits and how they are consumed

AI credits are used to manage and track AI usage. These credits are consumed each time a chatbot or AI agent generates an AI response.

The number of credits consumed per response varies based on the AI model you use. Below's a breakdown of credit usage by model.

<Note>
  For chatbots, credits are not consumed for normal messages sent and received by users. It is only used when the chatbot uses AI to generate responses (such as when you use the [AI block](/chatbot/builder/blocks/ai/ai-response)).
