You can configure the following settings for the Text block:

* **Store answer in variable**: Choose a variable to store the user's response. You can use the stored data in other blocks to personalize the conversation.
* **Input required**: Determine whether the user must provide an answer to proceed. If this option is disabled, a Skip button will appear, allowing users to skip the input.

* **Min. characters**: The minimum number of characters the user must enter.
* **Max. characters**: The maximum number of characters the user can enter.
