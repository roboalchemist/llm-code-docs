# Display name approval

> Learn how to fix issues related to the display name approval for your WhatsApp account.

If you get an error message stating `WhatsApp provided number needs display name approval before messages can be sent`, it means you cannot use the WhatsApp bot until Facebook approves your display name.

This normally happens when you use the free WhatsApp number provided by Facebook when you first connect your WhatsApp account to Chatling.

To fix this issue, you must verify your business in Facebook before they approve your display name.

## How to verify your business in Facebook

1. Go to the [Security Center](https://business.facebook.com/latest/settings/security_center) in your Facebook Business Manager.
2. Under the `Business Verification` section, set the verification use case to `Setting up a WhatsApp Business account`.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to verify your business.
5. Once you complete the process, your business will either be verified immediately or placed under review.
6. After your business is verified, Facebook will begin reviewing your display name. To view the status of the review:

* Go to [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/overview).
* Click `Phone numbers` in the left sidebar.
* You will see the status of the review under the display name as shown below.
