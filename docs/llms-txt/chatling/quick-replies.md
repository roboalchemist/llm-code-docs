4. Click the `Add` button to add a new quick reply. Each quick reply will have a label and a message. The label will be displayed on the button and the message will be sent when the user clicks on the button.

<Note>Label is optional, but recommended to keep the button short and descriptive.</Note>

5. You can also add translations for the quick replies, which will be displayed automatically based on the user's language.

6. The `Auto-hide quick replies` option allows you to automatically hide the quick replies after a certain number of messages are sent by the user. This is useful to prevent the quick replies from being displayed at all times.
