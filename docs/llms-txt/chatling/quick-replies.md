# Quick Replies

Quick replies are messages that will help users respond quickly without having to type out a full response. They are displayed as buttons above the input field and users can click on them to send a message.

* Enter the label for the quick reply. This is the text that will be displayed on the button.
* Enter the message that will be sent when the user clicks on the quick reply button.

For example if the label is "Pricing" and the message is "Tell me about your pricing", the user will see a button with the text "Pricing" and when they click on it, the message "Tell me about your pricing" will be sent.
