# Create Ticket

> Create tickets in HubSpot from your chatbot.

Create tickets in HubSpot from your chatbot. This is useful for forwarding user queries to your support team or creating tickets for issues that require further investigation.

## Configuration

1. Click the `Connect account` button under the Account field to connect your HubSpot account to Chatling or select an existing connection.
2. Select the `Pipeline` where the ticket should be created.
3. Enter the ticket's details, such as the subject, status, and description. You can enter variables in all fields to make the ticket dynamic.
4. To store the ticket's ID when the ticket is created, select a variable for the `Ticket ID` field under the `Save response` section.
