Data health signals offer a quick, at-a-glance view of data health when browsing your resources in Catalog. They keep you informed on the status of your resource's health using the indicators **Healthy**, **Caution**, **Degraded**, or **Unknown**.

Note, we don’t calculate data health for non-dbt resources.

* Supported resources are [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models.md), [sources](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources.md), and [exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/exposures.md).
* For accurate health data, ensure the resource is up-to-date and had a recent job run.
* Each data health signal reflects key data health components, such as test success status, missing resource descriptions, missing tests, absence of builds in 30-day windows, [and more](#data-health-signal-criteria).

## Access data health signals[​](#access-data-health-signals "Direct link to Access data health signals")

Access data health signals in the following places:

* In the [search function](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects.md#search-resources) or under **Models**, **Sources**, or **Exposures** in the **Resource** tab.
  <!-- -->
  * For sources, the data health signal also indicates the [source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/source-freshness.md) status.
* In the **Health** column on [each resource's details page](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects.md#view-resource-details). Hover over or click the signal to view detailed information.
* In the **Health** column of public models tables.
* In the [DAG lineage graph](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/explore-projects.md#project-lineage). Click any node to open the node details panel where you can view it and its details.
* In [Data health tiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/data-tile.md) through an embeddable iFrame and visible in your BI dashboard.

## Data health signal criteria[​](#data-health-signal-criteria "Direct link to Data health signal criteria")

Each resource has a health state that is determined by specific set of criteria. Select the following tabs to view the criteria for that resource type.

* Models
* Sources
* Exposures

The health state of a model is determined by the following criteria:

| **Health state** | **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
