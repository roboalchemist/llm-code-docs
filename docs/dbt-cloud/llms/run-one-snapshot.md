# How do I run one snapshot at a time?

To run one snapshot, use the `--select` flag, followed by the name of the snapshot:

```shell
$ dbt snapshot --select order_snapshot
```

Check out the [model selection syntax documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax.md) for more operators and examples.
