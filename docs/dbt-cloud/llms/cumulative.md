## Cumulative metrics example[​](#cumulative-metrics-example "Direct link to Cumulative metrics example")

Cumulative metrics measure data over a given window and consider the window infinite when no window parameter is passed, accumulating the data over all time.

The following example shows how to define cumulative metrics in a YAML file:

Note the use of the `window` function to select the `first` value. For `last` and `average`, we would replace the `first_value()` function in the generated SQL with `last_value()` and `average` respectively.

```sql
-- re-aggregate metric via the group by
select
  metric_time__week,
  metric_time__quarter,
  revenue_all_time
from (
  -- window function for metric re-aggregation

    metric_time__week,
    metric_time__quarter,
    first_value(revenue_all_time) over (
      partition by
        metric_time__week,
        metric_time__quarter
      order by metric_time__day
      rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following
    ) as revenue_all_time
  from (
    -- join self over time range
    -- pass only elements: ['txn_revenue', 'metric_time__week', 'metric_time__quarter', 'metric_time__day']
    -- aggregate measures

      subq_11.metric_time__week,
      subq_11.metric_time__quarter

### Window options[​](#window-options "Direct link to Window options")

This section details examples of when to specify and not to specify window options.

### Grain to date[​](#grain-to-date "Direct link to Grain to date")

You can choose to specify a grain to date in your cumulative metric configuration to accumulate a metric from the start of a grain (such as week, month, or year). When using a window, such as a month, MetricFlow will go back one full calendar month. However, grain to date will always start accumulating from the beginning of the grain, regardless of the latest date of data.

<!-- -->

<!-- -->

We can compare the difference between a 1-month window and a monthly grain to date.

* The cumulative metric in a window approach applies a sliding window of 1 month
* The grain to date by month resets at the beginning of each month.

## SQL implementation example[​](#sql-implementation-example "Direct link to SQL implementation example")

To calculate the cumulative value of the metric over a given window we do a time range join to a timespine table using the primary time dimension as the join key. We use the accumulation window in the join to decide whether a record should be included on a particular day. The following SQL code produced from an example cumulative metric is provided for reference:

To implement cumulative metrics, refer to the SQL code example:

```sql
select
  count(distinct distinct_users) as weekly_active_users,
  metric_time
from (
  select
    subq_3.distinct_users as distinct_users,
    subq_3.metric_time as metric_time
  from (
    select
      subq_2.distinct_users as distinct_users,
      subq_1.metric_time as metric_time
    from (
      select
        metric_time
      from transform_prod_schema.mf_time_spine subq_1356
      where (
        metric_time >= cast('2000-01-01' as timestamp)
      ) and (
        metric_time <= cast('2040-12-31' as timestamp)
      )
    ) subq_1
    inner join (
      select
        distinct_users as distinct_users,
        date_trunc('day', ds) as metric_time
      from demo_schema.transactions transactions_src_426
      where (
        (date_trunc('day', ds)) >= cast('1999-12-26' as timestamp)
      ) AND (
        (date_trunc('day', ds)) <= cast('2040-12-31' as timestamp)
      )
    ) subq_2
    on
      (
        subq_2.metric_time <= subq_1.metric_time
      ) and (
        subq_2.metric_time > dateadd(day, -7, subq_1.metric_time)
      )
  ) subq_3
)
group by
  metric_time,
limit 100;
```

## Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

If you specify a `window` in your cumulative metric definition, you must include `metric_time` as a dimension in the SQL query. This is because the accumulation window is based on metric time. For example,

```sql
select
  count(distinct subq_3.distinct_users) as weekly_active_users,
  subq_3.metric_time
from (
  select
    subq_2.distinct_users as distinct_users,
    subq_1.metric_time as metric_time
group by
  subq_3.metric_time
```
