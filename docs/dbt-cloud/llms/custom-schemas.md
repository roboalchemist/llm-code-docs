# Custom schemas

By default, all dbt models are built in the schema specified in your [environment](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-environments.md) (dbt platform) or [profile's target](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/dbt-core-environments.md) (dbt Core). This default schema is called your *target schema*.

For projects with many models, it's common to organize them across multiple schemas. For example, you might want to:

* Group models based on the business unit using the model, creating schemas such as `core`, `marketing`, `finance` and `support`.
* Hide intermediate models in a `staging` schema, and only present models that should be queried by an end user in an `analytics` schema.

To do this, specify a custom schema. dbt generates the schema name for a model by appending the custom schema to the target schema. For example, `<target_schema>_<custom_schema>`.

| Target schema            | Custom schema | Resulting schema                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| analytics\_prod          | None          | analytics\_prod                     |
| alice\_dev               | None          | alice\_dev                          |
| dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 | None          | dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456            |
| analytics\_prod          | marketing     | analytics\_prod\_marketing          |
| alice\_dev               | marketing     | alice\_dev\_marketing               |
| dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 | marketing     | dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456\_marketing |

## How do I use custom schemas?[​](#how-do-i-use-custom-schemas "Direct link to How do I use custom schemas?")

To specify a custom schema for a model, use the `schema` configuration key. As with any configuration, you can do one of the following:

* apply this configuration to a specific model by using a config block within a model
* apply it to a subdirectory of models by specifying it in your `dbt_project.yml` file

orders.sql

```sql
{{ config(schema='marketing') }}

select ...
```

dbt\_project.yml

```yaml
# models in `models/marketing/ will be built in the "*_marketing" schema
models:
  my_project:
    marketing:
      +schema: marketing
```

## Understanding custom schemas[​](#understanding-custom-schemas "Direct link to Understanding custom schemas")

When first using custom schemas, it's a common misunderstanding to assume that a model *only* uses the new `schema` configuration; for example, a model that has the configuration `schema: marketing` would be built in the `marketing` schema. However, dbt puts it in a schema like `<target_schema>_marketing`.

There's a good reason for this deviation. Each dbt user has their own target schema for development (refer to [Managing Environments](#managing-environments)). If dbt ignored the target schema and only used the model's custom schema, every dbt user would create models in the same schema and would overwrite each other's work.

By combining the target schema and the custom schema, dbt ensures that objects it creates in your data warehouse don't collide with one another.

If you prefer to use different logic for generating a schema name, you can change the way dbt generates a schema name (see below).

### How does dbt generate a model's schema name?[​](#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name "Direct link to How does dbt generate a model's schema name?")

dbt uses a default macro called `generate_schema_name` to determine the name of the schema that a model should be built in.

The following code represents the default macro's logic:

```sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}

    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}

        {{ default_schema }}

    {%- else -%}

        {{ default_schema }}_{{ custom_schema_name | trim }}

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

<br />

💡 Use Jinja's whitespace control to tidy your macros!

When you're modifying macros in your project, you might notice extra white space in your code in the `target/compiled` folder.

You can remove unwanted spaces and lines with Jinja's [whitespace control](https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/Jinja/jinja-whitespace.md) by using a minus sign. For example, use `{{- ... -}}` or `{%- ... %}` around your macro definitions (such as `{%- macro generate_schema_name(...) -%} ... {%- endmacro -%}`).

## Changing the way dbt generates a schema name[​](#changing-the-way-dbt-generates-a-schema-name "Direct link to Changing the way dbt generates a schema name")

If your dbt project has a custom macro called `generate_schema_name`, dbt will use it instead of the default macro. This allows you to customize the name generation according to your needs.

To customize this macro, copy the example code in the section [How does dbt generate a model's schema name](#how-does-dbt-generate-a-models-schema-name) into a file named `macros/generate_schema_name.sql` and make changes as necessary.

Be careful. dbt will ignore any custom `generate_schema_name` macros included in installed packages.

 Warning: Don't replace \`default\_schema\` in the macro

If you're modifying how dbt generates schema names, don't just replace `{{ default_schema }}_{{ custom_schema_name | trim }}` with `{{ custom_schema_name | trim }}` in the `generate_schema_name` macro.

If you remove `{{ default_schema }}`, it causes developers to override each other's models if they create their own custom schemas. This can also cause issues during development and continuous integration (CI).

❌ The following code block is an example of what your code *should not* look like:

```sql
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}

    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}

        {{ default_schema }}

    {%- else -%}
    # The following is incorrect as it omits {{ default_schema }} before {{ custom_schema_name | trim }}. 
        {{ custom_schema_name | trim }} 

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

### Jinja context available in generate\_schema\_name[​](#jinja-context-available-in-generate_schema_name "Direct link to Jinja context available in generate_schema_name")

If you choose to write custom logic to generate a schema name, it's worth noting that not all variables and methods are available to you when defining this logic. In other words: the `generate_schema_name` macro is compiled with a limited Jinja context.

The following context methods *are* available in the `generate_schema_name` macro:

| Jinja context                                                                     | Type     | Available          |

## A built-in alternative pattern for generating schema names[​](#a-built-in-alternative-pattern-for-generating-schema-names "Direct link to A built-in alternative pattern for generating schema names")

A common customization is to use the custom schema in production when provided, with the target schema serving only as a fallback if no custom schema is specified. In other environments, such as development and CI, custom schema configurations are ignored, defaulting to the target schema instead.

Production Environment (`target.name == 'prod'`)

| Target schema   | Custom schema | Resulting schema |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| analytics\_prod | None          | analytics\_prod  |
| analytics\_prod | marketing     | marketing        |

| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

Development/CI Environment (`target.name != 'prod'`)

| Target schema            | Custom schema | Resulting schema         |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| alice\_dev               | None          | alice\_dev               |
| alice\_dev               | marketing     | alice\_dev               |
| dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 | None          | dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 |
| dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 | marketing     | dbt\_cloud\_pr\_123\_456 |

Search table...

|                  |   |   |   |   |
| ---------------- | - | - | - | - |
| Loading table... |   |   |   |   |

Similar to the regular macro, this approach guarantees that schemas from different environments will not collide.

dbt ships with a macro for this use case — called `generate_schema_name_for_env` — which is disabled by default. To enable it, add a custom `generate_schema_name` macro to your project that contains the following code:

macros/generate\_schema\_name.sql

```sql
-- put this in macros/generate_schema_name.sql

{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}
    {{ generate_schema_name_for_env(custom_schema_name, node) }}
{%- endmacro %}
```

When using this macro, you'll need to set the target name in your production job to `prod`.

## Managing environments[​](#managing-environments "Direct link to Managing environments")

In the `generate_schema_name` macro examples shown in the [built-in alternative pattern](#a-built-in-alternative-pattern-for-generating-schema-names) section, the `target.name` context variable is used to change the schema name that dbt generates for models. If the `generate_schema_name` macro in your project uses the `target.name` context variable, you must ensure that your different dbt environments are configured accordingly. While you can use any naming scheme you'd like, we typically recommend:

* **dev** — Your local development environment; configured in a `profiles.yml` file on your computer.
* **ci** — A [continuous integration](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/connect-github.md) environment running on pull requests in GitHub, GitLab, and so on.
* **prod** — The production deployment of your dbt project, like in dbt, Airflow, or [similar](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deployments.md).

If your schema names are being generated incorrectly, double-check your target name in the relevant environment.

For more information, consult the [managing environments in dbt Core](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/dbt-core-environments.md) guide.
