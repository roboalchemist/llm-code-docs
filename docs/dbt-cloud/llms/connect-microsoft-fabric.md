# Connect Microsoft Fabric

## Supported authentication methods[​](#supported-authentication-methods "Direct link to Supported authentication methods")

The supported authentication methods are:

* Microsoft Entra service principal
* Microsoft Entra password

SQL password (LDAP) is not supported in Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse so you must use Microsoft Entra ID. This means that to use [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric) in dbt, you will need at least one Microsoft Entra service principal to connect dbt to Fabric, ideally one service principal for each user.

### Microsoft Entra service principal[​](#microsoft-entra-service-principal "Direct link to Microsoft Entra service principal")
