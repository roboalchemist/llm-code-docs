# Why might my actual warehouse costs differ from displayed costs?

Cost Insights shows estimates based on warehouse-reported usage and your configured pricing variables. These estimates are based on a retroactive analysis of historical runs and reflect actual usage, *not* forecasts of future costs. Adjustments and differences may occur if:

* Your warehouse has custom pricing that differs from the default compute credit unit.
* There are discounts or credits applied at the billing level that aren't reflected in usage tables.
* Costs include other charges beyond compute.

Costs Insights in the dbt platform is designed to be directionally accurate, showing you dbt-specific components rather than matching your billing exactly.
