# Deploy dbt

Use dbt's capabilities to seamlessly run a dbt job in production or staging environments. Rather than run dbt commands manually from the command line, you can leverage the [dbt's in-app scheduling](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/job-scheduler.md) to automate how and when you execute dbt.

The dbt platform offers the easiest and most reliable way to run your dbt project in production. Effortlessly promote high quality code from development to production and build fresh data assets that your business intelligence tools and end users query to make business decisions. Deploying with dbt lets you:

* Keep production data fresh on a timely basis
* Ensure CI and production pipelines are efficient
* Identify the root cause of failures in deployment environments
* Maintain high-quality code and data in production
* Gain visibility into the [health](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/explore/data-tile.md) of deployment jobs, models, and tests
* Uses [exports](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports.md) to write [saved queries](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/saved-queries.md) in your data platform for reliable and fast metric reporting
* [Visualize](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/downstream-exposures-tableau.md) and [orchestrate](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud-integrations/orchestrate-exposures.md) downstream exposures to understand how models are used in downstream tools and proactively refresh the underlying data sources during scheduled dbt jobs. [Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")
* Use [dbt's Git repository caching](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/account-settings.md#git-repository-caching) to protect against third-party outages and improve job run reliability. [Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")[Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing")
* Use [Hybrid projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/hybrid-projects.md) to upload dbt artifacts into the dbt platform for central visibility, cross-project referencing, and easier collaboration. [Enterprise +](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing "Go to https://www.getdbt.com/pricing") Preview

Before continuing, make sure you understand dbt's approach to [deployment environments](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments.md).
