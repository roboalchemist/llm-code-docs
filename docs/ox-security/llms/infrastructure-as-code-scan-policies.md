# Infrastructure as Code Scan Policies

Infrastructure as Code Scan policies focus on identifying security issues directly within application source code.

The article describes the policies in this category, configuration options, and the impact of policy violations. For an overview of policies and policy management, see the [Policies](https://docs.ox.security/ox-policies)article.

<summary>IaC issue</summary>

**Purpose:** Detects Infrastructure as Code (IaC) issues that indicate misconfigurations or insecure definitions in managed infrastructure.

**Business impact:** IaC issues can create security gaps that allow unauthorized access or unintended exposure of cloud resources. They can also cause operational instability, service outages, or inefficient resource usage. Failure to address these issues increases risk as cloud environments scale and change.
