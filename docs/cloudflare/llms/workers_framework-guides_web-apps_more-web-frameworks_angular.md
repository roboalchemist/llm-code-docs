In this guide, you will create a new [Angular](https://angular.dev/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Angular's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Angular project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-angular-app --framework=angular
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare my-angular-app --framework=angular
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-angular-app --framework=angular
  ```

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-angular-app
```

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm run start
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn run start
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm run start
  ```

## 3. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm run deploy
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn run deploy
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm run deploy
  ```

## Static assets

By default, Cloudflare first tries to match a request path against a static asset path, which is based on the file structure of the uploaded asset directory. This is either the directory specified by `assets.directory` in your Wrangler config or, in the case of the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/), the output directory of the client build. Failing that, we invoke a Worker if one is present. If there is no Worker, or the Worker then uses the asset binding, Cloudflare will fallback to the behaviour set by [`not_found_handling`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/#routing-behavior).

Refer to the [routing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/) for more information about how routing works with static assets, and how to customize this behavior.
