Cloudflare Realtime billing is based on data sent from Cloudflare edge to your application.

Cloudflare Realtime SFU and TURN services cost $0.05 per GB of data egress.

There is a free tier of 1,000 GB before any charges start. This free tier includes usage from both SFU and TURN services, not two independent free tiers. Cloudflare Realtime billing appears as a single line item on your Cloudflare bill, covering both SFU and TURN.

Traffic between Cloudflare Realtime TURN and Cloudflare Realtime SFU or Cloudflare Stream (WHIP/WHEP) does not get double charged, so if you are using both SFU and TURN at the same time, you will get charged for only one.

### TURN

Please see the [TURN FAQ page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/faq), where there is additional information on specifically which traffic path from RFC8656 is measured and counts towards billing.

### SFU

Only traffic originating from Cloudflare towards clients incurs charges. Traffic pushed to Cloudflare incurs no charge even if there is no client pulling same traffic from Cloudflare.
