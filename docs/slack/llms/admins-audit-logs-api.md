# Using the Audit Logs API

The features within are only available to Slack workspaces on an Enterprise plan.

The [Audit Logs API](/reference/audit-logs-api) is meant for anyone interested in programmatically monitoring audit events in a Slack [Enterprise](/enterprise) organization. This may include:

* Providers of security information and event management (SIEM) solutions looking to integrate with Slack
* Enterprise organization administrators looking for insight into how their team is accessing Slack
* Security professionals interested in actively monitoring their Slack organization for potential security issues

API method reference

## What the Audit Logs API can do {#what}

The Audit Logs API is for monitoring the audit events happening in an Enterprise organization to ensure continued compliance, to safeguard against any inappropriate system access, and to allow you to audit suspicious behavior within your enterprise.

The idea is to give Enterprise organization owners the ability to query user actions in a workspace. With this API, you could:

* Automatically feed Slack access data into an SIEM or other auditing tool
* Proactively monitor for potential security issues or malicious access attempts
* Write custom apps to gain insight into how your organization uses Slack

These API methods provide a view of the actions users perform in an organization. They do **_not_** enable monitoring of message content. If you need to proactively monitor the messages in a Slack organization or workspace for compliance reasons, you may consider an e-Discovery or Data Loss Prevention solution.

The Audit Logs API provides insight into audit events that are actually happening across a Slack organization and is therefore read only. There are no write methods for Audit Log events.

Slack also does not perform any kind of automated intrusion detection. The Audit Logs API will return the data but can not automatically determine or indicate whether an action was appropriate.

Slack has built an internal platform for processing our Slack logs in real time to detect statistically key characteristics and anomalies, and then surface them in the admin audit logs.

The Audit Logs API supports a subset of all possible Slack audit events.

We will continue to add support for additional audit events.

## Installing an app in an Enterprise organization {#install}

Apps requesting the `auditlogs:read` scope _must_ be installed by the _Owner_ of an Enterprise organization.

Audit Logs events work across an entire Enterprise organization, not individual workspaces. For this reason, the OAuth token used for calling Audit Logs API methods must be obtained from installing the app on the organization, not just a workspace within the organization.

To configure and install an app supporting Audit Logs on your Enterprise organization:

1. The web service powering your app will need to be able to handle a standard [OAuth 2 flow](/authentication/installing-with-oauth).
2. [Create an app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)

3. In the app's settings, select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left navigation. Scroll down to the section titled **Scopes**, then click **Add an OAuth Scope** under **User Token Scopes**. Add the `auditlogs:read` scope.
4. In the app's settings, select **Manage Distribution** from the left navigation. Under the section titled **Share Your App with Other Workspaces**, make sure all four sections have the green check. Then click the green **Activate Public Distribution** button.
5. Under the **Share Your App with Your Workspace** section, copy the **Sharable URL** and paste it into a browser to initiate the OAuth handshake that will install the app on your organization. You must be logged in as the **Owner** of your Enterprise organization to install the app.
6. Check the dropdown in the upper right of the installation screen to make sure you are installing the app on the Enterprise organization, not an individual workspace within the organization. (See image below.) If you have difficulty installing the app, you may need to add a bot scope in order to install to an Enterprise organization.
7. Once your app completes the OAuth flow, you will be granted an OAuth token that can be used for calling all of the Audit Logs API methods for your organization.

When installing an Audit Logs app, be sure to install it on your Enterprise organization, not a workspace within the organization.(See step 6 above.)

## The audit event {#audit-event}

If the Slack workspace is a stage, all the members are merely actors. They have their exits and entrances, and one user in time plays many parts.

Every audit event logged by the Audit Logs API is comprised of an **actor**, an **action**, an **entity**, and a **context**. They all work in harmony, such that the **actor** takes an **action** on an **entity** within a **context**.

The audit log events are returned to you as JSON, the exact format of which will vary slightly depending on the type of audit event. Each entry will describe the `action`, the `actor` that generated the event, the `entity`, and its `context`. Here's an audit event for a user logging in:

```json
{   "entries":[      {         "id":"0123a45b-6c7d-8900-e12f-3456789gh0i1",         "date_create":1521214343,         "action":"user_login",         "actor":{            "type":"user",            "user":{               "id":"W123AB456",               "name":"Charlie Parker",               "email":"bird@slack.com"            }         },         "entity":{            "type":"user",            "user":{               "id":"W123AB456",               "name":"Charlie Parker",               "email":"bird@slack.com"            }         },         "context":{            "location":{               "type":"enterprise",               "id":"E1701NCCA",               "name":"Birdland",               "domain":"birdland"            },            "ua":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/64.0.3282.186 Safari\/537.36",            "session_id": "847288190092",            "ip_address":"1.23.45.678"         }      }    ]}
```text

An **actor** will always be a user on a workspace and will be identified by their user ID, such as `W123AB456`. For eDiscovery apps with actions `file_downloaded` or `file_downloaded_blocked` the **actor** will be the user who installed the app.

If customer credentials were reset on their behalf by a Slack security agent, the ID will be `USLACKSECURITY`.

Occasionally, an event may fire without an actor, in which case Slack returns a placeholder `actor` object where the ID will be `USLACKUSER`.

An **action** is the thing the actor did. It will be an easily identifiable string from [the known list of actions](/reference/audit-logs-api/methods-actions-reference#actions). An example might be `user_login`, `file_downloaded`, or `emoji_removed`.

An **entity** is the thing that the actor has taken the action upon. It will be the Slack ID of the thing, such as:

* A user (`WXXXXXXXX`)
* A channel (`CXXXXXXXX`)
* A file (`FXXXXXXXX`)
* An app (`AXXXXXXXX`)
* A workspace (`TXXXXXXXX`)
* An enterprise (`EXXXXXXXX`)

For example, the entity corresponding to the audit event of a team member logging in is that _user_. For a file that was downloaded, the entity is that _file_. For an emoji being removed, it is the _workspace_ from which the emoji was removed.

The number of both entities and actions will always continue to grow to include other Slack components. So many new things happen in Slack, we don't always document them before they happen. We're certain the enumeration of audit events in this document is incomplete.

Finally, the **context** is the location where the actor took the action on the entity. It will always be either a Workspace or an Enterprise, with the appropriate ID.

Some audit events may optionally include **details** where appropriate — for example, if it would be helpful to know the previous value of a setting that was changed.

Audit events triggered through apps will include app which contains information about the app used to make the request. For a period of time app was logged for all events which was set to `null` when not triggered by an app, however a change has been made to ensure app only appears when required moving forward.

```json
