## Guides for admins {#management}

### Manage app approvals {#manage_app_approvals}

Build an app that can handle approvals and restrictions for admins across an entire Slack org. Read our guide to [app approval APIs](/admins/managing-app-approvals).

### Manage channels {#manage_channels}

Handle the intricacies of creating public and private channels, setting preferences, and connecting new workspaces—all with a single app. Use the [APIs for channel management](/admins/managing-channels).

### Manage invite requests {#manage_invite_requests}

Let users invite friends to unexplored workspaces, while maintaining admin approval over those invites. Explore [the invite request management APIs](/admins/managing-invite-requests).

### Manage users {#manage_users}

An app can create a workspace and control addition and removal of that workspace's users. Apps can even mark a user as an admin or owner. Read our guide to [the APIs for managing users in a workspace](/admins/managing-users).

Other things you can do to manage users include:

* Using **allowlists**: You can add, remove, and list membership allowlists for private channels.
* **Reset sessions rapidly**: When you suspect a device—mobile, web, or both—has been swiped, take immediate action.
* **Define default channels for IDP groups**: An [IDP group](https://slack.com/help/articles/115001435788-Connect-identity-provider-groups-to-your-Enterprise-organization) represents a group of users synced from your identity provider (IDP). You can add, remove, and list default channels for an IDP group.
