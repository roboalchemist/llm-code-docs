## Usage info {#usage-info}

This method enqueues a job that wipes sessions for a list of users, leaving them unauthenticated. The users' Slack clients will reset their local cache.

By default, the enqueued job will reset all sessions for the given users. Use the `web_only` and `mobile_only` parameters to wipe only web or only mobile sessions.

An ok response from this endpoint does not mean all sessions have been reset. This process is asynchronous. It means that the job that performs the reset has successfully been enqueued.

Here's an example call to this endpoint:

```json

{  "token": "xoxp-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx",  "user_ids": ["U1234", "U2345", "U3456"],  "mobile_only": true}

* * *

## Response {#response}

#### Typical success response

```json

{  "ok": true}

#### Typical error response

```json

{  "ok": false,  "error": "invalid_auth"}

## Errors {#errors}

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
