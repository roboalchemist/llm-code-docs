## Usage info {#usage-info}

This method allows searching accross all workflows in the top-level team of the caller. It returns an array of all workflows in the org, letting you filter by app ID, name, etc.

Since workflows can have an unlimited number of triggers, there may be some cases where we may not be able to accurately report trigger information in the response. For example, if a workflow has hundreds of triggers, we are only able to populate response fields such as `trigger_types` or `trigger_ids` for a subset of those triggers. We provide the `num_trigger_ids` parameter to allow fetching more triggers but this is limited to a maxiumum value for performance reasons.

This method requires the caller having the permission to manage apps for the workspace or enterprise.
