# Release: Slack CLI v2.9.0

September 8, 2023

Version `2.9.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has landed!

* We now support Slack's new look & feel.
* You can now specify which workspace within an Enterprise organization to grant your app access to when you `deploy` and `install` your app by using the `--org-workspace-grant` flag.
* Sometimes additional admin approval is needed before your app can be installed. We now notify you that pending app approval/denial notifications will come from Slackbot.
* We added more workflow events to the CLI for improved troubleshooting.
* We updated the output of our `--info` flag for a more streamlined experience.
* You can now skip the workspace selection dialog when you supply an app ID via `--app` and an active token via `--token` flags.
