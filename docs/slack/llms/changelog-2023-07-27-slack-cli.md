# Release: Slack CLI v2.6.0

July 27, 2023

Version `2.6.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has arrived!

* The `.github` directory will no longer be included in new projects created from one of our [sample apps](https://github.com/slack-samples).
* The `slack app list` command now returns `Status: Installed` instead of `Status: Unknown` for an installed app.
* When using the CLI in a non-interactive environment, such as in a CI pipeline, selection prompts will error and suggest a flag alternative to use instead of hanging indefinitely.
* Trigger generation prompts will be automatically skipped when using `slack run` or `slack deploy` in a non-interactive environment, regardless of how many triggers might exist.
* We've clarified admin approval requirements when installing to a workspace that has [Admin-Approved Apps](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/controlling-permissions-for-admins) enabled.
* Socket connections are now gracefully closed when ending a `slack run` session.
* Improved typeahead suggestions for the `type` field of `functions` and `datastores` were made in the Deno Slack SDK.
