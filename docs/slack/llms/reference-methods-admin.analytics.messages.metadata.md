## Usage info {#usage-info}

This Web API method allows org owners and admins to retrieve message metadata from channels within their organization. It returns structural information about messages without the actual message content, including character counts, reactions, file attachments, and threading information.

### Pagination {#pagination}

Results are paginated. When more results exist, the response includes a `response_metadata.next_cursor` field. Pass this value as the `cursor` parameter in subsequent requests to fetch the next page.

```text

cursor = Noneall_messages = []while True:    response = client.admin_analytics_messages_metadata(        channel="C0123456789",        limit=1000,        cursor=cursor    )    all_messages.extend(response["messages"])        cursor = response.get("response_metadata", {}).get("next_cursor")    if not cursor:        break
