### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`workflow_ids`**`array`Required

An array of workflow IDs to look up permissions for

### Optional arguments

**`max_workflow_triggers`**`integer`Optional

Maximum number of triggers to fetch for each workflow when determining overall run permissions; max 1000

_Default:_ `100`

## Usage info {#usage-info}

This method looks up permissions for which users are authorized to run workflows in the org. Since workflows themselves do not have an execution policy, the rule exists on the trigger associated with the workflow. For workflows created in Workflow Builder, there is a 1:1 mapping with a trigger. For coded apps, we merge the permissions of all of a workflow’s triggers and return the most permissive set. If there are numerous triggers, we will only check a subset of them (determined by `max_workflow_triggers`) and return `"complete": false` in the response to denote this.
