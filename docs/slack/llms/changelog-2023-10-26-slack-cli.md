# Release: Slack CLI v2.11.0

October 26, 2023

Version `2.11.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform has spookily appeared!

* We've updated commands requiring validation (e.g. `manifest`, `deploy`, `install`, `triggers create`, and `triggers run`) to catch errors if a connector is not installed, attempt to install any certified apps related to connectors mentioned in the manifest, and then re-validate the manifest.
* We added new error codes for connectors to aid you in troubleshooting.
* We added a `--file` flag to the `function distribute` command (renamed to `function access`) so that you can manage access and distributions with a configuration file instead of multiple commands.
