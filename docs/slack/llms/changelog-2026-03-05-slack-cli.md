# Release: Slack CLI v3.14.0

March 5, 2026

Version `3.14.0` of the developer tools for the Slack platform has landed!

* The [`slack create`](/tools/slack-cli/reference/commands/slack_create) command now prompts you for a custom app name if the randomly generated default isn't your thing. This prompt appears before scaffolding a new project from a template, and when making new project directories with your custom app name, we now replace spaces with a dash (instead of removing spaces altogether) to make navigation a bit better.
* The `slack create` command now updates the app name in the `package.json` and `pyproject.toml` project files.
* We've updated the `slack create` and [`slack init`](/tools/slack-cli/reference/commands/slack_init) commands to support creating a Python virtual environment (.venv) when it doesn't exist, and installing the project's dependencies from the `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` project files.
* When running Slack CLI commands in a Bolt Python project, the Slack CLI will attempt to automatically activate the Python virtual environment (.venv). This allows commands that use the `slack-cli-hooks` Python package to run safely and successfully, even when the terminal system doesn't have the virtual environment activated.
* We've added a `--subdir` flag to the `slack create` command for extracting a subdirectory from a template repository as the project root. This supports monorepo-style templates where multiple apps live in subdirectories (e.g., `slack create my-app -t org/monorepo --subdir apps/my-app`).
* The [`slack docs`](/tools/slack-cli/reference/commands/slack_docs) command opens the slack developer docs site, and you can now use the `--search` flag to open the docs search page with the provided query.
* We fixed a bug and now avoid infinite loops when searching for the root project `.slack` directory for projects existing on drives other than the `C:` drive on Windows.
* We fixed a bug and now check whether an installed `git` command exists on Windows.
