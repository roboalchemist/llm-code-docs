# Slack Connect API reference

[Slack Connect](/apis/slack-connect/) allows users between different workspaces and organizations to work together on Slack.

Below is a list of Slack Connect-related scopes, methods and events. For information on how to use these components together to address common use cases, see our [Using Slack Connect API methods](/apis/slack-connect/using-slack-connect-api-methods) guide.

## Scopes {#scopes}

Scope

Description

[`conversations.connect:read`](/reference/scopes/conversations.connect.read)

Receive Slack Connect invite events sent to the channels your slack app is in.

[`conversations.connect:write`](/reference/scopes/conversations.connect.write)

Create Slack Connect invitations for channels that your slack app has been added to, and accept invitations sent to your slack app.

[`conversations.connect:manage`](/reference/scopes/conversations.connect.manage)

Allows your slack app to manage Slack Connect channels, and approve, decline, and list Slack Connect invitations. Since approval requires more authority than accepting invitations, apps with this feature can only be installed by a workspace owner or admin.
