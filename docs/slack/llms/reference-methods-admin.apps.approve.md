## Usage info {#usage-info}

Managing app approval

When used in an admin app to approve or restrict other app installs across an entire Enterprise organization, the UI-based process is disabled and the admin app solely manages apps.

This [App Management API](/admins/managing-app-approvals) method approves an app install request, approves an app for a particular workspace, approves an app across an entire enterprise. When approved for an enterprise, an app can still be independently [restricted](/reference/methods/admin.apps.restrict) on particular workspaces.

This method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise org admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Enterprise org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:write`](/reference/scopes/admin.apps.write) method for more detailed instructions. When the [`admin.apps:write`](/reference/scopes/admin.apps.write) scope is used in an admin app to approve or restrict other app installs across an entire Enterprise organization, the UI-based process is disabled and the admin app solely manages apps.

Exactly one of the `team_id` or `enterprise_id` arguments is required, not both.

Either `app_id` or `request_id` is required. These IDs can be obtained either directly via the [`app_requested` event](/reference/events/app_requested), or by the [`admin.apps.requests.list`](/reference/methods/admin.apps.requests.list) method.

If an app was previously approved/resolved at an org level, it will need to be re-approved at the org level upon any scope changes.

Reinstalling the app to the workspace is required to add new scopes, but no approval at the workspace level is required.
