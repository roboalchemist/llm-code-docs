Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

**`usergroup_id`**`string`Required

An encoded usergroup (IDP Group) ID.

_Example:_ `S12345678`

**`team_ids`**`array`Required

A comma separated list of encoded team (workspace) IDs. Each workspace _MUST_ belong to the organization associated with the token.

_Example:_ `T12345678,T98765432`

### Optional arguments

**`auto_provision`**`boolean`Optional

When `true`, this method automatically creates new workspace accounts for the IDP group members.

## Usage info {#usage-info}

Use this method to add workspaces to an organization-wide [IDP Group](https://slack.com/help/articles/115001435788-Connect-identity-provider-groups-to-your-Enterprise-organization). When you link workspaces to an IDP group, you automatically add members of the IDP group to those workspaces.

This method is only available to Enterprise organizations, and only applies to IDP groups (user groups) across the organization.

## Response {#response}

#### Typical success response

```json

{  "ok": true}

If an error occurs on one or more workspaces, an `errors` element will be populated with a list of `team_ID`s that were _not_ successfully linked to the IDP group:

```json

    {        "ok": false,        "error": "auto_provision_failure",        "errors": [            "T12345678",            "T98765432"        ]    }

Note that some workspaces may successfully be added while others fail:

```json

    {        "ok": false,        "error": "auto_provision_failure",        "errors": [            "T98765432"        ]    }

## Errors {#errors}

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should always check the value of the `ok` parameter in the response.
