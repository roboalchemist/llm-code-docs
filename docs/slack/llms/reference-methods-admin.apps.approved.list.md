## Usage info {#usage-info}

Managing app approval

When used in an admin app to approve or restrict other app installs across an entire Enterprise organization, the UI-based process is disabled and the admin app solely manages apps.

This [App Management API](/admins/managing-app-approvals) method lists apps approved for installation for a workspace.

This method requires an `admin.*` scope. It's obtained through the normal [OAuth process](/authentication), but there are a few additional requirements. The scope must be requested by an Enterprise org admin or owner, and the OAuth install must take place on the entire Enterprise org, not an individual workspace. See the [`admin.apps:read`](/reference/scopes/admin.apps.read) method for more detailed instructions.

`enterprise_id` and `team_id` cannot be used together.

* Passing `enterprise_id` will return the list of org-wide approved apps.
* Passing `team_id` will return the apps approved for that specific workspace.
