# Release: Slack CLI v2.32.0

December 12, 2024

Version `2.32.0` of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here!

* We improved detection of [Deno](/tools/deno-slack-sdk/guides/installing-deno) projects and added test coverage to the Deno runtime for a smoother experience.
* We improved the formatting of output when running `slack env` commands. We also added error messaging to these commands when the app being referenced is not an app created using the Deno Slack SDK.
* The `slack env remove` command now exits without erroring when there are no environment variables to remove.
* We enhanced text styling for easier reading.
* We improved some internal processes that allow us to keep our documentation fresh and up-to-date.
* We improved the error messaging of our `slack datastore` commands.
* We updated our documentation and errors displayed when using `slack external-auth` subcommands with Bolt apps.
* We now raise errors that may impact the validation of selected authentications.
* We now hide blank `source` errors that may have caused confusion; they have been replaced with more helpful messaging.
