## Arguments {#arguments}

### Required arguments

**`token`**`string`Required

Authentication token bearing required scopes. Tokens should be passed as an HTTP Authorization header or alternatively, as a POST parameter.

_Example:_ `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx`

### Optional arguments

**`team_ids`**`array`Optional

Comma separated string of team IDs, signifying the internal workspaces to search through.

_Example:_ `T00000000,T00000001`

**`connected_team_ids`**`array`Optional

Array of encoded team IDs, signifying the external orgs to search through.

_Example:_ `['T00000000','T00000001']`

**`query`**`string`Optional

Name of the the channel to query by.

_Example:_ `announcement`

**`limit`**`integer`Optional

Maximum number of items to be returned. Must be between 1 - 20 both inclusive. Default is 10.

_Default:_ `10`

_Example:_ `20`

**`cursor`**`string`Optional

Set `cursor` to `next_cursor` returned by the previous call to list items in the next page.

_Example:_ `dXNlcjpVMEc5V0ZYTlo=`

**`search_channel_types`**`array`Optional

The type of channel to include or exclude in the search. For example `private` will search private channels, while `private_exclude` will exclude them. For a full list of types, check the [Types section](#types).

_Example:_ `private,archived`

**`sort`**`string`Optional

Possible values are `relevant` (search ranking based on what we think is closest), `name` (alphabetical), `member_count` (number of users in the channel), and `created` (date channel was created). You can optionally pair this with the `sort_dir` arg to change how it is sorted

_Default:_ `member_count`

_Example:_ `name`

**`sort_dir`**`string`Optional

Sort direction. Possible values are `asc` for ascending order like (1, 2, 3) or (a, b, c), and `desc` for descending order like (3, 2, 1) or (c, b, a)

_Default:_ `desc`

_Example:_ `asc`

**`total_count_only`**`boolean`Optional

Only return the total\_count of channels. Omits channel data and allows access for admins without channel manager permissions.

## Usage info {#usage-info}

This [Admin API method](/admins) searches for channels across an organization given a search query.

This admin scope is obtained through version two of the OAuth V2 flow, but there are a few additional requirements. The app requesting this scope must be installed by an admin or Owner of an Enterprise organization. Also, the app must be installed on the entire org, not on an individual workspace. See below for more details.

If the app is installed by an Org Admin or Owner, ensure the Channel Management settings provide the appropriate permissions. The Org Admin or Owner installing the app must have the **Channel Management** role, and must also be granted access to **Public channels** and **Private channels** within this role. If these criteria aren't met, the Org Admin or Owner will receive a `not_allowed` error when attempting to install an app.

Admin API endpoints reach across **an entire Enterprise organization**, not individual workspaces.

For a token to be imbued with Admin scopes, it must be obtained from installing an app on the **entire Enterprise org**, not just a workspace within the organization.

To configure and install an app supporting Admin API endpoints on your Enterprise organization:

1. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps). Your app will need to be able to handle a standard [OAuth 2 flow](/authentication/installing-with-oauth).
2. In the app's settings, select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left navigation. Scroll down to the section titled **Scopes** and add the `admin.*` scope you want. Click the **Save Changes** button.
3. In the app's settings, select **Manage Distribution** from the left navigation. Under the section titled **Share Your App with Other Workspaces**, make sure all four sections have the green check. Then click the green **Activate Public Distribution** button.
4. Under the **Share Your App with Your Workspace** section, copy the **Sharable URL** and paste it into a browser to initiate the OAuth handshake that will install the app on your organization. You must be logged in as an **admin or Owner** of your Enterprise organization to install the app.
5. Check the dropdown in the upper right of the installation screen to make sure you are installing the app on the organization, not an individual workspace within the organization. See the image below for a visual.
6. Once your app completes the OAuth flow, you will be granted an OAuth token that can be used for calling Admin API methods for your organization.

_When installing an app to use an Admin API endpoint, be sure to install it on your Enterprise organization, not a workspace within the organization._

### More on channel types {#types}

The `search_channel_types` allows an array of types to be passed, each of which filters the channels that the search returns. If you pass multiple types, the search occurs in channels that satisfy **any** of the types. You can pass the following values in your list of `search_channel_types`:

* `private`
* `private_exclude`
* `archived`
* `exclude_archived`
* `private_exclude_archived`
* `multi_workspace`
* `org_wide`
* `external_shared_exclude`
* `external_shared`
* `external_shared_private`
* `external_shared_archived`
* `exclude_org_shared`

`private` will search private channels, and `private_exclude` will exclude them from the search. The other names follow the same patterns for channels connected to other organizations and archived channels.

Searching private channels with this method will only work if the user associated with the user token being used has permission to manage private channels on the org. By default, only the [primary owner of the org has that level of permission](https://slack.com/help/articles/360052445454-Manage-permissions-for-channel-management-tools#h_01J6FQ9ATH7WVCZCZCHKG9P64Z). Missing this permission is a cause of the `not_allowed` error.

The `member_count` field will return `-1` when the channel is archived. Counts of `0` and above indicate current membership.
