# Audit Logs API methods & actions

This feature is only available to Slack workspaces on an Enterprise plan

The Audit Logs API is RESTful and, being read-only, uses a single HTTP verb — `GET` — to query and retrieve information. These methods will also return standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure.

The base URL for accessing the Audit Logs API methods is:

```text
https://api.slack.com/audit/v1/
```text

All [endpoints](#endpoints) branch from this base URL.

Header

Value

Description

`Host`

`api.slack.com`

`Accept`

`application/json`

`Authorization`

`Bearer xoxp-...`

The token must be a Slack user token (beginning with `xoxp`) associated with an Enterprise organization owner (Enterprise organization administrator tokens are not currently supported) and the token must be granted the `auditlogs:read` OAuth scope. If you are having trouble generating this token, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@slack.com).

Below is an example of a call:

```text
   GET /audit/v1/logs HTTP/1.1   Host: api.slack.com   Accept: application/json   Authorization: Bearer xoxp-EXAMPLE-SLACK-TOKEN
```text

## Rate limits {#rate-limits}

The Audit Logs API methods conform to Slack's [rate limits](/apis/web-api/rate-limits), and all methods are rated Tier 3. This allows for up to 50 calls per minute, with an allowance for sporadic bursts. Unlike the Web API rate limits however, which are calculated on a per-app basis, the Audit Logs API rate limits are calculated according to an organization-wide limit.

## Endpoints {#endpoints}

Use the following RESTful endpoints to access the methods of the Audit Logs API.

Endpoint

Description

## GET /schemas

Returns information about the kind of objects which the Audit Logs API returns as a list of all objects and a short description. Authentication not required.

## GET /actions

Returns information about the kind of actions that the Audit Logs API returns as a list of all actions and a short description of each. Authentication not required.

## GET /logs

Retrieves audit events from your organization. It will return a list of actions that have occurred on the installed workspace or Enterprise organization. Authentication required.

### Filters {#filters}

The following filters can be applied to narrow the range of actions returned. Filters are added as query string parameters and can be combined together. Multiple filter parameters are additive (a boolean AND) and are separated with an ampersand (`&`) in the query string. Filtering is entirely optional.

Filter key

Type

Description

`latest`

Integer

Unix timestamp of the most recent audit event to include (inclusive).

`oldest`

Integer

Unix timestamp of the least recent audit event to include (inclusive). Data is not available prior to March 2018.

`limit`

Integer

Number of results to _optimistically_ return, maximum `9999`.

`action`

String

Name of the action or actions (separated by commas) to filter on, maximum `30`.

`actor`

String

User ID who initiated the action. Will be `USLACKSECURITY` if customer credentials were reset by Slack Security.

`entity`

String

ID of the target entity of the action (such as a channel, workspace, organization, file).

For example, a call to the Audit Logs API that returns all of the audit events for a specific user (`W123AB456`) who logged in (`user_login`) since March 16, 2018 would look like:

```text
https://api.slack.com/audit/v1/logs?oldest=1521214343&action=user_login&actor=W123AB456
```text

To return logs for multiple actions, separate the actions in the query string by commas:

```text
https://api.slack.com/audit/v1/logs?oldest=1521214343&action=file_uploaded,public_channel_created,emoji_added
```text

Slack will return a maximum of 9,999 audit events per API request, with the default ordering being descending (most to least recent). Use [cursor-based pagination](/apis/web-api/pagination#cursors) to programmatically access more audit events.

You may receive more than the passed `limit` results from a given request if there are multiple logs that were recorded at the exact same time.

## Actions {#actions}

The following tables outline the currently supported list of actions, organized by entity. This list will grow over time — if you don't see an action you are interested in keeping an eye on, [please let us know](mailto:devsupport@slack.com).

### AI in Slack {#slack-ai}

Additional logging for Slackbot

When Slackbot takes an action on behalf of a user (for example, executing `file_opened` or `canvas_edited`), Slack provides additional context in the audit log. Here is an example of additional information provided with a `canvas_edited` action:

```text
action: canvas_edited...acting_agent: Slackbotagent_message:  channel_id: D0123ABC456  message_ts: "1772835937.732289"  thread_ts: "1772828335.812309"
