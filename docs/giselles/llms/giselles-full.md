# Privacy & Security FAQ
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/faq/security-support/privacy-security

Frequently asked questions about Giselle privacy and security measures

## Is my data used for AI model training?

**No.** When you use Giselle, your data is sent to AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) via their APIs. All of these providers explicitly state that API data is **not used for model training** by default.

### Anthropic

Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service clearly states:

> "Anthropic may not train models on Customer Content from Services."

This means your inputs and outputs when using Claude models through Giselle are not used to train Anthropic's models.

Additionally, Anthropic's Privacy Center states:

> "Anthropic does not use Customer Content to train our models."

**Sources:**

* [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (Section B. Customer Content)
* [Is my data used for model training?](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996868-is-my-data-used-for-model-training)

### OpenAI

OpenAI's official documentation states:

> "By default, we do not train on any inputs or outputs from our products for business users, including ChatGPT Business, ChatGPT Enterprise, and the API. We offer API customers a way to opt-in to share data with us, such as by providing feedback in the Playground, which we then use to improve our models. Unless they explicitly opt-in, organizations are opted out of data-sharing by default."

**Sources:**

* [How your data is used to improve model performance](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance)
* [Data controls in the OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data)

### Google

Giselle uses Gemini models through Google Cloud's Vertex AI. The Vertex AI documentation states:

> "Google does not use your data, including your prompts, inputs, and outputs, to train foundation models without your permission."
>
> "By default, Google Cloud does not use your data for training."

This applies to all managed models on Vertex AI, including Gemini models used through Giselle.

**Note:** For those using the Gemini API directly via Google AI Studio (not through Giselle), the terms differ. With paid services:

> "Google doesn't use your prompts (including associated system instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) or responses to improve our products"

# Action Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/action-node

Learn how Action Nodes in Giselle enable your workflows to interact with external services like GitHub, performing tasks such as creating issues, comments, or retrieving discussions in your repositories.

## Action Node in Giselle

**Action Node** empowers your Giselle workflows to connect with and control external services. It acts as a bridge, allowing you to automate tasks beyond the Giselle environment. Currently, the primary integration is with **GitHub**, enabling a variety of repository operations. We are continuously working to expand support for more external services.

### GitHub Action

The GitHub Action capability within the Action Node allows your workflows to perform specific operations in your GitHub repositories. This is useful for automating tasks like issue creation, commenting, retrieving data, and more, based on the logic and data processed within your Giselle flow.

#### Setting up a GitHub Action:

1. **Select GitHub Account/Organization**:
   * Upon adding an Action Node and choosing GitHub as the service, you'll first need to select the GitHub account or organization where your target repository resides (e.g., `giselles-ai`, `liam-hq`).

2. **Choose a Repository**:
   * Next, a list of repositories accessible under the selected account/organization will appear (e.g., `docs`, `giselle`).
   * Click the **Set up** button next to the repository you want the action to target (e.g., `giselle`).

3. **Choose the GitHub Action to Perform**:
   * Once a repository is selected (e.g., `giselles-ai/giselle`), you'll need to specify what action the Giselle's app should execute.
   * Click on the dropdown menu, which might be labeled "Choose what action you want to perform."
   * Select the desired action from the list. Examples include:
     * **Create Issue**
     * **Create Issue Comment**
     * **Create Pull Request Comment**
     * **Reply Pull Request Review Comment**
     * **Get Discussion**
   * After selecting an action, click the **Setup Action** button to proceed to parameter configuration.

4. **Configure Action Parameters**:
   * Each GitHub action requires specific parameters to execute correctly. For instance, the "Create Issue Comment" action requires an `issueNumber` and a `body` for the comment, as indicated by "Required" fields.
   * The configuration panel will display the selected repository and the chosen action (e.g., "Create Issue Comment"). Below this, the necessary parameters will be listed.
   * For each parameter, you'll need to provide a value. This can often be done by:
     * Entering a static value directly.
     * **Selecting a Source**: This allows you to map data dynamically from the output of previous nodes in your flow or from the Giselle's app flow's initial trigger input. The "Select Source" option next to each parameter field facilitates this.
   * Ensure all parameters marked as "Required" are filled in.
   * Once all parameters are configured, the changes are typically saved by an "Action" button or similar confirmation in the UI. The node on the canvas will update to reflect the configured action (e.g., showing "Create Issue Comment" with inputs for `issueNumber` and `body`).

#### Output of the Action Node:

After successfully performing its task, an Action Node will typically produce an **output**. This output can contain information relevant to the action performed, such as the ID or URL of a created issue or comment, or the data retrieved from a service (like discussion content). This output can then be used as input by subsequent nodes in your workflow, enabling complex chains of operations. The node preview often indicates the availability of an "output".

#### Example: Creating an Issue Comment

Imagine you've configured an Action Node to "Create Issue Comment" for the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository:

* **Repository**: `giselles-ai/giselle`
* **Action**: Create Issue Comment
* **Required Parameters (Inputs)**:
  * `issueNumber`: Sourced from a workflow trigger or a previous node (e.g., an issue number identified earlier in the flow).
  * `body`: Sourced from another node (e.g., a text summary generated by an AI model in a preceding step).
* **Execution**: When this node runs, it will post a new comment using the provided `body` to the issue specified by `issueNumber` within the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository.
* **Potential Output**: The node might output details like the URL or ID of the newly created comment, which can be used in further steps.

#### Example: Replying to a Pull Request Review Comment

Here's how you might configure an Action Node to "Reply Pull Request Review Comment" in the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository, as shown in the provided image:

* **Repository**: `giselles-ai/giselle`
* **Action**: Reply Pull Request Review Comment
* **Required Parameters (Inputs)**:
  * `pullNumber`: The number of the pull request containing the review comment. This would typically be sourced from a trigger event (e.g., a GitHub Trigger for "Pull Request Review Comment Created") or a previous node that identified the pull request.
  * `commentId`: The ID of the specific review comment to which you are replying. This also would likely come from the trigger data or a preceding node that fetched comment details.
  * `body`: The content of your reply. This could be static text, or more powerfully, dynamically generated text from an AI node in your workflow (e.g., an automated acknowledgment, a question, or a summary).
* **Execution**: When this Action Node executes, it will post the content from the `body` parameter as a reply to the specified `commentId` on the given `pullNumber` within the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository.
* **Potential Output**: The node may output information about the reply that was posted, such as its own ID or URL, which could be useful for further conditional workflow logic.

#### Example: Getting a GitHub Discussion

This action allows your workflow to retrieve the content and details of a specific GitHub Discussion from your repository.

* **Repository**: `giselles-ai/giselle` (or any other configured repository)
* **Action**: Get Discussion
* **Required Parameters (Inputs)**:
  * `discussionNumber`: The number of the GitHub Discussion to retrieve. This can be a static value or sourced dynamically from a previous node's output or a trigger input.
* **Execution**: When this node runs, it connects to GitHub and fetches the details of the discussion specified by `discussionNumber` from the selected repository.
* **Potential Output**: The node will output an object containing the discussion data. This typically includes details such as the discussion's `id`, `title`, `bodyHTML` (the content of the discussion in HTML format), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `author` information, and an array of `comments` associated with the discussion (each comment also having details like `bodyHTML`, `author`, etc.). This structured data can then be used by subsequent nodes in your workflow, for example, to summarize the discussion, extract key points, perform analysis on the comments, or trigger other actions based on its content.

The Action Node, particularly with its GitHub integration, is a versatile tool for extending Giselle's automation capabilities into your software development and project management lifecycles. Stay tuned for more actions and integrations with other external services!


# AI Parameters
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/ai-parameters

Dictionary of Generation Parameters Used Across AI Models in Giselle.

This document provides a detailed overview of common generation parameters ("Generation Parameters") that can be configured within Giselle's Generator Nodes to fine-tune outputs from various multimodal AI models such as Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, Sonar, and Fal AI.

Please note that definitions and availability of generation parameters may vary depending on the AI provider and specific models. Additionally, Giselle does not currently implement all parameters supported by each provider's API. This document primarily covers general definitions and typical usages of the parameters that are available. If you have suggestions for parameters you would like Giselle to support, please feel free to contact us.

## Common AI Parameters

### Temperature

* **Definition:** Controls randomness in text or image generation.
* **Range:** 0 (less random, deterministic) to 1 (highly random, creative).
* **Recommended use:**
  * Lower values (0–0.3) for precise, factual outputs.
  * Higher values (0.7–1.0) for creative or exploratory outputs.

### Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)

* **Definition:** Limits token selection to the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold (p).
* **Range:** Typically 0.0 to 1.0.
* **Recommended use:**
  * Lower values (0.7–0.9) for focused, consistent outputs.
  * Higher values (\~1.0) for broader, diverse content generation.

### Max Tokens

* **Definition:** Maximum number of tokens generated in a response.
* **Recommended use:**
  * Adjust based on desired response length and API/model token limits.
  * Essential for cost management and resource optimization.

## Reasoning Parameters

### Reasoning Effort

* **Definition:** Controls how many reasoning tokens the model generates before producing a response. Higher levels result in more thorough reasoning at the cost of increased latency.
* **Range:** Model-dependent. GPT-5.2 supports `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`. Traditional models support `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.
* **Default:** `none` for GPT-5.2/5.1 models, `medium` for traditional models.
* **Recommended use:**
  * `none`: Low-latency interactions where quick responses are prioritized.
  * `low` to `medium`: Balanced reasoning for general tasks.
  * `high` to `xhigh`: Complex problem-solving, deep analysis, and tasks requiring thorough reasoning.

### Text Verbosity

* **Definition:** Determines how many output tokens are generated. Controls the length and detail of the model's response.
* **Range:** `low`, `medium`, `high`.
* **Default:** `medium`.
* **Recommended use:**
  * `low`: Concise answers, simple code generation (e.g., SQL queries), situations where brevity is preferred.
  * `medium`: Balanced output length for most tasks.
  * `high`: Thorough explanations, extensive code refactoring, detailed documentation.

> **Note:** Text verbosity sets a general token range at the system prompt level, but actual output can still be influenced by prompting within that range.

## Text-Specific Parameters

### Frequency Penalty

* **Definition:** Reduces repetition by penalizing repeated tokens.
* **Range:** Typically 0.0 (no penalty) to 1.0 (strong penalty).
* **Recommended use:**
  * Increase when repetitive outputs are undesirable.

### Presence Penalty

* **Definition:** Encourages new content by penalizing tokens previously used.
* **Range:** Typically 0.0 (no penalty) to 1.0 (strong penalty).
* **Recommended use:**
  * Helpful for generating more diverse text outputs.

### Stop Sequences

* **Definition:** Tokens or phrases indicating where the model should stop generating.
* **Recommended use:**
  * Define clearly when structured or partial outputs are required.

## Image Generation Parameters

### Guidance Scale

* **Definition:** Influences how closely the generated image follows the provided prompt.
* **Range:** Typically 1 (less strict adherence) to 20 (highly strict adherence).
* **Recommended use:**
  * Lower values for exploratory, abstract outputs.
  * Higher values for precise, detailed adherence to prompts.

### Inference Steps

* **Definition:** Number of steps in the diffusion process.
* **Recommended use:**
  * Lower values (1–4 steps with flux/schnell) for rapid prototyping.
  * Higher values (\~28 steps with stable-diffusion) for detailed, high-quality images.

## Multimodal Parameters

# Document Vector Store Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/document-vector-store-node

Learn how the Document Vector Store Node enables you to upload and search documents using vector embeddings for AI-powered retrieval in your Giselle workflows.

## Document Vector Store Node in Giselle

The **Document Vector Store Node** is a specialized "Variable" node that creates a powerful, searchable knowledge base from uploaded documents. It works by processing your documents (PDFs, text files, and markdown) into vector embeddings, allowing AI models to perform semantic searches and retrieve relevant context for answering questions and generating responses.

This process uses advanced embedding models to convert your document content into vector embeddings. You can select from multiple embedding models, including OpenAI's [`text-embedding-3-small`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) (1536 dimensions) and [`text-embedding-3-large`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-large) (3072 dimensions). These vectorized data are then stored securely in Giselle's dedicated Vector Store.

### Setting up a Document Vector Store:

Before using the Document Vector Store Node in your workflow, you need to create and configure a vector store through your team settings:

1. **Navigate to Vector Store Settings**:
   * Go to **Settings > Team > Vector Stores** in your Giselle account.
   * You can access this page here: [https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/vector-stores/document](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/vector-stores/document).

2. **Create a New Document Vector Store**:
   * Click the button to create a new document vector store.
   * Enter a descriptive name for your vector store (e.g., "Company Documentation" or "Product Manuals").

3. **Upload Documents**:
   * After creating the vector store, you can upload documents by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping files.
   * **Supported File Types**: PDF (`.pdf`), Text (`.txt`), Markdown (`.md`)
   * **Maximum File Size**: 4.5 MB per file
   * You can upload multiple documents to build a comprehensive knowledge base.

4. **Document Processing**:
   * Once uploaded, documents are automatically processed through several stages:
   * **Text Extraction**: Text is extracted from PDFs and decoded from text files.
   * **Chunking**: Content is divided into manageable chunks (max 150 lines or 6000 characters per chunk, with 30-line overlap).
   * **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using the selected embedding model.
   * **Storage**: Embeddings are stored with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes for fast similarity search.

5. **Monitor Processing Status**:
   * Each document shows its status: **Pending**, **Processing**, **Ready**, or **Failed**.
   * Wait for documents to reach the "Ready" status before using the vector store in your workflows.

### Adding a Document Vector Store Node to Your Workflow:

1. **Add the Node**:
   * From the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas, click the **Variable** icon.
   * Select **Document Vector Store** from the pop-up menu to add the node to your workspace.

2. **Configure the Vector Store**:
   * When first added, the node will display a "REQUIRES SETUP" status.
   * Select the node to open its configuration panel on the right.
   * Click the **Select a vector store** dropdown menu and choose the document vector store you created earlier.

3. **Select the Embedding Profile**:
   * After selecting a vector store, choose which embedding model to use for queries.
   * This must match one of the embedding profiles used when the documents were processed.
   * Available options typically include:
   * **text-embedding-3-small**: 1536 dimensions - Efficient and suitable for most use cases.
   * **text-embedding-3-large**: 3072 dimensions - Higher precision for complex semantic understanding.

4. **Finalize Setup**:
   * Once configured, the node on the canvas will update to show the name of the selected vector store.
   * The node is now ready to be connected to other nodes in your workflow.

### Supported File Types

The Document Vector Store supports multiple file types, each with specific size limits:

| File Type    | Supported Formats | Maximum Size | Common Use Cases                             |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **PDF**      | `.pdf`            | 4.5MB        | Documentation, reports, manuals, articles    |
| **Text**     | `.txt`            | 4.5MB        | Plain text documents, logs, transcripts      |
| **Markdown** | `.md`             | 4.5MB        | Technical documentation, README files, notes |

### Usage in Workflows

The Document Vector Store Node is designed to be used in combination with a **Vector Query Node**. It acts as the knowledge base that the Vector Query Node searches through.

* **Connect the Output**: The "Output" of the Document Vector Store Node should be connected to the input of a Vector Query Node.
* **Perform a Search**: The Vector Query Node takes a user's question or dynamic input, searches the vectorized document content for the most relevant information, and passes that information to subsequent nodes (like a Generator Node) for processing, analysis, or summarization.

#### Example Workflow:

```
[Text Node: "What are the safety guidelines?"]
         ↓
[Vector Query Node] ←── [Document Vector Store Node]
         ↓
[Generator Node: Summarizes safety guidelines based on search results]
```

### Query Parameters

When using a Vector Query Node with the Document Vector Store, you can configure:

* **Max Results**: The maximum number of document chunks to return (default: 20, maximum: 100).
* **Similarity Threshold**: The minimum cosine similarity score for results (default: 0.3, range: 0-1). Higher values return only more relevant results.

### Output of the Node

The Document Vector Store Node's **output** is a reference to the vectorized data of your uploaded documents. This output provides the necessary connection for other nodes, like the Vector Query Node, to access and search the document content.

### Managing Your Document Vector Stores

You can manage all your document vector stores from the team settings page:

* **Add Documents**: Upload additional documents to existing vector stores.
* **Monitor Status**: View the processing status of each document.
* **Remove Documents**: Delete documents that are no longer needed.
* **Delete Vector Stores**: Remove entire vector stores when they're no longer in use.

### Technical Considerations

* **File Size Limit**: The maximum file size per document is **4.5 MB** due to platform constraints.
* **Processing Time**: Larger documents or multiple simultaneous uploads may take longer to process.
* **Embedding Consistency**: Ensure you use the same embedding profile when querying that was used during document ingestion for optimal search results.
* **Concurrent Processing**: The system prevents duplicate processing through atomic claim mechanisms, ensuring each document is processed only once.

### Error Handling

If a document fails to process, possible reasons include:

* **Unsupported File Type**: Ensure your file is PDF, TXT, or MD format.
* **File Too Large**: Files exceeding 4.5 MB will fail to upload.
* **Extraction Failed**: PDFs with non-standard encoding or corruption may fail during text extraction.
* **Processing Errors**: Network issues or system errors during embedding generation.

When errors occur, you can re-upload the document or contact support if the issue persists.


# File Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/file-node

Learn how the File Node in Giselle allows you to upload and use files like PDFs, images, and text as inputs for your AI workflows.

## File Node in Giselle

The **File Node** is a specialized type of "Variable Node" that allows you to handle file uploads and processing directly within your Giselle workflows. It acts as an input source, enabling you to incorporate documents, images, and text files for AI models to analyze, summarize, or transform.

### How to Use a File Node

1. **Add the Node**: Drag and drop a "File" node from the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas onto your workspace.
2. **Upload a File**: Select the node to open its configuration panel. You can upload a file by dragging and dropping it onto the designated area or by clicking to open a file selector.
3. **Monitor Status**: The node will display the status of the upload. Files can be in one of three states: "uploading," "uploaded," or "failed." Once successfully uploaded, the file is securely stored in your workspace and ready to be used in your workflow.

### Supported File Types

The File Node supports several types of files, each with specific use cases and limitations.

| File Type | Accepted Formats                                    | Max Size | Common Use Cases                               |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **PDF**   | `application/pdf`                                   | 4.5MB    | Document processing, text extraction, analysis |
| **Image** | `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/svg` | 4.5MB    | Visual content analysis and generation         |
| **Text**  | `text/plain`, `text/markdown`                       | 4.5MB    | Text content processing and generation         |

### Workflow Integration

The primary purpose of a File Node is to provide data to other nodes, most commonly a [Generator Node](/glossary/generator-node).

* **Connect the Output**: The "Output" of a File Node can be connected to the input of a Generator Node.
* **Process the Content**: In the Generator Node, you can then prompt an AI model to perform a task on the file's content. For example, you can connect a PDF file and instruct the AI to "Summarize the key findings from the attached document."

#### Model Compatibility

The type of file you can connect depends on the capabilities of the target AI model. For example:

* **PDF and Text files** can be connected to text-based or multimodal models for tasks like analysis, summarization, or Q\&A.
* **Image files** can be connected to multimodal models that accept image inputs for analysis, or to image generation models for transformation tasks.

### Technical Limitations

Please be aware of the following limitations when using File Nodes:

* **Maximum File Size**: Due to platform constraints (Vercel Serverless Function limits), the maximum size for any single file upload is **4.5MB**.
* **Image Size Limit**: Image files have a maximum size of **4.5MB**.
* **Connection Restrictions**: You cannot connect a file to a node that does not support its type. For instance, a PDF file cannot be connected to a node that only generates images, and an image file may not be compatible with older text-only generation models.


# Generator Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/generator-node

Learn how the Generator Node in Giselle uses AI models to generate text, images, and more, forming the core of your AI flows.

## Generator Node in Giselle

The **Generator Node** is the central component for AI-driven content creation in Giselle. It allows you to harness the power of various advanced AI models to generate text and images based on your instructions. By configuring prompts, selecting models, and providing tools, you can create highly customized outputs for any flow.

The Generator Node is configured through three main tabs in its settings panel: **Prompt**, **Model**, and **Tools**.

### Prompt Tab

This is where you provide the instructions for the AI model. Write a clear and detailed prompt describing the task you want the AI to perform. The output generated by the model will appear at the bottom of this panel, allowing you to quickly see the results.

**Referencing other node output**: If you want to insert the output of another node as a variable within your prompt, you can click the `@` key to display a suggestion list. From this list, you can select the output of another node that is connected to the current node's input and insert it into your prompt.

You can also test the node individually by clicking the **Generate** button, which runs only this node without executing the entire flow.

### Model Tab

In the Model tab, you can select the specific AI model you want to use for the generation task. Giselle provides access to a wide range of models from leading providers.

* **Select a Model**: Choose from a list of available models, such as OpenAI's `gpt-4o`, Anthropic's `claude-4-opus`, or Google's `gemini-2.5-pro`.
* **Configure Parameters**: Depending on the selected model, you can adjust various [AI Parameters](ai-parameters) like `Temperature` or `Max Tokens` to fine-tune the output.

For more details on the available models from each provider, see our documentation:

* [Anthropic](https://docs.giselles.ai/models/providers/anthropic)
* [fal.ai](https://docs.giselles.ai/models/providers/fal)
* [Google](https://docs.giselles.ai/models/providers/google)
* [OpenAI](https://docs.giselles.ai/models/providers/openai)

### Tools Tab

The Tools tab allows you to grant the AI model access to external services, enabling it to perform actions or retrieve data from outside Giselle. This is useful for creating more dynamic and powerful flows.

Currently, the following tools are supported:

* [GitHub](/glossary/github-tools)
* [PostgreSQL](/glossary/postgresql-tools)

We are continuously working to add support for more tools in the future.

## Output of the Generator Node

The primary output of a Generator Node is the content it creates (e.g., a block of text or an image). This output can be connected to the input of other nodes, allowing you to chain AI tasks together. For example, the text generated by one node can be used as the input for another node that summarizes or translates it.


# GitHub Tools
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/github-tools

Learn how to configure and use GitHub Tools within a Generator Node, empowering your AI models to interact directly with your GitHub repositories.

**GitHub Tools** enable AI models inside a Generator Node to perform a wide range of actions on GitHub by giving them access to a curated set of functions. This feature, often referred to as "tool use" or "function calling," allows you to build powerful AI agents that can automate development workflows, such as creating issues, managing pull requests, searching for code, and more, all based on natural language instructions in your prompt.

## Configuring GitHub Tools

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub account and enable specific tools for a Generator Node.

### 1. Navigate to the Tools Tab

In any Generator Node (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`), select the **Tools** tab. You will see a list of available integrations that can be connected.

### 2. Connect to GitHub

Click the **+ Connect** button next to the GitHub integration. This will open a configuration modal to add your credentials.

### 3. Add Your Personal Access Token (PAT)

<Info>
  You can create a new PAT from your GitHub account settings: [https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens). Ensure your token has the necessary permissions (scopes) for the actions you want to perform.
</Info>

In the "Connect to GitHub" window:

1. **Token Name**: Give your token a descriptive name for easy identification later (e.g., "Create Issue" or "Update Docs").
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Paste your token into this field. Giselle encrypts the token with authenticated encryption before saving it.
3. Click **Save & Connect**.

### 4. Select the Tools to Enable

After your token is validated, you'll be presented with a list of available GitHub tools, grouped by category. For security and control, you must explicitly select which actions the AI model is allowed to perform.

Check the boxes next to the tools you want to enable for this node (e.g., `createIssue`, `getPullRequest`, `createOrUpdateFile`).

### 5. Save the Configuration

Once you've selected the desired tools, click **Save & Connect** at the bottom of the modal. The Generator Node will now show that GitHub is connected, displaying the enabled tools and a **Configuration** button to make future changes.

# GitHub Vector Store Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/github-vector-store-node

Learn how the GitHub Vector Store Node vectorizes your GitHub repositories, creating a searchable knowledge base for your AI workflows in Giselle.

Learn how the GitHub Vector Store Node in Giselle vectorizes your GitHub repositories, creating a searchable knowledge base that can be queried within your AI workflows.

## GitHub Vector Store Node in Giselle

The **GitHub Vector Store Node** is a specialized "Source" node that creates a powerful, searchable database from the contents of a GitHub repository. It works by vectorizing the code and documents within the repository, allowing AI models to perform semantic searches and retrieve relevant context.

This process uses advanced embedding models to convert your repository's content into vector embeddings. You can select from multiple embedding models, including OpenAI's [`text-embedding-3-small`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) and [`text-embedding-3-large`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-large), as well as Google's [`gemini-embedding-001`](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/gemini-embedding-001?hl=en). These vectorized data are then stored securely in Giselle's dedicated Vector Store.

To use this feature, the [Giselle GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/giselles-ai) must be installed on the target GitHub repository.

### Setting up a GitHub Vector Store Node:

1. **Add the Node**:
   * From the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas, click the **Source** icon (a folder with a link symbol).
   * Select **GitHub Vector Store** from the pop-up menu to add the node to your workspace.

2. **Configure the Repository**:
   * When first added, the node will display a "REQUIRES SETUP" status.
   * Select the node to open its configuration panel on the right.
   * Click the **Select a repository** dropdown menu. This list will only show repositories that have the Giselle GitHub App installed. Choose the repository you want to use as a knowledge source (e.g., `giselles-ai/docs`).

3. **Choose the Content Type**:
   * After selecting a repository, you will need to specify which type of content to vectorize. The available options are:
   * **Code**: Vectorizes the source code and documents from the repository's default branch. This is useful for creating a knowledge base from your codebase.
   * **Issues**: Vectorizes the content from issues, including descriptions, comments, and discussions. This is ideal for analyzing problem patterns or summarizing bug tracking.
   * **Pull Requests**: Vectorizes the content from pull requests, including descriptions, comments, and discussions. This is ideal for analyzing development patterns or summarizing changes.
   * Select the radio button corresponding to the content you wish to use.

4. **Finalize Setup**:
   * Once the repository and content type are selected, the node on the canvas will update to show the name of the configured repository. The vectorization process for this repository will be initiated or updated in the background.

### Managing Your Vector Stores

You can add, configure, and remove the GitHub repositories that are processed by the GitHub Vector Store Node from your team's settings page.

* Navigate to **Settings > Team > Vector Stores** in your Giselle account.
* Alternatively, you can click the **Set Up GitHub Vector Store** link directly from the node's configuration panel.
* This page allows you to manage which repositories are indexed and available for your workflows. You can access it here: [https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/vector-stores](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/vector-stores).

#### Sources to Ingest

When registering a new repository, you can select which types of content to ingest. Giselle currently supports three sources:

* **Code**: Ingests the source code files from the repository. This source is required and cannot be disabled.
* **Issues**: Ingests the descriptions, comments, and discussions from issues. This is an optional source that can be enabled to provide additional context to your AI workflows.
* **Pull Requests**: Ingests the content and discussions from merged pull requests. This is an optional source that can be enabled to provide additional context to your AI workflows.

#### Embedding Models

When setting up a GitHub Vector Store, you can select from multiple embedding models for indexing your repository content. You must select at least one embedding model. Available options include:

* **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small**: Provider: OpenAI • Dimensions: 1536 - A powerful and efficient model suitable for most use cases.
* **OpenAI text-embedding-3-large**: Provider: OpenAI • Dimensions: 3072 - A larger model with higher precision for complex semantic understanding.
* **Google gemini-embedding-001**: Provider: Google • Dimensions: 3072 - Google's embedding model offering alternative semantic representation capabilities.

The choice of embedding model affects how your content is vectorized and can impact search quality and performance. You can select multiple models to leverage different semantic representation capabilities for your vector store.

### Rate Limits and Considerations

When using the GitHub Vector Store Node, please be aware of GitHub API rate limits. Giselle's GitHub Vector Store uses [GitHub App Installation](https://docs.github.com/ja/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#primary-rate-limit-for-github-app-installations) for GitHub API access, which has a rate limit of approximately 5,000 requests per hour. You may encounter errors when working with large-scale projects. If this occurs, please wait some time before trying again.

For large repositories or frequent updates, you may experience rate limiting during the vectorization process. If you encounter errors, simply wait and retry after the rate limit window resets.

### Usage in Workflows

The GitHub Vector Store Node is designed to be used in combination with a **Vector Query Node**. It acts as the knowledge base that the Vector Query Node searches through.

* **Connect the Output**: The "Output" of the GitHub Vector Store Node should be connected to the input of a Vector Query Node.
* **Perform a Search**: The Vector Query Node can then take a user's question or a dynamic input, search the vectorized repository content for the most relevant information, and pass that information to subsequent nodes (like a Generator Node) for processing, analysis, or summarization.

### Output of the Node

The GitHub Vector Store Node's **output** is a reference to the vectorized data of the selected repository. This output provides the necessary connection for other nodes, like the Vector Query Node, to access and search the repository's content.


# Nodes in Giselle
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/node

Learn about nodes, the building blocks of AI apps on Giselle. Connect nodes with various functions to visually design powerful AI workflows.

## Giselle's AI Agents Can Be Built by Combining "Nodes"

Giselle is a platform that allows you to build powerful AI agents through an intuitive node-based interface. By connecting "nodes" with various functions, like assembling building blocks, you can visually design complex AI workflows. This makes it easy for anyone, even without specialized knowledge, to achieve automation with AI agents.

## Node Categories

Giselle organizes nodes into four main categories, accessible from the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas:

| Category        | Hotkey | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **App**         | A      | Define the entry and exit points of your workflow |
| **Model**       | M      | Select AI models for content generation           |
| **Context**     | C      | Add source data and retrieval capabilities        |
| **Integration** | I      | Connect with external services                    |

## App

The **App** category contains nodes that define the boundaries of your workflow.

### Start Node & End Node

Start Node and End Node are the essential boundary nodes that define the entry and exit points of any workflow. They work as a pair to establish the complete flow of your app, from receiving user input to delivering the final output.

For more details, see the [Start Node & End Node documentation](start-end-nodes).

## Model

The **Model** category provides access to AI models for generating content.

### Generator Node

The Generator Node can create both text and images using advanced AI models. By configuring prompts and conditions, you can generate content tailored to your needs. For text, this includes applications such as document creation, blog writing, and research report generation, leveraging Giselle's LLM API for high-quality, natural-sounding text. For images, you can generate visuals from text prompts, enabling creative content creation and workflows that utilize visual data.

**Web Search Capability**: When using models that support web search functionality, the Generator Node can access real-time information from the internet. This enables the creation of content based on the latest data and current events, making your AI workflows more dynamic and up-to-date.

For more details, see the [Generator Node documentation](generator-node).

## Context

The **Context** category contains nodes for providing data sources and retrieval capabilities to your workflows. It is divided into two groups: **Source** and **Retrieval**.

### Source

Source nodes provide input data for your AI workflows.

#### Text Node

Text Node is used to hold text data. It can be used to record prompts, instructions, annotations, and more. It helps manage and organize text data within the workflow, streamlining input to generation nodes and data usage in other nodes.

For more details, see the [Text Node documentation](text-node).

#### File Node

File Node is used to handle file data. You can upload PDF files, images, and text files to use as input for AI models. It is useful for various tasks that involve utilizing file data, such as data-based analysis and report generation.

For more details, see the [File Node documentation](file-node).

#### Web Page Node

The Web Page Node is used to fetch and hold content from web pages. You can input one or more URLs, and Giselle will attempt to retrieve the content from these pages. The fetched content is processed and made available primarily in Markdown format, enabling tasks like summarization, analysis, or content generation based on information from the web.

For more details, see the [Web Page Node documentation](webpage-node).

#### Document Vector Store Node

The Document Vector Store Node creates a searchable knowledge base from your uploaded documents (PDFs, text files, and markdown). It uses advanced embedding models to convert your document content into vector embeddings, enabling semantic search within your workflows.

For more details, see the [Document Vector Store Node documentation](document-vector-store-node).

#### GitHub Vector Store Node

The GitHub Vector Store Node creates a searchable knowledge base from the contents of a GitHub repository. It vectorizes code, issues, and pull requests, enabling semantic search within your workflows. This is especially useful for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

For more details, see the [GitHub Vector Store Node documentation](github-vector-store-node).

### Retrieval

Retrieval nodes enable searching through vector stores to find relevant information.

#### Vector Query Node

The Vector Query Node is designed to execute search queries against connected vector store data sources (GitHub Vector Store Node or Document Vector Store Node). It retrieves the most relevant information (text chunks) from your vectorized content, which can then be used as dynamic context for AI generation.

For more details, see the [Vector Query Node documentation](vector-query-node).

## Integration

The **Integration** category contains nodes for connecting with external services. It is divided into two groups: **Trigger** and **Action**.

### Trigger

Trigger nodes start workflows based on external events.

#### Trigger Node

Trigger Node is the starting point for running workflows automatically. Currently, the GitHub Trigger Node enables workflows to be automatically triggered by GitHub webhooks. When the Giselle GitHub App is installed in a repository, this node can listen for specific events (like issue comments or pull requests) and start the workflow in response.

For more details, see the [Trigger Node documentation](trigger-node).

### Action

Action nodes perform operations on external services.

#### Action Node

Action Node is a node that can call external services. Currently, it primarily supports integrations with GitHub, allowing workflows to perform actions within your repositories such as creating issues or posting comments.

For more details, see the [Action Node documentation](action-node).

## Tips for Using Nodes

Here are some helpful tips to enhance your experience with nodes in Giselle.

### Node Duplication

To enhance workflow efficiency, Giselle supports node duplication. This feature allows you to quickly create a copy of an existing node within the workflow designer.

**How to Duplicate a Node:**

* **Right-Click Context Menu:** Right-click on any node in the workflow designer to open the context menu, then select "Duplicate Node."
* **Keyboard Shortcut:** Select the node you wish to duplicate and use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + D` (on macOS) or `Ctrl + D` (on Windows/Linux).

**Duplication Behavior:**

* The duplicated node will appear at an offset position from the original node.
* Connections from the original node are preserved in the duplicate where applicable.
* For File nodes, the duplicated node will correctly reference newly copied files.
* Cloned nodes will start in an "unconfigured" state, allowing you to customize their settings independently from the original node.
* If the duplication process encounters an issue, an error message will be displayed.

This feature streamlines the process of building complex workflows by allowing for easy replication of configured or template nodes.


# PostgreSQL Tools
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/postgresql-tools

Learn how to use PostgreSQL Tools in a Generator Node to connect your AI models to a PostgreSQL database, enabling them to query and retrieve data.

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in **Private Preview**. Access is limited to selected users. Features and availability may change.
</Warning>

**PostgreSQL Tools** empower AI models within a Generator Node to connect directly to your PostgreSQL databases. This feature, a form of "tool use" or "function calling," allows you to build AI agents that can query tables, retrieve data, and understand your database schema, all based on natural language instructions in your prompt.

This enables powerful workflows, such as generating business reports, answering data-driven questions, or performing automated data analysis.

## Configuring PostgreSQL Tools

Follow these steps to connect your PostgreSQL database and enable specific tools for a Generator Node.

### 1. Navigate to the Tools Tab

In any Generator Node (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`), select the **Tools** tab. You will see a list of available integrations that can be connected.

### 2. Connect to PostgreSQL

Click the **+ Connect** button next to the PostgreSQL integration. This will open a configuration modal to add your database credentials.

### 3. Add Your Connection String

To authenticate with your PostgreSQL database, you need to provide a connection string.

<Info>
  The connection string typically follows the format: `postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`. For detailed information, refer to the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
</Info>

In the "Connect to PostgreSQL" window:

1. **Connection Name**: Give your connection a short, descriptive name for easy identification (e.g., "giselle-db-preview"). You'll use this to link other nodes.
2. **Connection String**: Paste your full PostgreSQL connection string into this field. Giselle encrypts the connection string with authenticated encryption before saving it.
3. Click **Save & Connect**.

### 4. Select the Tools to Enable

After your connection is validated, you'll be presented with a list of available PostgreSQL tools. For security and control, you must explicitly select which actions the AI model is allowed to perform.

Check the boxes next to the tools you want to enable for this node:

* `getTableStructure`
* `query`

### 5. Save the Configuration

Once you've selected the desired tools, click **Save & Connect**. The Generator Node will now show that PostgreSQL is connected, displaying the enabled tools and a **Configuration** button to make future changes.

## Available PostgreSQL Tools

The following is a list of tools you can enable for your AI model.

### Schema

* `getTableStructure`: Allows the AI model to retrieve the schema of your database. This includes table names, column names, and data types. This is crucial for the AI to understand how to construct valid queries.

### Query

* `query`: Allows the AI model to execute a standard SQL query against the connected database and retrieve the results.

## How to Use PostgreSQL Tools

Once configured, you can instruct the AI model to use the enabled tools directly in your prompt. The model will understand your request, call the appropriate function, and use the results to complete the task.

### Example Prompt: Calculate the number of users

Imagine you have enabled the `getTableStructure` and `query` tools for a node.

```markdown theme={null}
Please find out the total number of users from the database.
```

When this prompt is run, the Giselle agent will:

1. Call the `getTableStructure` function to understand the database layout.
2. Identify the relevant table (e.g., `users`).
3. Formulate a SQL query like `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`.
4. Execute the query using the `query` tool.
5. Return a final answer based on the query result, such as: "The total number of users is 1,234."


# Start Node & End Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/start-end-nodes

Learn how Start and End Nodes in Giselle define the boundaries of your workflow, establishing where user input enters and where the final output is collected.

## Start Node & End Node in Giselle

**Start Node** and **End Node** are the essential boundary nodes that define the entry and exit points of any workflow in Giselle. They work as a pair to establish the complete flow of your app, from receiving user input to delivering the final output.

## Start Node

The **Start Node** is the entry point of your workflow. It defines the input parameters that users will provide when running your app in the Playground.

### Key Features

* **Entry Point**: The Start Node marks where workflow execution begins. All data flows from this node to downstream nodes.
* **Parameter Definition**: Define the input parameters that users will fill in when running your app, such as text input fields or file uploads.
* **Single Instance**: Each workflow can have only one Start Node. It cannot be duplicated.
* **Paired with End Node**: Start and End Nodes are always created together as a pair.

### Default Parameters

When you create a new app, the Start Node comes with two default input parameters:

1. **Input(Text)**: A multiline text field for users to enter text content. This is marked as required.
2. **Input(File)**: A file upload field that allows users to attach multiple files. This is optional by default.

The Start Node has a single output port that provides the user's input to downstream nodes in your workflow.

### Configuring the Start Node

1. **Select the Node**: Click on the Start Node to open its configuration panel.
2. **Edit App Description**: Customize the app description.

### Output of the Start Node

The Start Node has a single **output** that contains the values provided by the user when running the app. This output can be connected to any compatible node's input.

## End Node

The **End Node** is the endpoint of your workflow and the place where you define the app's final output. It collects processed data from upstream nodes and presents them as the app's results.

### Key Features

* **Workflow Endpoint**: The End Node is where workflow execution completes. Data connected here becomes the app's final result.
* **Output Definition**: Specify which node's output to include in the app's final result. You can connect multiple upstream nodes.
* **Single Instance**: Each workflow can have only one End Node. It cannot be duplicated.
* **Dynamic Input**: The End Node's input is created dynamically when you connect upstream nodes.

### Configuring the End Node

1. **Select the Node**: Click on the End Node to open its configuration panel.
2. **Add Output**: Click the "Add Output" button to select which upstream node's output should be included in the final result.
3. **Manage Connections**: View and disconnect connected nodes as needed.

### Connection Rules

When connecting nodes to the End Node:

* The End Node itself cannot be selected as a source
* Nodes already connected cannot be selected again
* Nodes without an output cannot be connected

### Input of the End Node

The End Node has a single **input** that receives data from connected upstream nodes. The connected data is then presented as the final output of your app.

## Visual Appearance

Both Start and End Nodes share a distinctive **capsule-shaped design** that sets them apart from other nodes:

* **Start Node**: Has an output handle on the right side for connecting to downstream nodes
* **End Node**: Has an input handle on the left side for receiving data from upstream nodes
* Both display their respective icons and names ("Start" and "End" by default)

### Connection Status Indicator

When the Start Node is properly connected to the End Node through the workflow:

* Both nodes display with full opacity
* The "Try App in Playground" button becomes enabled

When there's no valid path from Start to End:

* Both nodes appear slightly faded with dashed borders
* The "Try App in Playground" button is disabled

## How They Work Together

1. **User Input**: When someone runs your app, they fill in the parameters defined in the Start Node.
2. **Data Flow**: Input values flow from the Start Node through connected nodes.
3. **Processing**: Data is processed by various nodes (text, file, query, action nodes, etc.).
4. **Collection**: Processed results are collected by the End Node.
5. **Output**: The End Node presents the final output to the user.

### Connection Requirement

For your app to be runnable, there must be a valid path from the Start Node to the End Node. The system verifies this connection using a breadth-first search algorithm. Without a valid path, your app cannot be executed in the Playground.

## Start & End Nodes vs. Other Nodes

| Feature                | Start & End Nodes   | Other Nodes      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Instances per workflow | Exactly one each    | Multiple allowed |
| Can be duplicated      | No                  | Yes              |
| Visual style           | Capsule-shaped      | Card-shaped      |
| Purpose                | Workflow boundaries | Data processing  |
| Created automatically  | Yes, as a pair      | No               |

Start and End Nodes are essential for creating functional apps that accept user input and deliver processed results.


# Text Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/text-node

Learn how the Text Node in Giselle allows you to store and manage plain text, such as prompts, instructions, or data, directly within your workflows.

## Text Node in Giselle

The **Text Node** is one of the simplest yet most versatile "Source" nodes in Giselle. It is designed to hold and manage plain text content directly within your workflow, making it an essential tool for a wide range of applications. Unlike the File Node, which handles uploaded files, the Text Node stores its content inline, ensuring it is always immediately available without any loading or processing time.

### Key Features

* **Direct Text Input**: You can write or paste any text directly into the node's built-in editor.
* **Inline Storage**: The content is stored as a simple string within the node itself, making your workflow self-contained and portable.
* **Instant Availability**: Since there are no file uploads or external storage, the text is instantly available as an output for other nodes.

### How to Use a Text Node

1. **Add the Node**: From the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas, click the **Source** icon and select **Plain Text** to add the node to your workspace.
2. **Configure the Content**: Select the node to open its configuration panel on the right.
3. **Enter Text**: Type or paste your content directly into the text editor, which displays the placeholder "Write or paste text here...". The content is saved automatically as you type.

### Common Use Cases

The Text Node is ideal for:

* **Storing Prompts**: Write and store reusable prompts for Generator Nodes.
* **Creating Templates**: Keep text templates for various content generation tasks.
* **Writing Instructions**: Document workflow-specific instructions or guidelines for your team.
* **Holding Data**: Store small, structured datasets like JSON or CSV content for processing.
* **Quick Notes**: Use it for temporary text storage or as a scratchpad during workflow development.

### Text Node vs. File Node

While a **File Node** can also handle text files (like `.txt` or `.md`), the **Text Node** is fundamentally different and often more convenient:

* **Storage**: The Text Node stores content *directly* in the workflow. The File Node requires you to *upload* a file, which is stored separately.
* **Editing**: Content in a Text Node can be edited instantly within the Giselle interface. To change the content of a File Node, you would need to upload a new file.
* **Overhead**: The Text Node has no file management overhead (no size tracking, upload states, or potential upload failures).
* **Best For**: The Text Node is better suited for dynamic or frequently edited content, while the File Node is ideal for using large, static text files as a data source.

### Output of the Node

The **output** of a Text Node is the raw text content you have entered into its editor. This output can be connected to the input of any compatible node. For example, you can connect it to a Generator Node to use the text as a prompt, or to an Action Node to pass the text as a parameter to an external service.


# Trigger Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/trigger-node

Learn about Trigger Nodes, the starting points for workflows in Giselle. Use GitHub Triggers to initiate your AI workflow sequences.

## Trigger Node in Giselle

The **Trigger Node** is the starting point for running the workflow built in the Giselle App. It initiates the execution of the connected nodes in a sequence.

### GitHub Trigger Node

The **GitHub Trigger Node** enables you to automatically start your Giselle workflows based on specific events occurring in your GitHub repositories. This allows for seamless integration between your code management and AI-powered tasks.

#### Setting up a GitHub Trigger

#### 1. Select GitHub Account/Organization

When you add a GitHub Trigger node, you'll first need to choose the GitHub account or organization where your target repository resides (e.g., `giselles-ai`, `liam-hq`).

If you're missing a GitHub account connection or need to adjust permissions, click on "Adjust GitHub App Permissions".

#### 2. Choose a Repository

A list of repositories available under the selected account/organization will be displayed (e.g., `docs`, `giselle`).

Click the **Set up** button next to the desired repository (e.g., `giselle`).

If your repository isn't listed, you might need to "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" to grant Giselle access to it.

#### 3. Configure the Trigger Event

Once a repository is selected (e.g., `giselles-ai/giselle`), you need to specify which GitHub event will trigger the workflow.

Click on the dropdown menu labeled "Choose when you want to trigger the flow."

Select an event from the list, such as:

* **Issue Created**: Triggers the flow when a new issue is created in the repository.
* **Issue Closed**: Triggers when an issue is closed.
* **Issue Labeled**: Triggers when a specific label is added to an issue.
* **Issue Comment Created**: Triggers when a new comment is made on an issue.
* **Pull Request Comment Created**: Triggers on a new pull request comment.
* **Pull Request Opened**: Triggers when a new pull request is opened.
* **Pull Request Ready for Review**: Triggers when a pull request is marked as ready for review.
* **Pull Request Closed**: Triggers when a pull request is closed.
* **Pull Request Labeled**: Triggers when a specific label is added to a pull request.

#### 4. Configure Callsign (for Comment Events)

For some events, like "Issue Comment Created" or "Pull Request Comment Created," you can specify a **Callsign**.

A Callsign is a specific string or command (e.g., `/code-review`, `/deep-research`) that must be present in the comment for the trigger to activate. This prevents the flow from running on every single comment.

Enter your desired Callsign in the provided field. The example shows `/code-review`.

Click **Set up** after configuring the Callsign.

#### 5. Configure Labels (for Label Events)

For some events, like "Issue Labeled" or "Pull Request Labeled," you can specify one or more **Labels**.

When multiple labels are added, the workflow will trigger if *any* of the specified labels are added to the issue or pull request (OR condition). This allows for flexible triggering based on labeling conventions.

Enter your desired labels in the provided input fields. You can add multiple labels using the "Add label" button.

Click **Set up** after configuring the Labels.

#### 6. Enable the Trigger

After configuring the event and any associated options (like Callsign or Labels), the trigger will initially be in a "Disabled" state. The node on the canvas will show "Requires Setup" or display the repository and event type with a "Disabled" status.

On the configuration panel for the trigger (e.g., "On Issue Created" or "On Issue Comment Created"), you will see the current **State** as "Disable".

Click on **Enable** to activate the trigger.

Once enabled, the **State** will change to "Enable", and you will see an option to **Disable Trigger**. The node on the canvas will also reflect its "Enabled" status.

#### 7. Configure In-Progress Comment (Optional)

Once your trigger is set up, you can configure whether Giselle posts an "in-progress" comment to GitHub when the workflow starts executing.

By default, this option is **enabled**, meaning Giselle will automatically post a comment to the issue or pull request indicating that the workflow is running.

To disable in-progress comments, toggle off the **Post In-Progress Comment** option in the trigger's properties panel.

This setting is useful when you want to reduce noise in GitHub discussions or prefer silent workflow execution.

#### 8. Run in the Workspace

For GitHub Trigger Nodes, clicking the "Run" button allows you to test your workflow without waiting for an actual GitHub webhook. You can enter values in a form that simulates the GitHub event, enabling you to verify that your workflow functions correctly before enabling it for real GitHub events.

**Example Workflow after Setup:**

On Issue Created:

* **Trigger**: "On Issue Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When a new issue is created in the `giselles-ai/giselle` repository, this Giselle workflow will automatically start.

On Pull Request Comment Created:

* **Trigger**: "On Pull Request Comment Created" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with Callsign `/code-review`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When a comment containing `/code-review [enter your request...]` is posted on a pull request in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this workflow will start. The subsequent nodes can then access information like the comment body, pull request number, the pull request's diff content, etc.

On Issue Labeled:

* **Trigger**: "On Issue Labeled" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with label `bug`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When the label `bug` is added to an issue in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this Giselle workflow will automatically start. The subsequent nodes can access information like the issue number, title, body, and the name of the label that triggered the event.

On Pull Request Labeled:

* **Trigger**: "On Pull Request Labeled" for repository `giselles-ai/giselle` with labels `feature` or `enhancement`.
* **State**: Enabled.
* **Action**: When either the `feature` or `enhancement` label is added to a pull request in `giselles-ai/giselle`, this workflow will start. The subsequent nodes can access information like the pull request number, title, body, and the name of the label that triggered the event.

Stay tuned for more updates and functionalities for Giselle's nodes!


# Vector Query Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/vector-query-node

Learn how the Vector Query Node in Giselle executes queries against vector store data sources to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Vector Query Node in Giselle

The **Vector Query Node** is a powerful component in Giselle designed to search and retrieve information from connected vector store data sources. Its primary function is to execute a query (such as a question or a search term) against a vectorized dataset and return the most relevant results.

The Vector Query Node works with the following vector store nodes, making it a crucial building block for creating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications directly within your Giselle workflows:

* **[GitHub Vector Store Node](github-vector-store-node)**: Search through vectorized GitHub repository content including code, issues, and pull requests.
* **[Document Vector Store Node](document-vector-store-node)**: Search through your uploaded documents such as PDFs, text files, and markdown files.

### How to Use the Vector Query Node

Setting up a Vector Query Node involves adding it to your canvas, connecting a data source, and running a query.

#### 1. Add a Vector Query Node

From the node toolbar at the bottom of the canvas, select the **Vector Query Node**, which is identifiable by its magnifying glass icon, and place it in your workspace.

#### 2. Connect a Data Source

The Vector Query Node requires an input from a vector store data source to function. You must connect the `Output` of a vector store node (GitHub Vector Store Node or Document Vector Store Node) to the `Input` of the Vector Query Node. Until a data source is connected, the node will indicate that it is waiting for a connection.

#### 3. Write and Run a Query

Once a data source is connected, you can configure the Vector Query Node:

* **Enter a Query**: In the configuration panel, type your question or search term into the "Query" input field.
* **Run the Query**: Click the **Run Query** button to execute the search against the connected data source.

#### 4. Review the Results

After the query runs, the results will be displayed directly in the node's panel. The results typically include:

* A summary of the number of results found.
* A list of relevant "chunks" of text retrieved from the source documents.
* A similarity score (e.g., 58%) for each chunk, indicating its relevance to your query.

You can expand each chunk to view its content and metadata.

### Core Use Case: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The primary purpose of the Vector Query Node is to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows. RAG enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information from your own data sources before they generate a response.

A typical RAG workflow in Giselle looks like this:

1. **Data Source (Vector Store Node)**: Ingests and vectorizes your content from a GitHub repository or uploaded documents, making it searchable.
2. **Vector Query Node**: Takes a user's question (the query) and retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the vector store.
3. **Generator Node**: Receives the original question *and* the retrieved information from the Vector Query Node's output. It uses this combined context to generate a more accurate, detailed, and factually grounded answer.

### Output of the Vector Query Node

The `Result` output of the Vector Query Node contains the collection of retrieved data chunks. This structured data can be passed to subsequent nodes—most commonly a **Generator Node**—to serve as dynamic context for text generation.

<Note>
  For more information on how to set up a data source for querying, see our documentation on the [GitHub Vector Store Node](github-vector-store-node) and [Document Vector Store Node](document-vector-store-node).

# Web Page Node
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/glossary/webpage-node

Learn how the Web Page Node in Giselle allows you to fetch and use content from web pages as static inputs in your AI workflows.

## Web Page Node in Giselle

The **Web Page Node** is used to fetch and hold content from web pages. You can input one or more URLs, and Giselle will attempt to retrieve the content from these pages. Currently, the fetched content is processed and made available primarily in **Markdown format**. This allows you to use web content as a static input source for AI models or other processing nodes within your workflow, enabling tasks like summarization, analysis, or content generation based on information from the web.

The Web Page Node functions as an independent variable node, providing a streamlined way to integrate web-based information into your Giselle applications.

### Setting up a Web Page Node:

1. **Add a Web Page Node**:
   * Drag and drop a "Web Page" node from the toolbar at the bottom of the canvas onto your workspace.

2. **Configure URLs**:
   * Select the Web Page node on the canvas to open its configuration panel on the right.
   * In the text area labeled "URLs (one per line)", enter the full web addresses (URLs) of the pages from which you want to fetch content. If you have multiple URLs, enter each one on a new line.
     ```
     https://example.com/
     https://docs.giselles.ai/glossary/node
     ```

3. **Add URLs**:
   * After entering the desired URLs, click the blue **Add** button.
   * Giselle will then attempt to fetch the content from the specified URLs.
   * Once the URLs are processed, the configuration panel will update to list the added pages, often displaying their titles or a reference to the URL. The "URLs (one per line)" input area and the **Add** button will remain, allowing you to add more URLs if needed.

### Output of the Web Page Node:

* **Content**: After successfully fetching data from the provided URLs, the Web Page Node makes this content available as its **output**.
* **Format**: The fetched content is primarily delivered in **Markdown format**. This standardized format makes it easy to use in subsequent text-processing nodes.
* **Connectivity**: The output of the Web Page Node can be connected to other nodes in your workflow. For instance, you can feed the Markdown content into a **Generator Node** to summarize an article, extract specific information, or use it as context for generating new content.

The Web Page node on the canvas will have an "Output" port, which you can drag to connect to an input port of another node.

### Example: Summarizing a Web Article

1. **Configure Web Page Node**:
   * Add a Web Page Node.
   * Input the URL of an online blog article (e.g., `https://giselles.ai/blog/transforming-product-development-human-ai-collaboration`).
   * Click **Add**.

2. **Connect to Generator Node**:
   * Add a Generator Node.
   * Connect the "Output" of the Web Page Node to an input (e.g., a context or document input) of the Generator Node.

3. **Configure Generator Node**:
   * Instruct the Generator Node to summarize the provided text. For example, use a prompt like: "Please summarize the following article concisely:"

4. **Run Workflow**:
   * When the workflow runs, the Web Page Node fetches the article content as Markdown, and the Generator Node produces a summary.

### Future Updates

The Web Page Node's user interface and functionality, including supported output formats, may be updated incrementally in future Giselle releases.


# API Keys
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/guides/api/api-keys

Learn how to create and manage API keys to access the Giselle API programmatically.

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in **Private Preview**. Access is limited to selected users. Features and APIs may change without notice.
</Warning>

<Info>
  You can manage API keys by navigating to [Settings > Team > API Keys](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/api-keys).
</Info>

## Overview

API keys allow you to access the Giselle API programmatically to run your apps from external applications, scripts, or services. API keys are scoped to your team, meaning all team members share access to the same set of API keys.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys Settings">
    Go to [Settings > Team > API Keys](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/api-keys) in the Giselle.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Key">
    Click the **Create new secret key** button to open the creation dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Label (Optional)">
    Enter a descriptive label for your API key (e.g., "Production Server", "CI/CD Pipeline"). This helps you identify the key's purpose later.

    <Note>
      Labels can be up to 128 characters long.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Your API Key">
    After creation, your API key will be displayed **once**. Copy it immediately and store it securely.

    <Warning>
      The full API key is only shown once at creation time. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new key.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Key Format

API keys follow the format:

```
gsk_<id>.<secret>
```

For example: `gsk_abc123xyz.secret_value_here`

When viewing your API keys in the settings, you'll see a redacted version showing only the first few and last few characters (e.g., `gsk_abc...xyz`).

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing API Keys

The API Keys page displays all keys for your team with the following information:

* **Label**: The descriptive name you assigned
* **Redacted Value**: A shortened version of the key for identification
* **Created At**: When the key was created
* **Last Used At**: When the key was last used for an API request

### Revoking API Keys

To revoke an API key:

1. Navigate to [Settings > Team > API Keys](https://studio.giselles.ai/settings/team/api-keys)
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the **Revoke** button
4. Confirm the revocation

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key is immediate and permanent. Any applications or services using that key will immediately lose access to the API.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

When making requests to the Giselle API, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://studio.giselles.ai/api/apps/{appId}/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gsk_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your input text"}'
```

For a better developer experience, consider using the [Giselle SDK](/en/guides/api/sdk) which handles authentication automatically.

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Keys Secret">
    Never expose API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Labels">
    Label your keys by their use case (e.g., "Production", "Development", "CI/CD") to easily track and manage them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Periodically create new keys and revoke old ones, especially if you suspect a key may have been compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit Key Distribution">
    Only share API keys with team members and systems that genuinely need API access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate-limited based on your team's plan:

| Plan       | Requests per Minute |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Free       | 60                  |
| Pro        | 300                 |
| Team       | 600                 |
| Enterprise | 3,000               |

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

* `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed per minute
* `RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window
* `RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
* `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before retrying (when rate limited)

## Troubleshooting

### Unauthorized (401) Error

If you receive a 401 error, check that:

* Your API key is correct and complete
* The key hasn't been revoked
* The `Authorization` header is formatted correctly: `Bearer <your_api_key>`

### Rate Limited (429) Error

If you're being rate limited:

* Check the `Retry-After` header for when you can retry
* Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits
* Implement exponential backoff in your application

## Next Steps

* Learn how to use the [Giselle SDK](/en/guides/api/sdk) for easier API integration
* Explore the [Playground](/en/guides/playground) to test your apps before integrating via API


# Giselle SDK
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/guides/api/sdk

Learn how to use the Giselle SDK to integrate your apps with external applications and services.

<Warning>
  This feature is currently in **Private Preview**. Access is limited to selected users. Features and APIs may change without notice.
</Warning>

## Overview

The Giselle SDK (`@giselles-ai/sdk`) provides a simple, type-safe way to interact with the Giselle API from your Node.js applications. It handles authentication, request formatting, and polling for task completion automatically.

<Warning>
  The SDK is designed for server-side use only. Never use it in client-side code (browsers) as this would expose your API key.
</Warning>

## Installation

The Giselle SDK is published on npm at [@giselles-ai/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@giselles-ai/sdk).

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager:

```bash theme={null}
npm install @giselles-ai/sdk
```

```bash theme={null}
yarn add @giselles-ai/sdk
```

```bash theme={null}
pnpm add @giselles-ai/sdk
```

## Quick Start

```typescript theme={null}
import Giselle from "@giselles-ai/sdk";

// Initialize the client
const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: process.env.GISELLE_API_KEY,
});

// Run an app and wait for results
const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
  appId: "app_xxxxx",
  input: { text: "Hello, Giselle!" },
});

console.log(task.status); // "completed"
console.log(task.outputs); // Array of output results
```

## Configuration

### Constructor Options

```typescript theme={null}
const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: string;       // Required: Your API key
  baseUrl?: string;     // Optional: API base URL (default: "https://studio.giselles.ai")
  fetch?: typeof fetch; // Optional: Custom fetch implementation
});
```

| Option    | Required | Default                      | Description                                                                      |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiKey`  | Yes      | -                            | Your Giselle API key. Get one from [API Keys settings](/en/guides/api/api-keys). |
| `baseUrl` | No       | `https://studio.giselles.ai` | The base URL for API requests.                                                   |
| `fetch`   | No       | Global `fetch`               | Custom fetch implementation for specific runtime environments.                   |

### Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in an environment variable:

```bash theme={null}
# .env
GISELLE_API_KEY=gsk_your_api_key_here
```

```typescript theme={null}
const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: process.env.GISELLE_API_KEY,
});
```

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

## API Reference

### `client.apps.run()`

Starts an app execution and returns immediately with a task ID. Use this when you want to handle polling yourself or don't need to wait for results.

```typescript theme={null}
const { taskId } = await client.apps.run({
  appId: "app_xxxxx",
  input: { text: "Your input text" },
});

console.log(taskId); // "tsk_xxxxx"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter    | Type     | Required | Description                                    |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `appId`      | `string` | Yes      | The ID of the app to run (format: `app_xxxxx`) |
| `input.text` | `string` | Yes      | The text input for the app                     |

**Returns:**

```typescript theme={null}
{
  taskId: string; // The ID of the created task
}
```

### `client.apps.runAndWait()`

Starts an app execution and polls until the task completes. This is the recommended method for most use cases.

```typescript theme={null}
const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
  appId: "app_xxxxx",
  input: { text: "Your input text" },
  pollIntervalMs: 1000,  // Optional: polling interval (default: 1000ms)
  timeoutMs: 60000,      // Optional: timeout (default: 1200000ms / 20 minutes)
});
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter        | Type     | Required | Default   | Description                            |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `appId`          | `string` | Yes      | -         | The ID of the app to run               |
| `input.text`     | `string` | Yes      | -         | The text input for the app             |
| `pollIntervalMs` | `number` | No       | `1000`    | How often to check for completion (ms) |
| `timeoutMs`      | `number` | No       | `1200000` | Maximum time to wait (ms)              |

**Returns:**

```typescript theme={null}
{
  task: {
    id: string;
    workspaceId: string;
    name: string;
    status: "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled";
    steps: Array<{
      title: string;
      status: string;
      items: Array<{
        id: string;
        title: string;
        status: string;
        generationId?: string;
        outputs?: any[];
        error?: string;
      }>;
    }>;
    outputs: Array<{
      title: string;
      generationId?: string;
      outputs: any[];
    }>;
  };
}
```

## Finding Your App ID and Code Snippet

The easiest way to get your App ID and a ready-to-use code snippet is from the Workspace:

1. Open your app in the Workspace
2. Click the **Run** button in the top-right corner
3. In the dialog that appears, select the **Code** tab
4. You'll see a complete code snippet with your `appId` already filled in:

```typescript theme={null}
import Giselle from "@giselles-ai/sdk";

const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: process.env.GISELLE_API_KEY,
});

const { taskId } = await client.apps.run({
  appId: "app_xxxxx", // Your actual App ID is shown here
  input: { text: "your input here" },
});

console.log(taskId);
```

Simply copy this code and use it in your application.

<Note>
  The App ID format is `app_` followed by a unique identifier (e.g., `app_abc123xyz`).
</Note>

## Error Handling

The SDK throws specific error types for different failure scenarios:

```typescript theme={null}
import Giselle, {
  ConfigurationError,
  ApiError,
  TimeoutError,
  UnsupportedFeatureError,
} from "@giselles-ai/sdk";

try {
  const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
    appId: "app_xxxxx",
    input: { text: "Hello" },
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ConfigurationError) {
    // Missing or invalid configuration (e.g., no API key)
    console.error("Configuration error:", error.message);
  } else if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    // API request failed
    console.error("API error:", error.status, error.responseText);
  } else if (error instanceof TimeoutError) {
    // Task didn't complete within the timeout
    console.error("Task timed out:", error.message);
  } else if (error instanceof UnsupportedFeatureError) {
    // Attempted to use an unsupported feature
    console.error("Unsupported feature:", error.message);
  }
}
```

### Error Types

| Error Type                | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConfigurationError`      | Missing or invalid configuration (e.g., API key not provided)                    |
| `ApiError`                | HTTP request to the API failed. Includes `status` and `responseText` properties. |
| `TimeoutError`            | Task didn't complete within the specified timeout                                |
| `UnsupportedFeatureError` | Attempted to use a feature not yet supported (e.g., file inputs)                 |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript theme={null}
import Giselle from "@giselles-ai/sdk";

const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: process.env.GISELLE_API_KEY,
});

async function runMyApp(userInput: string) {
  const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
    appId: "app_xxxxx",
    input: { text: userInput },
  });

  if (task.status === "completed") {
    return task.outputs;
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Task failed: ${task.status}`);
  }
}
```

### With Custom Timeout

```typescript theme={null}
const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
  appId: "app_xxxxx",
  input: { text: "Complex query that may take time" },
  timeoutMs: 300000, // 5 minutes
  pollIntervalMs: 2000, // Check every 2 seconds
});
```

### Fire and Forget

```typescript theme={null}
// Start the task but don't wait for completion
const { taskId } = await client.apps.run({
  appId: "app_xxxxx",
  input: { text: "Background processing" },
});

console.log(`Task started: ${taskId}`);
// You can check the task status later via the API or in the Giselle
```

### Express.js Integration

```typescript theme={null}
import express from "express";
import Giselle from "@giselles-ai/sdk";

const app = express();
const client = new Giselle({
  apiKey: process.env.GISELLE_API_KEY,
});

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/process", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { task } = await client.apps.runAndWait({
      appId: "app_xxxxx",
      input: { text: req.body.text },
      timeoutMs: 60000,
    });

    res.json({
      success: true,
      outputs: task.outputs,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
    });
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Current Limitations

* **Text input only**: Currently, only text input is supported. File inputs will be supported in a future release.
* **Server-side only**: The SDK should only be used in server-side environments to protect your API key.

# Workspaces
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/guides/workspaces

Learn how to build AI workflows visually in the Workspace editor

## Overview

A **Workspace** is a visual canvas-based editor where you design AI workflows by connecting nodes together. Each node performs a specific function, and data flows between nodes through connections.

## The Workspace Editor

The Workspace editor consists of several key components:

* **Canvas**: The main area where you build your workflow by placing and connecting nodes
* **Toolbar**: Located at the bottom, provides access to all available node types
* **Properties Panel**: Appears on the right when a node is selected, allowing you to configure its settings

## Adding Nodes

To add a node to your workflow:

1. Click a category in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen
2. Select the desired node type from the menu
3. The node appears on the canvas
4. Drag the node to position it where you want

### Available Node Types

Nodes are organized into categories:

**App**

* **[Start Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#start-node)**: Defines the workflow entry point and input parameters
* **[End Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#end-node)**: Marks the workflow completion and output

**Model**

* **[Generator Node](/en/glossary/generator-node)**: Performs AI text or image generation using various LLM providers

**Context**

* **[Text Node](/en/glossary/text-node)**: Stores static text content
* **[File Node](/en/glossary/file-node)**: Attaches files (PDF, text, images) to your workflow
* **[Web Page Node](/en/glossary/webpage-node)**: Fetches and provides web page content
* **[Document Vector Store Node](/en/glossary/document-vector-store-node)**: Creates searchable indexes from documents
* **[GitHub Vector Store Node](/en/glossary/github-vector-store-node)**: Creates searchable indexes from GitHub repositories
* **[Vector Query Node](/en/glossary/vector-query-node)**: Searches vector stores for relevant content

**Integration**

* **[Trigger Node](/en/glossary/trigger-node)**: Starts workflows from external events (e.g., GitHub webhooks)
* **[Action Node](/en/glossary/action-node)**: Executes external actions (e.g., GitHub operations)

## Connecting Nodes

To connect nodes and create data flow:

1. Hover over a node to see its output port (right side)
2. Click and drag from the output port
3. Drop the connection on another node's input port (left side)
4. A connection line appears showing the data flow direction

Connections define how data passes between nodes. The output of one node becomes available as input to the connected node.

## Configuring Nodes

To configure a node:

1. Click on a node to select it
2. The Properties Panel opens on the right side
3. Edit the node name in the header if needed
4. Configure node-specific settings:
   * **Generator Node**: Select an AI model, write prompts, enable tools
   * **Text Node**: Enter your text content
   * **File Node**: Upload files
   * **Trigger/Action Nodes**: Configure integration settings

## Running Your Workflow

You can run your workflow directly in the Workspace to test it:

1. Click the **Run** button in the upper right corner
2. Enter any required input values
3. The workflow executes and you're redirected to the task execution result page

On the result page, you can see:

* Execution progress and status for each step
* Generated outputs from each node
* Token usage and execution duration

This allows you to quickly test and iterate on your workflow during development.

## Creating an App

By connecting a [Start Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#start-node) and [End Node](/en/glossary/start-end-nodes#end-node), your workflow becomes an **App** that can be run from the [Playground](https://studio.giselles.ai/playground).

1. Add a Start Node
2. Build your workflow with the nodes you need
3. Add an End Node to define the output
4. Connect all nodes in your workflow

Once configured, your app appears in the Playground where you and your team can run it without accessing the Workspace editor.

## Next Steps

* Learn about [Generator Node](/en/glossary/generator-node) configuration
* Explore [AI Parameters](/en/glossary/ai-parameters) for fine-tuning generation
* Set up [Integrations](/en/guides/settings/team/integrations) for external services

# Tips
Source: https://docs.giselles.ai/en/prompts/tips

Practical Tips for Effective Prompt Creation in Giselle’s Generator Nodes.

This document provides concrete, actionable tips tailored specifically for creating effective prompts within Giselle’s Generator Nodes. Unlike conversational UIs, Giselle uses a single-shot prompting model, meaning each prompt must be precise and complete on its own. While direct iterative refinement through conversation within a single node isn't possible, strategically chaining multiple nodes can significantly elevate the output quality through careful node integration and diverse data sourcing.

## Essential Principles

### 1. Ensure Clarity and Precision

* Clearly define the AI model’s role.
* Provide explicit, focused instructions without ambiguity.

```plaintext theme={null}
❌ Poor example:
"Describe a useful invention."

✅ Good example:
"Role: Technology historian

Task: Provide a concise summary (100 words max) of the invention of the telephone, highlighting its historical significance and modern impact.

Output Format:
- Summary paragraph
- Clearly stated historical context and modern relevance"
```

### 2. Include Comprehensive Context

* Provide necessary background and purpose clearly in your prompt.
* Explicitly state constraints or expectations relevant to the task.

### 3. Specify Structured Outputs

* Clearly outline the desired response structure, length, and style.
* Define formats explicitly (e.g., bullet points, structured paragraphs, JSON, image dimensions).

## Advanced Node Integration Techniques

### 1. Effective Role Definition

Defining roles guides the AI to produce contextually accurate outputs:

```plaintext theme={null}
✅ Example:
"Role: UX Designer

Task: Evaluate the provided web interface design for usability issues.

Output Format:
- List identified issues clearly
- Provide specific recommendations for improvements"
```

### 2. Sequential Node Chaining

Although Giselle nodes are single-shot, you can achieve iterative refinement by chaining multiple nodes:

1. **Ideation Node**: Generate initial ideas or concepts.
2. **Drafting Node**: Develop detailed drafts from initial concepts.
3. **Review Node**: Critically evaluate drafts and suggest improvements.

### 3. Leveraging Multi-Node Workflows

Combine diverse AI models across nodes to maximize output quality:

* **Claude** for nuanced analysis and ethical considerations.
* **GPT-5.2** for structured and creative content creation.
* **Gemini** for high-quality image and visual content generation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Overly Restrictive Instructions

Avoid excessively rigid constraints:

```plaintext theme={null}
❌ Avoid:
"Create a detailed report exactly 200 words, including exactly four examples."
```

### 2. Contradictory or Confusing Instructions

Ensure instructions remain logically consistent:

```plaintext theme={null}
❌ Avoid:
"Provide a highly detailed yet simple explanation using advanced terminology."
```

### 3. Ambiguous or Incomplete Prompts

Avoid vague instructions that lead to unclear outputs:

```plaintext theme={null}
❌ Avoid:
"Explain something useful."
```

## Optimizing Giselle Workflows

### 1. Iterative Node Refinement

* Regularly review outputs from each node to optimize subsequent prompts.
* Use multiple nodes strategically to iteratively refine concepts, drafts, and final outputs.

### 2. Strategic Use of Templates

Leverage prompt templates for consistent, effective outputs:

```plaintext theme={null}
✅ Giselle Template:

Role: [Defined AI role]

Task: [Explicit, precise task description]

Constraints:
- [Specific constraint or limitation]
- [Additional constraints as necessary]

Input Data:
- [Clearly referenced or provided data]

Output Format:
- [Detailed expected structure of response]
```

## Giselle-Specific Recommendations

### 1. Select Appropriate AI Models

Choose AI models carefully according to task requirements and capabilities:

* **Claude**: nuanced, ethical analyses.
* **Gemini**: complex multimodal inputs and image generation.
* **GPT-5.2**: structured outputs and creative content.

### 2. Visualize and Collaborate

* Clearly map your workflows visually within Giselle’s UI.
* Share your workflows with teams to enhance collaboration and clarity.
* Experiment with node combinations to achieve advanced, high-quality results beyond standard conversational interfaces.

## Key Points for Effective Giselle Prompts

* **Role Definition**: Clearly articulate the AI model’s role.
* **Precision**: Provide exact, detailed instructions.
