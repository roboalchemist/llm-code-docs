## Description

Sorts the input documents based on one or more specified sort orderings.

## Syntax

The following example sorts the <var translate="no">cities</var> collection by <var translate="no">population</var> in ascending order:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/cities")
      .sort(Field.of("population").ascending())
      .execute();

The following example sorts the <var translate="no">cities</var> collection by the <var translate="no">length</var> of the city name, in ascending order.

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/cities")
      .sort(Field.of("name").charLength().ascending())
      .execute();

## Client examples

### Web

```javascript
const results = await execute(db.pipeline()
  .collection("books")
  .sort(
    field("release_date").descending(), field("author").ascending()
  )
);
```

##### Swift

```swift
let results = try await db.pipeline()
  .collection("books")
  .sort([
    Field("release_date").descending(), Field("author").ascending()
  ])
  .execute()
```

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val results = db.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .sort(
        field("release_date").descending(),
        field("author").ascending()
    )
    .execute()
```

### Java

```java
Task<Pipeline.Snapshot> results = db.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .sort(
        field("release_date").descending(),
        field("author").ascending()
    )
    .execute();
```

##### Python

```python
from google.cloud.firestore_v1.pipeline_expressions import Field

results = (
    client.pipeline()
    .collection("books")
    .sort(Field.of("release_date").descending(), Field.of("author").ascending())
    .execute()
)
```

##### Java

```java
Pipeline.Snapshot results =
    firestore
        .pipeline()
        .collection("books")
        .sort(descending(field("release_date")), ascending(field("author")))
        .execute()
        .get();
```

## Behavior

### Sort order

Sort order follows [Cloud Firestore's value type order](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/concepts/data-types#value_type_ordering)

### Deterministic Order of Results

If there is no `sort` stage in the query, the ordering of the returned results is non-deterministic and may vary between executions. If a `sort` stage is present but the ordering expressions fail to produce a unique ordering among the returned results, the ordering of the returned results may still vary between executions.

For example, sorting cities by the <var translate="no">country</var> of the cities, in ascending order against the following dataset

    {name: 'Los Angeles', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 3970000},
    {name: 'New York', state: 'NY', country: 'USA', population: 8530000}
    {name: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 870000},

can produce any permutation of the 3 documents in the dataset because they all have the same <var translate="no">country</var> attribute.
To produce a deterministic ordering of the results, you can append a sort order on <var translate="no">**name**</var> to the order:

### Node.js

    const results = await db.pipeline()
      .collection("/cities")
      .sort(Field.of("country").ascending(), Field.of("__name__").ascending())
      .execute();

This will use the unique document name as the tiebreaker when multiple documents have the same <var translate="no">country</var> value.
Note that any other fields which together with the <var translate="no">country</var> field form a unique key of the document within the collection can be used to produce a deterministic order of results.

### Sorting Equivalent Values

Equivalent values are sorted together but the order of results within the equivalent class are not deterministic according to the [Deterministic Order of Results discussion](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/pipelines/stages/transformation/sort#deterministic-order-of-results).
For example, sorting cities by <var translate="no">size</var>, in ascending order against the following dataset

    {name: 'Los Angeles', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', size: 3970000},
    {name: 'Mexico City', state: null, country: 'Mexico', size: 3970000.0},

can produce any permutation of the 2 documents in the dataset because both documents have the equivalent <var translate="no">size</var> value `3970000`.

### Multiple Sort Stages

When the query contains multiple consecutive sort stages, only the last sort stage has an impact on the query results. Note that this is different from the behavior of the `orderBy` clause in the Core API.

### Top-N Sort Optimization

When a `limit` is used after a `sort`, a top-n sort may be used. This optimization bounds the memory use of the sort stage by allowing it to only store `N` documents at a time---as defined by `limit`---making the sort more memory-efficient.

### Null and Absent values

If a field specified in an ordering does not exist in a document, its value is sorted as if the value is `null`.
For example, sorting cities by the <var translate="no">state</var> of the cities, in ascending order against the following dataset

    {name: 'Los Angeles', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 3970000},
    {name: 'Mexico City', state: null, country: 'Mexico', population: 9200000},
    {name: 'New York', state: 'NY', country: 'USA', population: 8530000}
    {name: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 870000},
    {name: 'Toronto', country: 'Canada', population: 2930000},

produces the following results where the "Toronto" document and the "Mexico City" document are sorted as `null` and before other documents.

    {name: 'Toronto', country: 'Canada', population: 2930000},
    {name: 'Mexico City', state: null, country: 'Mexico', population: 9200000},
    {name: 'Los Angeles', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 3970000},
    {name: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA', country: 'USA', population: 870000},
    {name: 'New York', state: 'NY', country: 'USA', population: 8530000}
