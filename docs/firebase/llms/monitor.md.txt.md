# Monitor and protect web apps

After you publish your apps, you should monitor and secure them:

- If you publish with Firebase Hosting, you can link your Firebase
  project to Cloud Logging to monitor usage and access web request logs.
  Learn more at [View, search, and filter your web request logs with
  Cloud Logging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/web-request-logs-and-metrics).

- If you use the App Prototyping agent to publish with
  Firebase App Hosting, you can use its observability
  features to [monitor your web site's performance](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/monitor#observability). You can
  also [write logs to Cloud Logging and view logs and metrics in the
  Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/logging).

- If you use AI in your app with Genkit, you can [monitor how your
  generative AI features are running in production](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/monitor#genkit-monitoring).

- If your app includes Firebase services, secure them with
  [Firebase App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/monitor#app-check).

## Monitor your site performance with App Hosting observability

The **App overview** panel in Firebase Studio provides key
metrics and information about your app, letting you monitor your web app's
performance using App Hosting's built-in observability tools. After your
site rolls out, you can access the overview by clicking **Publish**. From this
panel, you can:

- Click **Publish** to release a new version of your app.
- Share the link to your app or open your app directly in **Visit your app**.
- Review a summary of your app's performance over the last 7 days, including the total number of requests and the status of your latest rollout. Click **View details** to access even more information in the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/apphosting/).
- View a graph of the number of the number of requests your app has received over the last 24 hours, broken down by HTTP status code.
- View the activation status of Firebase services like Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

If you close the App overview panel, you can re-open it at any time by
clicking **Publish**.

[Manage rollouts and releases](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/rollouts).

## Genkit Monitoring for your deployed features

You can monitor your Genkit feature steps, inputs, and outputs by enabling
telemetry to your AI flow code. Genkit's telemetry feature lets you monitor
the
performance and usage of your AI flows. This data can help you identify areas
for improvement, troubleshoot issues, optimize your prompts and flows for better
performance and cost efficiency, and track the usage of your flows over time.

To set up monitoring in Genkit, you add telemetry to the Genkit AI flows
and then view the results in the Firebase console.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** Genkit Monitoring relies on telemetry data written to Google Cloud Logging, Metrics, and Trace, which are paid services. View the [Google Cloud Observability pricing](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing) page for pricing details and to learn about free-of-charge tier limits.

### Step 1: Add telemetry to your Genkit flow code in Firebase Studio

To set up monitoring in your code:

1. If you aren't already in Code view, click
   ![Code switch
   icon](https://firebase.google.com/static/docs/studio/images/icons/codicon-code.svg)
   **Switch to Code** to open it.

2. Check `package.json` to verify the version of Genkit that's installed.

3. Open the terminal (`Ctrl-Shift-C`, or `Cmd-Shift-C` in MacOS).

4. Click inside the terminal and install the Firebase plugin, using the
   version that matches your `package.json` file. For example, if the
   Genkit packages in your
   `package.json` are at 1.0.4, you should run the following command to
   install the plugin:

       npm i --save @genkit-ai/firebase@1.0.4

5. From **Explorer** , expand `src > ai > flows`. One or more TypeScript files
   that contain your Genkit flows appear in the `flows` folder.

6. Click one of the flows to open it.

   > [!TIP]
   > **Tip:** Note the `prompt` section of the file: You can edit this manually to refine Gemini's responses.

7. At the bottom of the imports section of the file, add the following to
   import and enable `FirebaseTelemetry`:

       import { enableFirebaseTelemetry } from '@genkit-ai/firebase';

       enableFirebaseTelemetry();

   > [!TIP]
   > **Tip:** To learn more about advanced telemetry options in Genkit, see [Advanced
   > configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/observability/advanced-configuration#default-configuration).

### Step 2: Set up permissions

Firebase Studio enabled the [required
APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/observability/getting-started#enable-apis) for you when it
set up your Firebase project, but you also need to provide permissions to the
App Hosting service account.

To set up permissions:

1. Open the
   [Google Cloud IAM console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
   select your project, then grant the following roles to the **App Hosting
   service account**:

   - **Monitoring Metric Writer** (`roles/monitoring.metricWriter`)
   - **Cloud Trace Agent** (`roles/cloudtrace.agent`)
   - **Logs Writer** (`roles/logging.logWriter`)
2. [Re-publish your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/deploy-app#app-hosting) to App Hosting.

3. When publishing is complete, load your app and start using it. After five
   minutes, your app should start logging telemetry data.

### Step 3: Monitor your generative AI features on the Firebase console

When telemetry is configured, Genkit records the number of requests,
success, and latency for all of your flows, and, for each specific flow,
Genkit collects stability metrics, shows detailed graphs, and logs
captured traces.

To monitor your AI features implemented with Genkit:

1. After five minutes, open Genkit in the
   [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/genkit)
   and review Genkit's prompts and responses.

   Genkit compiles the following **Stability metrics**:
   - **Total requests:** The total number of requests received by your flow.
   - **Success rate:** The percentage of requests that were successfully processed.
   - **95th percentile latency:** The 95th percentile latency of your flow, which is the time it takes for 95% of requests to be processed.
   - **Token usage:**

     - Input tokens: The number of tokens sent to the model in the prompt.
     - Output tokens: The number of tokens generated by the model in the response.
   - **Image usage:**

     - **Input images:** The number of images sent to the model in the prompt.
     - **Output images:** The number of images generated by the model in the response.

   If you expand stability metrics, detailed graphs are available:
   - Request volume over time.
   - Success rate over time.
   - Input and output tokens over time.
   - Latency (95th and 50th percentile) over time.

## Protect your app with Firebase App Check

If you've integrated Firebase or Google Cloud services into your app,
Firebase App Check helps protect your app backends from abuse by preventing
unauthorized clients from accessing your Firebase resources. It works with
both Google services (including Firebase and Google Cloud services) and
your own custom backends to keep your resources safe.

We recommend adding App Check to any app you post publicly to protect your
backend resources from abuse.

This section guides you through setting up App Check within
Firebase Studio using [reCAPTCHA
Enterprise](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-enterprise-provider) for a web app
created by the App Prototyping agent, but you can set up App Check within
any app that implements Firebase services and can implement custom providers.
Learn more at [Firebase App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check).

ReCAPTCHA Enterprise provides [up to 10,000 assessments at
no-cost](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/compare-tiers).

### Step 1: Set up reCAPTCHA Enterprise for your app

1. Open the [reCAPTCHA Enterprise](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha?project=_)
   section of the Google Cloud console.

2. Select the name of your Firebase project from the Google Cloud console
   project picker.

3. If you're prompted to enable the reCAPTCHA Enterprise API, do so.

4. Click **Get started** , and add a **Display name** for your reCAPTCHA
   site key.

5. Accept the default **Web** **Application type** key.

6. Click **Add a domain** and add a domain. You'll want to add your
   App Hosting domain (for example,
   `studio--PROJECT_ID.REGION.hosted.app`)
   and any custom domains you use with or plan to use with your app.

7. Click **Next step**.

8. Leave **Will you use challenges?** unselected.

9. Click **Create key**.

10. Copy and save your **Key ID** and proceed to [**Configure App Check**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/monitor#configure-app-check).

### Step 2: Configure App Check

1. Open the
   [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/appcheck)
   and click **Build** \> **App Check** from the navigation menu.

2. Click **Get started** , then click **Register** next to your app.

3. Click to expand **ReCAPTCHA** and paste the Key ID you generated for
   reCAPTCHA Enterprise.

4. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Add App Check to your code

1. Return to Firebase Studio and in Code view, add
   the site key you generated to your `.env` file:

       NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY

2. If you don't already have your Firebase configuration saved to `.env`,
   obtain it:

   - From the
     [Firebase console](http:https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings),
     open **Project settings** and locate it within your the section that
     corresponds with your app.

   - From the Terminal in Code view:

     1. Log into Firebase: `firebase auth login`
     2. Select your project: `firebase use FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     3. Obtain the Firebase config: `firebase apps:sdkconfig`
3. Add the configuration to your `.env` file so that it looks like the
   following:

       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=FIREBASE_API_KEY
       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
       NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=FIREBASE_APP_ID
       NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY

4. Add App Check to your app code. You can ask Gemini to add
   App Check with reCAPTCHA Enterprise to your app (be sure to
   specify "reCAPTCHA Enterprise" and be sure to double-check it!), or
   follow the steps in [Initialize
   App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-enterprise-provider#initialize).

5. Re-publish your site to App Hosting. Try testing your
   database and authentication features to generate some data.

6. Verify that App Check is receiving requests in the
   Firebase console by opening **Build** \> **App Check**.

7. Click to inspect Cloud Firestore. After you verify that requests arrive,
   click **Enforce** to enforce App Check.

8. Repeat verification and enforcement for Firebase Authentication.

If, after you have registered your app for App Check, you want to run your
app in an environment that App Check would normally not classify as valid,
such as locally during development, or from a continuous integration (CI)
environment, you can create a debug build of your app that uses the
App Check debug provider instead of a real attestation provider. Learn more
at [Use App Check with the debug provider in web
apps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/debug-provider).
