[VPC Service Controls](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/) lets organizations define a perimeter around
Google Cloud resources to mitigate data exfiltration risks. With
VPC Service Controls, you create perimeters that protect the resources and data
of services that you explicitly specify.

## Bundled Cloud Firestore services

The following APIs are bundled together in VPC Service Controls:

- `firestore.googleapis.com`
- `datastore.googleapis.com`
- `firestorekeyvisualizer.googleapis.com`

When you restrict the `firestore.googleapis.com` service in a perimeter,
the perimeter also restricts the `datastore.googleapis.com` and
`firestorekeyvisualizer.googleapis.com` services.

### Restrict the datastore.googleapis.com service

The `datastore.googleapis.com` service is bundled under the
`firestore.googleapis.com` service. To restrict the
`datastore.googleapis.com`
service, you must restrict the `firestore.googleapis.com` service
as follows:

- When creating a service perimeter using the Google Cloud console, add Cloud Firestore as the restricted service.
- When creating a service perimeter using the Google Cloud CLI, use
  `firestore.googleapis.com` instead of `datastore.googleapis.com`.

      --perimeter-restricted-services=firestore.googleapis.com

### App Engine legacy bundled services for Datastore

[App Engine legacy bundled services for Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/bundled-services-overview)
don't support service perimeters. Protecting the Datastore
service with a service perimeter blocks traffic from
App Engine legacy bundled services. Legacy bundled services include:

- [Java 8 Datastore with App Engine APIs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/datastore)
- [Python 2 NDB client library for Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/ndb/creating-entities)
- [Go 1.11 Datastore with App Engine APIs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go111/datastore)

## Egress protection on import and export operations

Cloud Firestore supports VPC Service Controls but requires additional
configuration to get full egress protection on import and export operations.
You must use the Cloud Firestore service agent to authorize import and
export operations instead of the default App Engine service
account. Use the following instructions to view and configure the authorization
account for import and export operations.
