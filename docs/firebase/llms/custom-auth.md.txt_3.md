You can integrate Firebase Authentication with a custom authentication system by
modifying your authentication server to produce custom signed tokens when a user
successfully signs in. Your app receives this token and uses it to authenticate
with Firebase.

## Before you begin

1. [Add Firebase to your JavaScript project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
2. Get your project's server keys:
   1. Go to the [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) page in your project's settings.
   2. Click *Generate New Private Key* at the bottom of the *Firebase Admin SDK* section of the *Service Accounts* page.
   3. The new service account's public/private key pair is automatically saved on your computer. Copy this file to your authentication server.

## Authenticate with Firebase

1. When users sign in to your app, send their sign-in credentials (for example, their username and password) to your authentication server. Your server checks the credentials and returns a [custom
   token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens) if they are valid.
2. After you receive the custom token from your authentication server, pass it to `signInWithCustomToken` to sign in the user:

   ### Web

   ```javascript
   import { getAuth, signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";

   const auth = getAuth();
   signInWithCustomToken(auth, token)
     .then((userCredential) => {
       // Signed in
       const user = userCredential.user;
       // ...
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       const errorCode = error.code;
       const errorMessage = error.message;
       // ...
     });
   ```

   ### Web

   ```javascript
   firebase.auth().signInWithCustomToken(token)
     .then((userCredential) => {
       // Signed in
       var user = userCredential.user;
       // ...
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       var errorCode = error.code;
       var errorMessage = error.message;
       // ...
     });
   ```

## Next steps

After a user signs in for the first time, a new user account is created and
linked to the credentials---that is, the user name and password, phone
number, or auth provider information---the user signed in with. This new
account is stored as part of your Firebase project, and can be used to identify
a user across every app in your project, regardless of how the user signs in.

- In your apps, the recommended way to know the auth status of your user is to
  set an observer on the `Auth` object. You can then get the user's
  basic profile information from the `User` object. See
  [Manage Users](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users).

- In your Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage
  [Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/user-security), you can
  get the signed-in user's unique user ID from the `auth` variable,
  and use it to control what data a user can access.

You can allow users to sign in to your app using multiple authentication
providers by [linking auth provider credentials to an
existing user account.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/account-linking)

To sign out a user, call [`signOut`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/auth#signout):

### Web

```javascript
import { getAuth, signOut } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();
signOut(auth).then(() => {
  // Sign-out successful.
}).catch((error) => {
  // An error happened.
});
```

### Web

```javascript
firebase.auth().signOut().then(() => {
  // Sign-out successful.
}).catch((error) => {
  // An error happened.
});
```
