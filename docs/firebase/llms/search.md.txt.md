Most apps allow users to search app content. For example, you may want to search
for posts containing a certain word or notes you've written about a specific
topic.

Cloud Firestore doesn't support native indexing or search for
text fields in documents. Additionally, downloading an entire collection to
search for fields client-side isn't practical.

To enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data, use a dedicated
third-party search service. These services provide advanced indexing and search
capabilities far beyond what any simple database query can offer.

Before continuing, research then choose one of the search providers below:

- [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/app-search/)
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
- [Typesense](https://typesense.org/)

## Solution: External search service
