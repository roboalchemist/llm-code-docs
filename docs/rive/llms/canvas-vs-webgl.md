# Canvas vs WebGL

> Choose between `@rive-app/webgl2` and `@rive-app/canvas`, with guidance on performance, package size, and when to use canvas-lite.

### Choose a runtime

For web, start by choosing one of these two packages:

* [`@rive-app/webgl2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rive-app/webgl2)
* [`@rive-app/canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rive-app/canvas)

They share the same high-level API, so switching packages does not require changing how you create a `new Rive({...})` instance. The key differences are the renderer and package size; read the sections below to decide what is best for your use case, and compare package sizes on [Runtime Sizes](/runtimes/runtime-sizes/).

### `@rive-app/webgl2` (recommended)

Use `@rive-app/webgl2` if you want the best rendering quality and performance in most cases.

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @rive-app/webgl2
```

* Uses the [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/renderer) for the best rendering performance
* Supports Rive Renderer-only features (for example, vector feathering)

<Note>
  WebGL has browser limits on concurrent contexts, which can limit how many `new Rive({...})` instances you can run at once. If you display many graphics on the same page, set `useOffscreenRenderer: true` for each Rive object.
  This moves rendering work to a shared offscreen WebGL context instead of creating as many separate contexts on visible canvases, which helps avoid context-limit issues and improves stability when many Rive instances are active.
</Note>

<Note>
  Enabling the draft
  [WEBGL\_shader\_pixel\_local\_storage](https://www.wikihow.tech/Enable-WebGL-Draft-Extensions-in-Google-Chrome)
  extension in Chrome improves rendering performance. Without it, Rive falls
  back to an MSAA-based WebGL2 path. We are actively working with browser
  vendors to make this enabled by default.
</Note>

### `@rive-app/canvas`

Use `@rive-app/canvas` when your graphics are less complex and you want a smaller runtime package.

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @rive-app/canvas
```

* Uses the browser's built-in [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) renderer
* Smaller package size than WebGL renderer options
* Good for simpler vector/raster graphics

### More options after your runtime choice

After choosing `@rive-app/webgl2` or `@rive-app/canvas`, you can use these variants based on packaging needs.

#### `*-light` variants

Some runtimes provide a `-lite` variant for smaller package size.

* Example: [`@rive-app/canvas-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rive-app/canvas-lite)
* Use `-lite` when you want the smallest runtime footprint
* `-lite` variants remove some features (for example, text, layout, audio, and scripting engines)

#### `*-single` variants

Some runtime packages also provide a `-single` variant, which bundles `rive.wasm` directly into the JavaScript file.

* Example: [`@rive-app/canvas-single`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rive-app/canvas-single)
* Use `-single` if you want to avoid a separate WASM network request
* Expect a larger JS bundle compared to the standard package
* ⚠️ Non-`single` variants can cache better across pages, since the WASM is fetched separately

### Deprecated package

`@rive-app/webgl` is deprecated. Prefer `@rive-app/webgl2`.
