[The Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) is a managed container orchestration engine built on top of Kubernetes. LKE enables you to quickly deploy and manage your containerized applications without needing to build (and maintain) your own Kubernetes cluster. All LKE instances are equipped with a fully managed control plane at no additional cost.

First, consult Linode’s managed Kubernetes instructions below. Then, **to set up Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on LKE**, follow our [step-by-step documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/hybrid-cloud/hybrid-cloud-setup/).

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/hybrid-cloud/platform-deployment-options/\#amazon-web-services-aws) Amazon Web Services (AWS)

[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed service to run Kubernetes in the AWS cloud and on-premises data centers which can then be paired with Qdrant’s hybrid cloud. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services.

First, consult AWS’ managed Kubernetes instructions below. Then, **to set up Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on AWS**, follow our [step-by-step documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/hybrid-cloud/hybrid-cloud-setup/).

For a good balance between peformance and cost, we recommend:

- Depending on your cluster resource configuration either general purpose (m6\*, m7\*, or m8\*), memory optimized (r6\*, r7\*, or r8\*) or cpu optimized (c6\*, c7\*, or c8\*) instance types. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud also supports AWS Graviton ARM64 instances.
- At least gp3 EBS volumes for storage

- [Amazon EKS API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)

Your EKS cluster needs the EKS EBS CSI driver or a similar storage driver:

- [Amazon EBS CSI Driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html)

To allow vertical scaling, you need a StorageClass with volume expansion enabled:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1

metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true

```

To allow backups and restores, your EKS cluster needs the CSI snapshot controller:

- [Amazon EBS CSI Snapshot Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/csi-snapshot-controller.html)

And you need to create a VolumeSnapshotClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-snapclass
deletionPolicy: Delete
driver: ebs.csi.aws.com

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud works with any Kubernetes cluster that meets the [standard compliance](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) requirements.

This includes for example:

- [VMWare Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid)
- [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)

Qdrant databases need persistent block storage. Most storage solutions provide a CSI driver that can be used with Kubernetes. See [CSI drivers](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html) for more information.

To allow vertical scaling, you need a StorageClass with volume expansion enabled. See [Volume Expansion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion) for more information.

To allow backups and restores, your CSI driver needs to support volume snapshots cluster needs the CSI VolumeSnapshot controller and class. See [CSI Volume Snapshots](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html) for more information.
