Markdown Content:
The low-level API and the request struct.

Req is composed of:

*   [`Req`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.html) - the high-level API

*   [`Req.Request`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html) - the low-level API and the request struct (you're here!)

*   [`Req.Steps`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Steps.html) - the collection of built-in steps

*   [`Req.Test`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Test.html) - the testing conveniences

The low-level API and the request struct is the foundation of Req's extensibility. Virtually all of the functionality is broken down into individual pieces - steps. Req works by running the request struct through these steps. You can easily reuse or rearrange built-in steps or write new ones.

To make using custom steps by others even easier, they can be packaged up into plugins. See ["Writing Plugins"](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-writing-plugins) section for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most Req users would use it like this:

```
Req.get!("https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req").body["description"]
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

Here is the equivalent using the low-level API:

```
url = "https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req"

req =
  Req.Request.new(method: :get, url: url)
  |> Req.Request.append_request_steps(
    put_user_agent: &Req.Steps.put_user_agent/1,
    # ...
  )
  |> Req.Request.append_response_steps(
    # ...
    decompress_body: &Req.Steps.decompress_body/1,
    decode_body: &Req.Steps.decode_body/1,
    # ...
  )
  |> Req.Request.append_error_steps(
    retry: &Req.Steps.retry/1,
    # ...
  )

{req, resp} = Req.Request.run_request(req)
resp.body["description"]
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

By putting the request pipeline yourself you have precise control of exactly what is running and in what order.

[](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-the-request-struct)The Request Struct
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Public fields are:

*   `:method` - the HTTP request method.

*   `:url` - the HTTP request URL.

*   `:headers` - the HTTP request headers. The header names should be downcased. See also "Headers" section in [`Req`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.html) module documentation.

*   `:body` - the HTTP request body.

Can be one of:

    *   `iodata` - eagerly send request body

    *   `enumerable` - stream request body

*   `:into` - where to send the response body. It can be one of:

    *   `nil` - (default) read the whole response body and store it in the `response.body` field.

    *   `fun` - stream response body using a function. The first argument is a `{:data, data}` tuple containing the chunk of the response body. The second argument is a `{request, response}` tuple. To continue streaming chunks, return `{:cont, {req, resp}}`. To cancel, return `{:halt, {req, resp}}`. For example:

```
into: fn {:data, data}, {req, resp} ->
  IO.puts(data)
  {:cont, {req, resp}}
end
```
    *   `collectable` - stream response body into a [`Collectable.t/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Collectable.html#t:t/0). For example:

`into: File.stream!("path")`
Note that the collectable is only used, if the response status is 200. In other cases, the body is accumulated and processed as usual.

*   `:options` - the options to be used by steps. The exact representation of options is private. Calling `request.options[key]`, `put_in(request.options[key], value)`, and `update_in(request.options[key], fun)` is allowed. [`get_option/3`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#get_option/3) and [`delete_option/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#delete_option/2) are also available for additional ways to manipulate the internal representation.

*   `:halted` - whether the request pipeline is halted. See [`halt/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#halt/2).

*   `:adapter` - a request step that makes the actual HTTP request. Defaults to [`Req.Steps.run_finch/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Steps.html#run_finch/1). See ["Adapter"](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-adapter) section below for more information.

*   `:request_steps` - the list of request steps

*   `:response_steps` - the list of response steps

*   `:error_steps` - the list of error steps

*   `:private` - a map reserved for libraries and frameworks to use. The keys must be atoms. Prefix the keys with the name of your project to avoid any future conflicts. The `req_` prefix is reserved for Req.

[](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-steps)Steps
-------------------------------------------------------------

Req has three types of steps: request, response, and error.

Request steps are used to refine the data that will be sent to the server.

After making the actual HTTP request, we'll either get a HTTP response or an error. The request, along with the response or error, will go through response or error steps, respectively.

Nothing is actually executed until we run the pipeline with [`Req.Request.run_request/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#run_request/1).

### [](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-request-steps)Request Steps

A **request step** ([`request_step/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#t:request_step/0)) is a function that accepts a `request` and returns one of the following:

*   A `request`.

*   A `{request, response_or_error}` tuple. In this case no further request steps are executed and the return value goes through response or error steps.

#### Examples

A request step that adds a `user-agent` header if it's not there already:

```
def put_default_headers(request) do
  Req.Request.put_new_header(request, "user-agent", "req")
end
```

The next is a request step that reads the response from cache if available. Note how, if the cached response is available, this step returns a `{request, response}` tuple so that the request doesn't actually go through:

```
def read_from_cache(request) do
  case ResponseCache.fetch(request) do
    {:ok, response} -> {request, response}
    :error -> request
  end
end
```

### [](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-response-and-error-steps)Response and Error Steps

A response step ([`response_step/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#t:response_step/0)) is a function that accepts a `{request, response}` tuple and returns one of the following:

*   A `{request, response}` tuple.

*   A `{request, exception}` tuple. In that case, no further response steps are executed but the exception goes through error steps.

Similarly, an error step is a function that accepts a `{request, exception}` tuple and returns one of the following:

*   A `{request, exception}` tuple

*   A `{request, response}` tuple. In that case, no further error steps are executed but the response goes through response steps.

Examples:

```
def decode({request, response}) do
  case Req.Response.get_header(response, "content-type") do
    ["application/json" <> _] ->
      {request, update_in(response.body, &Jason.decode!/1)}

    [] ->
      {request, response}
  end
end

def log_error({request, exception}) do
  Logger.error(["#{request.method} #{request.uri}: ", Exception.message(exception)])
  {request, exception}
end
```

### [](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-halting)Halting

Any step can call [`halt/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#halt/2) to halt the pipeline. This prevents any further steps from being invoked.

Examples:

```
def circuit_breaker(request) do
  if CircuitBreaker.open?() do
    Req.Request.halt(request, RuntimeError.exception("circuit breaker is open"))
  else
    request
  end
end
```

[](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-writing-plugins)Writing Plugins
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom steps can be packaged into plugins so that they are even easier to use by others.

Here's an example plugin:

```
defmodule PrintHeaders do
  @doc """
  Prints request and response headers.

  ## Request Options

    * `:print_headers` - if `true`, prints the headers. Defaults to `false`.

  """
  def attach(%Req.Request{} = request, options \\ []) do
    request
    |> Req.Request.register_options([:print_headers])
    |> Req.Request.merge_options(options)
    |> Req.Request.append_request_steps(print_headers: &print_request_headers/1)
    |> Req.Request.prepend_response_steps(print_headers: &print_response_headers/1)
  end

  defp print_request_headers(request) do
    if request.options[:print_headers] do
      print_headers("> ", request.headers)
    end

    request
  end

  defp print_response_headers({request, response}) do
    if request.options[:print_headers] do
      print_headers("< ", response.headers)
    end

    {request, response}
  end

  defp print_headers(prefix, headers) do
    for {name, value} <- headers do
      IO.puts([prefix, name, ": ", value])
    end
  end
end
```

And here is how we can use it:

```
req = Req.new() |> PrintHeaders.attach()

Req.get!(req, url: "https://httpbin.org/json").status
200

Req.get!(req, url: "https://httpbin.org/json", print_headers: true).status
# Outputs:
# > accept-encoding: br, gzip
# > user-agent: req/0.3.0-dev
# < date: Wed, 11 May 2022 11:10:47 GMT
# < content-type: application/json
# ...
200

req = Req.new() |> PrintHeaders.attach(print_headers: true)
Req.get!(req, url: "https://httpbin.org/json").status
# Outputs:
# > accept-encoding: br, gzip
# ...
200
```

As you can see a plugin is simply a module. While this is not enforced, the plugin should follow these conventions:

*   It should export an `attach/1` function that takes and returns the request struct

*   The attach functions mostly just adds steps and it is the steps that do the actual work

*   A user should be able to attach your plugin alongside other plugins. For this reason, plugin functionality should usually only happen on a specific "trigger": on a specific option, on a specific URL scheme or host, etc. This is especially important for plugins that perform authentication; you don't want to accidentally expose a token from service A when a user makes request to service B.

*   If your plugin supports custom options, register them with [`register_options/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#register_options/2)

*   Sometimes it is useful to pass options when attaching the plugin. For that, export an `attach/2` function and call [`merge_options/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#merge_options/2). Remember to first register options before merging!

[](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-adapter)Adapter
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the ["Request Steps"](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-request-steps) section, a request step besides returning the request, might also return `{request, response}` or `{request, exception}`, thus invoking either response or error steps next. This is exactly how Req makes the underlying HTTP call, by invoking a request step that follows this contract.

The default adapter is using Finch via the [`Req.Steps.run_finch/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Steps.html#run_finch/1) step.

Here is a mock adapter that always returns a successful response:

```
adapter = fn request ->
  response = %Req.Response{status: 200, body: "it works!"}
  {request, response}
end

Req.request!(url: "http://example", adapter: adapter).body
#=> "it works!"
```

Here is another one that uses the [`Req.Response.json/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Response.html#json/2) function to conveniently return a JSON response:

```
adapter = fn request ->
  response = Req.Response.json(%{hello: 42})
  {request, response}
end

resp = Req.request!(url: "http://example", adapter: adapter)
resp.headers
#=> [{"content-type", "application/json"}]
resp.body
#=> %{"hello" => 42}
```

And here is a naive Hackney-based adapter:

```
hackney = fn request ->
  case :hackney.request(
         request.method,
         URI.to_string(request.url),
         request.headers,
         request.body,
         [:with_body]
       ) do
    {:ok, status, headers, body} ->
      headers = for {name, value} <- headers, do: {String.downcase(name, :ascii), value}
      response = %Req.Response{status: status, headers: headers, body: body}
      {request, response}

    {:error, reason} ->
      {request, RuntimeError.exception(inspect(reason))}
  end
end

Req.get!("https://api.github.com/repos/wojtekmach/req", adapter: hackney).body["description"]
#=> "Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir."
```

when response_or_exception: [Req.Response.t](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Response.html#t:t/0)() | [Exception.t](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Exception.html#t:t/0)()

Halts the request pipeline preventing any further steps from executing.

This function returns an updated request and the response or exception that caused the halt. It's perfect when used in a request step to stop the pipeline.

See the ["Halting"](https://hexdocs.pm/req/Req.Request.html#module-halting) section in the module documentation for more information.

Registers options to be used by a custom steps.

Req ensures that all used options were previously registered which helps finding accidentally mistyped option names. If you're adding custom steps that are accepting options, call this function to register them.

```
iex> Req.request!(urll: "https://httpbin.org")
** (ArgumentError) unknown option :urll. Did you mean :url?

iex> Req.new(bas_url: "https://httpbin.org")
** (ArgumentError) unknown option :bas_url. Did you mean :base_url?

req =
  Req.new(base_url: "https://httpbin.org")
  |> Req.Request.register_options([:foo])

Req.get!(req, url: "/status/201", foo: :bar).status
#=> 201

Updates private `key` with the given function.

If `key` is present in request private map then the existing value is passed to `fun` and its result is used as the updated value of `key`. If `key` is not present, `default` is inserted as the value of `key`. The default value will not be passed through the update function.
