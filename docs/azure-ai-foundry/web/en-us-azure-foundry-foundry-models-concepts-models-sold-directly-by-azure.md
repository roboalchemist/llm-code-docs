 Caution

We don't recommend using preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

 Important

gpt-5.1 reasoning_effort defaults to none. When upgrading from previous reasoning models to gpt-5.1, keep in mind that you may need to update your code to explicitly pass a reasoning_effort level if you want reasoning to occur.

gpt-5.1-chat adds built-in reasoning capabilities. Like other reasoning models it does not support parameters like temperature. If you upgrade from using gpt-5-chat (which is not a reasoning model) to gpt-5.1-chat make sure you remove any custom parameters like temperature from your code which are not supported by reasoning models.

gpt-5.1-codex-max adds support for setting reasoning_effort to xhigh. Reasoning effort none is not supported with gpt-5.1-codex-max.

 Note

1 gpt-5-chat version 2025-10-03 introduces a significant enhancement focused on emotional intelligence and mental health capabilities. This upgrade integrates specialized datasets and refined response strategies to improve the model's ability to:

Understand and interpret emotional context more accurately, enabling nuanced and empathetic interactions.
Provide supportive, responsible responses in conversations related to mental health, ensuring sensitivity and adherence to best practices.

These improvements aim to make GPT-5-chat more context-aware, human-centric, and reliable in scenarios where emotional tone and well-being considerations are critical.

 Caution

We don't recommend using preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

 Important

A known issue is affecting all GPT 4.1 series models. Large tool or function call definitions that exceed 300,000 tokens will result in failures, even though the 1 million token context limit of the models wasn't reached.

The errors can vary based on API call and underlying payload characteristics.

Here are the error messages for the Chat Completions API:

Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "This model's maximum context length is 300000 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 350564 tokens (100 in the messages, 350464 in the functions). Please reduce the length of the messages or functions.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}}

Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "Invalid 'tools[0].function.description': string too long. Expected a string with maximum length 1048576, but got a string with length 2778531 instead.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'tools[0].function.description', 'code': 'string_above_max_length'}}

Here's the error message for the Responses API:

Error code: 500 - {'error': {'message': 'The server had an error processing your request. Sorry about that! You can retry your request, or contact us through an Azure support request at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2213926 if you keep seeing this error. (Please include the request ID d2008353-291d-428f-adc1-defb5d9fb109 in your email.)', 'type': 'server_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}}

 Caution

We don't recommend that you use preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

Embeddings

text-embedding-3-large is the latest and most capable embedding model. You can't upgrade between embeddings models. To move from using text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-large, you need to generate new embeddings.

text-embedding-3-large
text-embedding-3-small
text-embedding-ada-002

OpenAI reports that testing shows that both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the MIRACL benchmark. They still maintain performance for English tasks with the MTEB benchmark.

Expand table
Evaluation benchmark	text-embedding-ada-002	text-embedding-3-small	text-embedding-3-large
MIRACL average	31.4	44.0	54.9
MTEB average	61.0	62.3	64.6

The third generation embeddings models support reducing the size of the embedding via a new dimensions parameter. Typically, larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. When you can adjust the number of dimensions, you gain more control over overall cost and performance. The dimensions parameter isn't supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library. To take advantage of this parameter, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version: pip install openai --upgrade.

OpenAI's MTEB benchmark testing found that even when the third generation model's dimensions are reduced to less than the 1,536 dimensions of text-embeddings-ada-002, performance remains slightly better.

Image generation models

The image generation models generate images from text prompts that the user provides. GPT-image-1 series models are in limited access preview. DALL-E 3 is generally available for use with the REST APIs. DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 with client SDKs are in preview.

Registration is required to access gpt-image-1, gpt-image-1-mini, or gpt-image-1.5. Access is granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria. Customers who have access to other limited access models still need to request access for this model.

To request access, fill out an application form: Apply for GPT-image-1 access; Apply for GPT-image-1.5 access. When access is granted, you need to create a deployment for the model.

Audio models

Audio models in Azure OpenAI are available via the realtime, completions, and audio APIs.

GPT-4o audio models

The GPT-4o audio models are part of the GPT-4o model family and support either low-latency, speech in, speech out conversational interactions or audio generation.

 Caution

We don't recommend using preview models in production. We'll upgrade all deployments of preview models to either future preview versions or to the latest stable, generally available version. Models that are designated preview don't follow the standard Azure OpenAI model lifecycle.

Models by deployment type

Azure OpenAI provides customers with choices on the hosting structure that fits their business and usage patterns. The service offers two main types of deployment:

Standard: Has a global deployment option, routing traffic globally to provide higher throughput.
Provisioned: Also has a global deployment option, allowing customers to purchase and deploy provisioned throughput units across Azure global infrastructure.

All deployments can perform the exact same inference operations, but the billing, scale, and performance are substantially different. To learn more about Azure OpenAI deployment types, see our Deployment types guide.
