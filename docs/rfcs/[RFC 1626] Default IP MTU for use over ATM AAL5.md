# Acknowledgements

While all members of the IETF's IP over ATM Working Group have been
helpful, Vern Schryver, Rob Warnock, Craig Partridge, Subbu
Subramaniam, and Bryan Lyles have been especially helpful to the
author in analysing the host and routing implications of the default
IP MTU value.  Similarly, Dan Grossman provided significant review
and help in ensuring alignment of this text with the related work in
the ATM Forum and ITU.
