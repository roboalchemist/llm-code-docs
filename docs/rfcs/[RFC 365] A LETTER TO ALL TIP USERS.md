# 1. PROTOCOL TO LOGIN will be removed.  It has been replaced by

LOGIN.

# 2. LOGIN will take a parameter, the Host number, so it will not

be necessary to give both HOST and LOGIN commands.

Some things which we are presently doing.
----------------------------------------

RFC # 365                                                  July 11, 1972

# 1. When a terminal hangs up, any captured devices will be given

back.
2.  Output to high speed devices will be possible.

# 3. Data sets will automatically be hung up when the caller

disconnects even though the caller never "logged in".
4.  202C modems will work.
5.  Major improvements on the magnetic tape option.
6.  Trying to find the "R half" of the "R T CLOSED" message.

# 7. We have received numerous complaints that the TIP once in a

while loses an allocate.  We will fix this or else demonstrate
it's not the TIP's fault.

Some things we are thinking about.
---------------------------------

1.  Adding a lower case capability for Model 33 Teletypes.

# 2. Adding a mechanism so the TIP's status or a device's status

(e.g., its device number) can be obtained by the user.

Each of the above mentioned changes will be preceded by
notification via the NEWS and we plan to issue frequent updates to the
TIP User's Guide from now on.

We are trying hard to improve the TIP.  If you've got a
suggestion (especially if it doesn't take any memory), let me hear
from you.
