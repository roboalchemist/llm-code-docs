Using Other Mail Systems:

It is not possible to give a generalized scenario for use with all
local mail systems.

The general procedure, to be applied to the local mail system, is
to supply:

"NIC" as the host name, and

Sender's NIC ident / Addressee's NIC ident as user name

See RFC543, NIC 17777, for more detail on Network Journal.
