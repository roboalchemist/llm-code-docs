3126    Pinkas          Sep 2001        Electronic Signature Formats
for long term electronic
signatures

This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can
remain valid over long periods.  This includes evidence as to its
validity even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny
(i.e., repudiates the validity of the signature).  This memo provides
information for the Internet community.

3125    Ross            Sep 2001        Electronic Signature Policies

This document defines signature policies for electronic signatures.  A
signature policy is a set of rules for the creation and validation of an
electronic signature, under which the validity of signature can be
determined.  A given legal/contractual context may recognize a
particular signature policy as meeting its requirements.  This memo
defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

# 3124. Balakrishnan    Jun 2001        The Congestion Manager

This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-system
module that enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent streams from a
sender destined to the same receiver and sharing the same congestion
properties to perform proper congestion avoidance and control, and
allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion.  [STANDARDS

3123    Koch            Jun 2001        A DNS RR Type for Lists of
Address Prefixes (APL RR)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is primarily used to translate domain names
into IPv4 addresses using A RRs (Resource Records).  Several approaches
exist to describe networks or address ranges.  This document specifies a
new DNS RR type "APL" for address prefix lists.  This memo defines an
Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

3122    Conta           Jun 2001        Extensions to IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery for Inverse
Discovery Specification

This memo describes extensions to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery that allow
a node to determine and advertise an IPv6 address corresponding to a
given link-layer address.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

Document Type Definitions, XML Schemas, Namespaces, Stylesheets, and
other documents).  This memo provides information for the Internet
community.

3120    Best            Jun 2001        A URN Namespace for XML.org

This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that is
engineered by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
Information Standards (OASIS) for naming persistent resources stored in
the XML.org repository (such as XML (Extensible Markup Language)
Document Type Definitions, XML Schemas, Namespaces, Stylesheets, and
other documents).  This memo provides information for the Internet

# 3119. Finlayson       Jun 2001        A More Loss-Tolerant RTP

Payload Format for MP3 Audio

This document describes a RTP (Real-Time Protocol) payload format for
transporting MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) 1 or 2, layer III audio
(commonly known as "MP3").  This format is an alternative to that
described in RFC 2250, and performs better if there is packet loss.

Modifications for IPv6

This document defines the Service Location Protocol Version 2's (SLPv2)
use over IPv6 networks.  Since this protocol relies on UDP and TCP, the
changes to support its use over IPv6 are minor.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

# 3106. Eastlake        Apr 2001        ECML v1.1: Field

Specifications for E-Commerce

Customers are frequently required to enter substantial amounts of
information at an Internet merchant site in order to complete a purchase
or other transaction, especially the first time they go there.  A
standard set of information fields is defined as the first version of an
Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) so that this task can be
more easily automated, for example by wallet software that could fill in
fields.  Even for the manual data entry case, customers will be less
confused by varying merchant sites if a substantial number adopt these
standard fields.  In addition, some fields are defined for merchant to
consumer communication.  This memo provides information for the Internet
community.

3105    Kempf           Oct 2001        Finding an RSIP Server with
SLP

This document contains an SLP service type template that describes the
advertisements made by RSIP servers for their services.  This memo
defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

# 3104. Montenegro      Oct 2001        RSIP Support for End-to-end

IPsec

This document proposes mechanisms that enable Realm Specific IP (RSIP)
to handle end-to-end IPsec (IP Security).  This memo defines an
Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

# 3103. Borella         Oct 2001        Realm Specific IP: Protocol

Specification

This document presents a protocol with which to implement Realm Specific
IP (RSIP).  The protocol defined herein allows negotiation of resources
between an RSIP host and gateway, so that the host can lease some of the
gateway's addressing parameters in order to establish a global network
presence.  This protocol is designed to operate on the application layer
and to use its own TCP or UDP port.  In particular, the protocol allows
a gateway to allocate addressing and control parameters to a host such
that a flow policy can be enforced at the gateway.  This memo defines an
Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

# 3102. Borella         Oct 2001        Realm Specific IP: Framework

This document examines the general framework of Realm Specific IP
(RSIP).  RSIP is intended as a alternative to NAT in which the end-to-
end integrity of packets is maintained.  We focus on implementation
issues, deployment scenarios, and interaction with other layer-three
protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
community.

3101    Murphy          Jan 2003        The OSPF Not-So-Stubby Area
(NSSA) Option

This memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
area that is somewhat humorously referred to as a "not-so-stubby" area
(or NSSA).  NSSAs are similar to the existing OSPF stub area
configuration option but have the additional capability of importing AS
external routes in a limited fashion.

The OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.  The functional
differences between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in Appendix F.
All differences, while expanding capability, are backward-compatible in
nature.  Implementations of this memo and of RFC 1587 will interoperate.
