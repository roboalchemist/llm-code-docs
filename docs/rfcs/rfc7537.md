# Abstract

RFCs 4379 and 6424 created name spaces for Multi-Protocol Label
Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  However, those RFCs
did not create the corresponding IANA registries for Downstream
Mapping object Flags (DS Flags), Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and
Interface and Label Stack Address Types.

There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
name spaces.  This document updates RFCs 4379 and 6424 in that it
creates IANA registries for that purpose.

However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries
for DS Flags, Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label
Stack Address Types.

There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
name spaces.  In particular, [ENTROPY-LSP-PING] and [LSP-PING-LAG]
request new DS Flags and Multipath Type allocations.

This document updates [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] in that it creates IANA
registries for that purpose.

Note that "DS Flags" and "Multipath Type" are fields included in two
TLVs defined in the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry: Downstream
Mapping (DEPRECATED) (value 2) and Downstream Detailed Mapping (value
20).  Modification to either registry will affect both TLVs.

# 2. IANA Considerations

Per this document, IANA has created new registries within the "Multi-
Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping
Parameters" [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING] registry to maintain DS Flags,
Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label Stack Address
Types fields.  The registry names and initial values are described in
the immediate subsections that follow.

## 2.1. DS Flags

[RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping (DSMAP) TLV, which has Type
2 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

[RFC6424] defines the Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV, which
has Type 20 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

DSMAP has been deprecated by DDMAP, but both TLVs share a field: DS
Flags.

IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "DS Flags".

The registration policy for this registry is Standards Action
[RFC5226].

IANA has made the following initial assignments:

Registry Name: DS Flags

Bit number Name                                         Reference
---------- ----------------------------------------     ---------
7    N: Treat as a Non-IP Packet                   RFC 4379
6    I: Interface and Label Stack Object Request   RFC 4379
5-0    Unassigned

## 2.2. Multipath Types

IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Multipath
Types".

The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are as follows:

0-250    Standards Action
251-254    Experimental Use
255    Standards Action

IANA has made the following initial assignments:

Registry Name: Multipath Types

Value      Meaning                                  Reference

## 2.3. Pad Type

IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Pad Types".

# 3. Security Considerations

This document simply creates IANA registries for code points defined
in [RFC4379] and [RFC6424].  Thus, there are no new security
concerns.
