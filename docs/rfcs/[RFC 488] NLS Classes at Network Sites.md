title: "NLS Classes at Network Sites"
date: March 1973

1.  We have found the optimum class size to be six, with an upper
limit of ten.

2.  We need a room large enough to hold the number of students, with
a teletype-type terminal and appropriate connections for each
student, a flip-chart stand and a large blackboard.

Class Outline - TNLS Course

We have held NLS classes approximately a dozen times.  In all, nearly a
hundred people have attended these classes.  While we feel that the
training has been helpful, we also recognize that teaching the class at
SRI-ARC tends to overlook special problems of working through the
Network and special interests of other sites.

The people who conduct the class are experienced in working out
procedures for using NLS in work environments.  Therefore, please accept
the outline below as a flexible one, one that can be tailored to fit
particular applications or needs.
