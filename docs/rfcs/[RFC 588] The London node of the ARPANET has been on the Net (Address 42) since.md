... A typical scenario is attached.

The intention is to keep the PDP-9/360 available as a HOST between
19.00 and 09.00 local time, as well as a number of periods during the
day (the local time is 8 or 9 hours ahead of California, and 5 hours
ahead of the East Coast).  There will be no operator available on the
PDP-9, although during the day and at least the early part of the
evening, there will be users in the computer room who will give
assistance where necessary.  The "operator's console" is a Teletype,
so any messages sent during the night will be read in the morning,
and we will try to send replies to all queries (if you tell us where
to reply to Network mail for our site may be send to KRISTEIN@ISI, or
to myself (IDENT=AVS) at the NIC.  Connection problems should be
referred to Peter Higginson (NIC ident = PLH).
