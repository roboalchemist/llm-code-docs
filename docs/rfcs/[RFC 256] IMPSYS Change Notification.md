1.  A Host will be prevented from sending any messages
into the Network for between 40 seconds and a
minute and a quarter after he comes alive (this
has been changed from between 30 seconds and a
minute).

2.  The IMP has been given the ability to test its Host
interfaces under control of the NCC.  This will help
us isolate the trouble when the IMP Host communication
path is faulty.
