# Abstract

In RFC 9280, responsibility for the RFC Series moved to the RFC
Series Working Group and the RFC Series Approval Board.  It is no
longer the responsibility of the RFC Editor, and the role of the IAB
in the RFC Series is altered.  Accordingly, in Section 2.1 of RFC
2026, the sentence "RFC publication is the direct responsibility of
the RFC Editor, under the general direction of the IAB" is deleted.
