1. CONJUNCTION

2. NEGATION

3. COMPLEX QUANTIFICATION

4. SOPHISTICATED PRONOUN REFERENCE

5. QUESTIONS NOT (!!) INVOLVING WEATHER,E.G.,

'WHAT DAY WAS YESTERDAY?'

'WHAT CITIES ARE IN MASSACHUSETTS?'

'IT' IS NOT WORKING TOO WELL THESE DAYS.  IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE, TRY
SOMETHING WITHOU 'IT' THAT IS KNOWN TO WORK.  'WHAT WAS THE
TEMPERATURE IN BOSTON YESTERDAY?' IS BETTER THAN MOST - WE ARE QUITE
APT TO TEST THAT PHRASE.

THE SYSTEM DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WORD 'SNOW'.  THERE IS NO WAY TO
LIST ITS VOCABULARY.  HOWEVER, THE SENTENCES IN SENTENCES.TXT SHOULD
GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF THE WORDS THE SYSTEM UNDESTANDS.

THE AVERAGE TIME FOR UNDERSTANDING AND ANSWERING A QUESTION IS ABOUT
1 MINUTE.  IF THE SYSTEM TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN THIS YOU SHOULD GET
SUSPICIOUS.  IF YOU ASK A VERY BIG QUESTION, LIKE 'WHAT WAS THE
HOTTEST PLACE IN CANADA?', THE LISP SYSTEM MAY GO INTO A GC (GARBAGE
COLLENTION) LOOP.  RESTARTING ALL OVER (WITH ^D) WILL BE OK, BUT THE
DATACOMPUTER MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RECOVER - IT DOESN'T (YET)
NOTICE THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE WRONG UNTIL IT ASKS FOR MORE INPUT.

DATA

THE DATA FROM OCT 1 THRU 16 IS ALMOST COMPLETE.  BETWEEN OCT 17 TO 25
IT IS FREQUENTLY SKETCHY.  WE PLAN TO RELOAD EVERYTHING SOMETIME
USING SEPTEMBER'S DATA, SO WE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE MONTH OF CLEAN
DATA.  NOTE: THIS DATA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY SUMMARIZED - IT IS
PROBABLY NOT USEFUL FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN WEATHER.

THE OCTOBER DATA IS ABOUT 2400 PAGES OF REAL DATA, PLUS ABOUT 200
MORE FOR THE INVERSION.  THERE ARE ABOUT 4000 CITIES.  THE CITY NAMES
HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO THE LOCAL CITY WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  I.E. 'BOSTON'
IS 'BOSTON' NOT 'LOGAN'.

'ALASKA' GOT LOST SOMEHOW.  DON'T BOTHER ASKING FOR IT.

SAMPLE DATALANGUAGE

THESE EXAMPLES ON THIS AND THE FOLLOWING PAGES WORK ON A VERY OLD
VERSION OF THE DATACOMPUTER.  THEY ARE NOT THE FINAL FORM OF
DATALANGUAGE THAT SHOULD BA AVAILABLE SOON.

THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO 'WEATHER' GENERATED TWO REQUESTS TO THE
DATACOMPUTER.  THE FIRST USES THE CHECK PORT TO VERIFY THAT 'BOSTON'
IS A VALID CITY NAME, AND THE SECOND USES THE ANSWER PORT TO RETRIEVE
THE DATA.  THE ACTUAL REQUESTS THAT ARE SENT TO THE DATACOMPUTER DO
NOT HAVE THE CARRIAGE RETURNS THAT MAKE THEM READABLE - THEY ARE SENT
AS ONE VERY LONG LINE.  THE '^Z' IS THE END OF DATA MARKER.

TO WEATHER

HAS IT RAINED IN BOSTON RECENTLY?

TO THE DATACOMPUTER:

OR CHECK.PLACE,STATION WITH CITY EQ 'BOSTON'
PLACE.LP1 = '('
PLACE.CITY = STATION,CITY
PLACE.RP1 = ')'
PLACE.BSN = STATION.BSN
PLACE.LP2 = '('
PLACE.REGION = STATION.REGION
PLACE.RP2 = ')'
END

FROM THE DATACOMPUTER:

(BOSTON                  )725090(MASSACHUSETTS            )
^Z

TO THE DATACOMPUTER:

FOR THE STATION WITH (REGION EQ 'MASSACHUSETTS' AND CITY EQ 'BOSTON')
FOR ANSWER.ANS OBSERVATION WITH GE '273' AND DATE LE '300'
ANS.LP1 = '('
ANS.CITY = STATION.CITY
ANS.RP1 =')'
ANS.DATE = OBSERVATION.DATE
ANS.LP2 = ')'
ANS.DATA = PRECIP
ANS.DATA1 = '     '
ANS.DATA2 = '     '
ANS.RP2 = ')'
END
END

AND BACK FROM THE DATACOMPUTER:

(BOSTON            )293(          )
(BOSTON            )294(    0     )
(BOSTON            )295(          )
(BOSTON            )296(   10     )
(BOSTON            )297(    0     )
(BOSTON            )298(    0     )
(BOSTON            )299(    0     )
(BOSTON            )300(          )
^Z

AND THE FINAL ANSWER FROM WEATHER WAS 'YES.'
