Where first item is month, day, year, hour, minute and then is a list of
host numbers, code, response time in tenths of second.  The list ends
with a minus 1, and we close the connections right after sending data
(The service is designed so that both human users and programs can use
the data ).  You can of course log into dmcg and use our NETWRK
subsystem which has commands for displaying the survey data in many
formats (Ref. RFC 308, NIC 9259).  We are also recording this data on
the DATACOMPUTER (CCA).  Your comments and suggestions will be
appreciated.

Thank You
