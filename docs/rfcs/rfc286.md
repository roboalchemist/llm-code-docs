title: "Network Library Information System"
date: December 1971

1.  One or more organizations may have a Library Retrieval
System that they would like to share with Georgetown.

2.  Since there probably are needs for such a system at most
organizations, and since it would be highly beneficial
for one organization to be able to query other library
holdings as well, and subsequently arrange for inter-
library loans, the ARPA community might undertake to
design a Network Library Information System.

If sufficient interest in such a system exists, a working group
could be set up to establish the necessary protocols and iron out
details of the system.

It is probable that the NIC could provide valuable inputs to such
an undertaking and perhaps would serve as a focal point for the system
design and operation.

Please contact me if either:

1.  You have, or know of a Library Retrieval System that
can be shared with Georgetown University,

2.  Your organization is interested in participating in a
Network Library Retrieval System, or

3.  You are interested in participating in designing such a
system.
