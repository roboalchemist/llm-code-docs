# 1. Introduction

This document describes a standard definition of MIME types
associated with MP4 files and the guidelines for using them.

MPEG-4 (ISO/IEC 14496) is a standard designed for the representation
and delivery of multimedia information over a variety of transport
protocols [1].  It includes interactive scene management and visual
and audio representations, as well as system functionality like
multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework
[2].

The historical approach for MPEG data has been to declare it under
"video", and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  In
addition, some MIME types are defined under "audio" and "application"
for the streams not containing visual presentation.

Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known as version 2)
introduced a standard file type, called MP4 files, for encapsulating
ISO/IEC 14496 data.  This is now separately specified as the MP4 file
format [4], which in turn is based on the ISO base media file format
[3].  A separate specification [5] covers the storage of Advanced
Video Coding (AVC) (also known as H.264) [6] material in files based
on the ISO base media file format.  The MP4 file type can be used in
a number of ways; perhaps the most important of these is its use as
an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, as a content-download
format, and as the format read by streaming media servers.

These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a
standard MIME type for serving these files (e.g., over HTTP).

The ISO/IEC 14496 standard is broad, and therefore the type of data
that may be in such a file can vary.  In brief, simple compressed
video and audio (using a number of different compression algorithms)
can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data about the
presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside the
file and so on.  Different top-level MIME types are used to identify
the type of the contents in the file.

# 2. Selection of MIME Types for MP4 Files

The MIME types to be assigned to MP4 files are selected according to
the contents.  Basic guidelines for selecting MIME types are as
follows:

a) if the file contains neither visual nor audio presentations, but
only, for example, MPEG-J or MPEG-7, use application/mp4;

b) for all other files, including those that have MPEG-J, etc., in
addition to video or audio streams, video/mp4 should be used;
however:

c) for files with audio but no visual aspect, including those that
have MPEG-J, etc., in addition to audio streams, audio/mp4 may be
used.

In any case, these indicate files conforming to the "MP4"
specification, ISO/IEC 14496-1:2000, systems file format.

# 3. IANA Considerations

This section describes the MIME types and names to be used with
various MPEG-4 contents.  Sections from 4.1 to 4.5 register five new
MIME types with the IANA.

implementations exist within the ISO/IEC 14496 community, and that
community has reference software for reading and writing the file
format.

# 4. Security Considerations

It is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams (Audio, Video,
and Systems) in the MP4 file to overload the receiver/decoder's
buffers.  This might compromise the functionality of the receiver or
even crash it.  This is especially true for end-to-end systems like
MPEG, where the buffer models are precisely defined.

An MP4 file supports the storage of stream types, including commands
that are executed on the terminal such as OD command and BIFS
commands, and programmatic content such as MPEG-J (Java(TM) Byte
Code) and ECMASCRIPT.  It is possible to use one or more of the above
in a manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash the receiver or
temporarily make it unavailable.

Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of the sender and
the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant malignant
MP4 files.

A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems MP4 files
containing MPEG-J contents that comprises Java(TM) classes and
objects.  MPEG-J defines a set of Java(TM) APIs and a secure
execution model.  MPEG-J content can call this set of APIs and
Java(TM) methods from a set of Java packages supported in the
receiver within the defined security model.  According to this
security model, downloaded byte code is forbidden to load libraries,
to define native methods, to start programs, to read or write files,
or to read system properties.
