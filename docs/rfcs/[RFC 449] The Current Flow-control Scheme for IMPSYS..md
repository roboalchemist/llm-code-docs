Host and an IMP, December 1972 Revision, section 3, pp. 17-35.

Reference 2 is particularly important reading for NCP programmers -
things have recently changed somewhat.

The inter-IMP acknowledgement mechanism, described in the last
section of Vint's RFC 442, is also described in reference 1 and an
almost identical mechanism is described in Appendix F of reference 2.
The acknowledgement is of only intellectual interest to most Hosts as it
is transparent to network users.  However, the description in reference
2 is of vital interest to so-called Very Distant Hosts.
