1974.  THERE MAY BE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THESE RESULTS AND THOSE
FROM SURVEYS MADE AT OTHER SITES.

(1) NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT TO THESE SITES ALL FAILED DUE TO
THE SITES' BEING DOWN TO THE NETWORK.

(2) THESE ARE THE SITES WHOSE OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT ACCORDING
TO ALL PROTOCOLS AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.

(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS THAT APPEAR HERE AS NEW-
PROTOCOL SERVERS ON SOCKET 1 ARE ACTUALLY SERVERS WHICH ATTEMPT
TO COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH OLD- AND NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNETS
ACCORDING TO WHAT CONTROL SEQUENCES ARE RECEIVED.
