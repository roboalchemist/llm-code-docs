# 1. Introduction

Section 11.5 of [RFC6455] sets up a WebSocket Subprotocol Name
Registry at IANA and directs IANA to use First Come First Serve
registration procedures as set out in [RFC5226].  The reuse of this
registry by other protocols has indicated that some clarification of
the instructions to IANA would be useful.

# 2. Clarified Instructions

The tokens registered in the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry
created by Section 11.5 of RFC 6455 are matched using case-sensitive
string match.  IANA is, however, instructed to decline registrations
in the registry which differ only as to case, in order to minimize
potential confusion among different registered versions.  For other
useful advice on avoiding collision, registrants are encouraged to
consult the non-normative Section 1.9 of RFC 6455.

# 3. Security Considerations

This document describes an update to registry policy, not a protocol.

# 4. IANA Considerations

This document is, in its entirety, a clarification of the registry
policy for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  As part of this
clarification, IANA has listed both this document and RFC 6455 as
references for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  In addition,
IANA has included the following note under the registry's
Registration Procedures: "Please see Section 2 of RFC 7936, which
clarifies that registrations which differ from existing registrations
only by case will be refused."
