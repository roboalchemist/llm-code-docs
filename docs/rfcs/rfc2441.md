Against them, on the Internet side, there was a very small group of
young Davids.  The OSI camp had its prestige, but we had working
systems, a large community of devotees, and properly documented
protocols that allowed integration of the TCP/IP suite into every
UNIX system, such as in every SUN workstation.

Against the strict laws in Europe, their universities developed an
underground of Internet connections.  One could get from California
to the university in Rome, for example, for example, by going first
over the Internet across the US to the east coast, then to the UK,
then using some private lines to France, then to CERN in Switzerland,
and from there to Rome - while breaking the laws of all those
countries with every packet.

Meanwhile, in the states, Academia, and the research communities,
never knew about GOSIP.

The Internet, against all the conventional wisdom, grew without
anyone being in charge, without central control, and without any
central planning.

The war between the ISO and the TCP/IP camps never took place.  One
camp turned out to be a no show.

What made it all possible was the wise selection of what to
standardize and what not to, and the high quality of the standards in
a series of living documents.

Our foundation and infrastructure of standards was the secret weapon
that won the war.  Jon created it, using the RFC mechanism initiated
by Steve Crocker.  It was Jon who immediately realized their
importance, and the need for someone to act as the curator, and
volunteered.

The lightning speed with which Microsoft joined the Internet was not
possible without the quality of the existing standards that were so
well documented.

During the transition from ARPA, through the NSF, to the commercial
world there was a point in which the trivial funding required for the
smooth operation of editing and distributing the RFCs was in doubt.
At that time the prospect of not having funds to run this operation
was very real.  Finally the problem was solved and the process
suffered no interruption.

What most of the involved agencies and managers did not know is that
there was never a danger of any interruption.  Jon would have done it
even with no external funding.  If they did not pay him to do it, he
would have paid them to let him do it.  For him it was not a job, it
was labor of love.

Jon never joined the PowerPoint generation.  Jon always believed that
the content was the only thing that matters.  Hand written slides
were good enough.  Color and logos were distractions, a necessary
evil in certain occasions, not the style of choice.

Jon defined quality by counting interesting ideas, not points per
inch.

When fancy formatting creeped into the Internet community, Jon
resisted the temptation to allow fancy formats for RFCs.  Instead, he
insisted on them being in ASCII, easy to e-mail, guaranteed to be
readable anywhere in the world.  The instant availability and
usability of RFCs was much more important to him than how fancy they
looked.

The Internet was not just a job for Jon.  It was his hobby and his
mission in life.

We will miss Jon, who was for the Internet its corporate memory, its
corporate style, and its corporate taste.

I will miss him even more as a colleague and a friend.

In Summary:

* Jon was pleasant, fun/funny, and unselfish.
He was full of  mischief, adventure, humor, and caring.
He was devoted to his work, to the Internet, and to the
people who worked with him.

* It was great working together and having neighboring
offices for 16 years.

* Jon set the standards for the Internet standards.

* Jon was the Internet's corporate memory, the corporate taste,
and the corporate style.

* Jon was an authority without bureaucracy.

* Jon was an Internet Missionary.

* Jon was a great friend that I will miss for ever.
