try to help.

Airline reservations can best be handled by your local airline
office.  Jim suggested that I warn Ozark (the local service) of the
upcoming surge of non-student, non-standby passengers in the hopes of
getting better service. As Ozark is currently enjoying a pilot
strike, I have been unable to do this.  Hopefully, it will be over in
a few days, but if it isn't, I recommend that you get the closest
flight you can and reserve a car for the rest of the way. This
probably will be resolved in time to avoid any hassle, but I thought
you would like to know about it just in case.

So that I will have a rough idea how much space we will need, let me
know, if possible, if you plan to attend.

I can usually be reached by calling (217)333-9354, preferably in the
afternoon.  I will be gone July 2-6, so during that period, Nancy
Freece at (217)333-7161 will take your messages.  Network mail will
be read earliest (also during JULY 2-6) if sent to user BUNCH at site
USC-ISI.  My mailing address is:
