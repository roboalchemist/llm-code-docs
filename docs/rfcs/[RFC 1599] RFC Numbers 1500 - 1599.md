# 1521. Borenstein   Sep 93   MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail

Extensions) Part One:
Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing
the Format of Internet Message Bodies

This document redefines the format of message bodies to allow multi-part
textual and non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged
without loss of information.  This is based on earlier work documented
in RFC 934 and STD 11, RFC 1049, but extends and revises that work.

# 1520. Rekhter      Sep 93    Exchanging Routing Information Across

Provider Boundaries in the CIDR
Environment

The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it describes various
alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information across
domain boundaries, where one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and
another is not.  Second, it addresses the implications of running CIDR-
capable inter-domain routing protocols (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on intra-
domain routing.  This memo provides information for the Internet
community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.

# 1519. Fuller      Sep 93     Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR):

an Address Assignment and Aggregation
Strategy

This memo discusses strategies for address assignment of the existing IP
address space with a view to conserve the address space and stem the
explosive growth of routing tables in default-route-free routers.

# 1518. Rekhter    Sep 93     An Architecture for IP Address

Allocation with CIDR

This paper provides an architecture and a plan for allocating IP
addresses in the Internet. This architecture and the plan are intended
to play an important role in steering the Internet towards the Address
Assignment and Aggregating Strategy. [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1517. IESG       Sep 93     Applicability Statement for the

Implementation of Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) defines a mechanism to slow the
growth of routing tables and reduce the need to allocate new IP network
numbers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1516. McMaster    Sep 93    Definitions of Managed Objects

for IEEE 802.3 Repeater Devices

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 10 Mb/second
baseband repeaters, sometimes referred to as "hubs." [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1515. McMaster    Sep 93    Definitions of Managed Objects

for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units
(MAUs)

This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment
Units (MAUs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1514. Grillo     Sep 93    Host Resources MIB

This memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems. [STANDARDS-

# 1513. Waldbusser  Sep 93    Token Ring Extensions to the Remote

Network Monitoring MIB

This memo defines extensions to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB for
managing 802.5 Token Ring networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1512. Case       Sep 93     FDDI Management Information Base

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In
particular, it defines objects for managing devices which implement the
FDDI based on the ANSI FDDI SMT 7.3 draft standard, which has been
forwarded for publication by the X3T9.5 committee.

# 1511. Linn      Sep 93     Common Authentication Technology Overview

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not
specify an Internet standard.

# 1510. Kohl     Sep 93     The Kerberos Network Authentication Service

(V5)

This document gives an overview and specification of Version 5 of the
protocol for the Kerberos network authentication system. [STANDARDS-

# 1509. Wray     Sep 93     Generic Security Service API : C-bindings

This document specifies C language bindings for the Generic Security
Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which is described at a
language-independent conceptual level in other documents. [STANDARDS-
TRACK]

# 1508. Linn    Sep 93     Generic Security Service Application Program

Interface

This Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
definition provides security services to callers in a generic fashion,
supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and
hence allowing source-level portability of applications to different
environments. [STANDARDS-TRACK]

# 1507. Kaufman  Sep 93    DASS

Distributed Authentication Security Service

The goal of DASS is to provide authentication services in a distributed
environment which are both more secure and easier to use than existing
mechanisms. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.

# 1506. Houttuin  Sep 93   A Tutorial on Gatewaying between X.400 and

Internet Mail

This tutorial was produced especially to help new gateway managers find
their way into the complicated subject of mail gatewaying according to
RFC 1327. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It
does not specify an Internet standard.

# 1505. Costanzo   Aug 93   Encoding Header Field for Internet Messages

This document expands upon the elective experimental Encoding header
field which permits the mailing of multi-part, multi-structured
messages.  It replaces RFC 1154. This memo defines an Experimental
Protocol for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
standard.

# 1504. Oppenheimer  Aug 93   Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol:

Enhanced Appletalk Routing

This document provides detailed information about the AppleTalk Update-
based Routing Protocol (AURP) and wide area routing. AURP provides wide
area routing enhancements to the AppleTalk routing protocols and is
fully compatible with AppleTalk Phase 2. This memo provides information
for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.

# 1503. McCloghrie Aug 93    Algorithms for Automating Administration

in SNMPv2 Managers

When a user invokes an SNMPv2 management application, it may be
desirable for the user to specify the minimum amount of information
necessary to establish and maintain SNMPv2 communications.  This memo
suggests an approach to achieve this goal. This memo provides
information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet
standard.

# 1502. Alvestrand  Aug 93   X.400 Use of Extended Character Sets
