2826    IAB             May 2000        IAB Technical Comment on the
Unique DNS Root

This document discusses the existence of a globally unique public name
space in the Internet called the DNS (Domain Name System).  This name
space is a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally
unique root.  It is a technical constraint inherent in the design of the
DNS.  One root must be supported by a set of coordinated root servers
administered by a unique naming authority.  It is not technically
feasible for there to be more than one root in the public DNS.  This
memo provides information for the Internet community.

combinations of signalling operations, often in network devices, to
complete.  It also outlines requirements for such a language.  This memo
provides information for the Internet community.

# 2823. Carlson         May 2000        PPP over Simple Data Link

(SDL) using SONET/SDH with
ATM-like framing

This document extends methods found in the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
and RFCs 1662 and 2615 to include a new encapsulation for PPP called
Simple Data Link (SDL).  SDL provides a standard method for transporting
multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links, and RFCs 1662 and

# 2615. provide a means to carry PPP over Synchronous Optical Network

(SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) circuits.  SDL provides
a very low overhead alternative to HDLC-like encapsulation, and can also
be used on SONET/SDH links.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
for the Internet community.
