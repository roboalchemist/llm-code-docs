Workshop held 29 February - 1 March,
This report details the conclusions of an IAB-sponsored invitational
workshop held 29 February  - 1 March, 1996, to discuss the use of

set handling in Internet protocols which transmit text, provides a
conceptual framework for specifying character sets, recommends the use
of MIME tagging for transmitted text, recommends a default character set
*without* stating that there is no need for other character sets, and

makes a series of recommendations to the IAB, IANA, and the IESG for
furthering the integration of the character set framework into text
transmission protocols.  This memo provides information for the Internet
