# Limited Trial Account Restrictions

> Understanding rate limits and balance restrictions for accounts in Limited Trial mode

## Overview

Accounts in Limited Trial mode are subject to certain restrictions to prevent abuse and ensure compliance with Bright Data's policies. These restrictions are automatically applied to accounts flagged or operating in Limited Trial mode and can be removed by completing the account verification process.

<Note>
  The "Limited Trial Account Restrictions" described on this page are **not the same as KYC (Know Your Customer) verification**.
  These restrictions only apply to accounts in Limited Trial mode.
</Note>

## Rate limiting restrictions

### Request rate limits

Accounts in Limited Trial mode are restricted to a maximum of **100 requests per minute** across all products.

#### What happens when you exceed the rate limit?

If you exceed this rate limit, your requests will be rejected with an **HTTP 429** error response:

```http  theme={null}
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
x-brd-error-code: client_10110
x-brd-error: Requests rate from account is too high
x-brd-err-msg: Your limited trial mode account exceeded the allowed rate limits. Reduce requests rate and try again or complete the verification process to remove rate limits.
```

<Warning>
  **You will not be charged for requests that are rejected due to rate limiting.**
</Warning>

#### How to resolve rate limit errors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reduce your request rate">
    Temporarily reduce your requests to stay under 100 requests per minute while in trial mode.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete account verification">
    [Complete the account verification process](https://brightdata.com/cp/account_verification) to remove all rate limiting restrictions.
  </Step>
