## Can my data be recovered once I've terminated my instance?

Warning

We cannot recover your data once you've terminated your instance! Before terminating an instance, make sure to back up all data that you want to keep.

If you want to save data even after you terminate your instance, create a [persistent storage filesystem](https://lambda.ai/blog/persistent-storage-beta/).
