# Overview [# ](#overview)

On-Demand Cloud (ODC) provides on-demand access to Linux-based, GPU-backed virtual machine instances. 

## Instance types [# ](#instance-types)

ODC offers a variety of predefined instance types to support different workload requirements. Available GPUs include the state-of-the-art NVIDIA HGX B200 GPU, NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, as well as several earlier models. Each instance you create is tied to a specific geographical region. For a list of available regions, see the [Regions ](#regions)section below. 

Select instance types are backed by GPUs that feature NVIDIA SXM. SXM offers improved bandwidth between the NVIDIA GPUs in a single physical server. 

Warning 

Lambda prohibits cryptocurrency mining on ODC instances.
