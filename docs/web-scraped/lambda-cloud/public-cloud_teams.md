## Create a team [# ](#create-a-team)

- In the Lambda Cloud console, in the sidebar, click **Team **. 
- At the top right of your **Team **page, click **Invite **. 
- Enter the email address of the person you want to invite to your team. Select their role in the team, either an **Admin **or a **Member **. 
- 
Click **Send invitation **. 

Warning 

**Be sure to invite only trusted persons to your team! **

Currently, the only differences between the *Admin *and *Member *roles are that an *Admin *can: 

  - Invite others to the team. 
  - Remove others from the team. 
  - Modify payment information. 
  - Change the team name. 
This means that a person with a *Member *role can, for example: 

  - Launch instances that will incur charges. 
  - Terminate instances that should continue to run, including those launched by others on the team.
