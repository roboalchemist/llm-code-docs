# Managing billing

This page explains how to manage your Lambda Cloud billing and provides guidance for troubleshooting billing issues.

## Setting up billing

Before you can launch Lambda Cloud services, you must visit the [Settings > Billing page](https://cloud.lambda.ai/settings/billing) in the Lambda Cloud console and add a credit card to your account. Lambda makes a $10 pre-authorization charge to make sure the card is valid. The charge will be refunded in a few days.

## Paying an open invoice

To pay an open invoice, visit the [Settings > Billing page](https://cloud.lambda.ai/settings/billing) in the Lambda Cloud console, scroll to the **Payment History** section, and then click **Pay open invoice** to open the payment page.

Note

If you don't have any open invoices, the **Pay open invoice** button does not appear.
