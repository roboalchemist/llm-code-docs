Lambda Private Cloud provides bare metal, single-tenant clusters for defined reservation periods. Private Cloud clusters are built to your specifications, with Lambda providing 24x7 support for cluster hardware. Access to the cluster and firewall is restricted solely to you, and all hardware is isolated from other customer workloads. Additionally, Lambda offers workload management for Private Cloud clusters, like [Managed Kubernetes ](managed-kubernetes/), as an added service.
