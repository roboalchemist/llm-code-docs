## What are the buttons and ports at the front and top of my Vector One? [# ](#what-are-the-buttons-and-ports-at-the-front-and-top-of-my-vector-one)

[![Vector One front and top buttons and ports](../../../assets/images/vector-one-buttons.png)](../../../assets/images/vector-one-buttons.png)

Your Vector One's power button is located at the front-top. 

The first button at the top, closest to the front, switches between the various RGB modes. The second button at the top changes the color. 

The first port at the top, closest to the front, is used to connect USB-C 3.1 devices. The following 2 ports are used to connect USB-A 3.0 devices. 

The jack at the top is used to connect a headset/microphone. 

## How do I fix Wi-Fi issues with my Vector One? [# ](#how-do-i-fix-wi-fi-issues-with-my-vector-one)

There are [known issues in Ubuntu with the Wi-Fi adapter ](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-firmware/+bug/2049220)installed in Vector Ones. In some cases, the Wi-Fi adapter isn't detected at all. In other cases, the Wi-Fi adapter is detected but exhibits slow performance. These issues are fixed in updated firmware for the Wi-Fi adapter. 

In order to download and install the updated firmware, you need to connect your Vector One to the Internet. 

If your Wi-Fi adapter isn't detected at all, try booting using a previous kernel version. Your Wi-Fi adapter might be detected and you can download the updated firmware. 

Note 

You can also connect your Vector One to the Internet using Ethernet (recommended), a USB Wi-Fi adapter, or by tethering your iPhone or Android phone.
