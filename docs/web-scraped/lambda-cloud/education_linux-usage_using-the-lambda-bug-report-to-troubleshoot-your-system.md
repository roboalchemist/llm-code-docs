# Using the Lambda bug report to troubleshoot your system

The Lambda bug report helps simplify the process of troubleshooting by collecting system information for you into one place. This article helps you utilize the `lambda-bug-report.log` file to troubleshoot common issues.

Warning

The `lambda-bug-report.sh` is intended for use on [Vector](https://lambda.ai/gpu-workstations/vector), [Scalar](https://lambda.ai/products/scalar), [Hyperplane](https://lambda.ai/deep-learning/servers/hyperplane), and [On-Demand](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud) products only. Do not run this script on a cluster as it installs packages that may cause unintended outcomes.
