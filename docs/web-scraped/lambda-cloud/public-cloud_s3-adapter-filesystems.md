[See our video guide on using the Filesystem S3 Adapter. ](https://youtu.be/9ewdYXajuBc)

The Filesystem S3 Adapter allows you to interact with your Lambda filesystems using `rclone`, `s5cmd`, `mc`, and other S3-compatible tools. Supported operations include: 

- Listing the files and folders on your filesystem. 
- Transferring or copying files and folders to and from your filesystem. 
- Deleting files and folders from your filesystem. 
As of April 2025, this feature is available in select regions only. For the current list of supported regions, see [API regions and endpoints ](#api-regions-and-endpoints)below. 

Note 

While the Filesystem S3 Adapter is designed to be compatible with S3 tooling, it is not designed to be a replacement for a full-fledged object storage offering.
