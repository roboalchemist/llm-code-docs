## Where can I download the user manual for my server chassis?

User manuals for Lambda server chassis can be downloaded below.

Tip

You can run `sudo dmidecode -t 1` to know your server chassis. The command will output, for example:

```bash
# dmidecode 3.2
Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
SMBIOS 3.3.0 present.
# SMBIOS implementations newer than version 3.2.0 are not
# fully supported by this version of dmidecode.
