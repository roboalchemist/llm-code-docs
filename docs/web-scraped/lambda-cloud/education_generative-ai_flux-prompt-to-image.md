# How to serve the FLUX.1 prompt-to-image models using Lambda Cloud on-demand instances [#](#how-to-serve-the-flux1-prompt-to-image-models-using-lambda-cloud-on-demand-instances)

This tutorial shows you how to use [Lambda Cloud](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)A100 and H100 on-demand instances to download and serve a [FLUX.1 prompt-to-image model](https://blackforestlabs.ai/). The model will be served as a [Gradio app](https://www.gradio.app/)accessible with a link you can share.

Note

You can download and serve the [FLUX.1 [schnell] ](https://huggingface.co/spaces/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell)model without a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)account.

However, to download and serve the [FLUX.1 [dev] ](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)model, you need a Hugging Face account and a [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens). You also need to review and accept the model license agreement.
