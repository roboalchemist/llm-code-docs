## Overview

Lambda Private Cloud provides single-tenant AI compute infrastructure with fully dedicated hardware and network resources allocated exclusively to a single customer. This architecture eliminates shared infrastructure risks and potential resource contention through complete environmental separation.

This isolation model significantly reduces third-party risk exposure while maintaining access to Lambda's infrastructure design expertise and operational support services.

All clusters start with a common baseline reference design, which incorporates well-reasoned and sensible security decisions. On top of this design, various customizations are offered to tailor a cluster to specific customer requirements. Common customizations and their impact on the cluster's security posture are outlined below.

## Cluster Design

A private cloud cluster contains several distinct types of server nodes. All nodes are single-tenant bare-metal systems which are physically isolated from other Lambda customers and dedicated to the customer's cluster.

-
**Compute (GPU) nodes: **Optimized for GPU workloads. These nodes connect to the cluster's in-band Ethernet network and InfiniBand fabric.

-
**Head nodes: **Used as control plane or CPU-only compute nodes. They connect solely to the cluster's in-band Ethernet network.

-
**Lambda Management nodes: **Used by Lambda to provide observability into the health of the cluster and allow Lambda to provide operational support.

### BIOS, BMC, and firmware

All nodes are deployed with the latest validated BIOS and BMC firmware. All nodes have secure BMC passwords set.

### Operating system

All compute and head nodes are provisioned with an up-to-date installation of an Ubuntu LTS (Long-Term Support) release. The customer is responsible for OS-level security and patch management, as well as monitoring logs and metrics.

Lambda provisions the cluster nodes with an initial SSH authorized key provided by the customer. With this key, the customer receives administrator (root) access to all compute and head nodes. Once the cluster is handed over, the customer can install additional SSH keys, add or remove local user accounts, and perform any other desired OS-level configuration changes.

## Network

A private cloud cluster primarily utilizes two network fabrics that operate in tandem: an **in-band Ethernet network **and an **InfiniBand fabric **. All network connections and supporting infrastructure (including firewalls, routers, and switches) are dedicated to the customer's cluster.

The **in-band Ethernet **network is connected to all compute and management nodes, as well as the cluster's persistent storage. This network is the primary path that compute and management nodes use to access persistent storage.

The in-band Ethernet network has internet connectivity provided through redundant dedicated internet access (DIA) links. A firewall is placed at the network perimeter and is initially configured with no internet-exposed ingress ports. The customer has full control over this firewall and can implement their own network policies.

The **InfiniBand fabric **provides high-speed, low-latency connectivity between compute nodes in a spine-leaf topology, suitable for RDMA-enabled GPU communication. All compute nodes have unrestricted access to each other on this fabric.

Depending on the size of the cluster, an **RoCE fabric **(RDMA over Converged Ethernet) may be used for RDMA traffic instead of InfiniBand. The security properties of this technology are similar to InfiniBand; however, it uses Ethernet as the underlying physical layer.

Each cluster also has a separate **management network **. The management network connects to control plane systems, physical infrastructure (including smart PDUs), dedicated management interfaces on server nodes (including BMCs and DPUs), and dedicated management interfaces of network devices that support the in-band Ethernet network and InfiniBand fabric. It has connectivity to the in-band Ethernet network through a dedicated management firewall.

Finally, there is a small **out-of-band (OOB) network **. This network is used for backup or emergency access to the dedicated management interfaces on network devices in the management network (i.e., core switches and firewalls). The OOB network has its own firewall that is connected to a backup low-bandwidth internet link, which can be utilized to manage core management network devices in an outage scenario. General routing is not permitted over the OOB backup link.

### Hardware

Lambda will deploy all network hardware with the latest firmware provided by the respective vendors. Lambda can assist with ongoing firmware updates to these devices at the customer's request, but will not (and generally cannot) take any action on them without prior customer approval.

### VPN

The cluster's perimeter firewall provides client VPN functionality, which allows for secure remote connection to the cluster from individual client endpoints. This is suitable either as a primary access path or a backup access path if the primary preference is to use a site-to-site VPN or dedicated private links.

As part of the handoff process of a new cluster, Lambda will provision and share an initial set of administrative VPN credentials with the customer. The customer has the option to provision additional VPN accounts or integrate with their own identity provider for single sign-on (SSO).

## Data storage and handling

Each cluster includes persistent network-attached storage. As with other aspects of a private cloud cluster, all hardware (including storage media) is dedicated to the customer and not shared with others.

Data saved to persistent storage is encrypted at rest with 256-bit AES-XTS. A unique encryption key is generated when the cluster is built and is not shared with other customers. If a persistent storage drive is ever physically removed, its data is unreadable and irrecoverable without this key.

Data accessed from persistent storage is not encrypted in-transit over the network, but the traffic is fully contained within the cluster's physical footprint. This design optimizes for I/O performance while still protecting the data through physical isolation and controlled datacenter access. Customers with stricter requirements can implement object-level encryption.

Storage drives that fail or reach end-of-life are carefully removed and secured within the datacenter until they are destroyed. Lambda relies on a certified third-party vendor for this process and can provide proof of destruction upon request.

At the conclusion of a Private Cloud contract, Lambda performs a secure wipe of all cluster drives. This sanitization process complies with NIST 800-88 "purge" requirements, ensuring that customer data is permanently removed.

## Physical site

Lambda Private Cloud infrastructure is housed in secure datacenter facilities featuring:

- Perimeter and internal CCTV surveillance, with a minimum 90-day retention
- Multiple security checkpoints, minimally including:
- Main lobby access that is restricted by a security door with a biometric reader, badge reader, and/or security personnel
- Multi-factor authentication (PIN/badge + biometric) for entry into the data hall
Physical access to the infrastructure is limited to Lambda employees and data center providers with a specific need for access. In the event of emergencies or planned maintenance, Lambda documents all access and reviews it to ensure compliance with these protocols.

Authorized Lambda employees may access data centers for maintenance, upgrades, or other hardware-related work. Local authorities or authorized data center providers may access the hall space as required by local codes.

## Ongoing maintenance and support

It is understood that every customer has unique infrastructure management requirements. Lambda Private Cloud offers different levels of maintenance options, allowing customers to select the level of support that best suits their needs. Regardless of the chosen model, the customer will have access to Lambda's expert support staff.

-
**Physical only **- After handoff, Lambda will not retain any logical access to the customer's cluster or data. The customer will be able to submit support and maintenance requests, and has the option to provide Lambda with logical access as-needed for assistance. This model provides the most robust level of access reduction for the cluster, while still retaining access to Lambda's support expertise.

-
**Managed Private Cloud **- Lambda will retain logical access to the cluster to provide best-in-class support at all layers of the stack. The customer can revoke Lambda's access at any time and will have access to robust audit logs that provide visibility into the actions Lambda takes on the cluster. Lambda will never take action on the cluster without prior notification and permission, and will work with the customer to establish requirements for maintenance windows.

## Customizations

### Managed Kubernetes

A [fully-managed Kubernetes stack](https://lambda.ai/kubernetes)can be provisioned into the cluster. This Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering adheres to Kubernetes best practices for cluster configuration and security, removing management overhead and enabling customers to leverage Kubernetes effectively. Lambda will handle ongoing cluster maintenance, including updates and patching (subject to the customer's requirements for maintenance window coordination).

SSO authentication is supported for Managed Kubernetes out-of-the-box. Customers can authenticate against their own identity provider via OIDC or SAML.

For clusters with Managed Kubernetes, customers will not have direct SSH access to cluster nodes; instead, Kubernetes tooling is used to manage workloads.

### Dedicated cage

A cage can be constructed within the datacenter to physically isolate the cluster hardware. The cage will be exclusively dedicated to the customer and will not contain any hardware allocated to other customers.

**Important: **If a dedicated cage is desired, Lambda needs to be informed early in the cluster build process so that space can be allocated and the cage can be physically constructed prior to cluster hardware installation.

The cage is constructed with a tight mesh and a ceiling, and can extend below the raised floor to the underlying concrete. Customers can install their own badging infrastructure at the entrance to the cage and will have full control over who has access and when they have access. Additionally, customers have the option to install their own security cameras within the cage, with full control over placement to get any angle within the cage.

The cluster will have external network links (including DIA links) that leave the cage. These links can optionally use armored cabling for increased protection against physical tampering.

### Site-to-site IPsec VPN

The cluster can be securely connected to the customer's infrastructure via a site-to-site VPN tunnel over the internet (or alternatively, through dedicated private links). The cluster's perimeter firewall terminates an IPsec tunnel with the customer's on-premises or self-hosted firewall/router, establishing secure and encrypted connectivity between the two environments.

The security of this tunnel relies heavily on the protection of the IPsec credentials (either a pre-shared key or certificates). The cluster firewall utilizes encrypted credential storage; however, the customer is responsible for secure storage of the credentials on their own infrastructure.

If additional protection is required for tunnels running over the internet, an IP allowlist can be added to the outer tunnel connection to restrict it to traffic from specified source IPs.

### Private cloud connectivity

The cluster can be configured with dedicated private network links to major cloud providers, including AWS DirectConnect, Azure ExpressRoute, GCP Dedicated/Partner Interconnect, and OCI FastConnect. These links are terminated on the cluster's perimeter firewall, allowing the customer to implement desired network security policies.

### Custom hardware

Additional custom hardware (such as network appliances or server nodes) can be deployed into a cluster to meet specific needs if the baseline components are not suitable. This is useful, for example, when there are requirements to run specific network appliances or a need for special-purpose functionality that must run in close proximity to the rest of the cluster. Lambda will be responsible for establishing physical network connectivity for custom hardware, and the customer will be responsible for its configuration and operation.
