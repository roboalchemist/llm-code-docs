# Troubleshooting Workstations and Desktops

This document provides guidelines for troubleshooting common issues with Vector desktops and workstations. By following this guide, you can often resolve problems without the need for a Repair Merchandise Authorization (RMA).

To mitigate unnecessary downtime with shipping and repair, Lambda may expect you to attempt basic troubleshooting before approving a request for RMA.

Note

When you encounter any issue with your product, your first step should be to file a [support ticket](https://support.lambda.ai/hc/en-us/requests/new). Doing so creates a record of your issue and allows our team to provide ongoing assistance if needed.

If possible, generate a Lambda bug report and attach the report to your ticket. This report provides our Support Team with valuable system information that can expedite the troubleshooting process.
