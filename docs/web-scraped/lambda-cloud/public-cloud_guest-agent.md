# Guest Agent

## Introduction

The `lambda-guest-agent` (Guest Agent) is a service you can install on both Lambda Cloud on-demand instances and 1-Click Cluster (1CC) nodes. For simplicity, this documentation refers to both types of systems as *virtual machines* (VMs). The Guest Agent collects system metrics, such as GPU and VRAM utilization, and sends them to Lambda's backend. You can then view these metrics in the the [Lambda Cloud console](https://cloud.lambda.ai/).

Note

The metrics dashboard will be generally available in the Lambda Cloud console in Q2 of 2025. To request early access, submit a support ticket.
