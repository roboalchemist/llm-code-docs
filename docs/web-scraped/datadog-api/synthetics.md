# Synthetics
Datadog Synthetic Monitoring uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to help you ensure uptime, identify regional issues, and track your application performance. Synthetic tests come in two different flavors, [API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest) and [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You can use Datadog’s API to manage both test types programmatically.
For more information, see the [Synthetic Monitoring documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).

`{ isEnabled: true }` RUM data is collected from the Synthetic test's default application.
`{ isEnabled: true, applicationId: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", clientTokenId: 12345 }` RUM data is collected using the specified application.
applicationId
string
RUM application ID used to collect RUM data for the browser test.
clientTokenId
int64
RUM application API key ID used to collect RUM data for the browser test.
isEnabled [_required_]
boolean
Determines whether RUM data is collected during test runs.
scheduling
object
Object containing timeframes and timezone used for advanced scheduling.
timeframes [_required_]
[object]

### Overview
Patch a global variable using JSON Patch (RFC 6902). This endpoint allows partial updates to a global variable by specifying only the fields to modify.
Common operations include:
  * Replace field values: `{"op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "new_name"}`
  * Update nested values: `{"op": "replace", "path": "/value/value", "value": "new_value"}`
  * Add/update tags: `{"op": "add", "path": "/tags/-", "value": "new_tag"}`
  * Remove fields: `{"op": "remove", "path": "/description"}`

This endpoint requires the `synthetics_global_variable_write` permission.
### Arguments
#### Path Parameters

### Overview
Edit a Synthetic global variable. This endpoint requires the `synthetics_global_variable_write` permission.
OAuth apps require the `synthetics_global_variable_write` authorization [scope](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/scopes/#synthetics) to access this endpoint.
### Arguments
#### Path Parameters
Name
Type
Description
variable_id [_required_]
string
The ID of the global variable.
### Request
#### Body Data (required)
Details of the global variable to update.

Details of the parser to use for the global variable.
type [_required_]
enum
Type of parser for a Synthetic global variable from a synthetics test. Allowed enum values: `raw,json_path,regex,x_path`
value
string
Regex or JSON path used for the parser. Not used with type `raw`.
type [_required_]
enum
Type of value to extract from a test for a Synthetic global variable. Allowed enum values: `http_body,http_header,http_status_code,local_variable`
