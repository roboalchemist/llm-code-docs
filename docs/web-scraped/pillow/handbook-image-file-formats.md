# Image file formats¶

The Python Imaging Library supports a wide variety of raster file formats.
Over 30 different file formats can be identified and read by the library.
Write support is less extensive, but most common interchange and presentation
formats are supported.

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open")
function identifies files from their contents, not their names, but the
[`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method looks at the name to determine which format to
use, unless the format is given explicitly.

When an image is opened from a file, only that instance of the image is
considered to have the format. Copies of the image will contain data loaded
from the file, but not the file itself, meaning that it can no longer be
considered to be in the original format. So if
[`copy()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.copy
"PIL.Image.Image.copy") is called on an image, or another method internally
creates a copy of the image, then any methods or attributes specific to the
format will no longer be present. The `fp` (file pointer) attribute will no
longer be present, and the
[`format`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.format
"PIL.Image.Image.format") attribute will be `None`.

## Fully supported formats¶

### AVIF¶

Pillow reads and writes AVIF files, including AVIF sequence images. It is only
possible to save 8-bit AVIF images, and all AVIF images are decoded as 8-bit
RGB(A).

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**quality**

    

Integer, 0-100, defaults to 75. 0 gives the smallest size and poorest quality,
100 the largest size and best quality.

**subsampling**

    

If present, sets the subsampling for the encoder. Defaults to `4:2:0`. Options
include:

  * `4:0:0`

  * `4:2:0`

  * `4:2:2`

  * `4:4:4`

**speed**

    

Quality/speed trade-off (0=slower/better, 10=fastest). Defaults to 6.

**max_threads**

    

Limit the number of active threads used. By default, there is no limit. If the
aom codec is used, there is a maximum of 64.

**range**

    

YUV range, either “full” or “limited”. Defaults to “full”.

**codec**

    

AV1 codec to use for encoding. Specific values are “aom”, “rav1e”, and “svt”,
presuming the chosen codec is available. Defaults to “auto”, which will choose
the first available codec in the order of the preceding list.

**tile_rows** / **tile_cols**

    

For tile encoding, the (log 2) number of tile rows and columns to use. Valid
values are 0-6, default 0. Ignored if “autotiling” is set to true.

**autotiling**

    

Split the image up to allow parallelization. Enabled automatically if
“tile_rows” and “tile_cols” both have their default values of zero.

**alpha_premultiplied**

    

Encode the image with premultiplied alpha. Defaults to `False`.

**advanced**

    

Codec specific options.

**icc_profile**

    

The ICC Profile to include in the saved file.

**exif**

    

The exif data to include in the saved file.

**xmp**

    

The XMP data to include in the saved file.

#### Saving sequences¶

When calling [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") to write an AVIF file, by default only the first frame
of a multiframe image will be saved. If the `save_all` argument is present and
true, then all frames will be saved, and the following options will also be
available.

**append_images**

    

A list of images to append as additional frames. Each of the images in the
list can be single or multiframe images.

**duration**

    

The display duration of each frame, in milliseconds. Pass a single integer for
a constant duration, or a list or tuple to set the duration for each frame
separately.

### BLP¶

BLP is the Blizzard Mipmap Format, a texture format used in World of Warcraft.
Pillow supports reading `JPEG` Compressed or raw `BLP1` images, and all types
of `BLP2` images.

#### Saving¶

Pillow supports writing BLP images. The
[`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**blp_version**

    

If present and set to “BLP1”, images will be saved as BLP1. Otherwise, images
will be saved as BLP2.

### BMP¶

Pillow reads and writes Windows and OS/2 BMP files containing `1`, `L`, `P`,
or `RGB` data. 16-colour images are read as `P` images. Support for reading
8-bit run-length encoding was added in Pillow 9.1.0. Support for reading 4-bit
run-length encoding was added in Pillow 9.3.0.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**compression**

    

Set to 1 if the file is a 256-color run-length encoded image. Set to 2 if the
file is a 16-color run-length encoded image.

### DDS¶

DDS is a popular container texture format used in video games and natively
supported by DirectX.

DXT1 and DXT5 pixel formats can be read, only in `RGBA` mode.

Added in version 3.4.0: DXT3 images can be read in `RGBA` mode and DX10 images
can be read in `RGB` and `RGBA` mode.

Added in version 6.0.0: Uncompressed `RGBA` images can be read.

Added in version 8.3.0: BC5S images can be opened in `RGB` mode, and
uncompressed `RGB` images can be read. Uncompressed data can also be saved to
image files.

Added in version 9.3.0: ATI1 images can be opened in `L` mode and ATI2 images
can be opened in `RGB` mode.

Added in version 9.4.0: Uncompressed `L` (“luminance”) and `LA` images can be
opened and saved.

Added in version 10.1.0: BC5U can be read in `RGB` mode, and 8-bit color
indexed images can be read in `P` mode.

Added in version 11.2.1: DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, BC2, BC3 and BC5 pixel formats can
be saved::

> im.save(out, pixel_format=”DXT1”)

### DIB¶

Pillow reads and writes DIB files. DIB files are similar to BMP files, so see
above for more information.

> Added in version 6.0.0.

### EPS¶

Pillow identifies EPS files containing image data, and can read files that
contain embedded raster images (ImageData descriptors). If Ghostscript is
available, other EPS files can be read as well. The EPS driver can also write
EPS images. The EPS driver can read EPS images in `L`, `LAB`, `RGB` and `CMYK`
mode, but Ghostscript may convert the images to `RGB` mode rather than leaving
them in the original color space. The EPS driver can write images in `L`,
`RGB` and `CMYK` modes.

#### Loading¶

To use Ghostscript, Pillow searches for the “gs” executable. On Windows, it
also searches for “gswin32c” and “gswin64c”. To customise this behaviour,
`EpsImagePlugin.gs_binary = "gswin64"` will set the name of the executable to
use. `EpsImagePlugin.gs_binary = False` will prevent Ghostscript use.

If Ghostscript is available, you can call the
[`load()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.load
"PIL.Image.Image.load") method with the following parameters to affect how
Ghostscript renders the EPS.

**scale**

    

Affects the scale of the resultant rasterized image. If the EPS suggests that
the image be rendered at 100px x 100px, setting this parameter to 2 will make
the Ghostscript render a 200px x 200px image instead. The relative position of
the bounding box is maintained:

    
    
    im = Image.open(...)
    im.size  # (100,100)
    im.load(scale=2)
    im.size  # (200,200)
    

**transparency**

    

If true, generates an RGBA image with a transparent background, instead of the
default behaviour of an RGB image with a white background.

### GIF¶

Pillow reads GIF87a and GIF89a versions of the GIF file format. The library
writes files in GIF87a by default, unless GIF89a features are used or GIF89a
is already in use. Files are written with LZW encoding.

GIF files are initially read as grayscale (`L`) or palette mode (`P`) images.
Seeking to later frames in a `P` image will change the image to `RGB` (or
`RGBA` if the first frame had transparency).

`P` mode images are changed to `RGB` because each frame of a GIF may contain
its own individual palette of up to 256 colors. When a new frame is placed
onto a previous frame, those colors may combine to exceed the `P` mode limit
of 256 colors. Instead, the image is converted to `RGB` handle this.

If you would prefer the first `P` image frame to be `RGB` as well, so that
every `P` frame is converted to `RGB` or `RGBA` mode, there is a setting
available:

    
    
    from PIL import GifImagePlugin
    GifImagePlugin.LOADING_STRATEGY = GifImagePlugin.LoadingStrategy.RGB_ALWAYS
    

GIF frames do not always contain individual palettes however. If there is only
a global palette, then all of the colors can fit within `P` mode. If you would
prefer the frames to be kept as `P` in that case, there is also a setting
available:

    
    
    from PIL import GifImagePlugin
    GifImagePlugin.LOADING_STRATEGY = GifImagePlugin.LoadingStrategy.RGB_AFTER_DIFFERENT_PALETTE_ONLY
    

To restore the default behavior, where `P` mode images are only converted to
`RGB` or `RGBA` after the first frame:

    
    
    from PIL import GifImagePlugin
    GifImagePlugin.LOADING_STRATEGY = GifImagePlugin.LoadingStrategy.RGB_AFTER_FIRST
    

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**background**

    

Default background color (a palette color index).

**transparency**

    

Transparency color index. This key is omitted if the image is not transparent.

**version**

    

Version (either `GIF87a` or `GIF89a`).

**duration**

    

May not be present. The time to display the current frame of the GIF, in
milliseconds.

**loop**

    

May not be present. The number of times the GIF should loop. 0 means that it
will loop forever.

**comment**

    

May not be present. A comment about the image. This is the last comment found
before the current frame’s image.

**extension**

    

May not be present. Contains application specific information.

#### Reading sequences¶

The GIF loader supports the
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") methods. You can combine these methods to seek to the
next frame (`im.seek(im.tell() + 1)`).

`im.seek()` raises an
[`EOFError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError "\(in
Python v3.14\)") if you try to seek after the last frame.

#### Saving¶

When calling [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") to write a GIF file, the following options are
available:

    
    
    im.save(out, save_all=True, append_images=[im1, im2, ...])
    

**save_all**

    

If present and true, or if `append_images` is not empty, all frames of the
image will be saved. Otherwise, only the first frame of a multiframe image
will be saved.

**append_images**

    

A list of images to append as additional frames. Each of the images in the
list can be single or multiframe images. This is supported for AVIF, GIF, PDF,
PNG, TIFF and WebP.

It is also supported for ICO and ICNS. If images are passed in of relevant
sizes, they will be used instead of scaling down the main image.

**include_color_table**

    

Whether or not to include local color table.

**interlace**

    

Whether or not the image is interlaced. By default, it is, unless the image is
less than 16 pixels in width or height.

**disposal**

    

Indicates the way in which the graphic is to be treated after being displayed.

  * 0 - No disposal specified.

  * 1 - Do not dispose.

  * 2 - Restore to background color.

  * 3 - Restore to previous content.

> Pass a single integer for a constant disposal, or a list or tuple to set the
> disposal for each frame separately.

**palette**

    

Use the specified palette for the saved image. The palette should be a bytes
or bytearray object containing the palette entries in RGBRGB… form. It should
be no more than 768 bytes. Alternately, the palette can be passed in as an
[`PIL.ImagePalette.ImagePalette`](../reference/ImagePalette.html#PIL.ImagePalette.ImagePalette
"PIL.ImagePalette.ImagePalette") object.

**optimize**

    

Whether to attempt to compress the palette by eliminating unused colors (this
is only useful if the palette can be compressed to the next smaller power of 2
elements) and whether to mark all pixels that are not new in the next frame as
transparent.

This is attempted by default, unless a palette is specified as an option or as
part of the first image’s
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
dictionary.

Note that if the image you are saving comes from an existing GIF, it may have
the following properties in its
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
dictionary. For these options, if you do not pass them in, they will default
to their [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") values.

**transparency**

    

Transparency color index.

**duration**

    

The display duration of each frame of the multiframe gif, in milliseconds.
Pass a single integer for a constant duration, or a list or tuple to set the
duration for each frame separately.

**loop**

    

Integer number of times the GIF should loop. 0 means that it will loop
forever. If omitted or `None`, the image will not loop.

**comment**

    

A comment about the image.

#### Reading local images¶

The GIF loader creates an image memory the same size as the GIF file’s
_logical screen size_ , and pastes the actual pixel data (the _local image_)
into this image. If you only want the actual pixel rectangle, you can crop the
image:

    
    
    im = Image.open(...)
    
    if im.tile[0][0] == "gif":
        # only read the first "local image" from this GIF file
        box = im.tile[0][1]
        im = im.crop(box)
    

### ICNS¶

Pillow reads and writes macOS `.icns` files. By default, the largest available
icon is read, though you can override this by setting the
[`size`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.size "PIL.Image.Image.size")
property before calling
[`load()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.load
"PIL.Image.Image.load"). The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open
"PIL.Image.open") method sets the following
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
property:

Note

Prior to version 8.3.0, Pillow could only write ICNS files on macOS.

**sizes**

    

A list of supported sizes found in this icon file; these are a 3-tuple,
`(width, height, scale)`, where `scale` is 2 for a retina icon and 1 for a
standard icon.

#### Loading¶

You can call the [`load()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.load
"PIL.Image.Image.load") method with the following parameter.

**scale**

    

Affects the scale of the resultant image. If the size is set to `(512, 512)`,
after loading at scale 2, the final value of
[`size`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.size "PIL.Image.Image.size")
will be `(1024, 1024)`.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**append_images**

    

A list of images to replace the scaled down versions of the image. The order
of the images does not matter, as their use is determined by the size of each
image.

Added in version 5.1.0.

### ICO¶

ICO is used to store icons on Windows. The largest available icon is read.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**sizes**

    

A list of sizes including in this ico file; these are a 2-tuple, `(width,
height)`; Default to `[(16, 16), (24, 24), (32, 32), (48, 48), (64, 64), (128,
128), (256, 256)]`. Any sizes bigger than the original size or 256 will be
ignored.

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**append_images**

    

A list of images to replace the scaled down versions of the image. The order
of the images does not matter, as their use is determined by the size of each
image.

Added in version 8.1.0.

**bitmap_format**

    

By default, the image data will be saved in PNG format. With a bitmap format
of “bmp”, image data will be saved in BMP format instead.

Added in version 8.3.0.

### IM¶

IM is a format used by LabEye and other applications based on the IFUNC image
processing library. The library reads and writes most uncompressed interchange
versions of this format.

IM is the only format that can store all internal Pillow formats.

### JPEG¶

Pillow reads JPEG, JFIF, and Adobe JPEG files containing `L`, `RGB`, or `CMYK`
data. It writes standard and progressive JFIF files.

Using the [`draft()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.draft
"PIL.Image.Image.draft") method, you can speed things up by converting `RGB`
images to `L`, and resize images to 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 of their original size
while loading them.

By default Pillow doesn’t allow loading of truncated JPEG files, set
[`ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES`](../reference/ImageFile.html#PIL.ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES
"PIL.ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES") to override this.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
may set the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties if available:

**jfif**

    

JFIF application marker found. If the file is not a JFIF file, this key is not
present.

**jfif_version**

    

A tuple representing the jfif version, (major version, minor version).

**jfif_density**

    

A tuple representing the pixel density of the image, in units specified by
jfif_unit.

**jfif_unit**

    

Units for the jfif_density:

  * 0 - No Units

  * 1 - Pixels per Inch

  * 2 - Pixels per Centimeter

**dpi**

    

A tuple representing the reported pixel density in pixels per inch, if the
file is a jfif file and the units are in inches.

**adobe**

    

Adobe application marker found. If the file is not an Adobe JPEG file, this
key is not present.

**adobe_transform**

    

Vendor Specific Tag.

**progression**

    

Indicates that this is a progressive JPEG file.

**icc_profile**

    

The ICC color profile for the image.

**exif**

    

Raw EXIF data from the image.

**comment**

    

A comment about the image, from the COM marker. This is separate from the
UserComment tag that may be stored in the EXIF data.

Added in version 7.1.0.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**quality**

    

The image quality, on a scale from 0 (worst) to 95 (best), or the string
`keep`. The default is 75. Values above 95 should be avoided; 100 disables
portions of the JPEG compression algorithm, and results in large files with
hardly any gain in image quality. The value `keep` is only valid for JPEG
files and will retain the original image quality level, subsampling, and
qtables. For more information on how qtables are modified based on the quality
parameter, see the qtables section.

**optimize**

    

If present and true, indicates that the encoder should make an extra pass over
the image in order to select optimal encoder settings.

**progressive**

    

If present and true, indicates that this image should be stored as a
progressive JPEG file.

**dpi**

    

A tuple of integers representing the pixel density, `(x,y)`.

**icc_profile**

    

If present and true, the image is stored with the provided ICC profile. If
this parameter is not provided, the image will be saved with no profile
attached. To preserve the existing profile:

    
    
    im.save(filename, 'jpeg', icc_profile=im.info.get('icc_profile'))
    

**exif**

    

If present, the image will be stored with the provided raw EXIF data.

**keep_rgb**

    

By default, libjpeg converts images with an RGB color space to YCbCr. If this
option is present and true, those images will be stored as RGB instead.

When this option is enabled, attempting to chroma-subsample RGB images with
the `subsampling` option will raise an
[`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "\(in
Python v3.14\)").

Added in version 10.2.0.

**subsampling**

    

If present, sets the subsampling for the encoder.

  * `keep`: Only valid for JPEG files, will retain the original image setting.

  * `4:4:4`, `4:2:2`, `4:2:0`: Specific sampling values

  * `0`: equivalent to `4:4:4`

  * `1`: equivalent to `4:2:2`

  * `2`: equivalent to `4:2:0`

If absent, the setting will be determined by libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo.

**restart_marker_blocks**

    

If present, emit a restart marker whenever the specified number of MCU blocks
has been produced.

Added in version 10.2.0.

**restart_marker_rows**

    

If present, emit a restart marker whenever the specified number of MCU rows
has been produced.

Added in version 10.2.0.

**qtables**

    

If present, sets the qtables for the encoder. This is listed as an advanced
option for wizards in the JPEG documentation. Use with caution. `qtables` can
be one of several types of values:

  * a string, naming a preset, e.g. `keep`, `web_low`, or `web_high`

  * a list, tuple, or dictionary (with integer keys = range(len(keys))) of lists of 64 integers. There must be between 2 and 4 tables.

If a quality parameter is provided, the qtables will be adjusted accordingly.
By default, the qtables are based on a standard JPEG table with a quality of
50. The qtable values will be reduced if the quality is higher than 50 and
increased if the quality is lower than 50.

Added in version 2.5.0.

**streamtype**

    

Allows storing images without quantization and Huffman tables, or with these
tables but without image data. This is useful for container formats or network
protocols that handle tables separately and share them between images.

  * `0` (default): interchange datastream, with tables and image data

  * `1`: abbreviated table specification (tables-only) datastream

Added in version 10.2.0.

  * `2`: abbreviated image (image-only) datastream

**comment**

    

A comment about the image.

Added in version 9.4.0.

Note

To enable JPEG support, you need to build and install the IJG JPEG library
before building the Python Imaging Library. See the distribution README for
details.

### JPEG 2000¶

Added in version 2.4.0.

Pillow reads and writes JPEG 2000 files containing `L`, `LA`, `RGB`, `RGBA`,
or `YCbCr` data. When reading, `YCbCr` data is converted to `RGB` or `RGBA`
depending on whether or not there is an alpha channel.

Added in version 8.3.0: Pillow can read (but not write) `RGB`, `RGBA`, and
`YCbCr` images with subsampled components.

Added in version 10.4.0: Pillow can read `CMYK` images with OpenJPEG 2.5.1 and
later.

Added in version 11.1.0: Pillow can write `CMYK` images with OpenJPEG 2.5.3
and later.

Pillow supports JPEG 2000 raw codestreams (`.j2k` files), as well as boxed
JPEG 2000 files (`.jp2` or `.jpx` files).

When loading, if you set the `mode` on the image prior to the
[`load()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.load
"PIL.Image.Image.load") method being invoked, you can ask Pillow to convert
the image to either `RGB` or `RGBA` rather than choosing for itself. It is
also possible to set `reduce` to the number of resolutions to discard (each
one reduces the size of the resulting image by a factor of 2), and `layers` to
specify the number of quality layers to load.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**offset**

    

The image offset, as a tuple of integers, e.g. (16, 16)

**tile_offset**

    

The tile offset, again as a 2-tuple of integers.

**tile_size**

    

The tile size as a 2-tuple. If not specified, or if set to None, the image
will be saved without tiling.

**quality_mode**

    

Either `"rates"` or `"dB"` depending on the units you want to use to specify
image quality.

**quality_layers**

    

A sequence of numbers, each of which represents either an approximate size
reduction (if quality mode is `"rates"`) or a signal to noise ratio value in
decibels. If not specified, defaults to a single layer of full quality.

**num_resolutions**

    

The number of different image resolutions to be stored (which corresponds to
the number of Discrete Wavelet Transform decompositions plus one).

**codeblock_size**

    

The code-block size as a 2-tuple. Minimum size is 4 x 4, maximum is 1024 x
1024, with the additional restriction that no code-block may have more than
4096 coefficients (i.e. the product of the two numbers must be no greater than
4096).

**precinct_size**

    

The precinct size as a 2-tuple. Must be a power of two along both axes, and
must be greater than the code-block size.

**irreversible**

    

If `True`, use the lossy discrete waveform transformation DWT 9-7. Defaults to
`False`, which uses the lossless DWT 5-3.

**mct**

    

If `1` then enable multiple component transformation when encoding, otherwise
use `0` for no component transformation (default). If MCT is enabled and
`irreversible` is `True` then the Irreversible Color Transformation will be
applied, otherwise encoding will use the Reversible Color Transformation. MCT
works best with a `mode` of `RGB` and is only applicable when the image data
has 3 components.

Added in version 9.1.0.

**progression**

    

Controls the progression order; must be one of `"LRCP"`, `"RLCP"`, `"RPCL"`,
`"PCRL"`, `"CPRL"`. The letters stand for Component, Position, Resolution and
Layer respectively and control the order of encoding, the idea being that e.g.
an image encoded using LRCP mode can have its quality layers decoded as they
arrive at the decoder, while one encoded using RLCP mode will have increasing
resolutions decoded as they arrive, and so on.

**signed**

    

If true, then tell the encoder to save the image as signed.

Added in version 9.4.0.

**cinema_mode**

    

Set the encoder to produce output compliant with the digital cinema
specifications. The options here are `"no"` (the default), `"cinema2k-24"` for
24fps 2K, `"cinema2k-48"` for 48fps 2K, and `"cinema4k-24"` for 24fps 4K. Note
that for compliant 2K files, _at least one_ of your image dimensions must
match 2048 x 1080, while for compliant 4K files, _at least one_ of the
dimensions must match 4096 x 2160.

**no_jp2**

    

If `True` then don’t wrap the raw codestream in the JP2 file format when
saving, otherwise the extension of the filename will be used to determine the
format (default).

Added in version 9.1.0.

**comment**

    

Adds a custom comment to the file, replacing the default “Created by OpenJPEG
version” comment.

Added in version 9.5.0.

**plt**

    

If `True` and OpenJPEG 2.4.0 or later is available, then include a PLT (packet
length, tile-part header) marker in the produced file. Defaults to `False`.

Added in version 9.5.0.

Note

To enable JPEG 2000 support, you need to build and install the OpenJPEG
library, version 2.0.0 or higher, before building the Python Imaging Library.

Windows users can install the OpenJPEG binaries available on the OpenJPEG
website, but must add them to their PATH in order to use Pillow (if you fail
to do this, you will get errors about not being able to load the `_imaging`
DLL).

### MPO¶

Pillow reads and writes Multi Picture Object (MPO) files. When first opened,
it loads the primary image. The
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") methods may be used to read other pictures from the
file. The pictures are zero-indexed and random access is supported.

#### Saving¶

When calling [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") to write an MPO file, by default only the first frame
of a multiframe image will be saved. If the `save_all` argument is present and
true, or if `append_images` is not empty, all frames will be saved.

**append_images**

    

A list of images to append as additional pictures. Each of the images in the
list can be single or multiframe images.

Added in version 9.3.0.

### MSP¶

Pillow identifies and reads MSP files from Windows 1 and 2. The library writes
uncompressed (Windows 1) versions of this format.

### PCX¶

Pillow reads and writes PCX files containing `1`, `L`, `P`, or `RGB` data.

### PFM¶

Added in version 10.3.0.

Pillow reads and writes grayscale (Pf format) Portable FloatMap (PFM) files
containing `F` data.

Color (PF format) PFM files are not supported.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open")
function sets the following
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
properties:

**scale**

    

The absolute value of the number stored in the _Scale Factor / Endianness_
line.

### PNG¶

Pillow identifies, reads, and writes PNG files containing `1`, `L`, `LA`, `I`,
`P`, `RGB` or `RGBA` data. Interlaced files are supported as of v1.1.7.

As of Pillow 6.0, EXIF data can be read from PNG images. However, unlike other
image formats, EXIF data is not guaranteed to be present in
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
until [`load()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.load
"PIL.Image.Image.load") has been called.

By default Pillow doesn’t allow loading of truncated PNG files, set
[`ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES`](../reference/ImageFile.html#PIL.ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES
"PIL.ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES") to override this.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open")
function sets the following
[`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info "PIL.Image.Image.info")
properties, when appropriate:

**chromaticity**

    

The chromaticity points, as an 8 tuple of floats. (`White Point X`, `White
Point Y`, `Red X`, `Red Y`, `Green X`, `Green Y`, `Blue X`, `Blue Y`)

**gamma**

    

Gamma, given as a floating point number.

**srgb**

    

The sRGB rendering intent as an integer.

>   * 0 Perceptual
>
>   * 1 Relative Colorimetric
>
>   * 2 Saturation
>
>   * 3 Absolute Colorimetric
>
>

**transparency**

    

For `P` images: Either the palette index for full transparent pixels, or a
byte string with alpha values for each palette entry.

For `1`, `L`, `I` and `RGB` images, the color that represents full transparent
pixels in this image.

This key is omitted if the image is not a transparent palette image.

`open` also sets `Image.text` to a dictionary of the values of the `tEXt`,
`zTXt`, and `iTXt` chunks of the PNG image. Individual compressed chunks are
limited to a decompressed size of
[`PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_CHUNK`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_CHUNK
"PIL.PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_CHUNK"), by default 1MB, to prevent decompression
bombs. Additionally, the total size of all of the text chunks is limited to
[`PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_MEMORY`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_MEMORY
"PIL.PngImagePlugin.MAX_TEXT_MEMORY"), defaulting to 64MB.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**optimize**

    

If present and true, instructs the PNG writer to make the output file as small
as possible. This includes extra processing in order to find optimal encoder
settings.

**transparency**

    

For `P`, `1`, `L`, `I`, and `RGB` images, this option controls what color from
the image to mark as transparent.

For `P` images, this can be a either the palette index, or a byte string with
alpha values for each palette entry.

**dpi**

    

A tuple of two numbers corresponding to the desired dpi in each direction.

**pnginfo**

    

A [`PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngInfo`](../PIL.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngInfo
"PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngInfo") instance containing chunks.

**compress_level**

    

ZLIB compression level, a number between 0 and 9: 1 gives best speed, 9 gives
best compression, 0 gives no compression at all. Default is 6. When `optimize`
option is True `compress_level` has no effect (it is set to 9 regardless of a
value passed).

**icc_profile**

    

The ICC Profile to include in the saved file.

**exif**

    

The exif data to include in the saved file.

Added in version 6.0.0.

**bits (experimental)**

    

For `P` images, this option controls how many bits to store. If omitted, the
PNG writer uses 8 bits (256 colors).

**dictionary (experimental)**

    

Set the ZLIB encoder dictionary.

Note

To enable PNG support, you need to build and install the ZLIB compression
library before building the Python Imaging Library. See the [installation
documentation](../installation.html) for details.

#### APNG sequences¶

The PNG loader includes limited support for reading and writing Animated
Portable Network Graphics (APNG) files. When an APNG file is loaded,
[`get_format_mimetype()`](../reference/ImageFile.html#PIL.ImageFile.ImageFile.get_format_mimetype
"PIL.ImageFile.ImageFile.get_format_mimetype") will return `"image/apng"`. The
value of the
[`is_animated`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.is_animated
"PIL.Image.Image.is_animated") property will be `True` when the
[`n_frames`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.n_frames
"PIL.Image.Image.n_frames") property is greater than 1. For APNG files, the
`n_frames` property depends on both the animation frame count as well as the
presence or absence of a default image. See the `default_image` property
documentation below for more details. The
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") methods are supported.

`im.seek()` raises an
[`EOFError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError "\(in
Python v3.14\)") if you try to seek after the last frame.

These [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties will be set for APNG frames, where
applicable:

**default_image**

    

Specifies whether or not this APNG file contains a separate default image,
which is not a part of the actual APNG animation.

When an APNG file contains a default image, the initially loaded image (i.e.
the result of `seek(0)`) will be the default image. To account for the
presence of the default image, the
[`n_frames`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.n_frames
"PIL.Image.Image.n_frames") property will be set to `frame_count + 1`, where
`frame_count` is the actual APNG animation frame count. To load the first APNG
animation frame, `seek(1)` must be called.

  * `True` \- The APNG contains default image, which is not an animation frame.

  * `False` \- The APNG does not contain a default image. The `n_frames` property will be set to the actual APNG animation frame count. The initially loaded image (i.e. `seek(0)`) will be the first APNG animation frame.

**loop**

    

The number of times to loop this APNG, 0 indicates infinite looping.

**duration**

    

The time to display this APNG frame (in milliseconds).

Note

The APNG loader returns images the same size as the APNG file’s logical screen
size. The returned image contains the pixel data for a given frame, after
applying any APNG frame disposal and frame blend operations (i.e. it contains
what a web browser would render for this frame - the composite of all previous
frames and this frame).

Any APNG file containing sequence errors is treated as an invalid image. The
APNG loader will not attempt to repair and reorder files containing sequence
errors.

#### Saving¶

When calling [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save"), by default only a single frame PNG file will be
saved. To save an APNG file (including a single frame APNG), the `save_all`
parameter should be set to `True` or `append_images` should not be empty. The
following parameters can also be set:

**default_image**

    

Boolean value, specifying whether or not the base image is a default image. If
`True`, the base image will be used as the default image, and the first image
from the `append_images` sequence will be the first APNG animation frame. If
`False`, the base image will be used as the first APNG animation frame.
Defaults to `False`.

**append_images**

    

A list or tuple of images to append as additional frames. Each of the images
in the list can be single or multiframe images. The size of each frame should
match the size of the base image. Also note that if a frame’s mode does not
match that of the base image, the frame will be converted to the base image
mode.

**loop**

    

Integer number of times to loop this APNG, 0 indicates infinite looping.
Defaults to 0.

**duration**

    

Integer (or list or tuple of integers) length of time to display this APNG
frame (in milliseconds). Defaults to 0.

**disposal**

    

An integer (or list or tuple of integers) specifying the APNG disposal
operation to be used for this frame before rendering the next frame. Defaults
to 0.

  * 0 ([`OP_NONE`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_NONE "PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_NONE"), default) - No disposal is done on this frame before rendering the next frame.

  * 1 ([`PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_BACKGROUND`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_BACKGROUND "PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_BACKGROUND")) - This frame’s modified region is cleared to fully transparent black before rendering the next frame.

  * 2 ([`OP_PREVIOUS`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_PREVIOUS "PIL.PngImagePlugin.Disposal.OP_PREVIOUS")) - This frame’s modified region is reverted to the previous frame’s contents before rendering the next frame.

**blend**

    

An integer (or list or tuple of integers) specifying the APNG blend operation
to be used for this frame before rendering the next frame. Defaults to 0.

  * 0 ([`OP_SOURCE`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.Blend.OP_SOURCE "PIL.PngImagePlugin.Blend.OP_SOURCE")) - All color components of this frame, including alpha, overwrite the previous output image contents.

  * 1 ([`OP_OVER`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.PngImagePlugin.Blend.OP_OVER "PIL.PngImagePlugin.Blend.OP_OVER")) - This frame should be alpha composited with the previous output image contents.

Note

The `duration`, `disposal` and `blend` parameters can be set to lists or
tuples to specify values for each individual frame in the animation. The
length of the list or tuple must be identical to the total number of actual
frames in the APNG animation. If the APNG contains a default image (i.e.
`default_image` is set to `True`), these list or tuple parameters should not
include an entry for the default image.

### PPM¶

Pillow reads and writes PBM, PGM, PPM and PNM files containing `1`, `L`, `I`
or `RGB` data.

“Raw” (P4 to P6) formats can be read, and are used when writing.

Since Pillow 9.2.0, “plain” (P1 to P3) formats can be read as well.

### QOI¶

Added in version 9.5.0.

Pillow reads and writes images in Quite OK Image format using a Python codec.
If you wish to write code specifically for this format,
[qoi](https://pypi.org/project/qoi/) is an alternative library that uses C to
decode the image and interfaces with NumPy.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**colorspace**

    

If set to “sRGB”, the colorspace will be written as sRGB with linear alpha,
instead of all channels being linear.

### SGI¶

Pillow reads and writes uncompressed `L`, `RGB`, and `RGBA` files.

### SPIDER¶

Pillow reads and writes SPIDER image files of 32-bit floating point data
(“F;32F”).

Pillow also reads SPIDER stack files containing sequences of SPIDER images.
The [`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") methods are supported, and random access is allowed.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following attributes:

**format**

    

Set to `SPIDER`

**istack**

    

Set to 1 if the file is an image stack, else 0.

**n_frames**

    

Set to the number of images in the stack.

A convenience method,
[`convert2byte()`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.SpiderImagePlugin.SpiderImageFile.convert2byte
"PIL.SpiderImagePlugin.SpiderImageFile.convert2byte"), is provided for
converting floating point data to byte data (mode `L`):

    
    
    im = Image.open("image001.spi").convert2byte()
    

#### Saving¶

The extension of SPIDER files may be any 3 alphanumeric characters. Therefore
the output format must be specified explicitly:

    
    
    im.save('newimage.spi', format='SPIDER')
    

For more information about the SPIDER image processing package, see
<https://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER>

### TGA¶

Pillow reads and writes TGA images containing `L`, `LA`, `P`, `RGB`, and
`RGBA` data. Pillow can read and write both uncompressed and run-length
encoded TGAs.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**compression**

    

If set to “tga_rle”, the file will be run-length encoded.

Added in version 5.3.0.

**id_section**

    

The identification field.

Added in version 5.3.0.

**orientation**

    

If present and a positive number, the first pixel is for the top left corner,
rather than the bottom left corner.

Added in version 5.3.0.

### TIFF¶

Pillow reads and writes TIFF files. It can read both striped and tiled images,
pixel and plane interleaved multi-band images. If you have libtiff and its
headers installed, Pillow can read and write many kinds of compressed TIFF
files. If not, Pillow will only read and write uncompressed files.

Note

Beginning in version 5.0.0, Pillow requires libtiff to read or write
compressed files. Prior to that release, Pillow had buggy support for reading
Packbits, LZW and JPEG compressed TIFFs without using libtiff.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**compression**

    

Compression mode.

Added in version 2.0.0.

**dpi**

    

Image resolution as an `(xdpi, ydpi)` tuple, where applicable. You can use the
[`tag`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag") attribute to get more detailed
information about the image resolution.

Added in version 1.1.5.

**resolution**

    

Image resolution as an `(xres, yres)` tuple, where applicable. This is a
measurement in whichever unit is specified by the file.

Added in version 1.1.5.

The
[`tag_v2`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag_v2
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag_v2") attribute contains a dictionary of
TIFF metadata. The keys are numerical indexes from
[`TiffTags.TAGS_V2`](../reference/TiffTags.html#PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.TAGS_V2
"PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.TAGS_V2"). Values are strings or numbers for single
items, multiple values are returned in a tuple of values. Rational numbers are
returned as a
[`IFDRational`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.IFDRational
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.IFDRational") object.

> Added in version 3.0.0.

For compatibility with legacy code, the
[`tag`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.TiffImageFile.tag") attribute contains a dictionary of
decoded TIFF fields as returned prior to version 3.0.0. Values are returned as
either strings or tuples of numeric values. Rational numbers are returned as a
tuple of `(numerator, denominator)`.

> Deprecated since version 3.0.0.

#### Reading multi-frame TIFF images¶

The TIFF loader supports the
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") methods, taking and returning frame numbers within the
image file. You can combine these methods to seek to the next frame
(`im.seek(im.tell() + 1)`). Frames are numbered from 0 to `im.n_frames - 1`,
and can be accessed in any order.

`im.seek()` raises an
[`EOFError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError "\(in
Python v3.14\)") if you try to seek after the last frame.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**save_all**

    

If true, or if `append_images` is not empty, Pillow will save all frames of
the image to a multiframe tiff document.

Added in version 3.4.0.

**append_images**

    

A list of images to append as additional frames. Each of the images in the
list can be single or multiframe images.

Added in version 4.2.0.

**tiffinfo**

    

A
[`ImageFileDirectory_v2`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2") object or dict object containing
tiff tags and values. The TIFF field type is autodetected for Numeric and
string values, any other types require using an
[`ImageFileDirectory_v2`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2") object and setting the type in
[`tagtype`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2.tagtype
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2.tagtype") with the appropriate
numerical value from
[`TiffTags.TYPES`](../reference/TiffTags.html#PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.TYPES
"PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.TYPES").

Added in version 2.3.0.

Metadata values that are of the rational type should be passed in using a
[`IFDRational`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.IFDRational
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.IFDRational") object.

Added in version 3.1.0.

For compatibility with legacy code, a
[`ImageFileDirectory_v1`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v1
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v1") object may be passed in this
field. However, this is deprecated.

Added in version 5.4.0.

Previous versions only supported some tags when writing using libtiff. The
supported list is found in
[`TiffTags.LIBTIFF_CORE`](../reference/TiffTags.html#PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.LIBTIFF_CORE
"PIL.TiffTags.PIL.TiffTags.LIBTIFF_CORE").

Added in version 6.1.0.

Added support for signed types (e.g. `TIFF_SIGNED_LONG`) and multiple values.
Multiple values for a single tag must be to
[`ImageFileDirectory_v2`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2") as a tuple and require a matching
type in
[`tagtype`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2.tagtype
"PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2.tagtype") tagtype.

**exif**

    

Alternate keyword to “tiffinfo”, for consistency with other formats.

Added in version 8.4.0.

**big_tiff**

    

If true, the image will be saved as a BigTIFF.

Added in version 11.1.0.

**compression**

    

A string containing the desired compression method for the file. (valid only
with libtiff installed) Valid compression methods are:
[`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "\(in Python
v3.14\)"), `"group3"`, `"group4"`, `"jpeg"`, `"lzma"`, `"packbits"`,
`"tiff_adobe_deflate"`, `"tiff_ccitt"`, `"tiff_lzw"`, `"tiff_raw_16"`,
`"tiff_sgilog"`, `"tiff_sgilog24"`, `"tiff_thunderscan"`, `"webp"`, `"zstd"`

**quality**

    

The image quality for JPEG compression, on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100
(best). The default is 75.

Added in version 6.1.0.

These arguments to set the tiff header fields are an alternative to using the
general tags available through tiffinfo.

**description**

**software**

**date_time**

**artist**

**copyright**

    

Strings

**icc_profile**

    

The ICC Profile to include in the saved file.

**resolution_unit**

    

An integer. 1 for no unit, 2 for inches and 3 for centimeters.

**resolution**

    

Either an integer or a float, used for both the x and y resolution.

**x_resolution**

    

Either an integer or a float.

**y_resolution**

    

Either an integer or a float.

**dpi**

    

A tuple of `(x_resolution, y_resolution)`, with inches as the resolution unit.
For consistency with other image formats, the x and y resolutions of the dpi
will be rounded to the nearest integer.

### WebP¶

Pillow reads and writes WebP files. Requires libwebp v0.5.0 or later.

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method supports the following options:

**lossless**

    

If present and true, instructs the WebP writer to use lossless compression.

**quality**

    

Integer, 0-100, defaults to 80. For lossy, 0 gives the smallest size and 100
the largest. For lossless, this parameter is the amount of effort put into the
compression: 0 is the fastest, but gives larger files compared to the slowest,
but best, 100.

**alpha_quality**

    

Integer, 0-100, defaults to 100. For lossy compression only. 0 gives the
smallest size and 100 is lossless.

**method**

    

Quality/speed trade-off (0=fast, 6=slower-better). Defaults to 4.

**exact**

    

If true, preserve the transparent RGB values. Otherwise, discard invisible RGB
values for better compression. Defaults to false.

**icc_profile**

    

The ICC Profile to include in the saved file.

**exif**

    

The exif data to include in the saved file.

**xmp**

    

The XMP data to include in the saved file.

#### Saving sequences¶

When calling [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") to write a WebP file, by default only the first frame
of a multiframe image will be saved. If the `save_all` argument is present and
true, or if `append_images` is not empty, all frames will be saved, and the
following options will also be available.

**append_images**

    

A list of images to append as additional frames. Each of the images in the
list can be single or multiframe images.

**duration**

    

The display duration of each frame, in milliseconds. Pass a single integer for
a constant duration, or a list or tuple to set the duration for each frame
separately.

**loop**

    

Number of times to repeat the animation. Defaults to [0 = infinite].

**background**

    

Background color of the canvas, as an RGBA tuple with values in the range of
(0-255).

**minimize_size**

    

If true, minimize the output size (slow). Implicitly disables key-frame
insertion.

**kmin, kmax**

    

Minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key frames in the output. The
library may insert some key frames as needed to satisfy this criteria. Note
that these conditions should hold: kmax > kmin and kmin >= kmax / 2 + 1. Also,
if kmax <= 0, then key-frame insertion is disabled; and if kmax == 1, then all
frames will be key-frames (kmin value does not matter for these special
cases).

**allow_mixed**

    

If true, use mixed compression mode; the encoder heuristically chooses between
lossy and lossless for each frame.

### XBM¶

Pillow reads and writes X bitmap files (mode `1`).

## Read-only formats¶

### CUR¶

CUR is used to store cursors on Windows. The CUR decoder reads the largest
available cursor. Animated cursors are not supported.

### DCX¶

DCX is a container file format for PCX files, defined by Intel. The DCX format
is commonly used in fax applications. The DCX decoder can read files
containing `1`, `L`, `P`, or `RGB` data.

When the file is opened, only the first image is read. You can use
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") or
[`ImageSequence`](../reference/ImageSequence.html#module-PIL.ImageSequence
"PIL.ImageSequence") to read other images.

### FITS¶

Added in version 9.1.0.

Pillow identifies and reads FITS files, commonly used for astronomy.
Uncompressed and GZIP_1 compressed images can be read.

### FLI, FLC¶

Pillow reads Autodesk FLI and FLC animations.

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**duration**

    

The delay (in milliseconds) between each frame.

### FPX¶

Pillow reads Kodak FlashPix files. Only the highest resolution image is read
from the file, and the viewing transform is not taken into account.

To enable FPX support, you must install
[olefile](https://pypi.org/project/olefile/).

Note

To enable full FlashPix support, you need to build and install the IJG JPEG
library before building the Python Imaging Library. See the distribution
README for details.

### FTEX¶

Added in version 3.2.0.

The FTEX decoder reads textures used for 3D objects in Independence War 2:
Edge Of Chaos. The plugin reads a single texture per file, in the compressed
and uncompressed formats.

### GBR¶

The GBR decoder reads GIMP brush files, version 1 and 2.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**comment**

    

The brush name.

**spacing**

    

The spacing between the brushes, in pixels. Version 2 only.

### GD¶

Pillow reads uncompressed GD2 files. Note that you must use
[`PIL.GdImageFile.open()`](../PIL.html#PIL.GdImageFile.open
"PIL.GdImageFile.open") to read such a file.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**transparency**

    

Transparency color index. This key is omitted if the image is not transparent.

### IMT¶

Pillow reads Image Tools images containing `L` data.

### IPTC/NAA¶

Pillow provides limited read support for IPTC/NAA newsphoto files.

### MCIDAS¶

Pillow identifies and reads 8-bit McIdas area files.

### MIC¶

Pillow identifies and reads Microsoft Image Composer (MIC) files. When opened,
the first sprite in the file is loaded. You can use
[`seek()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.seek
"PIL.Image.Image.seek") and
[`tell()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tell
"PIL.Image.Image.tell") to read other sprites from the file.

Note that there may be an embedded gamma of 2.2 in MIC files.

To enable MIC support, you must install
[olefile](https://pypi.org/project/olefile/).

### PCD¶

Pillow reads PhotoCD files containing `RGB` data. This only reads the 768x512
resolution image from the file. Higher resolutions are encoded in a
proprietary encoding.

### PIXAR¶

Pillow provides limited support for PIXAR raster files. The library can
identify and read “dumped” RGB files.

The format code is `PIXAR`.

### PSD¶

Pillow identifies and reads PSD files written by Adobe Photoshop 2.5 and 3.0.

### SUN¶

Pillow identifies and reads Sun raster files.

### WAL¶

Added in version 1.1.4.

Pillow reads Quake2 WAL texture files.

Note that this file format cannot be automatically identified, so you must use
the open function in the [`WalImageFile`](../PIL.html#module-PIL.WalImageFile
"PIL.WalImageFile") module to read files in this format.

By default, a Quake2 standard palette is attached to the texture. To override
the palette, use the
[`PIL.Image.Image.putpalette()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.putpalette
"PIL.Image.Image.putpalette") method.

### WMF, EMF¶

Pillow can identify WMF and EMF files.

On Windows, it can read WMF and EMF files. By default, it will load the image
at 72 dpi. To load it at another resolution:

    
    
    from PIL import Image
    
    with Image.open("drawing.wmf") as im:
        im.load(dpi=144)
    

To add other read or write support, use
[`PIL.WmfImagePlugin.register_handler()`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.WmfImagePlugin.register_handler
"PIL.WmfImagePlugin.register_handler") to register a WMF and EMF handler.

    
    
    from typing import IO
    
    from PIL import Image, ImageFile
    from PIL import WmfImagePlugin
    
    
    class WmfHandler(ImageFile.StubHandler):
        def open(self, im: ImageFile.StubImageFile) -> None:
            ...
    
        def load(self, im: ImageFile.StubImageFile) -> Image.Image:
            ...
            return image
    
        def save(self, im: Image.Image, fp: IO[bytes], filename: str) -> None:
            ...
    
    
    wmf_handler = WmfHandler()
    
    WmfImagePlugin.register_handler(wmf_handler)
    
    im = Image.open("sample.wmf")
    

### XPM¶

Pillow reads X pixmap files as P mode images if there are 256 colors or less,
and as RGB images otherwise.

#### Opening¶

The [`open()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open "PIL.Image.open") method
sets the following [`info`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.info
"PIL.Image.Image.info") properties:

**transparency**

    

Transparency color index. This key is omitted if the image is not transparent.

### XV thumbnails¶

Pillow can read XV thumbnail files.

## Write-only formats¶

### PALM¶

Pillow provides write-only support for PALM pixmap files.

The format code is `Palm`, the extension is `.palm`.

### PDF¶

Pillow can write PDF (Acrobat) images. Such images are written as binary PDF
1.4 files. Different encoding methods are used, depending on the image mode.

  * 1 mode images are saved using TIFF encoding, or JPEG encoding if libtiff support is unavailable

  * L, RGB and CMYK mode images use JPEG encoding

  * P mode images use HEX encoding

  * LA and RGBA mode images use JPEG2000 encoding

#### Saving¶

The [`save()`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save
"PIL.Image.Image.save") method can take the following keyword arguments:

**save_all**

    

If a multiframe image is used, by default, only the first image will be saved.
To save all frames, each frame to a separate page of the PDF, the `save_all`
parameter should be present and set to `True` or `append_images` should not be
empty.

Added in version 3.0.0.

**append_images**

    

A list of [`PIL.Image.Image`](../reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image
"PIL.Image.Image") objects to append as additional pages. Each of the images
in the list can be single or multiframe images.

Added in version 4.2.0.

**append**

    

Set to True to append pages to an existing PDF file. If the file doesn’t
exist, an
[`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "\(in
Python v3.14\)") will be raised.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**resolution**

    

Image resolution in DPI. This, together with the number of pixels in the
image, will determine the physical dimensions of the page that will be saved
in the PDF.

**dpi**

    

A tuple of `(x_resolution, y_resolution)`, with inches as the resolution unit.
If both the `resolution` parameter and the `dpi` parameter are present,
`resolution` will be ignored.

**title**

    

The document’s title. If not appending to an existing PDF file, this will
default to the filename.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**author**

    

The name of the person who created the document.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**subject**

    

The subject of the document.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**keywords**

    

Keywords associated with the document.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**creator**

    

If the document was converted to PDF from another format, the name of the
conforming product that created the original document from which it was
converted.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**producer**

    

If the document was converted to PDF from another format, the name of the
conforming product that converted it to PDF.

Added in version 5.1.0.

**creationDate**

    

The creation date of the document. If not appending to an existing PDF file,
this will default to the current time.

Added in version 5.3.0.

**modDate**

    

The modification date of the document. If not appending to an existing PDF
file, this will default to the current time.

Added in version 5.3.0.

## Identify-only formats¶

### BUFR¶

Added in version 1.1.3.

Pillow provides a stub driver for BUFR files.

To add read or write support to your application, use
[`PIL.BufrStubImagePlugin.register_handler()`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.BufrStubImagePlugin.register_handler
"PIL.BufrStubImagePlugin.register_handler").

### GRIB¶

Added in version 1.1.5.

Pillow provides a stub driver for GRIB files.

The driver requires the file to start with a GRIB header. If you have files
with embedded GRIB data, or files with multiple GRIB fields, your application
has to seek to the header before passing the file handle to Pillow.

To add read or write support to your application, use
[`PIL.GribStubImagePlugin.register_handler()`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.GribStubImagePlugin.register_handler
"PIL.GribStubImagePlugin.register_handler").

### HDF5¶

Added in version 1.1.5.

Pillow provides a stub driver for HDF5 files.

To add read or write support to your application, use
[`PIL.Hdf5StubImagePlugin.register_handler()`](../reference/plugins.html#PIL.Hdf5StubImagePlugin.register_handler
"PIL.Hdf5StubImagePlugin.register_handler").

### MPEG¶
