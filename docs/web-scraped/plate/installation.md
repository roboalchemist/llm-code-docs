for a rich, pre-configured editor experience, especially if you're using or plan to use
shadcn/ui
.
Install Plate UI
Begin by following the
Plate UI Installation Guide
. This guide covers installing core dependencies and setting up Plate UI components.
Basic Usage
Once Plate UI is set up, choose the guide that matches your React application type:
Next.js
- For server-side rendered applications
React
- For client-side applications (Vite, React Router, etc.)
Option 2: Manual Setup
For projects not using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, or those requiring a framework-agnostic solution, follow the
Manual Installation Guide
for detailed instructions.
You can always integrate Plate UI components into a manual setup later.
Server-Side Integration
