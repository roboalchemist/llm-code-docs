4.12 Scripting

Scripts allow authors to add interactivity to their documents.

Authors are encouraged to use declarative alternatives to scripting where possible, as declarative mechanisms are often more maintainable, and many users disable scripting.

For example, instead of using a script to show or hide a section to show more details, the details element could be used.

Authors are also encouraged to make their applications degrade gracefully in the absence of scripting support.

For example, if an author provides a link in a table header to dynamically resort the table, the link could also be made to function without scripts by requesting the sorted table from the server.

The script element allows authors to include dynamic script, instructions to the user agent, and data blocks in their documents. The element does not represent content for the user.

✔MDN

The script element has two core attributes. The type attribute allows customization of the type of script represented:

Omitting the attribute, setting it to the empty string, or setting it to a JavaScript MIME type essence match means that the script is a classic script, to be interpreted according to the JavaScript Script top-level production. Authors should omit the type attribute instead of redundantly setting it.

Setting the attribute to an ASCII case-insensitive match for "module" means that the script is a JavaScript module script, to be interpreted according to the JavaScript Module top-level production.

Setting the attribute to an ASCII case-insensitive match for "importmap" means that the script is an import map, containing JSON that will be used to control the behavior of module specifier resolution.

Setting the attribute to an ASCII case-insensitive match for "speculationrules" means that the script defines a speculation rule set, containing JSON that will be used to describe speculative loads.

Setting the attribute to any other value means that the script is a data block, which is not processed by the user agent, but instead by author script or other tools. Authors must use a valid MIME type string that is not a JavaScript MIME type essence match to denote data blocks.

The requirement that data blocks must be denoted using a valid MIME type string is in place to avoid potential future collisions. Values for the type attribute that are not MIME types, like "module" or "importmap", are used by the standard to denote types of scripts which have special behavior in user agents. By using a valid MIME type string now, you ensure that your data block will not ever be reinterpreted as a different script type, even in future user agents.

The second core attribute is the src attribute. It must only be specified for classic scripts and JavaScript module scripts, and denotes that instead of using the element's child text content as the script content, the script will be fetched from the specified URL. If src is specified, it must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces.

Which other attributes may be specified on a given script element is determined by the following table:

	nomodule	async	defer	blocking	crossorigin	referrerpolicy	integrity	fetchpriority
External classic scripts	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
Inline classic scripts	Yes	·	·	·	Yes*	Yes*	·	·†
External module scripts	·	Yes	·	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
Inline module scripts	·	Yes	·	·	Yes*	Yes*	·	·†
Import maps	·	·	·	·	·	·	·	·
Speculation rules	·	·	·	·	·	·	·	·
Data blocks	·	·	·	·	·	·	·	·

* Although inline scripts have no initial fetches, the crossorigin and referrerpolicy attribute on inline scripts affects the credentials mode and referrer policy used by module imports, including dynamic import().

† Unlike crossorigin and referrerpolicy, fetchpriority does not affect module imports. See some discussion in issue #10276.

The contents of inline script elements, or the external script resource, must conform with the requirements of the JavaScript specification's Script or Module productions, for classic scripts and JavaScript module scripts respectively. [JAVASCRIPT]

The contents of inline script elements for import maps must conform with the import map authoring requirements.

The contents of inline script elements for speculation rule sets must conform with the speculation rule set authoring requirements.

When used to include data blocks, the data must be embedded inline, the format of the data must be given using the type attribute, and the contents of the script element must conform to the requirements defined for the format used.

The nomodule attribute is a boolean attribute that prevents a script from being executed in user agents that support module scripts. This allows selective execution of module scripts in modern user agents and classic scripts in older user agents, as shown below.

✔MDN

The async and defer attributes are boolean attributes that indicate how the script should be evaluated. There are several possible modes that can be selected using these attributes, depending on the script's type.

For external classic scripts, if the async attribute is present, then the classic script will be fetched in parallel to parsing and evaluated as soon as it is available (potentially before parsing completes). If the async attribute is not present but the defer attribute is present, then the classic script will be fetched in parallel and evaluated when the page has finished parsing. If neither attribute is present, then the script is fetched and evaluated immediately, blocking parsing until these are both complete.

For module scripts, if the async attribute is present, then the module script and all its dependencies will be fetched in parallel to parsing, and the module script will be evaluated as soon as it is available (potentially before parsing completes). Otherwise, the module script and its dependencies will be fetched in parallel to parsing and evaluated when the page has finished parsing. (The defer attribute has no effect on module scripts.)

This is all summarized in the following schematic diagram:

The exact processing details for these attributes are, for mostly historical reasons, somewhat non-trivial, involving a number of aspects of HTML. The implementation requirements are therefore by necessity scattered throughout the specification. The algorithms below describe the core of this processing, but these algorithms reference and are referenced by the parsing rules for script start and end tags in HTML, in foreign content, and in XML, the rules for the document.write() method, the handling of scripting, etc.

When inserted using the document.write() method, script elements usually execute (typically blocking further script execution or HTML parsing). When inserted using the innerHTML and outerHTML attributes, they do not execute at all.

The defer attribute may be specified even if the async attribute is specified, to cause legacy web browsers that only support defer (and not async) to fall back to the defer behavior instead of the blocking behavior that is the default.

The blocking attribute is a blocking attribute.

The crossorigin attribute is a CORS settings attribute. For external classic scripts, it controls whether error information will be exposed, when the script is obtained from other origins. For external module scripts, it controls the credentials mode used for the initial fetch of the module source, if cross-origin. For both classic and module scripts, it controls the credentials mode used for cross-origin module imports.

Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching.

The referrerpolicy attribute is a referrer policy attribute. Its sets the referrer policy used for the initial fetch of an external script, as well as the fetching of any imported module scripts. [REFERRERPOLICY]

An example of a script element's referrer policy being used when fetching imported scripts but not other subresources:

<script referrerpolicy="origin">
  fetch('/api/data');    // not fetched with <script>'s referrer policy
  import('./utils.mjs'); // is fetched with <script>'s referrer policy ("origin" in this case)
</script>

The integrity attribute sets the integrity metadata used for the initial fetch of an external script. The value must match the requirements of the integrity attribute. [SRI]

The fetchpriority attribute is a fetch priority attribute. Its sets the priority used for the initial fetch of an external script.

Changing any of these attributes dynamically has no direct effect; these attributes are only used at specific times described in the processing model.

The crossOrigin IDL attribute must reflect the crossorigin content attribute, limited to only known values.

✔MDN

The referrerPolicy IDL attribute must reflect the referrerpolicy content attribute, limited to only known values.

The fetchPriority IDL attribute must reflect the fetchpriority content attribute, limited to only known values.

The async getter steps are:

If this's force async is true, then return true.

If this's async content attribute is present, then return true.

Return false.

The async setter steps are:

Set this's force async to false.

If the given value is true, then set this's async content attribute to the empty string.

Otherwise, remove this's async content attribute.

script.text [ = value ]

Returns the child text content of the element.

script.text = value

Replaces the element's children with the text given by value.

HTMLScriptElement.supports(type)

Returns true if the given type is a script type supported by the user agent. The possible script types in this specification are "classic", "module", and "importmap", but others might be added in the future.

The text getter steps are to return this's child text content.

The text setter steps are to string replace all with the given value within this.

✔MDN

The static supports(type) method steps are:

If type is "classic", then return true.

If type is "module", then return true.

If type is "importmap", then return true.

If type is "speculationrules", then return true.

Return false.

The type argument has to exactly match these values; we do not perform an ASCII case-insensitive match. This is different from how type content attribute values are treated, and how DOMTokenList's supports() method works, but it aligns with the WorkerType enumeration used in the Worker() constructor.

In this example, two script elements are used. One embeds an external classic script, and the other includes some data as a data block.

<script src="game-engine.js"></script>
<script type="text/x-game-map">
........U.........e
o............A....e
.....A.....AAA....e
.A..AAA...AAAAA...e
</script>

The data in this case might be used by the script to generate the map of a video game. The data doesn't have to be used that way, though; maybe the map data is actually embedded in other parts of the page's markup, and the data block here is just used by the site's search engine to help users who are looking for particular features in their game maps.

The following sample shows how a script element can be used to define a function that is then used by other parts of the document, as part of a classic script. It also shows how a script element can be used to invoke script while the document is being parsed, in this case to initialize the form's output.

<script>
 function calculate(form) {
   var price = 52000;
   if (form.elements.brakes.checked)
     price += 1000;
   if (form.elements.radio.checked)
     price += 2500;
   if (form.elements.turbo.checked)
     price += 5000;
   if (form.elements.sticker.checked)
     price += 250;
   form.elements.result.value = price;
 }
</script>
<form name="pricecalc" onsubmit="return false" onchange="calculate(this)">
 <fieldset>
  <legend>Work out the price of your car</legend>
  <p>Base cost: £52000.</p>
  <p>Select additional options:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><label><input type=checkbox name=brakes> Ceramic brakes (£1000)</label></li>
   <li><label><input type=checkbox name=radio> Satellite radio (£2500)</label></li>
   <li><label><input type=checkbox name=turbo> Turbo charger (£5000)</label></li>
   <li><label><input type=checkbox name=sticker> "XZ" sticker (£250)</label></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Total: £<output name=result></output></p>
 </fieldset>
 <script>
  calculate(document.forms.pricecalc);
 </script>
</form>

The following sample shows how a script element can be used to include an external JavaScript module script.

<script type="module" src="app.mjs"></script>

This module, and all its dependencies (expressed through JavaScript import statements in the source file), will be fetched. Once the entire resulting module graph has been imported, and the document has finished parsing, the contents of app.mjs will be evaluated.

Additionally, if code from another script element in the same Window imports the module from app.mjs (e.g. via import "./app.mjs";), then the same JavaScript module script created by the former script element will be imported.

This example shows how to include a JavaScript module script for modern user agents, and a classic script for older user agents:

<script type="module" src="app.mjs"></script>
<script nomodule defer src="classic-app-bundle.js"></script>

In modern user agents that support JavaScript module scripts, the script element with the nomodule attribute will be ignored, and the script element with a type of "module" will be fetched and evaluated (as a JavaScript module script). Conversely, older user agents will ignore the script element with a type of "module", as that is an unknown script type for them — but they will have no problem fetching and evaluating the other script element (as a classic script), since they do not implement the nomodule attribute.

The following sample shows how a script element can be used to write an inline JavaScript module script that performs a number of substitutions on the document's text, in order to make for a more interesting reading experience (e.g. on a news site): [XKCD1288]

<script type="module">
 import { walkAllTextNodeDescendants } from "./dom-utils.mjs";

 const substitutions = new Map([
   ["witnesses", "these dudes I know"]
   ["allegedly", "kinda probably"]
   ["new study", "Tumblr post"]
   ["rebuild", "avenge"]
   ["space", "spaaace"]
   ["Google glass", "Virtual Boy"]
   ["smartphone", "Pokédex"]
   ["electric", "atomic"]
   ["Senator", "Elf-Lord"]
   ["car", "cat"]
   ["election", "eating contest"]
   ["Congressional leaders", "river spirits"]
   ["homeland security", "Homestar Runner"]
   ["could not be reached for comment", "is guilty and everyone knows it"]
 ]);

 function substitute(textNode) {
   for (const [before, after] of substitutions.entries()) {
     textNode.data = textNode.data.replace(new RegExp(`\\b${before}\\b`, "ig"), after);
   }
 }

 walkAllTextNodeDescendants(document.body, substitute);
</script>

Some notable features gained by using a JavaScript module script include the ability to import functions from other JavaScript modules, strict mode by default, and how top-level declarations do not introduce new properties onto the global object. Also note that no matter where this script element appears in the document, it will not be evaluated until both document parsing has complete and its dependency (dom-utils.mjs) has been fetched and evaluated.

The following sample shows how a JSON module script can be imported from inside a JavaScript module script:

<script type="module">
 import peopleInSpace from "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json" with { type: "json" };

 const list = document.querySelector("#people-in-space");
 for (const { craft, name } of peopleInSpace.people) {
   const li = document.createElement("li");
   li.textContent = `${name} / ${craft}`;
   list.append(li);
 }
</script>

MIME type checking for module scripts is strict. In order for the fetch of the JSON module script to succeed, the HTTP response must have a JSON MIME type, for example Content-Type: text/json. On the other hand, if the with { type: "json" } part of the statement is omitted, it is assumed that the intent is to import a JavaScript module script, and the fetch will fail if the HTTP response has a MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type.

4.12.1.1 Processing model

A script element has several associated pieces of state.

A script element has a parser document, which is either null or a Document, initially null. It is set by the HTML parser and the XML parser on script elements they insert, and affects the processing of those elements. script elements with non-null parser documents are known as parser-inserted.

A script element has a preparation-time document, which is either null or a Document, initially null. It is used to prevent scripts that move between documents during preparation from executing.

A script element has a force async boolean, initially true. It is set to false by the HTML parser and the XML parser on script elements they insert, and when the element gets an async content attribute added.

A script element has a from an external file boolean, initially false. It is determined when the script is prepared, based on the src attribute of the element at that time.

A script element has a ready to be parser-executed boolean, initially false. This is used only used for elements that are also parser-inserted, to let the parser know when to execute the script.

A script element has an already started boolean, initially false.

A script element has a delaying the load event boolean, initially false.

A script element has a type, which is either null, "classic", "module", "importmap", or "speculationrules", initially null. It is determined when the element is prepared, based on the type attribute of the element at that time.

A script element has a result, which is either "uninitialized", null (representing an error), a script, an import map parse result, or a speculation rules parse result. It is initially "uninitialized".

A script element has steps to run when the result is ready, which are a series of steps or null, initially null. To mark as ready a script element el given a result:

Set el's result to result.

If el's steps to run when the result is ready are not null, then run them.

Set el's steps to run when the result is ready to null.

Set el's delaying the load event to false.

A script element el is implicitly potentially render-blocking if el's type is "classic", el is parser-inserted, and el does not have an async or defer attribute.

The cloning steps for script elements given node, copy, and subtree are to set copy's already started to node's already started.

When an async attribute is added to a script element el, the user agent must set el's force async to false.

Whenever a script element el's delaying the load event is true, the user agent must delay the load event of el's preparation-time document.

The script HTML element post-connection steps, given insertedNode, are:

If insertedNode is parser-inserted, then return.

Prepare the script element given insertedNode.

The HTML element post-connection steps only run when the inserted element is still connected, which protects against cases where an earlier-inserted script removes a later-inserted script. For instance:

<script>
const script1 = document.createElement('script');
script1.innerText = `
  document.querySelector('#script2').remove();
`;

const script2 = document.createElement('script');
script2.id = 'script2';
script2.textContent = `console.log('script#2 running')`;

document.body.append(script1, script2);
</script>

Nothing is printed to the console in this example. By the time the HTML element post-connection steps run for the first script that was atomically inserted by append(), it can observe that the second script is already connected to the DOM, and it removes it from the DOM. Because the second script is no longer connected, its HTML element post-connection steps do not run, and it does not get prepared.

The script HTML element removing steps given removedNode are:

If removedNode's result is a speculation rules parse result, then:

Unregister speculation rules given removedNode's relevant global object and removedNode's result.

Set removedNode's already started to false.

Set removedNode's result to null.

The script children changed steps given changedNode are:

If the script element is not connected, then return.

Run the script HTML element post-connection steps, given changedNode.

This has an interesting implication on the execution order of a script element and any newly-inserted child script elements. Consider the following snippet:

<script id=outer-script></script>

<script>
  const outerScript = document.querySelector('#outer-script');

  const start = new Text('console.log(1);');
  const innerScript = document.createElement('script');
  innerScript.textContent = `console.log('inner script executing')`;
  const end = new Text('console.log(2);');

  outerScript.append(start, innerScript, end);

  // Logs:
  // 1
  // 2
  // inner script executing
</script>

By the time the second script block executes, the outer-script has already been prepared, but because it is empty, it did not execute and therefore is not marked as already started. The atomic insertion of the Text nodes and nested script element have the following effects:

All three child nodes get atomically inserted as children of outer-script; all of their insertion steps run, which have no observable consequences in this case.

The outer-script's children changed steps run, which prepares that script; because its body is now non-empty, this executes the contents of the two Text nodes, in order.

The script HTML element post-connection steps finally run for innerScript, causing its body to execute.

The following attribute change steps, given element, localName, oldValue, value, and namespace, are used for all script elements:

If namespace is not null, then return.

If localName is src and element is connected, then run the script HTML element post-connection steps, given element.

To prepare the script element given a script element el:

If el's already started is true, then return.

Let parser document be el's parser document.

Set el's parser document to null.

This is done so that if parser-inserted script elements fail to run when the parser tries to run them, e.g. because they are empty or specify an unsupported scripting language, another script can later mutate them and cause them to run again.

If parser document is non-null and el does not have an async attribute, then set el's force async to true.

This is done so that if a parser-inserted script element fails to run when the parser tries to run it, but it is later executed after a script dynamically updates it, it will execute in an async fashion even if the async attribute isn't set.

Let source text be el's child text content.

If el has no src attribute, and source text is the empty string, then return.

If el is not connected, then return.

If any of the following are true:

el has a type attribute whose value is the empty string;

el has no type attribute but it has a language attribute and that attribute's value is the empty string; or

el has neither a type attribute nor a language attribute,

then let the script block's type string for this script element be "text/javascript".

Otherwise, if el has a type attribute, then let the script block's type string be the value of that attribute with leading and trailing ASCII whitespace stripped.

Otherwise, el has a non-empty language attribute; let the script block's type string be the concatenation of "text/" and the value of el's language attribute.

The language attribute is never conforming, and is always ignored if there is a type attribute present.

If the script block's type string is a JavaScript MIME type essence match, then set el's type to "classic".

Otherwise, if the script block's type string is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "module", then set el's type to "module".

Otherwise, if the script block's type string is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "importmap", then set el's type to "importmap".

Otherwise, if the script block's type string is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "speculationrules", then set el's type to "speculationrules".

Otherwise, return. (No script is executed, and el's type is left as null.)

If parser document is non-null, then set el's parser document back to parser document and set el's force async to false.

Set el's already started to true.

Set el's preparation-time document to its node document.

If parser document is non-null, and parser document is not equal to el's preparation-time document, then return.

If scripting is disabled for el, then return.

The definition of scripting is disabled means that, amongst others, the following scripts will not execute: scripts in XMLHttpRequest's responseXML documents, scripts in DOMParser-created documents, scripts in documents created by XSLTProcessor's transformToDocument feature, and scripts that are first inserted by a script into a Document that was created using the createDocument() API. [XHR] [DOMPARSING] [XSLTP] [DOM]

If el has a nomodule content attribute and its type is "classic", then return.

This means specifying nomodule on a module script has no effect; the algorithm continues onward.

Let cspType be "script speculationrules" if el's type is "speculationrules"; otherwise, "script".

If el does not have a src content attribute, and the Should element's inline behavior be blocked by Content Security Policy? algorithm returns "Blocked" when given el, cspType, and source text, then return. [CSP]

If el has an event attribute and a for attribute, and el's type is "classic", then:

Let for be the value of el's for attribute.

Let event be the value of el's event attribute.

Strip leading and trailing ASCII whitespace from event and for.

If for is not an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "window", then return.

If event is not an ASCII case-insensitive match for either the string "onload" or the string "onload()", then return.

If el has a charset attribute, then let encoding be the result of getting an encoding from the value of the charset attribute.

If el does not have a charset attribute, or if getting an encoding failed, then let encoding be el's node document's the encoding.

If el's type is "module", this encoding will be ignored.

Let classic script CORS setting be the current state of el's crossorigin content attribute.

Let module script credentials mode be the CORS settings attribute credentials mode for el's crossorigin content attribute.

Let cryptographic nonce be el's [[CryptographicNonce]] internal slot's value.

If el has an integrity attribute, then let integrity metadata be that attribute's value.

Otherwise, let integrity metadata be the empty string.

Let referrer policy be the current state of el's referrerpolicy content attribute.

Let fetch priority be the current state of el's fetchpriority content attribute.

Let parser metadata be "parser-inserted" if el is parser-inserted, and "not-parser-inserted" otherwise.

Let options be a script fetch options whose cryptographic nonce is cryptographic nonce, integrity metadata is integrity metadata, parser metadata is parser metadata, credentials mode is module script credentials mode, referrer policy is referrer policy, and fetch priority is fetch priority.

Let settings object be el's node document's relevant settings object.

If el has a src content attribute, then:

If el's type is "importmap" or "speculationrules", then queue an element task on the DOM manipulation task source given el to fire an event named error at el, and return.

External import maps and speculation rules are not currently supported. See WICG/import-maps issue #235 and WICG/nav-speculation issue #348 for discussions on adding support.

Let src be the value of el's src attribute.

If src is the empty string, then queue an element task on the DOM manipulation task source given el to fire an event named error at el, and return.

Set el's from an external file to true.

Let url be the result of encoding-parsing a URL given src, relative to el's node document.

If url is failure, then queue an element task on the DOM manipulation task source given el to fire an event named error at el, and return.

If el is potentially render-blocking, then block rendering on el.

Set el's delaying the load event to true.

If el is currently render-blocking, then set options's render-blocking to true.

Let onComplete given result be the following steps:

Mark as ready el given result.

Switch on el's type:

"classic"

Fetch a classic script given url, settings object, options, classic script CORS setting, encoding, and onComplete.

"module"

If el does not have an integrity attribute, then set options's integrity metadata to the result of resolving a module integrity metadata with url and settings object.

Fetch an external module script graph given url, settings object, options, and onComplete.

For performance reasons, user agents may start fetching the classic script or module graph (as defined above) as soon as the src attribute is set, instead, in the hope that el will become connected (and that the crossorigin attribute won't change value in the meantime). Either way, once el becomes connected, the load must have started as described in this step. If the UA performs such prefetching, but el never becomes connected, or the src attribute is dynamically changed, or the crossorigin attribute is dynamically changed, then the user agent will not execute the script so obtained, and the fetching process will have been effectively wasted.

If el does not have a src content attribute:

Let base URL be el's node document's document base URL.

Switch on el's type:

"classic"

Let script be the result of creating a classic script using source text, settings object, base URL, and options.

Mark as ready el given script.

"module"

Set el's delaying the load event to true.

If el is potentially render-blocking, then:

Block rendering on el.

Set options's render-blocking to true.

Fetch an inline module script graph, given source text, base URL, settings object, options, and with the following steps given result:

Queue an element task on the networking task source given el to perform the following steps:

Mark as ready el given result.

Queueing a task here means that, even if the inline module script has no dependencies or synchronously results in a parse error, we won't proceed to execute the script element synchronously.

"importmap"

Let result be the result of creating an import map parse result given source text and base URL.

Mark as ready el given result.

"speculationrules"

Let result be the result of creating a speculation rules parse result given source text and el's node document.

Mark as ready el given result.

If el's type is "classic" and el has a src attribute, or el's type is "module":

Assert: el's result is "uninitialized".

If el has an async attribute or el's force async is true:

Let scripts be el's preparation-time document's set of scripts that will execute as soon as possible.

Append el to scripts.

Set el's steps to run when the result is ready to the following:

Execute the script element el.

Remove el from scripts.

Otherwise, if el is not parser-inserted:

Let scripts be el's preparation-time document's list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible.

Append el to scripts.

Set el's steps to run when the result is ready to the following:

If scripts[0] is not el, then abort these steps.

While scripts is not empty, and scripts[0]'s result is not "uninitialized":

Execute the script element scripts[0].

Remove scripts[0].

Otherwise, if el has a defer attribute or el's type is "module":

Append el to its parser document's list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing.

Set el's steps to run when the result is ready to the following: set el's ready to be parser-executed to true. (The parser will handle executing the script.)

Otherwise:

Set el's parser document's pending parsing-blocking script to el.

Block rendering on el.

Set el's steps to run when the result is ready to the following: set el's ready to be parser-executed to true. (The parser will handle executing the script.)

Otherwise:

Assert: el's result is not "uninitialized".

If all of the following are true:

el's type is "classic";
el is parser-inserted;
el's parser document has a style sheet that is blocking scripts; and
either the parser that created el is an XML parser, or it's an HTML parser whose script nesting level is not greater than one,

then:

Set el's parser document's pending parsing-blocking script to el.

Set el's ready to be parser-executed to true. (The parser will handle executing the script.)

Otherwise, immediately execute the script element el, even if other scripts are already executing.

Each Document has a pending parsing-blocking script, which is a script element or null, initially null.

Each Document has a set of scripts that will execute as soon as possible, which is a set of script elements, initially empty.

Each Document has a list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible, which is a list of script elements, initially empty.

Each Document has a list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing, which is a list of script elements, initially empty.

If a script element that blocks a parser gets moved to another Document before it would normally have stopped blocking that parser, it nonetheless continues blocking that parser until the condition that causes it to be blocking the parser no longer applies (e.g., if the script is a pending parsing-blocking script because the original Document has a style sheet that is blocking scripts when it was parsed, but then the script is moved to another Document before the blocking style sheet(s) loaded, the script still blocks the parser until the style sheets are all loaded, at which time the script executes and the parser is unblocked).

To execute the script element given a script element el:

Let document be el's node document.

If el's preparation-time document is not equal to document, then return.

Unblock rendering on el.

If el's result is null, then fire an event named error at el, and return.

If el's from an external file is true, or el's type is "module", then increment document's ignore-destructive-writes counter.

Switch on el's type:

"classic"

Let oldCurrentScript be the value to which document's currentScript object was most recently set.

If el's root is not a shadow root, then set document's currentScript attribute to el. Otherwise, set it to null.

This does not use the in a document tree check, as el could have been removed from the document prior to execution, and in that scenario currentScript still needs to point to it.

Run the classic script given by el's result.

Set document's currentScript attribute to oldCurrentScript.

"module"

Assert: document's currentScript attribute is null.

Run the module script given by el's result.

"importmap"

Register an import map given el's relevant global object and el's result.

"speculationrules"

Register speculation rules given el's relevant global object and el's result.

Decrement the ignore-destructive-writes counter of document, if it was incremented in the earlier step.

If el's from an external file is true, then fire an event named load at el.

4.12.1.2 Scripting languages

User agents are not required to support JavaScript. This standard needs to be updated if a language other than JavaScript comes along and gets similar wide adoption by web browsers. Until such a time, implementing other languages is in conflict with this standard, given the processing model defined for the script element.

Servers should use text/javascript for JavaScript resources, in accordance with Updates to ECMAScript Media Types. Servers should not use other JavaScript MIME types for JavaScript resources, and must not use non-JavaScript MIME types. [RFC9239]

For external JavaScript resources, MIME type parameters in `Content-Type` headers are generally ignored. (In some cases the `charset` parameter has an effect.) However, for the script element's type attribute they are significant; it uses the JavaScript MIME type essence match concept.

For example, scripts with their type attribute set to "text/javascript; charset=utf-8" will not be evaluated, even though that is a valid JavaScript MIME type when parsed.

Furthermore, again for external JavaScript resources, special considerations apply around `Content-Type` header processing as detailed in the prepare the script element algorithm and Fetch. [FETCH]

4.12.1.3 Restrictions for contents of script elements

The easiest and safest way to avoid the rather strange restrictions described in this section is to always escape an ASCII case-insensitive match for "<!--" as "\x3C!--", "<script" as "\x3Cscript", and "</script" as "\x3C/script" when these sequences appear in literals in scripts (e.g. in strings, regular expressions, or comments), and to avoid writing code that uses such constructs in expressions. Doing so avoids the pitfalls that the restrictions in this section are prone to triggering: namely, that, for historical reasons, parsing of script blocks in HTML is a strange and exotic practice that acts unintuitively in the face of these sequences.

The script element's descendant text content must match the script production in the following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode. [ABNF]

script        = outer *( comment-open inner comment-close outer )

outer         = < any string that doesn't contain a substring that matches not-in-outer >
not-in-outer  = comment-open
inner         = < any string that doesn't contain a substring that matches not-in-inner >
not-in-inner  = comment-close / script-open

comment-open  = "<!--"
comment-close = "-->"
script-open   = "<" s c r i p t tag-end

s             =  %x0053 ; U+0053 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S
s             =/ %x0073 ; U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S
c             =  %x0043 ; U+0043 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C
c             =/ %x0063 ; U+0063 LATIN SMALL LETTER C
r             =  %x0052 ; U+0052 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R
r             =/ %x0072 ; U+0072 LATIN SMALL LETTER R
i             =  %x0049 ; U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I
i             =/ %x0069 ; U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I
p             =  %x0050 ; U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P
p             =/ %x0070 ; U+0070 LATIN SMALL LETTER P
t             =  %x0054 ; U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T
t             =/ %x0074 ; U+0074 LATIN SMALL LETTER T

tag-end       =  %x0009 ; U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
tag-end       =/ %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
tag-end       =/ %x000C ; U+000C FORM FEED (FF)
tag-end       =/ %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
tag-end       =/ %x002F ; U+002F SOLIDUS (/)
tag-end       =/ %x003E ; U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (>)

When a script element contains script documentation, there are further restrictions on the contents of the element, as described in the section below.

The following script illustrates this issue. Suppose you have a script that contains a string, as in:

const example = 'Consider this string: <!-- <script>';
console.log(example);

If one were to put this string directly in a script block, it would violate the restrictions above:

<script>
  const example = 'Consider this string: <!-- <script>';
  console.log(example);
</script>

The bigger problem, though, and the reason why it would violate those restrictions, is that actually the script would get parsed weirdly: the script block above is not terminated. That is, what looks like a "</script>" end tag in this snippet is actually still part of the script block. The script doesn't execute (since it's not terminated); if it somehow were to execute, as it might if the markup looked as follows, it would fail because the script (highlighted here) is not valid JavaScript:

<script>
  const example = 'Consider this string: <!-- <script>';
  console.log(example);
</script>
<!-- despite appearances, this is actually part of the script still! -->
<script>
 ... // this is the same script block still...
</script>

What is going on here is that for legacy reasons, "<!--" and "<script" strings in script elements in HTML need to be balanced in order for the parser to consider closing the block.

By escaping the problematic strings as mentioned at the top of this section, the problem is avoided entirely:

<script>
  // Note: `\x3C` is an escape sequence for `<`.
  const example = 'Consider this string: \x3C!-- \x3Cscript>';
  console.log(example);
</script>
<!-- this is just a comment between script blocks -->
<script>
 ... // this is a new script block
</script>

It is possible for these sequences to naturally occur in script expressions, as in the following examples:

if (x<!--y) { ... }
if ( player<script ) { ... }

In such cases the characters cannot be escaped, but the expressions can be rewritten so that the sequences don't occur, as in:

if (x < !--y) { ... }
if (!--y > x) { ... }
if (!(--y) > x) { ... }
if (player < script) { ... }
if (script > player) { ... }

Doing this also avoids a different pitfall as well: for related historical reasons, the string "<!--" in classic scripts is actually treated as a line comment start, just like "//".

4.12.1.4 Inline documentation for external scripts

If a script element's src attribute is specified, then the contents of the script element, if any, must be such that the value of the text IDL attribute, which is derived from the element's contents, matches the documentation production in the following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode. [ABNF]

documentation = *( *( space / tab / comment ) [ line-comment ] newline )
comment       = slash star *( not-star / star not-slash ) 1*star slash
line-comment  = slash slash *not-newline

; characters
tab           = %x0009 ; U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
newline       = %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
space         = %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
star          = %x002A ; U+002A ASTERISK (*)
slash         = %x002F ; U+002F SOLIDUS (/)
not-newline   = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-10FFFF
                ; a scalar value other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
not-star      = %x0000-0029 / %x002B-10FFFF
                ; a scalar value other than U+002A ASTERISK (*)
not-slash     = %x0000-002E / %x0030-10FFFF
                ; a scalar value other than U+002F SOLIDUS (/)

This corresponds to putting the contents of the element in JavaScript comments.

This requirement is in addition to the earlier restrictions on the syntax of contents of script elements.

This allows authors to include documentation, such as license information or API information, inside their documents while still referring to external script files. The syntax is constrained so that authors don't accidentally include what looks like valid script while also providing a src attribute.

<script src="cool-effects.js">
 // create new instances using:
 //    var e = new Effect();
 // start the effect using .play, stop using .stop:
 //    e.play();
 //    e.stop();
</script>
4.12.1.5 Interaction of script elements and XSLT

This section is non-normative.

This specification does not define how XSLT interacts with the script element. However, in the absence of another specification actually defining this, here are some guidelines for implementers, based on existing implementations:

When an XSLT transformation program is triggered by an <?xml-stylesheet?> processing instruction and the browser implements a direct-to-DOM transformation, script elements created by the XSLT processor need to have its parser document set correctly, and run in document order (modulo scripts marked defer or async), immediately, as the transformation is occurring.

The XSLTProcessor transformToDocument() method adds elements to a Document object with a null browsing context, and, accordingly, any script elements they create need to have their already started set to true in the prepare the script element algorithm and never get executed (scripting is disabled). Such script elements still need to have their parser document set, though, such that their async IDL attribute will return false in the absence of an async content attribute.

The XSLTProcessor transformToFragment() method needs to create a fragment that is equivalent to one built manually by creating the elements using document.createElementNS(). For instance, it needs to create script elements with null parser document and with their already started set to false, so that they will execute when the fragment is inserted into a document.

The main distinction between the first two cases and the last case is that the first two operate on Documents and the last operates on a fragment.

4.12.2 The noscript element

The noscript element represents nothing if scripting is enabled, and represents its children if scripting is disabled. It is used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, by affecting how the document is parsed.

When used in HTML documents, the allowed content model is as follows:

In a head element, if scripting is disabled for the noscript element

The noscript element must contain only link, style, and meta elements.

In a head element, if scripting is enabled for the noscript element

The noscript element must contain only text, except that invoking the HTML fragment parsing algorithm with the noscript element as the context element and the text contents as the input must result in a list of nodes that consists only of link, style, and meta elements that would be conforming if they were children of the noscript element, and no parse errors.

Outside of head elements, if scripting is disabled for the noscript element

The noscript element's content model is transparent, with the additional restriction that a noscript element must not have a noscript element as an ancestor (that is, noscript can't be nested).

Outside of head elements, if scripting is enabled for the noscript element

The noscript element must contain only text, except that the text must be such that running the following algorithm results in a conforming document with no noscript elements and no script elements, and such that no step in the algorithm throws an exception or causes an HTML parser to flag a parse error:

Remove every script element from the document.
Make a list of every noscript element in the document. For every noscript element in that list, perform the following steps:
Let s be the child text content of the noscript element.
Set the outerHTML attribute of the noscript element to the value of s. (This, as a side-effect, causes the noscript element to be removed from the document.)

All these contortions are required because, for historical reasons, the noscript element is handled differently by the HTML parser based on whether scripting mode was Disabled when the parser was invoked.

The noscript element must not be used in XML documents.

The noscript element is only effective in the HTML syntax, it has no effect in the XML syntax. This is because the way it works is by essentially "turning off" the parser when scripts are enabled, so that the contents of the element are treated as pure text and not as real elements. XML does not define a mechanism by which to do this.

The noscript element has no other requirements. In particular, children of the noscript element are not exempt from form submission, scripting, and so forth, even when scripting is enabled for the element.

In the following example, a noscript element is used to provide fallback for a script.

<form action="calcSquare.php">
 <p>
  <label for=x>Number</label>:
  <input id="x" name="x" type="number">
 </p>
 <script>
  var x = document.getElementById('x');
  var output = document.createElement('p');
  output.textContent = 'Type a number; it will be squared right then!';
  x.form.appendChild(output);
  x.form.onsubmit = function () { return false; }
  x.oninput = function () {
    var v = x.valueAsNumber;
    output.textContent = v + ' squared is ' + v * v;
  };
 </script>
 <noscript>
  <input type=submit value="Calculate Square">
 </noscript>
</form>

When script is disabled, a button appears to do the calculation on the server side. When script is enabled, the value is computed on-the-fly instead.

The noscript element is a blunt instrument. Sometimes, scripts might be enabled, but for some reason the page's script might fail. For this reason, it's generally better to avoid using noscript, and to instead design the script to change the page from being a scriptless page to a scripted page on the fly, as in the next example:

<form action="calcSquare.php">
 <p>
  <label for=x>Number</label>:
  <input id="x" name="x" type="number">
 </p>
 <input id="submit" type=submit value="Calculate Square">
 <script>
  var x = document.getElementById('x');
  var output = document.createElement('p');
  output.textContent = 'Type a number; it will be squared right then!';
  x.form.appendChild(output);
  x.form.onsubmit = function () { return false; }
  x.oninput = function () {
    var v = x.valueAsNumber;
    output.textContent = v + ' squared is ' + v * v;
  };
  var submit = document.getElementById('submit');
  submit.parentNode.removeChild(submit);
 </script>
</form>

The above technique is also useful in XML documents, since noscript is not allowed there.

interface HTMLTemplateElement : HTMLElement {
  [HTMLConstructor] constructor();

  readonly attribute DocumentFragment content;
  [CEReactions] attribute DOMString shadowRootMode;
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute boolean shadowRootDelegatesFocus;
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute boolean shadowRootClonable;
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute boolean shadowRootSerializable;
  [CEReactions, Reflect] attribute DOMString shadowRootCustomElementRegistry;
};

The template element is used to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in the document by script.

In a rendering, the template element represents nothing.

The shadowrootmode content attribute is an enumerated attribute with the following keywords and states:

Keyword	State	Brief description
open	Open	The template element represents an open declarative shadow root.
closed	Closed	The template element represents a closed declarative shadow root.

The shadowrootmode attribute's invalid value default and missing value default are both the None state.

The shadowrootdelegatesfocus content attribute is a boolean attribute.

The shadowrootclonable content attribute is a boolean attribute.

The shadowrootserializable content attribute is a boolean attribute.

The shadowrootcustomelementregistry content attribute is a boolean attribute.

The template contents of a template element are not children of the element itself.

It is also possible, as a result of DOM manipulation, for a template element to contain Text nodes and element nodes; however, having any is a violation of the template element's content model, since its content model is defined as nothing.

For example, consider the following document:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
  <title>Homework</title>
 <body>
  <template id="template"><p>Smile!</p></template>
  <script>
   let num = 3;
   const fragment = document.getElementById('template').content.cloneNode(true);
   while (num-- > 1) {
     fragment.firstChild.before(fragment.firstChild.cloneNode(true));
     fragment.firstChild.textContent += fragment.lastChild.textContent;
   }
   document.body.appendChild(fragment);
  </script>
</html>

The p element in the template is not a child of the template in the DOM; it is a child of the DocumentFragment returned by the template element's content IDL attribute.

If the script were to call appendChild() on the template element, that would add a child to the template element (as for any other element); however, doing so is a violation of the template element's content model.

template.content
✔MDN

Returns the template contents (a DocumentFragment).

Each template element has an associated DocumentFragment object that is its template contents. The template contents have no conformance requirements. When a template element is created, the user agent must run the following steps to establish the template contents:

Let document be the template element's node document's appropriate template contents owner document.

Create a DocumentFragment object whose node document is document and host is the template element.

Set the template element's template contents to the newly created DocumentFragment object.

A Document document's appropriate template contents owner document is the Document returned by the following algorithm:

If document is not a Document created by this algorithm:

If document does not yet have an associated inert template document:

Let newDocument be a new Document (whose browsing context is null). This is "a Document created by this algorithm" for the purposes of the step above.

If document is an HTML document, then mark newDocument as an HTML document also.

Set document's associated inert template document to newDocument.

Set document to document's associated inert template document.

Each Document not created by this algorithm thus gets a single Document to act as its proxy for owning the template contents of all its template elements, so that they aren't in a browsing context and thus remain inert (e.g. scripts do not run). Meanwhile, template elements inside Document objects that are created by this algorithm just reuse the same Document owner for their contents.

Return document.

The adopting steps (with node and oldDocument as parameters) for template elements are the following:

Let document be node's node document's appropriate template contents owner document.

node's node document is the Document object that node was just adopted into.

Adopt node's template contents (a DocumentFragment object) into document.

The content getter steps are:

Assert: this's template contents is not a ShadowRoot node.

Return this's template contents.

The shadowRootMode IDL attribute must reflect the shadowrootmode content attribute, limited to only known values.

The shadowRootCustomElementRegistry IDL attribute intentionally does not have a boolean type so it can be extended.

The cloning steps for template elements given node, copy, and subtree are:

If subtree is false, then return.

For each child of node's template contents's children, in tree order: clone a node given child with document set to copy's template contents's node document, subtree set to true, and parent set to copy's template contents.

In this example, a script populates a table four-column with data from a data structure, using a template to provide the element structure instead of manually generating the structure from markup.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<title>Cat data</title>
<script>
 // Data is hard-coded here, but could come from the server
 var data = [
   { name: 'Pillar', color: 'Ticked Tabby', sex: 'Female (neutered)', legs: 3 },
   { name: 'Hedral', color: 'Tuxedo', sex: 'Male (neutered)', legs: 4 },
 ];
</script>
<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Name <th>Color <th>Sex <th>Legs
 <tbody>
  <template id="row">
   <tr><td><td><td><td>
  </template>
</table>
<script>
 var template = document.querySelector('#row');
 for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 1) {
   var cat = data[i];
   var clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
   var cells = clone.querySelectorAll('td');
   cells[0].textContent = cat.name;
   cells[1].textContent = cat.color;
   cells[2].textContent = cat.sex;
   cells[3].textContent = cat.legs;
   template.parentNode.appendChild(clone);
 }
</script>

This example uses cloneNode() on the template's contents; it could equivalently have used document.importNode(), which does the same thing. The only difference between these two APIs is when the node document is updated: with cloneNode() it is updated when the nodes are appended with appendChild(), with document.importNode() it is updated when the nodes are cloned.

4.12.3.1 Interaction of template elements with XSLT and XPath

This section is non-normative.

This specification does not define how XSLT and XPath interact with the template element. However, in the absence of another specification actually defining this, here are some guidelines for implementers, which are intended to be consistent with other processing described in this specification:

An XSLT processor based on an XML parser that acts as described in this specification needs to act as if template elements contain as descendants their template contents for the purposes of the transform.

An XSLT processor that outputs a DOM needs to ensure that nodes that would go into a template element are instead placed into the element's template contents.

XPath evaluation using the XPath DOM API when applied to a Document parsed using the HTML parser or the XML parser described in this specification needs to ignore template contents.

The slot element defines a slot. It is typically used in a shadow tree. A slot element represents its assigned nodes, if any, and its contents otherwise.

The name content attribute may contain any string value. It represents a slot's name.

The name attribute is used to assign slots to other elements: a slot element with a name attribute creates a named slot to which any element is assigned if that element has a slot attribute whose value matches that name attribute's value, and the slot element is a child of the shadow tree whose root's host has that corresponding slot attribute value.

Returns slot's assigned nodes, limited to elements.
slot.assignedElements({ flatten: true })
Returns the same as assignedNodes({ flatten: true }), limited to elements.
slot.assign(...nodes)

Sets slot's manually assigned nodes to the given nodes.

The slot element has manually assigned nodes, which is an ordered set of slottables set by assign(). This set is initially empty.

The manually assigned nodes set can be implemented using weak references to the slottables, because this set is not directly accessible from script.

The assignedNodes(options) method steps are:

If options["flatten"] is false, then return this's assigned nodes.

Return the result of finding flattened slottables with this.

The assignedElements(options) method steps are:

If options["flatten"] is false, then return this's assigned nodes, filtered to contain only Element nodes.
