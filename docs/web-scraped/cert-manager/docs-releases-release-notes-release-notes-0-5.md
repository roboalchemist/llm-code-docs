Release Notes
=============

Highlights[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.5#highlights)
==============================================================================================

Resource validation webhook[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.5#resource-validation-webhook)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the `v0.4.0` release, we have now added a 'validating webhook' for our API resources. This will help prevent invalid configurations being submitted to the API server.

This feature is disabled by default.

Information on enabling the new webhook component can be found in the Resource Validation Webhook document.

New Certificate options[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.5#new-certificate-options)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A number of new fields have been added to the Certificate resource type:

*   `keyAlgorithm` - support alternative private key algorithms (e.g. RSA or ECDSA) for generated certificates.
*   `keySize` - allow specifying an alternative key bit size
*   `isCA` - allows generating certificates with the 'signing' usage set
*   `organization` - allows specifying values for the 'O' field of Certificates (for supported providers)

New fields like this make cert-manager more useful for applications beyond just securing Ingress, as well as allowing users to continue meeting their security requirements for X.509 certificates.

New ACME DNS providers[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.5#new-acme-dns-providers)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release includes two new DNS provides for the ACME Issuer:

*   ACMEDNS
*   RFC2136 These additions should help more users begin using cert-manager with their chosen DNS provider, without having to delegate to an alternate provider that is supported
