SelfSigned
==========

⚠️ `SelfSigned` issuers are generally useful for bootstrapping a PKI locally, which is a complex topic for advanced users. To be used safely in production, running a PKI introduces complex planning requirements around rotation, trust store distribution and disaster recovery.

If you're not planning to run your own PKI, use a different issuer type.

The `SelfSigned` issuer doesn't represent a certificate authority as such, but instead denotes that certificates will "sign themselves" using a given private key. In other words, the private key of the certificate will be used to sign the certificate itself.

This `Issuer` type is useful for bootstrapping a root certificate for a custom PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), or for otherwise creating simple ad-hoc certificates for a quick test.

There are important [caveats](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#caveats) - including security issues - to consider with `SelfSigned` issuers; in general you'd likely want to use a [`CA`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) issuer rather than a `SelfSigned` issuer. That said, `SelfSigned` issuers are really useful for initially [bootstrapping](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#bootstrapping-ca-issuers) a `CA` issuer.

> Note: a `CertificateRequest` that references a self-signed certificate _must_ also contain the `cert-manager.io/private-key-secret-name` annotation since the private key corresponding to the `CertificateRequest` is required to sign the certificate. This annotation is added automatically by the `Certificate` controller.

Deployment[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#deployment)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the `SelfSigned` issuer has no dependency on any other resource, it is the simplest to configure. Only the `SelfSigned` stanza is required to be present in the issuer spec, with no other configuration required:

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Issuer

metadata:

 name: selfsigned-issuer

 namespace: sandbox

spec:

 selfSigned: {}

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: ClusterIssuer

metadata:

 name: selfsigned-cluster-issuer

spec:

 selfSigned: {}

Once deployed, you should be able to see immediately that the issuer is ready for signing:

$ kubectl get issuers -n sandbox -o wide selfsigned-issuer

NAME READY STATUS AGE

selfsigned-issuer True 2m

$ kubectl get clusterissuers -o wide selfsigned-cluster-issuer

NAME READY STATUS AGE

selfsigned-cluster-issuer True 3m

### Bootstrapping `CA` Issuers[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#bootstrapping-ca-issuers)

One of the ideal use cases for `SelfSigned` issuers is to bootstrap a custom root certificate for a private PKI, including with the cert-manager [`CA`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) issuer.

The YAML below will create a `SelfSigned` issuer, issue a root certificate and use that root as a `CA` issuer:

apiVersion: v1

kind: Namespace

metadata:

 name: sandbox

---

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: ClusterIssuer

metadata:

 name: selfsigned-issuer

spec:

 selfSigned: {}

---

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Certificate

metadata:

 name: my-selfsigned-ca

 namespace: sandbox

spec:

 isCA: true

 commonName: my-selfsigned-ca

 secretName: root-secret

 privateKey:

 algorithm: ECDSA

 size: 256

 issuerRef:

 name: selfsigned-issuer

 kind: ClusterIssuer

 group: cert-manager.io

---

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Issuer

metadata:

 name: my-ca-issuer

 namespace: sandbox

spec:

 ca:

 secretName: root-secret

Alternatively, if you are looking to use `ClusterIssuer` for signing `Certificates` anywhere in your cluster with the `SelfSigned``Certificate` CA, use the YAML below (slight modification):

# `sandbox` namespace is no longer needed.

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: ClusterIssuer

metadata:

 name: selfsigned-issuer

spec:

 selfSigned: {}

---

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Certificate

metadata:

 name: my-selfsigned-ca

 # Create CA root secret in `cert-manager` namespace instead of `sandbox` namespace.

 namespace: cert-manager

spec:

 isCA: true

 commonName: my-selfsigned-ca

 secretName: root-secret

 privateKey:

 algorithm: ECDSA

 size: 256

 issuerRef:

 name: selfsigned-issuer

 kind: ClusterIssuer

 group: cert-manager.io

---

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: ClusterIssuer

metadata:

 name: my-ca-issuer

spec:

 ca:

 # `ClusterIssuer` resource is not namespaced, so `secretName` is assumed to reference secret in `cert-manager` namespace.

 secretName: root-secret

The "selfsigned-issuer" `ClusterIssuer` is used to issue the Root CA Certificate. Then, "my-ca-issuer" `ClusterIssuer` is used to issue but also sign certificates using the newly created Root CA `Certificate`, which is what you will use for future certificates cluster-wide.

### CRL Distribution Points[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#crl-distribution-points)

You may also optionally specify [CRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list) Distribution Points as an array of strings, each of which identifies the location of a CRL in which the revocation status of issued certificates can be checked:

...

spec:

 selfSigned:

 crlDistributionPoints:

 - "http://example.com"

Caveats[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#caveats)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Trust[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#trust)

Clients consuming `SelfSigned` certificates have _no way_ to trust them without already having the certificates beforehand, which can be hard to manage when the client is in a different namespace to the server.

This limitation can be tackled by using [trust-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/trust-manager/) to distribute `ca.crt` to other namespaces.

There is no secure alternative to solving the problem of distributing trust stores; it's possible to "TOFU" (trust-on-first-use) a certificate, but that approach is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Certificate Validity[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#certificate-validity)

One side-effect of a certificate being self-signed is that its Subject DN and its Issuer DN are identical. The X.509 [RFC 5280, section 4.1.2.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) requires that:

> The issuer field MUST contain a non-empty distinguished name (DN).

However, self-signed certs don't have a subject DN set by default. Unless you manually set a certificate's Subject DN, the Issuer DN will be empty and the certificate will technically be invalid.

Validation of this specific area of the spec is patchy and varies between TLS libraries, but there's always the risk that a library will improve its validation - entirely within spec - in the future and break your app if you're using a certificate with an empty Issuer DN.

To avoid this, be sure to set a Subject for `SelfSigned` certs. This can be done by setting the `spec.subject` on a cert-manager `Certificate` object which will be issued by a `SelfSigned` issuer.

Starting in version 1.3, cert-manager will emit a Kubernetes [warning event](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/45befd86966c563663d18848943a1066d9681bf8/pkg/controller/certificaterequests/selfsigned/selfsigned.go#L140) of type `BadConfig` if it detects that a certificate is being created by a `SelfSigned` issuer which has an empty Issuer DN.
