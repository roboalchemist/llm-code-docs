Release Notes
=============

Following on from the `v0.7.x` releases and a series of prerelease candidates, cert-manager `v0.8.0` is available at last!

This release packs in a tonne of stability improvements, as well as a whole load of new features grinning

As part of this release, we're updating our API format in order to better support the 1.0 release, which we hope to reach within the next few months. This has been accomplished in a backwards-compatible for now, to make the upgrade process easier, especially for users that manage large numbers of certificate resources.

As well as the new release, we've also finally created a project logo! For those of you who are attending KubeCon EU, we'll be handing out stickers at the Jetstack booth from tomorrow onward!

Action required[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.8#action-required)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deployment manifests have now moved from being a part of our GitHub repository and are now published alongside each image tag. Please double check the installation guide for more information on where the manifests can now be found. This change does not affect the Helm chart!

New ACME configuration format[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.8#new-acme-configuration-format)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of stabilizing our API surface, we've made a change to the way you configure your ACME based certificates.

Instead of Certificate resources containing an extra `certificate.spec.acme` field, which is only relevant for ACME certificates, the configuration has now moved over to the Issuer resource instead. More details on this change can be found in the upgrade notes.

OpenShift installation instructions[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.8#openshift-installation-instructions)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make it easier for users to run cert-manager on platforms other than Kubernetes, we've improved our OpenShift support, including an official installation guide for users of OpenShift.

If you use OpenShift in your organization, check out the getting started section for more information on how to get up and running!

Webhook based ACME DNS01 solver[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.8#webhook-based-acme-dns01-solver)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the last year and a half, we've had more than 15 pull requests to add new ACME DNS01 providers to our codebase. It's been brilliant to see such vibrant community involvement, however it's become infeasible for us to continue to accept, test and maintain such a rapidly growing matrix of providers.

As a result, we've put together a new 'webhook' DNS01 solver type. This allows you to create and install your own DNS01 providers without having to make changes in cert-manager itself.

You can see an example repository to get started building your own over in the cert-manager-webhook-example repo on GitHub.

This is a new and experimental feature, however we're excited to see the community move to this new model of extending cert-manager.

Switch to structured logging[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.8#switch-to-structured-logging)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the project has grown, we've also increased the verbosity and frequency of our log messages. Over time, this has become difficult to manage and work with, and so with the `v0.8` release we have begun the process of switching over our code base to structured logging.

This should make it far easier to index, search and grep through log messages that cert-manager emits.

Your feedback here is really valuable, so please open issues and comment on Slack if you have any issues!
