Release Notes
=============

Action Required[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#action-required)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Helm chart `rbac.create` option has moved to be `global.rbac.create`. Users of the Helm chart will need to update their install overrides to use the new format.

The Helm chart has now moved to be hosted on `charts.jetstack.io`, and exposed via the Helm Hub. This allows us to make and test changes to the Helm chart more easily, and better manage versions.

### Venafi Issuer type[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#venafi-issuer-type)

This release introduces a new issuer type for Venafi Cloud and Venafi Trust Protection Platform.

The Venafi adapter will be built out over the coming months to improve the integration and expose more of the Venafi platform's advanced functionality.

### New `cainjector` controller[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#new-cainjector-controller)

This release introduces support for injecting CA bundles into Kubernetes `{Validating,Mutating}WebhookConfiguration`& APIService resources.

You can utilize the new controller by adding the `certmanager.k8s.io/inject-ca-from` annotation to your webhook and APIService resources.

This was needed in order to improve our own deployment of the 'webhook' component as part of this release.

### Improved webhook deployment[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#improved-webhook-deployment)

The `v0.6` release utilized an additional ca-sync CronJob resource that allowed us to secure the webhook component automatically using cert-manager itself.

Thanks to the new `cainjector` controller described above, we have now removed this CronJob altogether in favor of using the far more reliable controller.

### Experimental ARM support[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#experimental-arm-support)

Support for ARM was adding as part of this release (#1212). We do not currently have automated testing using ARM platforms, so this feature is still marked experimental.

To utilize the new ARM support, you'll need to update your manifests and append the architecture to the image name (i.e. `quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-controller-arm64:v0.7.0`).

### Easier debugging of failing ACME challenges[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.7#easier-debugging-of-failing-acme-challenges)

The introduction of the Challenge resource in the last release has allowed us to provide better means for debugging failures.

In the `v0.7.0 release`, if a self check or ACME validation is failing for some reason, this information will be displayed when running `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe`.
