Notes on the breaking change with the `class` field that happened in cert-manager v1.5.4
========================================================================================

> ⚠️ This document focuses on the `class` field of the Issuer and ClusterIssuer resources and the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. If you are interested in using `ingressClassName` on your Ingress resources when using cert-manager's HTTP-01 solver, see the page [Securing Ingress Resources](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/http01/#ingressclassname).

In cert-manager v1.5.4 we made a change to the HTTP-01 code which was not backwards compatible. Before v1.5.4, cert-manager was using the `class` field on the Issuer and ClusterIssuer to add the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. In cert-manager v1.5.4, cert-manager stopped setting the annotation. See [Regression: HTTP-01 challenges fail with Istio, Traefik, ingress-gce and Azure AGIC](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/4537).

In v1.5.5, v1.6.2 and 1.7.1 we fixed this problem.

If you have cert-manager v1.5.3 (or below) you should skip v1.5.4 and instead:

*   upgrade to v1.5.5
*   then the newest version of cert-manager 1.6
*   and then the newest version of cert-manager 1.7

and you can ignore the rest of this document.

The following notes apply to anyone upgrading from cert-manager v1.5.4, v1.6.0, v1.6.1 on Kubernetes v1.19 or later.

Background[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#background)
=====================================================================================================

cert-manager 1.5 was released to coincide with Kubernetes 1.22, which [removed](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/07/14/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-1-22/) the `v1beta1` Ingress API. As cert-manager creates Ingress resources to solve HTTP-01 challenges, this code path needed to be updated.

In the `v1beta1` spec, Ingress Class was a string annotation that was adopted by all popular Ingress controllers by convention. In the `v1` spec, `IngressClass` is now its own resource type, and the `.spec.ingressClassName` field on `v1` Ingresses is now a reference to that object. As the Kubernetes documentation points out, the old and new specs are not directly equivalent.

During the 1.5 and 1.6 cert-manager release cycles, we discovered that ingress controllers have handled the graduation of Ingress to `v1` differently. Some treat the class as an opaque string, similarly to the annotation. Some were unintentionally broken, as their default ingress class name contains characters that are disallowed in object references, e.g. (`/`). Some now require you to create an `IngressClass` object matching the field to work.

cert-manager aims to be compatible with as many ingress controllers as possible. According to the Ingress v1 [Kubernetes enhancement proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/44dd2975dc6cdad96ca73e7b0ba1794f1196f604/keps/sig-network/1453-ingress-api#interoperability-with-previous-annotation), the deprecated annotation, if present, takes precedence over the new field. From our perspective, the option that maintains the highest compatibility is to only use the annotation, even when creating `v1` Ingresses.

Notes For Specific Ingress Controllers[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#notes-for-specific-ingress-controllers)
=============================================================================================================================================================

ingress-nginx[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#ingress-nginx)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you chose not to use the IngressClass `nginx` that is created by default by the Helm chart (e.g., you named the IngressClass `nginx-outside`), you will need to add the flags `--ingress-class` to your ingress-nginx deployment:

--ingress-class=nginx-outside --ingress-class-by-name=true

In case you are using the Helm chart, you will need to use at least these values:

ingressClassResource:

 name: nginx-outside

 controllerValue: k8s.io/ingress-nginx-outside

ingressClassByName: true

ingressClass: nginx-outside

Istio[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#istio)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Istio and you had to create an IngressClass while migrating to cert-manager 1.5 or 1.6 and you chose to create an IngressClass that isn't named `istio` (e.g., you named it `istio-internal`), you will need to change the `class` field on those Issuers back to `istio`.

Traefik[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#traefik)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Traefik and you had to create an IngressClass while migrating to cert-manager 1.5 or 1.6 and the IngressClass you created isn't named `traefik` (for example, you called the IngressClass `traefik-external`), you will need to add a command-line argument to your Traefik deployment:

--providers.kubernetesingress.ingressclass=traefik-external

Ambassador[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/upgrading/ingress-class-compatibility/#ambassador)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Ambassador and you had to create an IngressClass while migrating to cert-manager 1.5 or 1.6, and the IngressClass you created isn't named `ambassador` (e.g., `ambassador-internal`), you will need to change the `class` field on the affected Issuers back to `ambassador`.
