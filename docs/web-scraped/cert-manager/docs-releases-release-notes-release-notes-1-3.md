Release Notes
=============

Patch Release `v1.3.1`[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#patch-release-v131)
==================================================================================================================

Bug and Security Fixes[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#bug-and-security-fixes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   A Helm upgrade bug was [fixed](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/3882), you should now able to upgrade from cert-manager 1.2 to 1.3 when `--set installCRDs=true` is used. This issue was due to [a Helm bug](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5806#issuecomment-788116838) with the `minimum` field on the CRDs.

Final Release `v1.3.0`[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#final-release-v130)
==================================================================================================================

The 1.3 release prepares for the implementation of certificate issuance policies and adoption of the upstream [Kubernetes CSR](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) API. It also improves interoperability with HashiCorp [Vault Enterprise](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise). A slew of bugs have also been squashed.

Deprecated Features and Breaking Changes[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#deprecated-features-and-breaking-changes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Venafi Cloud Issuer[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#venafi-cloud-issuer)

This release updates the [Venafi Cloud Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/venafi/) to use `OutagePREDICT` instead of `DevOpsACCELERATE`.

The only impact to Venafi Cloud users is the change in zone syntax. The zone is now `<Application Name>\<Issuing Template Alias>` (e.g. `My Application\My CIT`).

### cert-manager controller[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#cert-manager-controller)

The `--renew-before-expiration-duration` flag has been removed from the cert-manager controller, having been deprecated in the previous release.

### cert-manager CRDs[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#cert-manager-crds)

`CertificateRequests` are now immutable - the `spec` and `metadata.annotations` fields cannot be changed after creation. They were always designed to be immutable but this behavior is now _enforced_ by the cert-manager webhook.

New Features[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#new-features)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Policy Support Preparation[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#policy-support-preparation)

*   The [design documentation](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/v1.3.0/design/20210203.certificate-request-identity.md) for Certificate Identity is now available.
*   `CertificateRequests` now have identity fields mirroring the upstream [Kubernetes CSR](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) object.
*   `CertificateRequests` are now immutable.
*   `CertificateRequests` now have an Approval condition type, with `Approved` and `Denied` reasons.
*   The cert-manager controller currently always approves any `CertificateRequest`.
*   Added `kubectl cert-manager [approve|deny]` commands to the kubectl plugin.

### cert-manager CRDs[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#cert-manager-crds-1)

*   `CertificateRequests` now support the `revisionHistoryLimit` field to limit the amount of retained history. The default is unlimited (`nil`).

### Vault Enterprise[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#vault-enterprise)

*   cert-manager now sends the `X-VAULT-NAMESPACE` header for the `requestTokenWithAppRoleRef` API call.

Bug Fixes[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#bug-fixes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### cert-manager Controller[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#cert-manager-controller-1)

*   Fixed an issue which could cause multiple `CertificateRequests` to be created in a short time for a single `Certificate` resource.
*   Certificate Readiness controller only updates a certificate's status if something has changed.

### SelfSigned Issuer[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#selfsigned-issuer)

*   The issuer now warns if you request a certificate with an empty subject DN - creating a certificate that is in violation of RFC 5280. Some applications will reject such certificates as invalid, such as Java's `keytool`.

### Helm Chart[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#helm-chart)

*   The `targetPort` used by the Prometheus service monitor is now correctly set from helm values.
*   The correct permissions are added to the aggregate `edit` role.

Other Changes[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#other-changes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repository Hygiene[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#repository-hygiene)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   `SECURITY.md` now contains information on how to report security issues.
*   The language of `CONTRIBUTING.md` has been updated to match existing copyright notices.

### Tooling[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.3#tooling)

*   cert-manager now can be built with go 1.16 on Apple Silicon.
*   Docker images targets have been added to the Makefile.
*   Bazel `v3.5.0` is required to build locally and to run tests.
