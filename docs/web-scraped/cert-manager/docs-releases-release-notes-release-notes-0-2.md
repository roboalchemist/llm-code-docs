Release Notes
=============

Changelog since `v0.1.0`[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.2#changelog-since-v010)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Action Required[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-0.2#action-required)

*   Move to `jetstack` organization. Action required: this will require updating your existing deployments to point to the new image repository, as new tags will not be pushed to the old `jetstackexperimental/cert-manager-controller` repository. A helm upgrade should take care of this. (#145, `@munnerz`)
*   Set the Kubernetes secret type to TLS. Action required: this will cause renewals of existing certificates to fail. You must delete certificates that have been previously produced by cert-manager else cert-manager may enter a renewal loop when saving the new certificates. Alternatively, you may specify a new secret to store your certificate in and manually update your ingress resource/applications to reference the new secret. (#172, `@munnerz`)
