Cloudflare
==========

To use Cloudflare, you may use one of two types of tokens. **API Tokens** allow application-scoped keys bound to specific zones and permissions, while **API Keys** are globally-scoped keys that carry the same permissions as your account.

**API Tokens** are recommended for higher security, since they have more restrictive permissions and are more easily revocable.

API Tokens[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/#api-tokens)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tokens can be created at **User Profile > API Tokens > API Tokens**. The following settings are recommended:

*   Permissions:
    *   `Zone - DNS - Edit`
    *   `Zone - Zone - Read`

*   Zone Resources:
    *   `Include - All Zones`

To create a new `Issuer`, first make a Kubernetes secret containing your new API token:

apiVersion: v1

kind: Secret

metadata:

 name: cloudflare-api-token-secret

type: Opaque

stringData:

 api-token: <API Token>

Then in your `Issuer` manifest:

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Issuer

API Keys[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/#api-keys)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API keys can be retrieved at **User Profile > API Tokens > API Keys > Global API Key > View**.

To create a new `Issuer`, first make a Kubernetes secret containing your API key:

apiVersion: v1

kind: Secret

metadata:

 name: cloudflare-api-key-secret

type: Opaque

stringData:

 api-key: <API Key>

Then in your `Issuer` manifest:

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1

kind: Issuer

metadata:

 name: example-issuer

spec:

 acme:

 ...

 solvers:

 - dns01:

 cloudflare:

 email: my-cloudflare-acc@example.com

 apiKeySecretRef:

 name: cloudflare-api-key-secret

 key: api-key

Troubleshooting[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/#troubleshooting)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Actor `com.cloudflare.api.token.xxxx` requires permission `com.cloudflare.api.account.zone.list` to list zones[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/#actor-comcloudflareapitokenxxxx-requires-permission-comcloudflareapiaccountzonelist-to-list-zones)

If you get the error that your token does not have the correct permission to list zones there can be 2 causes.

1.   The token lacks the `Zone - Zone - Read` permission
2.   cert-manager identified the wrong zone name for the domain due to DNS issues.

In the case of the 2nd issue you will see an error like below:

Events:

 Type Reason Age From Message

 Warning PresentError 3s (x2 over 3s) cert-manager Error presenting challenge: Cloudflare API Error for GET "/zones?name=<TLD>" 

 Error: 0: Actor 'com.cloudflare.api.token.xxxx' requires permission 'com.cloudflare.api.account.zone.list' to list zones

In this case we recommend [changing your DNS01 self-check nameservers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#setting-nameservers-for-dns01-self-check).

`Cloudflare API error for POST "/zones/<id>/dns_records` generic error[](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/cloudflare/#cloudflare-api-error-for-post-zonesiddns_records-generic-error)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might be hitting this as Cloudflare blocks the use of the API to update DNS records for the following TLDs: `.cf`, `.ga`, `.gq`, `.ml` and `.tk`. This is discussed in the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/unable-to-update-ddns-using-api-for-some-tlds/167228). We recommend using an alternative DNS provider when using these TLDs.
