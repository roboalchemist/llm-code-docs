This topic describes how to manage fee deduction channels and view bills for
organization administrators.

Before applied in the production environment, it is recommended to link a
credit card or open a cloud marketplace deduction channel to ensure the
continuous operation of the service.

## Deduction Channels​

VeloDB Cloud currently supports four deduction channels, which are credit
card, cloud marketplace, cash and vouchers. VeloDB Cloud will generate bills
periodically and deducts fees from those channels.

Click the **User Menu** > **Billings** , enter Billing Overview page to view
the overall usage of the those fee deduction channels.

The following describes the use of the above deduction channels:

### Credit Card​

In Billing Overview page, click **Add** on **Credit Card** to complete the
setup.

You can’t remove a credit card in the Billing Overview page, but you can
update it anytime. This helps ensure your organization always has a valid
payment method. If you need to remove your credit card, please contact VeloDB
Cloud support for help.
