# DBeaver

## introduce​

DBeaver is a cross-platform database tool for developers, database
administrators, analysts and anyone who works with data.

Apache Doris is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol. You can use
DBeaver's MySQL driver to connect to Apache Doris and query data in the
internal catalog and external catalog.

## Preconditions​

Dbeaver installed You can visit <https://dbeaver.io> to download and install
DBeaver

## Add data source​

Note

Currently verified using DBeaver version 24.0.0

  1. Start DBeaver

  2. Click the plus sign (**+**) icon in the upper left corner of the DBeaver window, or select **Database > New Database Connection** in the menu bar to open the **Connect to a database** interface.

  4. Configure Doris connection

In the **main** tab of the **Connection Settings** window, configure the
following connection information:

  * Server Host: FE host IP address of the Doris cluster.
  * Port: FE query port of Doris cluster, such as 9030.
  * Database: The target database in the Doris cluster.
  * Username: The username used to log in to the Doris cluster, such as admin.
  * Password: User password used to log in to the Doris cluster.

tip

Database can be used to distinguish between internal catalog and external
catalog. If only the Database name is filled in, the current data source will
be connected to the internal catalog by default. If the format is catalog.db,
the current data source will be connected to the catalog filled in Database by
default, as shown in DBeaver The database tables are also database tables in
the connected catalog, so you can use DBeaver's MySQL driver to create
multiple Doris data sources to manage different Catalogs in Doris.

Note

Managing the external catalog connected to Doris through the Database form of
catalog.db requires Doris version 2.1.0 and above.

  * external catalog ![connect external catalog](/assets/images/dbeaver5-f92fa21b93bffc3ce13dfb830da8dd13.png)

  5. Test data source connection

After filling in the connection information, click Test Connection in the
lower left corner to verify the accuracy of the database connection
information. DBeaver returns to the following dialog box to confirm the
configuration of the connection information. Click OK to confirm that the
configured connection information is correct. Then click Finish in the lower
right corner to complete the connection configuration. ![test

  6. Connect to database

After the database connection is established, you can see the created data
source connection in the database connection navigation on the left, and you
can connect and manage the database through DBeaver. ![create
