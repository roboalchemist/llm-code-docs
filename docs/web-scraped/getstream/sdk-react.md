# Overview

> Building on top of the Stream Chat API, the Stream Chat React component
> library includes everything you need to build feature-rich and high-
> functioning chat user experiences out of the box. The library includes an
> extensive set of performant and customizable React components which allow
> you to get started quickly with little to no plumbing required. Use cases
> include team and social messaging, virtual events, livestream gaming, and
> customer support. The library supports:

  * Rich media messages
  * Reactions
  * Threads and quoted replies
  * Text input commands (ex: Giphy and @mentions)
  * Image and file uploads
  * Video playback
  * Audio recording
  * Read state and typing indicators
  * Channel and message lists

## Where to Get Started

If you are new to our SDK it is best to go through our
[tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/react-chat/tutorial/).

After that, our [getting started
page](/chat/docs/sdk/react/basics/getting_started/) is a great next step.

If you are integrating our SDK, please pay attention to our
[Theming](/chat/docs/sdk/react/theming/themingv2/) and [Customizing
Components](/chat/docs/sdk/react/guides/customization/) sections in our
guides. We see that most of our users can get very far by utilizing the
flexibility of our SDKs.

## Architecture

> A common pattern in the library is the use of context provider hooks. These
> custom hooks allow for effective value sharing between parent components and
> their children. This makes customization straightforward, as you can use our
> exported hooks in your custom components to receive the exact values needed,
> while also subscribing to context changes.

The left navigation will guide you to the various documentation sections for
information on everything regarding our robust component library. Check out
the instructions for adding the library to your React project.

## Supported Platforms

Our React Chat SDK can run on all modern browsers and platforms released after
April 2024. Here is the list of supported platforms:

  * Chrome 124+
  * Firefox 124+
  * Edge 124+
  * Safari and Mobile Safari 17.4+

Although the SDK works on other exotic and older browser versions, these are
the ones we officially support and test against, so we recommend using them
for the best experience.
