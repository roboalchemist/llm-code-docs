##  [ Incorrect or missing information? ](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd.github.io/issues/new?title=Improve%3A+Pre-queue+scripts&body=%23%23+URL%3A+%2Fwiki%2Fconfiguration%2F4.5%2Fscripts%2Fpre-queue-scripts.html%0A%0AImprovement:%0A) Pre-queue scripts 

You can choose to let SABnzbd run a script just before an NZB enters the queue. This script determines whether the NZB should be accepted and can modify a number of job parameters. 

Scripts may use any scripting language available on your system; common choices are Python, Unix shell, and Windows batch scripts. All scripts must be located in the Scripts-directory, specified in [Config->Folders](/wiki/configuration/4.5/folders) and must be executable. On Unix-like operating systems (Linux, BSD, etc.) this means the x-bit must be on. On Windows, the requirement is that the script's extension is listed in your system's `PATHEXT` environment variable. Once everything is in place, the Pre-Queue Script can be set in [Config->Switches](/wiki/configuration/4.5/switches) (enable Advanced Settings). 

The script must write results to the console. Exit code `0` will make SABnzbd inspect the returned output. If the script has an exit code other than `0`, script failure is assumed and the NZB accepted without changes. 

* * *

## Input parameters

All parameters (except 1) can be empty, meaning a default value. Use `%1` in Windows scripts and `$1` in Unix scripts. Note that on Windows the input parameters are surrounded by quotes (e.g. `"job name"`).

NOTE **Much more information is available to scripts via environment variables,see below!**

Position | Description  
---|---  
1 | Clean version of the job name (no path info and `.nzb` removed) includes the password if present, in the `job name / password` notation  
2 | Post Processing (PP) flags: 

  * `0` = Download
  * `1` = +Repair
  * `2` = +Unpack
  * `3` = +Delete

3 | Category  
4 | Script (no path)  
5 | Priority 

  * `-100` = Default
  * `-2` = Paused
  * `-1` = Low
  * `0` = Normal
  * `1` = High
  * `2` = Force

6 | Size of the download (in bytes)  
7 | Group list (separated by spaces)  
  
* * *

## Return parameters

The script can refuse or accept the NZB and it can also return alternative parameters. These parameters should be written to the console, each parameter on a separate line. SABnzbd uses the first 7 lines of output, so they should be empty (original value will be used) or only contain proper data. Anything after line 7 is ignored. 

NOTE To manipulate duplicate detection, you should assemble a new name and return a recognized format.

Position | Description  
---|---  
1 | 

  * `0` = Refuse
  * `1` = Accept
  * `2` = Accept but fail, this way post-processing scripts for the job will be activated if necessary.

2 |  Clean version of the job name (no path info and `.nzb` removed) can be used to set a password when provided in the `job name / password` notation  
3 | Post Processing (PP) flags: 

  * `0` = Download
  * `1` = +Repair
  * `2` = +Unpack
  * `3` = +Delete

4 | Category  
5 | Script (no path)  
6 | Priority 

  * `-100` = Default
  * `-2` = Paused
  * `-1` = Low
  * `0` = Normal
  * `1` = High
  * `2` = Force

7 | Group to be used (in case your provider doesn't carry all groups and there are multiple groups in the NZB)  
  
* * *

## Environment variables

Your script can get extra information via environment variables (return information should still be sent as plain output):

Variable | Description  
---|---  
`SAB_SCRIPT` | The name of the current script  
`SAB_FINAL_NAME` | The name of the job in the queue and of the final folder  
`SAB_FILENAME` | The NZB filename (after grabbing from the URL)  
`SAB_CAT` | What category was assigned  
`SAB_BYTES` | Total number of bytes  
`SAB_DUPLICATE` | Is this a duplicate and what type  
`SAB_DUPLICATE_KEY` | The key used for Smart Duplicate Detection  
`SAB_PASSWORD` | What was the password supplied by the NZB or the user  
`SAB_STATUS` | Current status (completed/failed/running)  
`SAB_PP` | What post-processing was activated (download/repair/unpack/delete)  
`SAB_REPAIR` | Was repair selected by user  
`SAB_UNPACK` | Was unpack selected by user  
`SAB_PRIORITY` | Priority set by user  
`SAB_GROUPS` | Newsgroups listed in the NZB  
`SAB_VERSION` | The version of SABnzbd used  
`SAB_PROGRAM_DIR` | The directory where the current SABnzbd instance is located  
`SAB_API_KEY` | The API-key that you can use to communicate with the SABnzbd [API](/wiki/configuration/4.5/api).  
`SAB_API_URL` |  The URL to the SABnzbd [API](/wiki/configuration/4.5/api), for example `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`.  
It does not include the required `apikey` parameter, use `SAB_API_KEY`.   
`SAB_PAR2_COMMAND` | The path to the `par2` command on the system that SABnzbd uses  
`SAB_MULTIPAR_COMMAND` | Windows-only (empty on other systems). The path to the MultiPar command on the system that SABnzbd uses  
`SAB_RAR_COMMAND` | The path to the `unrar` command on the system that SABnzbd uses  
`SAB_ZIP_COMMAND` | The path to the `unzip` command on the system that SABnzbd uses  
`SAB_7ZIP_COMMAND` | The path to the `7z` command on the system that SABnzbd uses. Not all systems have 7zip installed (it's optional for SABnzbd), so this can also be empty  
`SAB_TITLE` | Title of the movie or show  
`SAB_SEASON` | Season (1..99)  
`SAB_EPISODE` | Episode (1..99)  
`SAB_EPISODE_NAME` | Episode name  
`SAB_IS_PROPER` | Tagged as Proper (True or False)  
`SAB_RESOLUTION` | Resolution  
`SAB_DECADE` | Decade  
`SAB_YEAR` | Year  
`SAB_MONTH` | Month  
`SAB_DAY` | Day  
`SAB_JOB_TYPE` | Job type (tv, date, movie, or unknown)

## Example Script 1

Example of a Windows batch file that forces high priority on anything smaller than 2GB.
    
    @echo off
    echo 1
    echo.
    echo.
    echo.
    echo.
    if %6 LSS 2000000000 echo 1

Save it as file `size-checker.cmd` and put in the scripts folder.

## Example Script 2

A python script to set prio to Force on downloads smaller than 50MB:
    
    import sys
    
    try:
        # Parse the input variables for SABnzbd version >= 4.2.0
        (scriptname, nzbname, postprocflags, category, script, prio, downloadsize, grouplist) = sys.argv
    except Exception:
        sys.exit(1)  # a non-zero exit status causes SABnzbd to ignore the output of this script
    
    prio = -100  # Default
    if int(downloadsize) < 50*1024**2:
        prio = 2
    
    print("1")  # Accept the job
    print()
    print()
    print()
    print()
    print(prio)
    print()
    
    # 0 means OK
    sys.exit(0)
