##  [ Incorrect or missing information? ](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd.github.io/issues/new?title=Improve%3A+RSS&body=%23%23+URL%3A+%2Fwiki%2Fconfiguration%2F4.5%2Frss.html%0A%0AImprovement:%0A) RSS 

SABnzbd can read RSS-feeds provided by indexers or public RSS websites. These sites offer the latest downloads or return results based on a query. For a list of supported RSS sites, [see here.](/wiki/introduction/nzb-sources)

Each feed is analyzed using filters. A filter looks for a text-pattern in the title of entries and will reject or accept a job based on that pattern. A filter "matches" a title if the filter text is found inside that title. You can add `*` to match arbitrary parts of the title or `?` for one arbitrary character at that place. The filters are analyzed in order and the first one matched will be selected. 

* * *

## An example

Suppose you subscribe to a feed and the output of titles in this feed is: 
    
    My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 1
    You and me and the dog Part 1
    You and me and the dog Part 2
    My first teen steps hdtv xvid Part 1
    My first baby steps xvid Part 1
    My first baby steps hdtv xvid Part 2
    The making of My first baby steps xvid hdtv
    
Now, suppose you want to get all `My ... first steps` episodes, but only when marked `hdtv` and you're not interested in `Making of`:
    
    Reject || making of
    Accept || first*steps*hdtv
    
The `Reject` filter should be placed first, otherwise the `Accept` filter will also pick the `Making of`.

It's also possible to setup a `Required` filter. This means that the following filters are only applied when a title matches the `Required` filter.  

For example: if you are only interested in `hdtv` format, you would create filters like this: 
    
    Reject || making of
    Requires || hdtv
    Accept || first*steps
    Accept || second*steps
    
* * *

## Categories

For each feed you can set the category or the [job options](/wiki/extra/job-options) for all jobs in the feed in the top row, or for each `Accept` filter specifically.  
If all category settings are left as `Default` and the indexer category matches one of your categories (by category name or by [custom `Indexer tag`](/wiki/configuration/4.5/categories)), it will be automatically assigned to that category.   

The assigned or automatically matched category is shown in the Category column. 

* * *

## Filters

Filter name | Meaning  
---|---  
`Accept` | Accept job when the title matches the expression.  
If not matched, go to next filter.  
`Requires` | Require job title to contain this expression.   
If matched, go to next filter. If not matched, reject job.  
`Reject` | Reject job when the title matches the expression.  
If not matched, go to next filter.  
`RequiresCat` | Require job to have this category (**after** mapping the indexer category to your own categories).   
If matched, go to next filter. If not matched, reject job.  
`At Least` | The size of the job should be at least this. You can use `K/M/G` notation, where `100M` means at least 100Mbyte.   
If size correct, go to next filter. If size not correct, reject job.  
`At Most` | The size of the job should be at most this. You can use `K/M/G` notation, where `200M` means at most 200Mbyte.   
If size correct, go to next filter. If size not correct, reject job.  
`From SxxEyy` | Only this season/episode and newer will be accepted.   
If matched, go to next filter. If not matched, reject job.  
`From Show SxxEyy` |  Accept this and newer episodes of this specific show.   
Accept if matched. If not matched, go to next filter.  
Directly accepts job, this permits multiple shows in a single feed.   
  
WARNING The `,` (comma) and `#` characters are **not** allowed.

NOTE The `From SxxEyy` and `From Show SxxEyy` will only work when SABnzbd recognizes the season/episode notation in the job title. Wildcards (`*` and `?`) are not supported.

NOTE The `RequireCat` only works for indexers whose categories have been mapped to your [own](/wiki/configuration/4.5/categories).

NOTE Some websites require the inclusion of authentication details in the URL. Please check with your feed provider.

### Feed buttons

Read feed | Read the RSS source again and apply the filters.  
---|---  
Force download | Send all matching items to the queue.  
Clear download | Clear the list of items already sent to the queue.  
Apply Filters | New or altered filters are not directly applied to existing results, click this button to re-filter the results.

## Regular expressions

If you prefix a filter with `re:` it will be interpreted as a Python regular expression (case-insensitive). 

Here's a [tutorial on regular expressions](https://regexone.com/). For all the details see [the Python manual](http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html). 

Simple example: `re: this|that` will match all jobs containing `this` or `that` in the title. 

* * *

## Automatic processing

If you check the checkbox next to the name of the feed, it will be automatically processed. The time between scans can be set with `RSS checking rate`. This can be overridden by using the Scheduler. 

* * *

## First batch

To prevent the download of a (potentially) large backlog, the first batch of NZBs will **not** automatically download. These lines are marked with an asterisk `*`. If you want these matched feed items in this first batch to download, click the `Force Download` button. 

Then, new feed items in subsequent RSS reads will download automatically (if the feed is enabled).
