# Reporter

</div>

Test runner notifies the reporter about various events during test execution. All methods of the reporter are optional.

You can create a custom reporter by implementing a class with some of the reporter methods. Make sure to export this class as default.

-   TypeScript
-   JavaScript

my-awesome-reporter.ts

``` 
import type  from '@playwright/test/reporter';

class MyReporter implements Reporter  = ) `);
  }

  onBegin(config: FullConfig, suite: Suite)  tests`);
  }

  onTestBegin(test: TestCase) `);
  }

  onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) : $`);
  }

  onEnd(result: FullResult) `);
  }
}
export default MyReporter;
```

my-awesome-reporter.js

``` 
// @ts-check

/** @implements  */
class MyReporter `);
  }

  onBegin(config, suite)  tests`);
  }

  onTestBegin(test) `);
  }

  onTestEnd(test, result) : $`);
  }

  onEnd(result) `);
  }
}

module.exports = MyReporter;
```

Now use this reporter with [testConfig.reporter](/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-reporter). Learn more about [using reporters](/docs/test-reporters).

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig(]],
});
```

Here is a typical order of reporter calls:

-   [reporter.onBegin()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-begin) is called once with a root suite that contains all other suites and tests. Learn more about [suites hierarchy](/docs/api/class-suite "Suite").
-   [reporter.onTestBegin()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-test-begin) is called for each test run. It is given a [TestCase](/docs/api/class-testcase "TestCase") that is executed, and a [TestResult](/docs/api/class-testresult "TestResult") that is almost empty. Test result will be populated while the test runs (for example, with steps and stdio) and will get final `status` once the test finishes.
-   [reporter.onStepBegin()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-step-begin) and [reporter.onStepEnd()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-step-end) are called for each executed step inside the test. When steps are executed, test run has not finished yet.
-   [reporter.onTestEnd()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-test-end) is called when test run has finished. By this time, [TestResult](/docs/api/class-testresult "TestResult") is complete and you can use [testResult.status](/docs/api/class-testresult#test-result-status), [testResult.error](/docs/api/class-testresult#test-result-error) and more.
-   [reporter.onEnd()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-end) is called once after all tests that should run had finished.
-   [reporter.onExit()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-exit) is called immediately before the test runner exits.

Additionally, [reporter.onStdOut()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-std-out) and [reporter.onStdErr()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-std-err) are called when standard output is produced in the worker process, possibly during a test execution, and [reporter.onError()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-error) is called when something went wrong outside of the test execution.

If your custom reporter does not print anything to the terminal, implement [reporter.printsToStdio()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-prints-to-stdio) and return `false`. This way, Playwright will use one of the standard terminal reporters in addition to your custom reporter to enhance user experience.

**Reporter errors**

Playwright will swallow any errors thrown in your custom reporter methods. If you need to detect or fail on reporter errors, you must wrap and handle them yourself.

**Merged report API notes**

When merging multiple [`blob`](/docs/test-reporters#blob-reporter) reports via [`merge-reports`](/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli) CLI command, the same [Reporter](/docs/api/class-reporter "Reporter") API is called to produce final reports and all existing reporters should work without any changes. There some subtle differences though which might affect some custom reporters.

-   Projects from different shards are always kept as separate [TestProject](/docs/api/class-testproject "TestProject") objects. E.g. if project \'Desktop Chrome\' was sharded across 5 machines then there will be 5 instances of projects with the same name in the config passed to [reporter.onBegin()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-begin).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods") 

### onBegin[​](#reporter-on-begin "Direct link to onBegin") 

Added in: v1.10 reporter.onBegin

Called once before running tests. All tests have been already discovered and put into a hierarchy of [Suite](/docs/api/class-suite "Suite")s.

**Usage**

``` 
reporter.onBegin(config, suite);
```

**Arguments**

-   `config` [FullConfig](/docs/api/class-fullconfig "FullConfig")[][\#](#reporter-on-begin-option-config)

    Resolved configuration.

-   `suite` [Suite](/docs/api/class-suite "Suite")[][\#](#reporter-on-begin-option-suite)

    The root suite that contains all projects, files and test cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### onEnd[​](#reporter-on-end "Direct link to onEnd") 

Added in: v1.10 reporter.onEnd

Called after all tests have been run, or testing has been interrupted. Note that this method may return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise") and Playwright Test will await it. Reporter is allowed to override the status and hence affect the exit code of the test runner.

**Usage**

``` 
await reporter.onEnd(result);
```

**Arguments**

-   `result` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")[][\#](#reporter-on-end-option-result)

    -   `status` \"passed\" \| \"failed\" \| \"timedout\" \| \"interrupted\"

        Test run status.

    -   `startTime` [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date "Date")

        Test run start wall time.

    -   `duration` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number")

        Test run duration in milliseconds.

    Result of the full test run, `status` can be one of:

    -   `'passed'` - Everything went as expected.
    -   `'failed'` - Any test has failed.
    -   `'timedout'` - The [testConfig.globalTimeout](/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-global-timeout) has been reached.
    -   `'interrupted'` - Interrupted by the user.

**Returns**

-   [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")\<[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")\>[][\#](#reporter-on-end-return)
    -   `status` \"passed\" \| \"failed\" \| \"timedout\" \| \"interrupted\" *(optional)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### onError[​](#reporter-on-error "Direct link to onError") 

Added in: v1.10 reporter.onError

Called on some global error, for example unhandled exception in the worker process.

**Usage**

``` 
reporter.onError(error);
```

**Arguments**

-   `error` [TestError](/docs/api/class-testerror "TestError")[][\#](#reporter-on-error-option-error)

    The error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### onExit[​](#reporter-on-exit "Direct link to onExit") 

Added in: v1.33 reporter.onExit

Called immediately before test runner exists. At this point all the reporters have received the [reporter.onEnd()](/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-end) signal, so all the reports should be build. You can run the code that uploads the reports in this hook.

**Usage**

``` 
await reporter.onExit();
```

**Returns**

-   [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")\<[void](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined "void")\>[][\#](#reporter-on-exit-return)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### onStdErr[​](#reporter-on-std-err "Direct link to onStdErr")
