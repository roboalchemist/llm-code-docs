# Global setup and teardown

</div>

## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction") 

There are two ways to configure global setup and teardown: using a global setup file and setting it in the config under [`globalSetup`](#option-2-configure-globalsetup-and-globalteardown) or using [project dependencies](#option-1-project-dependencies). With project dependencies, you define a project that runs before all other projects. This is the recommended approach, as it integrates better with the Playwright test runner: your HTML report will include the global setup, traces will be recorded, and fixtures can be used. For a detailed comparison of the two approaches, see the table below.

## Option 1: Project Dependencies[​](#option-1-project-dependencies "Direct link to Option 1: Project Dependencies") 

[Project dependencies](/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-dependencies) are a list of projects that need to run before the tests in another project run. They can be useful for configuring the global setup actions so that one project depends on this running first. Using dependencies allows global setup to produce traces and other artifacts.

### Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup") 

First we add a new project with the name \'setup db\'. We then give it a [testProject.testMatch](/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-test-match) property in order to match the file called `global.setup.ts`:

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig(,
    // 
  ]
});
```

Then we add the [testProject.dependencies](/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-dependencies) property to our projects that depend on the setup project and pass into the array the name of our dependency project, which we defined in the previous step:

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig(,
    ,
      dependencies: ['setup db'],
    },
  ]
});
```

In this example the \'chromium with db\' project depends on the \'setup db\' project. We then create a setup test, stored at root level of your project (note that setup and teardown code must be defined as regular tests by calling [test()](/docs/api/class-test#test-call) function):

tests/global.setup.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

setup('create new database', async () => );
```

tests/menu.spec.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

test('menu', async () => );
```

### Teardown[​](#teardown "Direct link to Teardown") 

You can teardown your setup by adding a [testProject.teardown](/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-teardown) property to your setup project. This will run after all dependent projects have run.

First we add the [testProject.teardown](/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-teardown) property to our setup project with the name \'cleanup db\' which is the name we gave to our teardown project in the previous step:

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig(,
    ,
    ,
      dependencies: ['setup db'],
    },
  ]
});
```

Then we create a `global.teardown.ts` file in the tests directory of your project. This will be used to delete the data from the database after all tests have run.

tests/global.teardown.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

teardown('delete database', async () => );
```

### Test filtering[​](#test-filtering "Direct link to Test filtering") 

All test filtering options, such as `--grep`/`--grep-invert`, `--shard`, filtering directly by location in the command line, or using [`test.only()`](/docs/api/class-test#test-only), directly select the primary tests to be run. If those tests belong to a project with dependencies, all tests from those dependencies will also run.

You can pass `--no-deps` command line option to ignore all dependencies and teardowns. Only your directly selected projects will run.

## Option 2: Configure globalSetup and globalTeardown[​](#option-2-configure-globalsetup-and-globalteardown "Direct link to Option 2: Configure globalSetup and globalTeardown") 

You can use the `globalSetup` option in the [configuration file](/docs/test-configuration#advanced-configuration) to set something up once before running all tests. The global setup file must export a single function that takes a config object. This function will be run once before all the tests.

Similarly, use `globalTeardown` to run something once after all the tests. Alternatively, let `globalSetup` return a function that will be used as a global teardown. You can pass data such as port number, authentication tokens, etc. from your global setup to your tests using environment variables.

Beware that `globalSetup` and `globalTeardown` lack some features --- see the [intro](#introduction) section for a detailed comparison. Consider using [project dependencies](#option-1-project-dependencies) instead to get full feature support.

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig();
```

### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example") 

Here is a global setup example that authenticates once and reuses authentication state in tests. It uses the `baseURL` and `storageState` options from the configuration file.

global-setup.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig)  = config.projects[0].use;
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(baseURL!);
  await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('user');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
  await page.getByText('Sign in').click();
  await page.context().storageState();
  await browser.close();
}

export default globalSetup;
```

Specify `globalSetup`, `baseURL` and `storageState` in the configuration file.

playwright.config.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig(,
});
```

Tests start already authenticated because we specify `storageState` that was populated by global setup.

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async () => );
```

You can make arbitrary data available in your tests from your global setup file by setting them as environment variables via `process.env`.

global-setup.ts

``` 
import type  from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) );
}

export default globalSetup;
```

Tests have access to the `process.env` properties set in the global setup.

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async () =>  = process.env;

  // FOO and BAR properties are populated.
  expect(FOO).toEqual('some data');

  const complexData = JSON.parse(BAR);
  expect(BAR).toEqual();
});
```

### Capturing trace of failures during global setup[​](#capturing-trace-of-failures-during-global-setup "Direct link to Capturing trace of failures during global setup") 

In some instances, it may be useful to capture a trace of failures encountered during the global setup. In order to do this, you must [start tracing](/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start) in your setup, and you must ensure that you [stop tracing](/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop) if an error occurs before that error is thrown. This can be achieved by wrapping your setup in a `try...catch` block. Here is an example that expands the global setup example to capture a trace.

global-setup.ts

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig)  = config.projects[0].use;
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  try );
    await page.goto(baseURL!);
    await page.getByLabel('User Name').fill('user');
    await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
    await page.getByText('Sign in').click();
    await context.storageState();
    await context.tracing.stop();
    await browser.close();
  } catch (error) );
    await browser.close();
    throw error;
  }
}

export default globalSetup;
```
