# Migrating from Puppeteer

</div>

## Migration Principles[​](#migration-principles "Direct link to Migration Principles") 

This guide describes migration to [Playwright Library](/docs/library) and [Playwright Test](/docs/intro) from Puppeteer. The APIs have similarities, but Playwright offers much more possibilities for web testing and cross-browser automation.

-   Most Puppeteer APIs can be used as is
-   The use of [ElementHandle](/docs/api/class-elementhandle "ElementHandle") is discouraged, use [Locator](/docs/api/class-locator "Locator") objects and web-first assertions instead.
-   Playwright is cross-browser
-   You probably don\'t need explicit wait

## Cheat Sheet[​](#cheat-sheet "Direct link to Cheat Sheet") 

Puppeteer

Playwright Library

`await puppeteer.launch()`

`await playwright.chromium.launch()`

`puppeteer.launch()`

`await playwright.firefox.launch()`

WebKit is not supported by Puppeteer

`await playwright.webkit.launch()`

`await browser.createIncognitoBrowserContext(...)`

`await browser.newContext(...)`

`await page.setViewport(...)`

`await page.setViewportSize(...)`

`await page.waitForXPath(XPathSelector)`

`await page.waitForSelector(XPathSelector)`

`await page.waitForNetworkIdle(...)`

`await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`

`await page.$eval(...)`

[Assertions](/docs/test-assertions) can often be used instead to verify text, attribute, class\...

`await page.$(...)`

Discouraged, use [Locators](/docs/api/class-locator) instead

`await page.$x(xpath_selector)`

Discouraged, use [Locators](/docs/api/class-locator) instead

No methods dedicated to checkbox or radio input

`await page.locator(selector).check()`\
`await page.locator(selector).uncheck()`

`await page.click(selector)`

`await page.locator(selector).click()`

`await page.focus(selector)`

`await page.locator(selector).focus()`

`await page.hover(selector)`

`await page.locator(selector).hover()`

`await page.select(selector, values)`

`await page.locator(selector).selectOption(values)`

`await page.tap(selector)`

`await page.locator(selector).tap()`

`await page.type(selector, ...)`

`await page.locator(selector).fill(...)`

`await page.waitForFileChooser(...)`\
`await elementHandle.uploadFile(...)`

`await page.locator(selector).setInputFiles(...)`

`await page.cookies([...urls])`

`await browserContext.cookies([urls])`

`await page.deleteCookie(...cookies)`

`await browserContext.clearCookies()`

`await page.setCookie(...cookies)`

`await browserContext.addCookies(cookies)`

`page.on(...)`

`page.on(...)`\
In order to intercept and mutate requests, see [page.route()](/docs/api/class-page#page-route)

`page.waitForNavigation` and `page.waitForSelector` remain, but in many cases will not be necessary due to [auto-waiting](/docs/actionability).

The use of [ElementHandle](/docs/api/class-elementhandle "ElementHandle") is discouraged, use [Locator](/docs/api/class-locator "Locator") objects and web-first assertions instead.

Locators are the central piece of Playwright\'s auto-waiting and retry-ability. Locators are strict. This means that all operations on locators that imply some target DOM element will throw an exception if more than one element matches a given selector.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples") 

### Automation example[​](#automation-example "Direct link to Automation example") 

Puppeteer:

``` 
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => );
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/', );
  await page.screenshot();
  await browser.close();
})();
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright:

``` 
const  = require('playwright'); // 1

(async () => ); // 3
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/', );
  await page.screenshot();
  await browser.close();
})();
```

Migration highlights (see inline comments in the Playwright code snippet):

1.  Each Playwright Library file has explicit import of `chromium`. Other browsers `webkit` or `firefox` can be used.
2.  For browser state isolation, consider [browser contexts](/docs/browser-contexts)
3.  `setViewport` becomes `setViewportSize`
4.  `networkidle2` becomes `networkidle`. Please note that in most cases it is not useful, thanks to auto-waiting.

### Test example[​](#test-example "Direct link to Test example") 

Puppeteer with Jest:

``` 
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

describe('Playwright homepage', () => );

  it('contains hero title', async () => );

  afterAll(() => browser.close());
});
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright Test:

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test'; // 1

test.describe('Playwright homepage', () => ) => );
});
```

1.  Each Playwright Test file has explicit import of the `test` and `expect` functions
2.  Test function is marked with `async`
3.  Playwright Test is given a `page` as one of its parameters. This is one of the many [useful fixtures](/docs/api/class-fixtures) in Playwright Test. Playwright Test creates an isolated [Page](/docs/api/class-page "Page") object for each test. However, if you\'d like to reuse a single [Page](/docs/api/class-page "Page") object between multiple tests, you can create your own in [test.beforeAll()](/docs/api/class-test#test-before-all) and close it in [test.afterAll()](/docs/api/class-test#test-after-all).
4.  Locator creation with [page.locator()](/docs/api/class-page#page-locator) is one of the few methods that is sync.
5.  Use [assertions](/docs/test-assertions) to verify the state instead of `page.$eval()`.

## Testing[​](#testing "Direct link to Testing") 

To improve testing, it is advised to use [Locators](/docs/api/class-locator) and web-first [Assertions](/docs/test-assertions). See [Writing Tests](/docs/writing-tests)

It is common with Puppeteer to use `page.evaluate()` or `page.$eval()` to inspect an [ElementHandle](/docs/api/class-elementhandle "ElementHandle") and extract the value of text content, attribute, class\... Web-first [Assertions](/docs/test-assertions) offers several matchers for this purpose, it is more reliable and readable.

[Playwright Test](/docs/intro) is our first-party recommended test runner to be used with Playwright. It provides several features like Page Object Model, parallelism, fixtures or reporters.
