# Command line

</div>

Playwright provides a powerful command line interface for running tests, generating code, debugging, and more. The most up to date list of commands and arguments available on the CLI can always be retrieved via `npx playwright --help`.

## Essential Commands[​](#essential-commands "Direct link to Essential Commands") 

### Run Tests[​](#run-tests "Direct link to Run Tests") 

Run your Playwright tests. [Read more about running tests](/docs/running-tests).

#### Syntax[​](#syntax "Direct link to Syntax") 

``` 
npx playwright test [options] [test-filter...]
```

#### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples") 

``` 
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run a single test file
npx playwright test tests/todo-page.spec.ts

# Run a set of test files
npx playwright test tests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/

# Run tests at a specific line
npx playwright test my-spec.ts:42

# Run tests by title
npx playwright test -g "add a todo item"

# Run tests in headed browsers
npx playwright test --headed

#### Common Options[​](#common-options "Direct link to Common Options") 

Option

Description

`--debug`

Run tests with Playwright Inspector. Shortcut for `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable and `--timeout=0 --max-failures=1 --headed --workers=1` options.

`--headed`

Run tests in headed browsers (default: headless).

`-g <grep>` or `--grep <grep>`

`--project <project-name...>`

Only run tests from the specified list of projects, supports \'\*\' wildcard (default: run all projects).

`--ui`

`-j <workers>` or `--workers <workers>`

Number of concurrent workers or percentage of logical CPU cores, use 1 to run in a single worker (default: 50%).

#### All Options[​](#all-options "Direct link to All Options") 

Option

Description

Non-option arguments

Each argument is treated as a regular expression matched against the full test file path. Only tests from files matching the pattern will be executed. Special symbols like `$` or `*` should be escaped with `\`. In many shells/terminals you may need to quote the arguments.

`-c <file>` or `--config <file>`

Configuration file, or a test directory with optional \"playwright.config.?\". Defaults to `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` in the current directory.

`--debug`

Run tests with Playwright Inspector. Shortcut for `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable and `--timeout=0 --max-failures=1 --headed --workers=1` options.

`--fail-on-flaky-tests`

Fail if any test is flagged as flaky (default: false).

`--forbid-only`

Fail if `test.only` is called (default: false). Useful on CI.

`--fully-parallel`

Run all tests in parallel (default: false).

`--global-timeout <timeout>`

Maximum time this test suite can run in milliseconds (default: unlimited).

`-g <grep>` or `--grep <grep>`

Only run tests matching this regular expression (default: \".\*\").

`--grep-invert <grep>`

Only run tests that do not match this regular expression.

`--headed`

Run tests in headed browsers (default: headless).

`--ignore-snapshots`

Ignore screenshot and snapshot expectations.

`-j <workers>` or `--workers <workers>`

Number of concurrent workers or percentage of logical CPU cores, use 1 to run in a single worker (default: 50%).

`--last-failed`

Only re-run the failures.

`--list`

Collect all the tests and report them, but do not run.

`--max-failures <N>` or `-x`

Stop after the first `N` failures. Passing `-x` stops after the first failure.

`--no-deps`

Do not run project dependencies.

`--output <dir>`

Folder for output artifacts (default: \"test-results\").

`--only-changed [ref]`

Only run test files that have been changed between \'HEAD\' and \'ref\'. Defaults to running all uncommitted changes. Only supports Git.

`--pass-with-no-tests`

Makes test run succeed even if no tests were found.

`--project <project-name...>`

Only run tests from the specified list of projects, supports \'\*\' wildcard (default: run all projects).

`--quiet`

Suppress stdio.

`--repeat-each <N>`

Run each test `N` times (default: 1).

`--reporter <reporter>`

Reporter to use, comma-separated, can be \"dot\", \"line\", \"list\", or others (default: \"list\"). You can also pass a path to a custom reporter file.

`--retries <retries>`

Maximum retry count for flaky tests, zero for no retries (default: no retries).

`--shard <shard>`

Shard tests and execute only the selected shard, specified in the form \"current/all\", 1-based, e.g., \"3/5\".

`--test-list <file>`

Path to a file containing a list of tests to run. See [test list](#test-list) for details.

`--test-list-invert <file>`

Path to a file containing a list of tests to skip. See [test list](#test-list) for details.

`--timeout <timeout>`

Specify test timeout threshold in milliseconds, zero for unlimited (default: 30 seconds).

`--trace <mode>`

Force tracing mode, can be `on`, `off`, `on-first-retry`, `on-all-retries`, `retain-on-failure`, `retain-on-first-failure`.

`--tsconfig <path>`

Path to a single tsconfig applicable to all imported files (default: look up tsconfig for each imported file separately).

`--ui`

Run tests in interactive UI mode.

`--ui-host <host>`

Host to serve UI on; specifying this option opens UI in a browser tab.

`--ui-port <port>`

Port to serve UI on, 0 for any free port; specifying this option opens UI in a browser tab.

`-u` or `--update-snapshots [mode]`

Update snapshots with actual results. Possible values are \"all\", \"changed\", \"missing\", and \"none\". Running tests without the flag defaults to \"missing\"; running tests with the flag but without a value defaults to \"changed\".

`--update-source-method [mode]`

Update snapshots with actual results. Possible values are \"patch\" (default), \"3way\" and \"overwrite\". \"Patch\" creates a unified diff file that can be used to update the source code later. \"3way\" generates merge conflict markers in source code. \"Overwrite\" overwrites the source code with the new snapshot values.

`-x`

Stop after the first failure.

#### Test list[​](#test-list "Direct link to Test list") 

Options `--test-list` and `--test-list-invert` accept a path to a test list file. This file should list tests in the format similar to the output produced in `--list` mode.

``` 
# This is a test list file.
# It can include comments and empty lines.

# Fully qualified test with a project:
[chromium] › path/to/example.spec.ts:3:9 › suite › nested suite › example test

# This test is included for all projects:
path/to/example.spec.ts:3:9 › example test

# Use "›" or ">" as a separator:
[firefox] > example.spec.ts > suite > nested suite > example test

# Line/column numbers are completely ignored, you can omit them.
# Three entries below refer to the same test:
example.spec.ts › example test
example.spec.ts:15 › example test
example.spec.ts:42:42 › example test
