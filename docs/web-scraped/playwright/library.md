## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction") 

Playwright Library provides unified APIs for launching and interacting with browsers, while Playwright Test provides all this plus a fully managed end-to-end Test Runner and experience.

Under most circumstances, for end-to-end testing, you\'ll want to use `@playwright/test` (Playwright Test), and not `playwright` (Playwright Library) directly. To get started with Playwright Test, follow the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/intro).

## Differences when using library[​](#differences-when-using-library "Direct link to Differences when using library") 

### Library Example[​](#library-example "Direct link to Library Example") 

The following is an example of using the Playwright Library directly to launch Chromium, go to a page, and check its title:

-   TypeScript
-   JavaScript

``` 
import  from 'playwright';
import assert from 'node:assert';

(async () => )();
```

``` 
const assert = require('node:assert');
const  = require('playwright');

(async () => )();
```

Run it with `node my-script.js`.

### Test Example[​](#test-example "Direct link to Test Example") 

A test to achieve similar behavior, would look like:

-   TypeScript
-   JavaScript

``` 
import  from '@playwright/test';

test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);

test('should be titled', async () => );
```

``` 
const  = require('@playwright/test');

test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);

test('should be titled', async () => );
```

Run it with `npx playwright test`.

### Key Differences[​](#key-differences "Direct link to Key Differences") 

The key differences to note are as follows:

Library

Test

Installation

`npm install playwright`

`npm init playwright@latest` - note `install` vs. `init`

Install browsers

Install `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and/or `@playwright/browser-webkit`

`npx playwright install` or `npx playwright install chromium` for a single one

`import` from

`playwright`

`@playwright/test`

Initialization

Explicitly need to:

1.  Pick a browser to use, e.g. `chromium`
2.  Launch browser with [browserType.launch()](/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch)
3.  Create a context with [browser.newContext()](/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context), *and* pass any context options explicitly, e.g. `devices['iPhone 11']`
4.  Create a page with [browserContext.newPage()](/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-new-page)

An isolated `page` and `context` are provided to each test out-of the box, along with other [built-in fixtures](/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures). No explicit creation. If referenced by the test in its arguments, the Test Runner will create them for the test. (i.e. lazy-initialization)

Assertions

No built-in Web-First Assertions

[Web-First assertions](/docs/test-assertions) like:

-   [expect(page).toHaveTitle()](/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-title)
-   [expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()](/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1)

which auto-wait and retry for the condition to be met.

Timeouts

Defaults to 30s for most operations.

Most operations don\'t time out, but every test has a timeout that makes it fail (30s by default).

Cleanup

Explicitly need to:

1.  Close context with [browserContext.close()](/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-close)
2.  Close browser with [browser.close()](/docs/api/class-browser#browser-close)

No explicit close of [built-in fixtures](/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures); the Test Runner will take care of it.

Running

When using the Library, you run the code as a node script, possibly with some compilation first.

When using the Test Runner, you use the `npx playwright test` command. Along with your [config](/docs/test-configuration), the Test Runner handles any compilation and choosing what to run and how to run it.

In addition to the above, Playwright Test, as a full-featured Test Runner, includes:

-   [Configuration Matrix and Projects](/docs/test-configuration): In the above example, in the Playwright Library version, if we wanted to run with a different device or browser, we\'d have to modify the script and plumb the information through. With Playwright Test, we can just specify the [matrix of configurations](/docs/test-configuration) in one place, and it will create run the one test under each of these configurations.
-   [Parallelization](/docs/test-parallel)
-   [Web-First Assertions](/docs/test-assertions)
-   [Reporting](/docs/test-reporters)
-   [Retries](/docs/test-retries)
-   [Easily Enabled Tracing](/docs/trace-viewer-intro)
-   and more...

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage") 

Use npm or Yarn to install Playwright library in your Node.js project. See [system requirements](/docs/intro#system-requirements).

``` 
npm i -D playwright
```

You will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically.

``` 
# Download the Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browser
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit

# Alternatively, add packages that will download a browser upon npm install
npm i -D @playwright/browser-chromium @playwright/browser-firefox @playwright/browser-webkit
```

See [managing browsers](/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries) for more options.

Once installed, you can import Playwright in a Node.js script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (`chromium`, `firefox` and `webkit`).

``` 
const  = require('playwright');

(async () => )();
```

Playwright APIs are asynchronous and return Promise objects. Our code examples use [the async/await pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to ease readability. The code is wrapped in an unnamed async arrow function which is invoking itself.

``` 
(async () => )(); // End of the function and () to invoke itself
```

## First script[​](#first-script "Direct link to First script") 

In our first script, we will navigate to `https://playwright.dev/` and take a screenshot in WebKit.

``` 
const  = require('playwright');

(async () => );
  await browser.close();
})();
```

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the `headless: false` flag while launching the browser. You can also use `slowMo` to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools [section](/docs/debug).

``` 
firefox.launch();
```

## Record scripts[​](#record-scripts "Direct link to Record scripts") 

[Command line tools](/docs/test-cli) can be used to record user interactions and generate JavaScript code.

``` 
npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org
```

## Browser downloads[​](#browser-downloads "Direct link to Browser downloads") 

To download Playwright browsers run:

``` 
# Explicitly download browsers
npx playwright install
```

Alternatively, you can add `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and `@playwright/browser-webkit` packages to automatically download the respective browser during the package installation.

``` 
# Use a helper package that downloads a browser on npm install
npm install @playwright/browser-chromium
```

**Download behind a firewall or a proxy**

Pass `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to download through a proxy.

-   Bash
-   PowerShell
-   Batch

``` 
# Manual
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npm install
```

``` 
# Manual
$Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
$Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
npm install
```

``` 
# Manual
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1
npm install
```

**Download from artifact repository**

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft\'s CDN. Pass `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` environment variable to download from an internal artifacts repository instead.

-   Bash
-   PowerShell
-   Batch

``` 
# Manual
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npm install
```

``` 
# Manual
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
npm install
```

``` 
# Manual
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
npx playwright install

# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1
npm install
```

**Skip browser download**

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately. This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installing packages.

-   Bash
-   PowerShell
-   Batch

``` 
# When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

``` 
# When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
npm install
```

``` 
# When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox
# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages
set PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
npm install
```

## TypeScript support[​](#typescript-support "Direct link to TypeScript support") 

Playwright includes built-in support for TypeScript. Type definitions will be imported automatically. It is recommended to use type-checking to improve the IDE experience.

### In JavaScript[​](#in-javascript "Direct link to In JavaScript") 

Add the following to the top of your JavaScript file to get type-checking in VS Code or WebStorm.

``` 
// @ts-check
// ...
```

Alternatively, you can use JSDoc to set types for variables.

``` 
/** @type  */
let page;
```

### In TypeScript[​](#in-typescript "Direct link to In TypeScript") 

TypeScript support will work out-of-the-box. Types can also be imported explicitly.

``` 
let page: import('playwright').Page;
```
