# Vulnerability Management[¶](#vulnerability-management "Permanent link")

## Reporting Vulnerabilities[¶](#reporting-vulnerabilities "Permanent link")

As mentioned in the [security policy](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/SECURITY.md), security vulnerabilities may be reported privately to the project via [GitHub](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/new).

## Vulnerability Management Team[¶](#vulnerability-management-team "Permanent link")

Once a vulnerability has been reported to the project, the Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) is responsible for managing the vulnerability. The VMT is responsible for:

-   Triaging the vulnerability.
-   Coordinating with reporters and project maintainers on vulnerability analysis and resolution.
-   Drafting of security advisories for confirmed vulnerabilities, as appropriate.
-   Coordination with project maintainers on a coordinated release of the fix and security advisory.

### Security Advisories[¶](#security-advisories "Permanent link")

Advisories are published via GitHub through the same system used to report vulnerabilities. More information on the process can be found in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).

### Team Members[¶](#team-members "Permanent link")

We prefer to keep all vulnerability-related communication on the security report on GitHub. However, if you need to contact the VMT directly for an urgent issue, you may contact the following individuals:

-   Simon Mo - [[\[email protected\]]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#74071d191b1a5a191b341c110d5a171b19)
-   Russell Bryant - [[\[email protected\]]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c1b3a3b3b8a0afb581b3a4a5a9a0b5efa2aeac)
-   Huzaifa Sidhpurwala - [[\[email protected\]]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b233e312a222d2a380b392e2f232a3f65282426)

## Slack Discussion[¶](#slack-discussion "Permanent link")

You may use the `#security` channel in the [vLLM Slack](https://slack.vllm.ai) to discuss security-related topics. However, please do not disclose any vulnerabilities in this channel. If you need to report a vulnerability, please use the GitHub security advisory system or contact a VMT member privately.

## Vulnerability Disclosure[¶](#vulnerability-disclosure "Permanent link")

The process for disclosing vulnerabilities is the following:

-   The VMT will work with the project maintainers to develop a fix for the vulnerability.
-   The VMT will coordinate with the reporter and project maintainers to prepare a security advisory that adequately describes the vulnerability and its impact.
-   The VMT will coordinate with the project maintainers to publish a fix and release an update that includes that fix.
-   The VMT will publish the security advisory on GitHub. Release notes will be updated to include a reference to the security advisory.

The VMT and project maintainers will work to minimize the amount of time in between disclosing any public information about the vulnerability and making a release and advisory available.
