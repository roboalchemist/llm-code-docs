Title: The vpath Directive — DevDocs

Markdown Content:
Similar to the `VPATH` variable, but more selective, is the `vpath` directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify a search path for a particular class of file names: those that match a particular pattern. Thus you can supply certain search directories for one class of file names and other directories (or none) for other file names.

There are three forms of the `vpath` directive:

`vpath pattern directories`
Specify the search path directories for file names that match pattern.

The search path, directories, is a list of directories to be searched, separated by colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and MS-Windows) or blanks, just like the search path used in the `VPATH` variable.

`vpath pattern`
Clear out the search path associated with pattern.

`vpath`
Clear all search paths previously specified with `vpath` directives.

A `vpath` pattern is a string containing a ‘%’ character. The string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched for, the ‘%’ character matching any sequence of zero or more characters (as in pattern rules; see [Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules](https://devdocs.io/gnu_make/pattern-rules)). For example, `%.h` matches files that end in `.h`. (If there is no ‘%’, the pattern must match the prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)

‘%’ characters in a `vpath` directive’s pattern can be quoted with preceding backslashes (‘\’). Backslashes that would otherwise quote ‘%’ characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote ‘%’ characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting ‘%’ characters go unmolested.

When a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the pattern in a `vpath` directive matches the name of the prerequisite file, then the directories in that directive are searched just like (and before) the directories in the `VPATH` variable.

For example,

vpath %.h ../headers

tells `make` to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in .h in the directory ../headers if the file is not found in the current directory.

If several `vpath` patterns match the prerequisite file’s name, then `make` processes each matching `vpath` directive one by one, searching all the directories mentioned in each directive. `make` handles multiple `vpath` directives in the order in which they appear in the makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are independent of each other.

Thus,

vpath %.c foo
vpath %   blish
vpath %.c bar

will look for a file ending in ‘.c’ in foo, then blish, then bar, while

vpath %.c foo:bar
vpath %   blish

will look for a file ending in ‘.c’ in foo, then bar, then blish.
