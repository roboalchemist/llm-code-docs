Docs›Reference›CLITailscale CLIThe Tailscale client includes a built-in command-line interface (CLI) you can use to manage and troubleshoot your device within your Tailscale network (known as a tailnet).
The Tailscale CLI is available for all plans.
Using the Tailscale CLI
The location of the CLI varies depending on your platform:
LinuxmacOSWindowsOn Linux, the CLI is your primary interface to Tailscale. The tailscale binary is likely already in your $PATH, so you can run commands with:tailscale 
There is no CLI support for iOS and Android.
Tab completion
The Tailscale CLI supports tab-completion for commands, flags, and arguments. You can configure tab-completion with the completion command.
tailscale completion  [--flags] [--descs]
Select your shell, then follow the instructions to load Tailscale CLI completions.
BashZshFishPowerShellTo load tab-completions for Bash, run the following command.source <(tailscale completion bash)
Run the following command to load completions for every new session on Linux, then reload your shell.tailscale completion bash > /etc/bash\_completion.d/tailscale
Run the following command to load completions for every new session on macOS, then reload your shell.tailscale completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash\_completion.d/tailscale
Command Reference
Common flags for all commands:
--socket= Path to the tailscaled socket.
up
Connect your device to Tailscale and authenticate if needed.
tailscale up [flags]
Running tailscale up without any flags connects to Tailscale.
Common flags:
--accept-routes Accept subnet routes that other nodes advertise. The default depends on the host operating system. For certain platforms - Windows, iOS, Android, the macOS App Store variant, and the macOS standalone variant - the default is to accept routes. All other platforms default to not accepting routes.
--advertise-exit-node Offer to be an exit node for outbound internet traffic from the Tailscale network. Defaults to not offering to be an exit node.
--advertise-routes= Expose physical subnet routes to your entire Tailscale network.
--exit-node= Provide a Tailscale IP or machine name to use as an exit node. To disable the use of an exit node, pass the flag with an empty argument: --exit-node=.
--exit-node-allow-lan-access Allow the client node access to its own LAN while connected to an exit node. Defaults to not allowing access while connected to an exit node.
--force-reauth Force re-authentication.
--snat-subnet-routes (Linux only) Disable source NAT. In normal operations, a subnet device sees the traffic originating from the subnet router. This simplifies routing, but does not allow traversing multiple networks. By disabling source NAT, the end machine sees the LAN IP address of the originating machine as the source.
--stateful-filtering Enable stateful filtering for subnet routers and exit nodes. When enabled, inbound packets with another node's destination IP are dropped, unless they are a part of a tracked outbound connection from that node. Defaults to disabled.
--shields-up Block incoming connections from other devices on your Tailscale network. Useful for personal devices that only make outgoing connections.
--ssh Run a Tailscale SSH server, permitting access per the tailnet administrator's declared access policy, or the default policy if none is defined. Defaults to false.
For a complete list of available flags, refer to the tailscale up topic.
down
Disconnect from Tailscale. Running this command is the same as choosing to disconnect from or quit a Tailscale client.
tailscale down
When disconnected, you cannot reach devices over Tailscale. To reconnect, re-run tailscale up without any flags.
Available flags:
--accept-risk= Accept risk and skip confirmation for risk type. This can be either lose-ssh or all, or an empty string to not accept risk.
--reason="" Specify the reason (inside quotes) for disconnecting Tailscale when the system policies AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason are enabled. For example, tailscale down --reason="DNS issues".
bugreport
The bugreport command is available in Tailscale v1.8 or later. If you don't see this command, consider updating your Tailscale client.
Generate a bug report with diagnostic information.
The bugreport command makes it easier to report bugs to the Tailscale team by marking diagnostic logs with indicators to make triage easier.
If you encounter a connectivity issue, run tailscale bugreport on the device experiencing the issue at the time you encounter it. This command prints a random identifier into diagnostic logs, which you can share with our team.
Identifiers look like this:
$ tailscale bugreport
BUG-1b7641a16971a9cd75822c0ed8043fee70ae88cf05c52981dc220eb96a5c49a8-20210427151443Z-fbcd4fd3a4b7ad94
This command shares no personally identifiable information and is unused unless you share the bug identifier with our team.
Available flags:
--diagnose Prints additional verbose information about the system to the Tailscale logs after generating a bugreport identifier, which can then be viewed by our support team. Defaults to false.
--record Pause and then write another bugreport. Use this flag to create an initial bugreport identifier. During the pause, perform the action that reproduces your issue. Then, press Enter to create a second bugreport identifier. Share both bug identifiers with our team. Defaults to false.
cert
Generate Let's Encrypt certificate and key files on the host for HTTPS certificates in your tailnet.
If you are trying to serve a folder of files or reverse proxy to an HTTP service, use the tailscale serve command instead.
tailscale cert hostname.tails-scales.ts.net
Alternatively, if you want to save the certificate and private key to files, you can use the --cert-file and --key-file arguments:
tailscale cert --cert-file=cert.pem --key-file=key.pem hostname.tails-scales.ts.net
The certificates provided by Let's Encrypt have a 90-day expiry and require periodic renewal. When a certificate is delivered as files on disk which you then move to an install location, such as when using tailscale cert, the tailscaled daemon doesn't know where to place a renewed certificate or how to install it. As a result, you are responsible for renewing any certificates that you create using tailscale cert.
If a certificate is handled without the user initiating any file-based certificate installation (such as when using the Caddy integration of Tailscale) then the certificate will automatically renew without the user doing anything.
Available flags:
--cert-file= Specify the certificate output path.
--key-file= Specify the private key output path.
--min-validity= Request a specified minimum remaining validity on the returned certificate. duration can be any value parseable by time.ParseDuration(). For example, use 120h to set the duration to five days.
--serve-demo Serve on port :443 using the cert as a demo, instead of writing out the files to disk.
The --min-validity flag lets you ensure that the returned certificate is valid for at least the specified duration. If you specify a duration longer than the certification lifetime set by Let's Encyrpt, it uses the maximum lifetime set by Let's Encrypt.

Expose and collect Tailscale client metrics for use with third-party monitoring systems.
tailscale metrics
Subcommands:
print Shows client metrics in the current terminal session.
write Writes metric values to a text file.
netcheck
Get a report on your current physical network conditions. This command is provided to help debug connection troubles.
tailscale netcheck
netcheck will output a report like this:
Report:
\* Time: 2025-03-13T16:35:03.336481Z
\* UDP: true
\* IPv4: yes, 
\* IPv6: yes, 
\* MappingVariesByDestIP: false
\* PortMapping:
\* Nearest DERP: Seattle
\* DERP latency:
- sea: 24.2ms (Seattle)
- sfo: 50.5ms (San Francisco)
- lax: 57.2ms (Los Angeles)
- den: 58.5ms (Denver)
- dfw: 63ms (Dallas)
- ord: 73.3ms (Chicago)
(In the example output, the list of DERP servers is truncated for brevity.)
UDP shows whether UDP traffic is enabled on the current network. If this is false, it's unlikely Tailscale will be able to make point-to-point connections, and will instead rely on our encrypted TCP relays (DERP)
IPv4 and IPv6 show your network public IP addresses and support for both protocols.
MappingVariesByDestIP describes whether your device is behind a difficult NAT that varies the device's IP address depending on the destination.
HairPinning describes whether your router can route connections from endpoints on your LAN back to your LAN using those endpoints' globally-mapped IPv4 addresses/ports.
PortMapping describes a list of which three port-mapping services exist on your router. Possible values are "UPnP", "NAT-PMP", and "PCP".
DERP latency and Nearest DERP describe latency from our encrypted TCP relays (DERP). The lowest latency ("nearest") server is used for traffic.
If any fields are blank, it means Tailscale wasn't able to measure that network property.
All the information from tailscale netcheck is also available in the Machines page of the admin console, by selecting a particular machine.
Available flags:
--every= If non-zero, do an incremental report with the given frequency.
--format= Output format; empty (for human-readable), json or json-line.
--verbose Verbose logs.
nc
Connect to a port on a host, connected to stdin/stdout.
tailscale nc  
ping
Attempt to ping another device exclusively over Tailscale.
The regular ping command often works fine over Tailscale, but tailscale ping provides more details about the connection over Tailscale that can be helpful when troubleshooting connectivity.
tailscale ping 
You can call tailscale ping using either a 100.x.y.z address or a machine name.
Available flags:
--c Maximum number of pings to send. Defaults to 10.
--icmp, --icmp=false Perform an ICMP-level ping (through WireGuard, but not the local host OS stack). Defaults to false.
--peerapi, --peerapi=false Try hitting the peer's PeerAPI HTTP server. Defaults to false.
--size= Size of the ping message (default pings only). 0 for minimum size.
--tsmp, --tsmp=false Perform a TSMP-level ping (through WireGuard, but not either host's OS stack). Defaults to false.
--timeout= Maximum amount of time to wait before giving up on a ping. duration can be any value parseable by time.ParseDuration(). Defaults to 5s.
--until-direct, --until-direct=false Stop once a direct path is established. Defaults to true.
--verbose, --verbose=false Show verbose output. Defaults to false.
There are four types of ping messages supported by the tailscale ping command.
serve
Serve content and local servers from your Tailscale node to your tailnet.
To publicly share the local service to the internet, use the funnel command.
tailscale serve 
tailscale serve  [flags] 
Subcommands:
status Gets the status.
reset Resets the configuration.
For more information, refer to the tailscale serve topic.
set
Change specified preferences.
Unlike tailscale up, this command does not require the complete set of desired settings. It only updates the settings you explicitly set. There are no default values. Note that when using Fast User Switching, changes made are only for the currently connected tailnet.
tailscale set [flags]
Available flags:
--accept-dns Accept DNS configuration from the admin console.
--accept-risk= Accept risk and skip confirmation for risk type. This can be either lose-ssh or all, or an empty string to not accept risk.
--accept-routes, --accept-routes=false Accept subnet routes that other nodes advertise. The default depends on the host operating system. For certain platforms - Windows, iOS, Android, the macOS App Store variant, and the macOS standalone variant - the default is to accept routes. All other platforms default to not accepting routes.
--advertise-connector Offer to be an app connector for domain-specific internet traffic for the tailnet.
--advertise-exit-node, --advertise-exit-node=false Offer to be an exit node for internet traffic for the tailnet.
--advertise-routes= Expose physical subnet routes to your entire Tailscale network. This is a comma-separated string, such as "10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/24", or an empty string to not advertise routes.
--auto-update, --auto-update=false Enable or disable auto-updates for the client.
--exit-node= Provide a Tailscale IP or machine name to use as an exit node. You can also use --exit-node=auto:any to track the suggested exit node and automatically switch to it when available exit nodes or network conditions change. To disable the use of an exit node, pass the flag with an empty argument using --exit-node=.
--exit-node-allow-lan-access, --exit-node-allow-lan-access=false Allow the client node access to its own LAN while connected to an exit node.
--hostname= Hostname to use for the device instead of the one provided by the OS. Note that this will change the machine name used in MagicDNS.
--netfilter-mode= Netfilter mode (one of on, nodivert, off). Refer to Tailscale netfilter modes for more information.
--nickname= Nickname for the current account.
--operator= A Unix username other than root to operate tailscaled.
--relay-server-port= Specify a UDP port to accept peer relay connections on. UDP port number (0 will pick a random unused port) for the relay server to bind to, on all interfaces, or empty string to disable relay server functionality. Refer to Tailscale Peer Relays for more information.
--relay-server-static-endpoints Use static endpoints for Tailscale Peer Relays.
--report-posture Allow management plane to gather device posture information.
--shields-up, --shields-up=false Block incoming connections from other devices on your Tailscale network.
Useful for personal devices that only make outgoing connections.
--snat-subnet-routes Source NAT traffic to local routes advertised with --advertise-routes.
--ssh, --ssh=false Run a Tailscale SSH server, permitting access per the tailnet administrator's declared access policy, or the default policy if none is defined.
--stateful-filtering Apply stateful filtering to forwarded packets (subnet routers, exit nodes, and so on).
--update-check Notify about available Tailscale updates.
--webclient, --webclient=false Expose the web interface to your tailnet persistently in the background on port :5252.
ssh
Establish a Tailscale SSH session to a Tailscale machine.
You can often use the regular ssh command or another SSH client to make an SSH session to a Tailscale machine. However, when your local node is in userspace-networking mode and can't make a direct connection, use tailscale ssh. This sets up an SSH ProxyCommand to connect through the local tailscaled daemon. You can also use tailscale ssh when your local node is in kernel mode.
The tailscale ssh command automatically checks the destination server's SSH host key against the node's SSH host key as advertised by using the Tailscale coordination server.
tailscale ssh 
 is one of the following forms:
host The destination server. An interactive session will prompt you for the user name to use for the session.
user@host The user name for the session and the destination server.
For both forms, host can be the destination server's MagicDNS name (even if --accept-dns=false was set on the local node) or the destination server's Tailscale IP address.
tailscale ssh is not available on sandboxed macOS builds—use the regular ssh client instead.
status
Get the status of your connections to other Tailscale devices.
tailscale status
This command returns a condensed table of information in human-readable format:
1 2 3 4 5
100.1.2.3 device-a apenwarr@ linux active; direct , tx 1116 rx 1124
100.4.5.6 device-b crawshaw@ macOS active; relay , tx 1351 rx 4262
100.7.8.9 device-c danderson@ windows idle; tx 1214 rx 50
100.0.1.2 device-d ross@ iOS -
From left-to-right, these columns represent:
Column 1 is a Tailscale IP, which you can use to connect to the device.
Column 2 is the machine name of the device. If you use MagicDNS, you can also use this name to connect.
Column 3 is the email address for the owner of the device.
Column 4 is the device OS.
Column 5 shows the current connection status.
Connection status (column 5) is shown using three terms:
active means traffic is currently being sent/received from this device. It also includes the connection type, which can be direct, relay, or peer-relay.
If the connection is direct, it includes peer device's IP address.
If the connection is relay, it includes the DERP server's city code (nyc, fra, tok, syd) for the respective location.
If the connection is peer-relay, it includes the Tailscale IP address of the peer relay and the VNI (virtual network interface) used.
idle means traffic is not currently being sent/received from this device.
- means no traffic has ever been sent/received from this device.
active and idle connection statuses will also include tx/rx values indicating the number of bytes sent (tx) and received (rx) from this device.
Running tailscale status with the --json flag returns a machine-readable JSON response.
tailscale status --json
Unlike tailscale status, using this flag gives a detailed list of peers and users in your tailnet that makes it well-suited for automation tasks. It also includes additional metadata associated with your device.
Combine this with jq to automate data collection about your network. For example, the following command counts and sorts the relay servers your Tailscale peers are connected to.
tailscale status --json | jq -r '.Peer[].Relay | select(.!="")' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
Available flags:
--active Filter output to only peers with active sessions (not applicable to web mode).
--browser Open a browser in web mode (default true).
--header Show column headers in table format (default false).
--json Output in JSON format (WARNING: format subject to change).
--listen= Listen address for web mode; use port 0 for automatic (default 127.0.0.1:8384).
--peers Show status of peers (default true).
--self Show status of local machine (default true).
--web Run webserver with HTML showing status.
switch
Switch to a different Tailscale account. For more information about switching accounts, refer to fast-user-switching.
tailscale switch  [flags]
Examples:
To switch to the alice@example.com account:
tailscale switch alice@example.com
To switch to the account that has the nickname "work":
tailscale switch work
Available flags:
--list Lists available accounts.
Subcommands:
remove  removes a Tailscale account from the local machine. This does not delete the account itself, but it will no longer be available for switching to. You can add it back by logging in again. This command is currently in alpha and may change in the future.
syspolicy
List system policies, reload system policies, or inspect errors related to the system policies configured in your tailnet.
tailscale syspolicy
Subcommands:
list Shows system policies, reload system policies, or explore errors related to the system policies configured on the device.
reload Forces the Tailscale client to reload and reapply system policy settings on the device.
Available flags:
--json Return a machine-readable JSON response.
systray
The systray command is available on the Linux client, is currently in beta, and is available in Tailscale v1.88 or later.
Run the system tray (systray) application for Linux desktop clients to access some common actions like fast user switching and exit node selection.
tailscale systray
Do not run tailscale systray as superuser (sudo tailscale systray), because systray is not designed to run as superuser and the command will fail.
update
The update command is available in Tailscale v1.36 or later for Windows and Ubuntu/Debian Linux, in v1.48.0 or later for the Mac Apple Store version and Synology, and in v1.54.0 or later for QNAP and the Standalone variant of the macOS application. If you don't see this command and you are running one of these operating systems, consider updating your Tailscale client.
Update the Tailscale client version to the latest version, or to a different version.
tailscale update [flags]
Available flags:
--dry-run Show what update would do, without performing the update and without prompting to start the update.
--track The track to check for updates, either "stable" or "unstable". If not specified, the update uses the track currently in effect for the client.
--version An explicit version to use for the update or downgrade. You cannot specify both --track and --version. This flag is not available on the macOS client.
--yes Perform the update without interactive prompts. Defaults to false.
If you downgrade to a version that does not have the tailscale update functionality, you won't be able to run tailscale update to return to the prior version. You would need to perform an update without using the Tailscale CLI.
To determine the current version on a client, run tailscale version.
Examples:
Update to the latest version within your current track (stable or unstable, depending on what you're running):
tailscale update
Update to the latest version within your current track without using interactive prompts:
tailscale update --yes
Update to Tailscale v1.34:
tailscale update --version=1.34.0
Update to the latest unstable version:
tailscale update --track=unstable
version
Print the version of Tailscale.
tailscale version [flags]
Available flags:
--daemon Also print local node's daemon version. Defaults to false.
--json Return a machine-readable JSON response.
--upstream Print the latest upstream release version from pkgs.tailscale.com. Defaults to false.
Running tailscale version also prints other information, including the Go version. Here's an example of the output:tailscale version
1.72.0
tailscale commit: 9a0f00ea8ed08d1a94b357fb232ac9d44a512664
other commit: 387e0b40ad87031fb4444372ee80a97156e8deb9
go version: go1.22.5
web
Start a web server for controlling the tailscaled daemon. Starting a web server is useful when the CLI or a native app is impractical (such as on NAS devices).
tailscale web [flags]
Available flags:
--cgi= Run the web server as a CGI script. Defaults to false.
--listen= Set the listen address. Use port 0 for automatic. Defaults to localhost:8088.
--origin= Origin at which the web UI is served (if behind a reverse proxy or used with CGI).
--prefix= Set the URL prefix added to requests (for CGI or reverse proxies).
--readonly Run the web server in read-only mode.
whois
Get the machine and user associated with a Tailscale IP.
tailscale whois ip[:port]
For user devices, this command returns:
Machine:
Name:
ID:
Addresses:
AllowedIPs:
