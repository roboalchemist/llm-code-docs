Learn how to fine-tune models in Microsoft Foundry for your datasets and use cases. Fine-tuning enables:

*   Higher-quality results than what you can get just from [prompt engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering).
*   The ability to train on more examples than what can fit into a model's request context limit.
*   Token savings due to shorter prompts.
*   Lower-latency requests, particularly when you're using smaller models.

In contrast to few-shot learning, fine-tuning improves the model by training on more examples than what fits in a prompt. Because weights adapt to your task, you include fewer examples or instructions. Including less reduces tokens per call and potentially lowers cost and latency.

We use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune models in a way that reduces their complexity without significantly affecting their performance. This method works by approximating the original high-rank matrix with a lower-rank one. Fine-tuning a smaller subset of important parameters during the supervised training phase makes the model more manageable and efficient. For users, it also makes training faster and more affordable than other techniques.

In this article, you learn how to:

*   Choose appropriate datasets and formats for fine-tuning.
*   Trigger a fine-tuning job, monitor the status, and fetch results.
*   Deploy and evaluate a fine-tuned model.
*   Clean up your resources when you no longer need them.

*   Read the [guide on when to use Foundry fine-tuning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/fine-tuning-considerations).
*   You need an Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
*   You need a Foundry project resource. To create one, sign in to the [Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/).
*   Fine-tuning requires the **Azure AI Owner** role. While Azure AI Users may train (fine-tune) models, only AI Owners may deploy them. You may also create a [custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/concepts/rbac-foundry#create-custom-roles-for-projects) that combines required actions into a single role.
*   If you don't already have access to view quotas and deploy models in the Foundry portal, you need [more permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).

The following models are supported for fine-tuning:

| `gpt-oss-20b` | Not supported | ✅ | ❌ | SFT | Public preview | Text to text |

Or you can fine-tune a previously fine-tuned model, formatted as `base-model.ft-{jobid}`.

Note

Open-source models (Ministral-3B, Qwen-32B, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, gpt-oss-20b) are only supported on Foundry resources and in the new Foundry UI.

Your training and validation datasets consist of input and output examples for how you want the model to perform.

The training and validation data that you use _must_ be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document. It must also be formatted in the conversational format that the [Chat Completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt) API uses.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). Each file must be less than 512 MB in size.

We recommend that you use the instructions and prompts that you found worked best in every training example. This approach helps you get the best results, especially if you have fewer than a hundred examples.

If you don't have an existing dataset prepared, you can use the [data generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/fine-tuning/data-generation) capabilities to create a new one.

```

Multiple turns of a conversation in a single line of your JSONL training file are also supported. To skip fine-tuning on specific assistant messages, add the optional `weight` key/value pair. Currently, `weight` can be set to `0` or `1`.

```

The more training examples you have, the better. Fine-tuning jobs won't proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. A best practice for successful fine-tuning is to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples. We recommend that you start with 50 well-crafted examples.

In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind that low-quality examples can negatively affect performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data without first pruning the dataset for only the highest-quality examples, your model might perform worse than expected.

To fine-tune a model in an existing Foundry project, follow these steps:

1.   Sign in to [Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) and select your project. If you don't have a project already, first [create a project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/how-to/create-projects).

2.   Go to the **Build**>**Fine-tune** page, and then select the **Fine-tune** button at the upper right.

3.   You should now see the **Fine-tune a model** experience for creating a new fine-tuning job. Use the following sections to help with configuring the job, and then select **Submit** to start training your new fine-tuned model.

The project region might limit the available models. Your choice of model influences both the performance and the cost of your model.

You can also select a previously fine-tuned model.

The supported customization methods depend on the selected model:

*   **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**: Trains the model on labeled input/output pairs. Best for most scenarios, including task specialization.

*   **Direct preference optimization (DPO)**: Aligns the model with human-preferred responses. Ideal for improving response quality.

*   **Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)**: Uses reward signals from model graders to optimize complex behaviors.

Note

The rest of this article covers steps for the SFT method. For instructions specific to other customization methods, see the [guide for DPO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-direct-preference-optimization) and the [guide for RFT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/reinforcement-fine-tuning).

Select the training tier based on your use case and budget:

*   **Standard**: Training occurs in the current Foundry resource's region and provides guarantees for data residency. Ideal for workloads where data must remain in a specific region.

*   **Global**: Provides more affordable pricing compared to Standard by using capacity beyond your current region. Data and weights are copied to the region where training occurs. Ideal if data residency is not a restriction and you want faster queue times.

*   **Developer (preview)**: Provides significant cost savings by using idle capacity for training. There are no latency or SLA guarantees, so jobs in this tier might be automatically preempted and resumed later. There are no guarantees for data residency either. Ideal for experimentation and price-sensitive workloads.

If you have existing datasets in the Foundry project, select **Existing dataset** for **Data source**, and then select your dataset.

To upload newly prepared datasets, select **Upload new dataset** for **Data source**, and then upload your JSONL file.

After you select or upload your data files, validation checks automatically occur to confirm that the files are formatted as JSONL, are encoded in UTF-8 with a BOM, and are less than 512 MB in size.

We recommend that you provide a **Suffix** value to make it easier to distinguish between different iterations of your fine-tuned model. A suffix takes a string of up to 18 characters and is used in naming the resulting fine-tuned model.

A seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results but might differ in rare cases. If you don't specify a seed, one is randomly generated for you.

You can manually configure hyperparameters for your fine-tuning job or leave them as defaults.

The following hyperparameters are available:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `batch_size` | Integer | The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. In general, we find that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets. The default value and the maximum value for this property are specific to a base model. A larger batch size means that model parameters are updated less frequently, but with lower variance. When the value is set to `-1`, the batch size is calculated as 0.2% of examples in the training set. The maximum is `256`. |
| `learning_rate_multiplier` | Number | The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pre-training, multiplied by this value. Larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes. We recommend experimenting with values in the range of `0.02` to `0.2` to see what produces the best results. A smaller learning rate can be useful to avoid overfitting. |
| `n_epochs` | Integer | The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset. If the value is set to `-1`, the number of epochs is determined dynamically based on the input data. |

Important

For automatic deployment, you need the **Azure AI Owner** role or any role with the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments/write` action.

To save time, you can enable automatic deployment for your resulting model. If training finishes successfully, the model is deployed according to the selected deployment type. The deployment name is based on the unique name generated for your custom model and the optional suffix that you might have provided earlier.

Automatic deployment is supported only for OpenAI models.

After you submit your fine-tuning job, a table view lists all of your fine-tuning job submissions. To see more information about the individual results, open the **Job details** page.

Your job might be queued behind other jobs in the system. Training your model can take minutes to hours, depending on the model and the dataset size.

You can monitor the following metrics by going to the **Monitor** pivot:

*   `train_loss`: The loss for the training batch. Each training step on the x-axis represents a single pass, forward and backward, on a batch of training data.

*   `full_valid_loss`: The validation loss calculated at the end of each epoch. When training goes well, loss should decrease.

*   `train_mean_token_accuracy`: The percentage of tokens in the training batch that the model correctly predicted.

For example, if the batch size is set to `3` and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to `0.83` (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`.

*   `full_valid_mean_token_accuracy`: The valid mean token accuracy calculated at the end of each epoch. When training is going well, token accuracy should increase.

Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If your training and validation data diverge, you might be overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs or a smaller learning-rate multiplier.

When each training epoch finishes, a checkpoint is generated. You can view checkpoints by going to the **Checkpoints** pivot.

A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model that can be both deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, because they might provide snapshots prior to overfitting. When a fine-tuning job finishes, you have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. You can copy checkpoints between resources and subscriptions through the REST API.

Note

During the training, you can view the metrics and pause the job as needed. Pausing can be useful if metrics aren't converging or if you feel that the model isn't learning at the right pace. When you pause a training job, a deployable checkpoint is created after safety evaluations are complete. This checkpoint is available for you to deploy and use for inference, or you can resume the job to complete it.

The pause operation is applicable only for jobs that are trained for at least one step and are in a **Running** state. Pausing is supported only for OpenAI models.

Important

To deploy models, you need the **Azure AI Owner** role or any role with the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments/write` action.

When you're satisfied with the metrics from your fine-tuning job, you can deploy the model by selecting the **Deploy** button on the details page and then configuring your deployment settings.

For more information, see the [fine-tuning deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-deploy?tabs=portal).

After you deploy your fine-tuned model, you can use it like any other deployed model. You can use the playground in [Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) to experiment with your new deployment. You can also use the REST API to call your fine-tuned model from your own application. You can even begin to use this new fine-tuned model in your prompt flow to build your generative AI application.

Note

For chat models, the system message that you use to guide your fine-tuned model (whether it's deployed or available for testing in the playground) must be the same as the system message that you used for training. If you use a different system message, the model might not perform as expected.

After you create a fine-tuned model, you might want to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples.

To perform fine-tuning on a model that you previously fine-tuned, you use the same process described in [Create your fine-tuned model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#create-your-fine-tuned-model). But instead of specifying the name of a generic base model, you specify your already fine-tuned model. A custom fine-tuned model looks like `gpt-4o-2024-08-06.ft-d93dda6110004b4da3472d96f4dd4777-ft`.

Continuous fine-tuning is supported only for OpenAI models.

When you no longer need your fine-tuned model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files that you uploaded to the service, if necessary.

Important

After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for more than 15 days, the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model is _inactive_ if the model was deployed more than 15 days ago and no chat completions or response API calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.

The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model. The customized model can be redeployed at any time.

As described in [Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/), each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether chat completions or response API calls are made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI, see [Plan and manage costs for Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/concepts/manage-costs#fine-tuned-models).

You can delete the deployment for your fine-tuned model on the **Build**>**Models** page in the Foundry portal.

You can delete a fine-tuned model on the **Fine-tuning** page in the Foundry portal. Select the fine-tuned model to delete, and then select **Delete**.

Note

You can't delete a fine-tuned model if it has an existing deployment. You must [delete your model deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#delete-your-fine-tuned-model-deployment) before you can delete your fine-tuned model.

Note

Open-source models (Ministral-3B, Qwen-32B, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, gpt-oss-20b) are only supported on Foundry resources and in the new Foundry UI.

Take a moment to review the fine-tuning workflow for using the Python SDK with Azure OpenAI:

1.   Prepare your training and validation data.
2.   Select a base model.
3.   Upload your training data.
4.   Train your new customized model.
5.   Check the status of your customized model.
6.   Deploy your customized model for use.
7.   Use your customized model.
8.   Optionally, analyze your customized model for performance and fit.

Your training and validation datasets consist of input and output examples for how you want the model to perform.

The training and validation data that you use _must_ be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document. It must also be formatted in the conversational format that the [Chat Completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt) API uses.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). Each file must be less than 512 MB in size.

The more training examples you have, the better. Fine-tuning jobs won't proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. A best practice for successful fine-tuning is to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples.

In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind that low-quality examples can negatively affect performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data without first pruning the dataset for only the highest-quality examples, your model might perform worse than expected.

The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when you're customizing your model. After you prepare your training data, you can upload your files to the service. There are two ways to upload training data:

*   [From a local file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/files/upload)
*   [From Azure Blob Storage or a web location (import)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/files/import)

For large data files, we recommend that you import from Blob Storage. Large files can become unstable when you upload them through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Blob Storage, see [What is Azure Blob Storage?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview).

The following Python example uploads local training and validation files by using the Python SDK, and retrieves the returned file IDs:

```
import os
from openai import OpenAI

# Load the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
  api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  base_url="https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/"
)

# Upload the training and validation dataset files to Microsoft Foundry with the SDK.
training_file_name = 'training_set.jsonl'
validation_file_name = 'validation_set.jsonl'

training_response = client.files.create(file=open(training_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune")
validation_response = client.files.create(file=open(validation_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune")
training_file_id = training_response.id
validation_file_id = validation_response.id

print("Training file ID:", training_file_id)
print("Validation file ID:", validation_file_id)
```

After you upload your training and validation files, you're ready to start the fine-tuning job.

The following Python code shows an example of how to create a new fine-tuning job by using the Python SDK:

```
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_file_id,
    validation_file=validation_file_id,
    model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14", # Enter the base model name.
    suffix="my-model", # Custom suffix for naming the resulting model. Note that in Microsoft Foundry, the model can't contain dot/period characters.
    seed=105, # Seed parameter controls reproducibility of the fine-tuning job. If you don't specify a seed, one is generated automatically.
    extra_body={ "trainingType": "GlobalStandard" } # Change this value to your preferred training type. Other options are `Standard` and `Developer`.
)

job_id = response.id

# You can use the job ID to monitor the status of the fine-tuning job.
# The fine-tuning job takes some time to start and finish.

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

Note

We recommend using the Global Standard tier for the training type, because it offers [cost savings](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and uses global capacity for faster queuing times. However, it does copy data and weights outside the current resource region. If [data residency](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency/) is a requirement, use a [model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai#fine-tuning-models) that supports Standard-tier training.

You can also pass additional optional parameters, like hyperparameters, to take greater control of the fine-tuning process. For initial training, we recommend using the automatic defaults that are present without specifying these parameters.

The currently supported hyperparameters for supervised fine-tuning are:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `batch_size` | Integer | The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. In general, we find that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets. The default value and the maximum value for this property are specific to a base model. A larger batch size means that model parameters are updated less frequently, but with lower variance. |
| `learning_rate_multiplier` | Number | The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pre-training, multiplied by this value. Larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes. We recommend experimenting with values in the range of `0.02` to `0.2` to see what produces the best results. A smaller learning rate can be useful to avoid overfitting. |
| `n_epochs` | Integer | The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset. |
| `seed` | Integer | The seed that controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results but might differ in rare cases. If you don't specify a seed, one is generated for you. |

To set custom hyperparameters with the 1.x version of the OpenAI Python API, provide them as part of `method`:

```
client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
  training_file="file-abc123", 
  model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
  suffix="my-model",
  seed=105,
  method={
    "type": "supervised", # In this case, the job is using supervised fine-tuning.
    "supervised": {
      "hyperparameters": {
        "n_epochs": 2
      }
    }
  },
  extra_body={ "trainingType": "GlobalStandard" }
)
```

To learn about supported hyperparameters for the other customization methods, see the [guide for direct preference optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-direct-preference-optimization) and the [guide for reinforcement fine-tuning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/reinforcement-fine-tuning).

Select the training tier based on your use case and budget:

*   **Standard**: Training occurs in the current Foundry resource's region and provides guarantees for data residency. Ideal for workloads where data must remain in a specific region.

*   **Global**: Provides more affordable pricing compared to Standard by using capacity beyond your current region. Data and weights are copied to the region where training occurs. Ideal if data residency is not a restriction and you want faster queue times.

*   **Developer (preview)**: Provides significant cost savings by using idle capacity for training. There are no latency or SLA guarantees, so jobs in this tier might be automatically preempted and resumed later. There are no guarantees for data residency either. Ideal for experimentation and price-sensitive workloads.

* * *

To examine the individual fine-tuning events that were generated during training, run the following command. Before you run the command, you might need to upgrade your OpenAI client library to the latest version by using `pip install openai --upgrade`.

```
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(fine_tuning_job_id=job_id, limit=10)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

The completion of each training epoch generates a checkpoint. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model that can be both deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, because they might provide snapshots prior to overfitting.

When a fine-tuning job finishes, you have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. Your fine-tuned model represents the final epoch. The previous two epochs are available as checkpoints.

You can run the following command to retrieve the list of checkpoints associated with an individual fine-tuning job. Before you run the command, you might need to upgrade your OpenAI client library to the latest version by using `pip install openai --upgrade`.

```
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.checkpoints.list(job_id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

* * *

Azure OpenAI attaches a result file named `results.csv` to each fine-tuning job after it finishes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your customized model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each customized model. You can use the Python SDK to retrieve the file ID and download the result file for analysis.

The following Python example retrieves the file ID of the first result file attached to the fine-tuning job for your customized model. It then uses the Python SDK to download the file to your current working directory for analysis.

```
# Retrieve the file ID of the first result file from the fine-tuning job
# for the customized model.
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id)
if response.status == 'succeeded':
    result_file_id = response.result_files[0]

retrieve = client.files.retrieve(result_file_id)

# Download the result file.
print(f'Downloading result file: {result_file_id}')

with open(retrieve.filename, "wb") as file:
    result = client.files.content(result_file_id).read()
    file.write(result)
```

The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step that the fine-tuning job performs. The result file contains the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `step` | The number of the training step. A training step represents a single pass, forward and backward, on a batch of training data. |
| `train_loss` | The loss for the training batch. |
| `train_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the training batch that the model correctly predicted. For example, if the batch size is set to `3` and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to `0.83` (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `valid_loss` | The loss for the validation batch. |
| `validation_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the validation batch that the model correctly predicted. For example, if the batch size is set to `3` and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to `0.83` (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `full_valid_loss` | The validation loss calculated at the end of each epoch. When training goes well, loss should decrease. |
| `full_valid_mean_token_accuracy` | The valid mean token accuracy calculated at the end of each epoch. When training is going well, token accuracy should increase. |

You can also view the data in your `results.csv` file as plots in the Microsoft Foundry portal. When you select the link for your trained model, three charts appear: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets appear on the same plot.

Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If your training and validation data diverge, you might be overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs or a smaller learning-rate multiplier.

When you're satisfied with the metrics from your fine-tuning job, or you just want to move on to inference, you must deploy the model.

If you're deploying for further validation, consider deploying for [testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/fine-tune-test?tabs=python) by using a Developer deployment.

Unlike with the previous SDK commands, you must use the control plane API for the deployment. This task requires separate authorization, a different API path, and a different API version.

| Variable | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | An authorization token. There are multiple ways to generate an authorization token. The easiest method for initial testing is to open Azure Cloud Shell from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Then run [`az account get-access-token`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token()). You can use this token as your temporary authorization token for API testing. We recommend storing this token in a new environment variable. |
| `subscription` | The subscription ID for the associated Azure OpenAI resource. |
| `resource_group` | The resource group name for your Azure OpenAI resource. |
| `resource_name` | The Azure OpenAI resource name. |
| `model_deployment_name` | The custom name for your new fine-tuned model deployment. This name is referenced in your code during chat completion calls. |
| `fine_tuned_model` | Your fine-tuned model. Retrieve this value from your fine-tuning job results in the previous step. It looks like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-b044a9d3cf9c4228b5d393567f693b83`. You need to add the value to the `deploy_data` JSON. Alternatively, you can deploy a checkpoint by passing the checkpoint ID, which appears in the format `ftchkpt-e559c011ecc04fc68eaa339d8227d02d`. |

```

deploy_params = {'api-version': "2024-10-01"} # Control plane API version rather than the data plane API for this call 
deploy_headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(token), 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

deploy_data = json.dumps(deploy_data)

request_url = f'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resource_name}/deployments/{model_deployment_name}'

print('Creating a new deployment...')

r = requests.put(request_url, params=deploy_params, headers=deploy_headers, data=deploy_data)

```

To learn about cross-region deployment and how to use the deployed model, see [Use your deployed fine-tuned model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-deploy#use-your-deployed-fine-tuned-model).

If you're ready to deploy for production or you have particular data-residency needs, follow the [deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-deploy?tabs=python).

After you create a fine-tuned model, you might want to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples. Continuous fine-tuning is supported only for OpenAI models.

To perform fine-tuning on a model that you previously fine-tuned, you use the same process described in [Create a customized model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#create-a-customized-model). But instead of specifying the name of a generic base model, you specify your fine-tuned model's ID. The fine-tuned model's ID looks like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7`.

```
response = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_file_id,
    validation_file=validation_file_id,
    model="gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7"
)
job_id = response.id

# You can use the job ID to monitor the status of the fine-tuning job.
# The fine-tuning job takes some time to start and finish.

print("Job ID:", response.id)
print("Status:", response.id)
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

We also recommend that you include the `suffix` parameter to more easily distinguish between iterations of your fine-tuned model. The `suffix` parameter takes a string and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. With the OpenAI Python API, you can add a string of up to 18 characters to the name of your fine-tuned model.

If you're unsure of the ID of your existing fine-tuned model, you can find this information on the **Models** page of Microsoft Foundry. Or you can generate a [list of models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/models/list?view=rest-azureopenai-2023-12-01-preview&tabs=HTTP) for an Azure OpenAI resource by using the REST API.

When you no longer need your customized model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files that you uploaded to the service, if necessary.

Important

After you deploy a customized model, if at any time the deployment remains inactive for more than 15 days, the deployment is deleted. The deployment of a customized model is _inactive_ if the model was deployed more than 15 days ago and no chat completions or response API calls were made to it during a continuous 15-day period.

The deletion of an inactive deployment doesn't delete or affect the underlying customized model. The customized model can be redeployed at any time.

As described in [Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/), each customized (fine-tuned) model that's deployed incurs an hourly hosting cost regardless of whether chat completions or response API calls are made to the model. To learn more about planning and managing costs with Azure OpenAI, see [Plan and manage costs for Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/concepts/manage-costs#fine-tuned-models).

You can use either of these methods to delete the deployment for your customized model:

*   [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-model-deployment)
*   [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account/deployment?preserve-view=true#az-cognitiveservices-account-deployment-delete)

You can delete your customized model by using [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-customized-model).

Note

You can't delete a customized model if it has an existing deployment. You must [delete your model deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#delete-your-model-deployment) before you can delete your customized model.

You can optionally delete training and validation files that you uploaded for training, and result files generated during training, from your Azure OpenAI subscription. You can use the following methods to delete your training, validation, and result files:

*   [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-training-files)
*   [REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/files/delete)
*   Python SDK

The following Python example uses the Python SDK to delete the training, validation, and result files for your customized model:

```
print('Checking for existing uploaded files.')
results = []

# Get the complete list of uploaded files in your subscription.
files = openai.File.list().data
print(f'Found {len(files)} total uploaded files in the subscription.')

# Enumerate all uploaded files. Extract the IDs for the
# files with file names that match your training dataset file and
# validation dataset file.
for item in files:
    if item["filename"] in [training_file_name, validation_file_name, result_file_name]:
        results.append(item["id"])
print(f'Found {len(results)} already uploaded files that match our files')

# Enumerate the file IDs for your files and delete each file.
print(f'Deleting already uploaded files.')
for id in results:
    openai.File.delete(sid = id)
```

*   Read the [guide on when to use Azure OpenAI fine-tuning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/fine-tuning-considerations).
*   You need an Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
*   You need an Azure OpenAI resource. For more information, see [Create a resource and deploy a model with Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/create-resource).
*   Fine-tuning requires the **Azure AI Owner** role. While Azure AI Users may train (fine-tune) models, only AI Owners may deploy them. You may also create a [custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/concepts/rbac-foundry#create-custom-roles-for-projects) that combines required actions into a single role.
*   If you don't already have access to view quotas and deploy models in the Foundry portal, you need [more permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/role-based-access-control).

The following models are supported for fine-tuning:

| Model ID | Standard regions | Global | Developer | Methods | Status | Modality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-4o-mini` (2024-07-18) | North Central US Sweden Central | ✅ | ✅ | SFT | GA | Text to text |

| `gpt-oss-20b` | Not supported | ✅ | ❌ | SFT | Public preview | Text to text |

Or you can fine-tune a previously fine-tuned model, formatted as `base-model.ft-{jobid}`.

Note

Open-source models (Ministral-3B, Qwen-32B, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, gpt-oss-20b) are only supported on Foundry resources and in the new Foundry UI.

Take a moment to review the fine-tuning workflow for using the REST API and Python with Azure OpenAI:

1.   Prepare your training and validation data.
2.   Select a base model.
3.   Upload your training data.
4.   Train your new customized model.
5.   Check the status of your customized model.
6.   Deploy your customized model for use.
7.   Use your customized model.
8.   Optionally, analyze your customized model for performance and fit.

Your training and validation datasets consist of input and output examples for how you want the model to perform.

The training and validation data that you use _must_ be formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL) document. It must also be formatted in the conversational format that the [Chat Completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/chatgpt) API uses.

In addition to the JSONL format, training and validation data files must be encoded in UTF-8 and include a byte-order mark (BOM). Each file must be less than 512 MB in size.

If you want a step-by-step walkthrough of fine-tuning `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, see the [Azure OpenAI fine-tuning tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/tutorials/fine-tune).

Multiple turns of a conversation in a single line of your JSONL training file are also supported. To skip fine-tuning on specific assistant messages, add the optional `weight` key/value pair. Currently, `weight` can be set to `0` or `1`.

The more training examples you have, the better. Fine-tuning jobs won't proceed without at least 10 training examples, but such a small number isn't enough to noticeably influence model responses. A best practice for successful fine-tuning is to provide hundreds, if not thousands, of training examples.

In general, doubling the dataset size can lead to a linear increase in model quality. But keep in mind that low-quality examples can negatively affect performance. If you train the model on a large amount of internal data without first pruning the dataset for only the highest-quality examples, your model might perform worse than expected.

The next step is to either choose existing prepared training data or upload new prepared training data to use when you're customizing your model. After you prepare your training data, you can upload your files to the service. There are two ways to upload training data:

*   [From a local file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/files/upload)
*   [From Azure Blob Storage or a web location (import)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/files/import)

For large data files, we recommend that you import from Blob Storage. Large files can become unstable when you upload them through multipart forms because the requests are atomic and can't be retried or resumed. For more information about Blob Storage, see [What is Azure Blob Storage?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview).

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/files \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F "purpose=fine-tune" \
  -F "file=@C:\\fine-tuning\\training_set.jsonl;type=application/json"
```

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/files \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F "purpose=fine-tune" \
  -F "file=@C:\\fine-tuning\\validation_set.jsonl;type=application/json"
```

After you upload your training and validation files, you're ready to start the fine-tuning job. The following code shows an example of how to [create a new fine-tuning job](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/fine-tuning/create?view=rest-azureopenai-2024-10-21&tabs=HTTP) by using the REST API.

This example includes passing the seed parameter. The seed controls the reproducibility of the job. Passing in the same seed and job parameters should produce the same results but might differ in rare cases. If you don't specify a seed, one is generated for you.

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>",
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "seed": 105
}'
```

If you're fine-tuning a model that supports [global training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai#fine-tuning-models), you can specify the training type by using the `extra_body` named argument and using `api-version=2025-04-01-preview`:

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/fine_tuning/jobs?api-version=2025-04-01-preview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14",
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>",
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "seed": 105,
    "trainingType": "globalstandard"
}'
```

You can also pass additional optional parameters like [hyperparameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/fine-tuning/create?view=rest-azureopenai-2024-10-21&tabs=HTTP#finetuninghyperparameters) to take greater control of the fine-tuning process. For initial training, we recommend using the automatic defaults that are present without specifying these parameters.

The currently supported hyperparameters for supervised fine-tuning are:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `batch_size` | Integer | The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. In general, we find that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets. The default value and the maximum value for this property are specific to a base model. A larger batch size means that model parameters are updated less frequently, but with lower variance. |
| `learning_rate_multiplier` | Number | The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pre-training, multiplied by this value. Larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes. We recommend experimenting with values in the range of `0.02` to `0.2` to see what produces the best results. A smaller learning rate can be useful to avoid overfitting. |
| `n_epochs` | Integer | The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset. |
| `seed` | Integer | The seed that controls the reproducibility of the job. |

To learn about supported hyperparameters for the other customization methods, see the [guide for direct preference optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-direct-preference-optimization) and the [guide for reinforcement fine-tuning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/reinforcement-fine-tuning).

Select the training tier based on your use case and budget:

*   **Standard**: Training occurs in the current Foundry resource's region and provides guarantees for data residency. Ideal for workloads where data must remain in a specific region.

*   **Global**: Provides more affordable pricing compared to Standard by using capacity beyond your current region. Data and weights are copied to the region where training occurs. Ideal if data residency is not a restriction and you want faster queue times.

*   **Developer (preview)**: Provides significant cost savings by using idle capacity for training. There are no latency or SLA guarantees, so jobs in this tier might be automatically preempted and resumed later. There are no data residency guarantees either. Ideal for experimentation and price-sensitive workloads.

```
curl -X POST "https://<ACCOUNT-NAME>.openai.azure.com/openai/fine_tuning/jobs?api-version=2025-04-01-preview" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "api-key: <API-KEY>" -d "{"model": "gpt-4.1", "training_file": "<FILE_ID>", "hyperparameters": {"prompt_loss_weight": 0.1}, "trainingType": "developerTier"}"
```

After you start a fine-tuning job, it can take some time to finish. Your job might be queued behind other jobs in the system. Training your model can take minutes or hours, depending on the model and dataset size.

The following example uses the REST API to check the status of your fine-tuning job. The example retrieves information about your job by using the job ID returned from the previous example.

```
curl -X GET $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<YOUR-JOB-ID> \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

To examine the individual fine-tuning events that were generated during training:

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

The completion of each training epoch generates a checkpoint. A checkpoint is a fully functional version of a model that can be both deployed and used as the target model for subsequent fine-tuning jobs. Checkpoints can be particularly useful, because they might provide snapshots prior to overfitting.

When a fine-tuning job finishes, you have the three most recent versions of the model available to deploy. Your fine-tuned model represents the final epoch. The previous two epochs are available as checkpoints.

You can run the following command to retrieve the list of checkpoints associated with an individual fine-tuning job:

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/checkpoints \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

During the training, you can view the logs and metrics and pause the job as needed. Pausing can be useful if metrics aren't converging or if you feel that the model isn't learning at the right pace.

After the training job is paused and safety evaluations are complete, a deployable checkpoint is created. This checkpoint is available for you to deploy and use for inference, or you can resume the job to complete it.

The pause operation is applicable only for jobs that are trained for at least one step and are in a **Running** state.

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/pause \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/{fine_tuning_job_id}/resume \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

You can now copy a fine-tuned checkpointed model from one region to another, across different subscriptions but within the same tenant. The process uses dedicated APIs to help ensure efficient and secure transfers. This feature is currently available only with the API and not through the Foundry portal.

After the model is copied from region A to region B, you can continually fine-tune the model in region B and deploy the model from this location.

Note

Deletion of the model checkpoint in the source region doesn't cause the model to be deleted in the destination region. To delete the model in both regions after it's copied, you must deploy the model separately in each region.

*   The destination resource or account should have at least one fine-tuning job.
*   The destination resource or account should not disable public network access (at least while you're sending the copy request).
*   You can copy only to the destination account, if the account that initiates the copy has sufficient permissions to access the destination account.

1.   Create a [user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp).
2.   Give the Azure AI User role to your user-assigned managed identity on your destination resource or account.
3.   [Assign the user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-assign-access-azure-resource?pivots=identity-mi-access-portal#use-azure-rbac-to-assign-a-managed-identity-access-to-another-resource-using-the-azure-portal) to your source resource account.

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://<aoai-resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<ftjob>/checkpoints/<checkpoint-name>/copy' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'api-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'aoai-copy-ft-checkpoints: preview' \
  --data '{
  "destinationResourceId": "<resourceId>",
  "region": "<region>"
}'
```

Because this is a long-running operation, check the status of the fine-tuned model copy by providing the checkpoint ID of the source account used in the `POST` call.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://<aoai-resource>.openai.azure.com//openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<ftjob>/checkpoints/<checkpoint-name>/copy' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'api-key: <api-key>' \
  --header 'aoai-copy-ft-checkpoints: preview'
```

Note

When you copy a checkpoint from a source account, the same checkpoint name is retained in the destination account. Ensure that you use exactly this same name for fine-tuning, deployment, or any other operation in the destination account. This checkpoint doesn't appear in the UI or in the `list checkpoints` API.

Azure OpenAI attaches a result file named `results.csv` to each fine-tuning job after it finishes. You can use the result file to analyze the training and validation performance of your customized model. The file ID for the result file is listed for each customized model. You can use the REST API to retrieve the file ID and download the result file for analysis.

The following Python example uses the REST API to retrieve the file ID of the first result file attached to the fine-tuning job for your customized model. It then downloads the file to your working directory for analysis.

```
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<JOB_ID>" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

```
curl -X GET "$AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/files/<RESULT_FILE_ID>/content" \
    -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" > <RESULT_FILENAME>
```

The result file is a CSV file that contains a header row and a row for each training step that the fine-tuning job performs. The result file contains the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `step` | The number of the training step. A training step represents a single pass, forward and backward, on a batch of training data. |
| `train_loss` | The loss for the training batch. |
| `train_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the training batch that the model correctly predicted. For example, if the batch size is set to `3` and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to `0.83` (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `valid_loss` | The loss for the validation batch. |
| `validation_mean_token_accuracy` | The percentage of tokens in the validation batch that the model correctly predicted. For example, if the batch size is set to `3` and your data contains completions `[[1, 2], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`, this value is set to `0.83` (5 of 6) if the model predicted `[[1, 1], [0, 5], [4, 2]]`. |
| `full_valid_loss` | The validation loss calculated at the end of each epoch. When training goes well, loss should decrease. |
| `full_valid_mean_token_accuracy` | The valid mean token accuracy calculated at the end of each epoch. When training is going well, token accuracy should increase. |

You can also view the data in your `results.csv` file as plots in the Foundry portal. When you select the link for your trained model, three charts appear: loss, mean token accuracy, and token accuracy. If you provided validation data, both datasets appear on the same plot.

Look for your loss to decrease over time, and your accuracy to increase. If your training and validation data diverge, you might be overfitting. Try training with fewer epochs or a smaller learning-rate multiplier.

When you're satisfied with the metrics from your fine-tuning job, or you just want to move on to inference, you must deploy the model.

If you're deploying for further validation, consider deploying for [testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry-classic/openai/how-to/fine-tune-test?tabs=rest) by using a Developer deployment.

If you're ready to deploy for production or you have particular data-residency needs, follow the [deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-deploy?tabs=rest).

| Variable | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | An authorization token. There are multiple ways to generate an authorization token. The easiest method for initial testing is to open Azure Cloud Shell from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Then run [`az account get-access-token`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token()). You can use this token as your temporary authorization token for API testing. We recommend storing this token in a new environment variable. |
| `subscription` | The subscription ID for the associated Azure OpenAI resource. |
| `resource_group` | The resource group name for your Azure OpenAI resource. |
| `resource_name` | The Azure OpenAI resource name. |
| `model_deployment_name` | The custom name for your new fine-tuned model deployment. This name is referenced in your code during chat completion calls. |
| `fine_tuned_model` | Your fine-tuned model. Retrieve this value from your fine-tuning job results in the previous step. It looks like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-b044a9d3cf9c4228b5d393567f693b83`. You need to add the value to the `deploy_data` JSON. Alternatively, you can deploy a checkpoint by passing the checkpoint ID, which appears in the format `ftchkpt-e559c011ecc04fc68eaa339d8227d02d`. |

To learn about cross-region deployment and how to use the deployed model, see [Use your deployed fine-tuned model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning-deploy#use-your-deployed-fine-tuned-model).

After you create a fine-tuned model, you might want to continue to refine the model over time through further fine-tuning. Continuous fine-tuning is the iterative process of selecting an already fine-tuned model as a base model and fine-tuning it further on new sets of training examples. Continuous fine-tuning is supported only for OpenAI models.

To perform fine-tuning on a model that you previously fine-tuned, you use the same process described in [Create a customized model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#create-a-customized-model). But instead of specifying the name of a generic base model, you specify your fine-tuned model's ID. The fine-tuned model's ID looks like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7`.

```
curl -X POST $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT/openai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1-2025-04-14.ft-5fd1918ee65d4cd38a5dcf6835066ed7",
    "training_file": "<TRAINING_FILE_ID>",
    "validation_file": "<VALIDATION_FILE_ID>",
    "suffix": "<additional text used to help identify fine-tuned models>"
}'
```

We also recommend that you include the `suffix` parameter to more easily distinguish between iterations of your fine-tuned model. The `suffix` parameter takes a string and is set to identify the fine-tuned model. The suffix can contain up to 40 characters (`a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, `-`, and `_`) that are added to your fine-tuned model's name.

If you're unsure of the ID of your existing fine-tuned model, you can find this information on the **Models** page of Foundry. Or you can generate a [list of models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureopenai/models/list?view=rest-azureopenai-2023-12-01-preview&tabs=HTTP) for an Azure OpenAI resource by using the REST API.

When you no longer need your customized model, you can delete the deployment and model. You can also delete the training and validation files that you uploaded to the service, if necessary.

You can use either of these methods to delete the deployment for your customized model:

*   [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-model-deployment)
*   [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/cognitiveservices/account/deployment?view=azure-cli-latest#az-cognitiveservices-account-deployment-delete)

You can delete your customized model by using [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-customized-model).

Note

You can't delete a customized model if it has an existing deployment. You must [delete your model deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning#delete-your-model-deployment) before you can delete your customized model.

You can optionally delete training and validation files that you uploaded for training, and result files generated during training, from your Azure OpenAI subscription. You can use [Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=ai-foundry-portal#delete-your-training-files) to delete the files.
