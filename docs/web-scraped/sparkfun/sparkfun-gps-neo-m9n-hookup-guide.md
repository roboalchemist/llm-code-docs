### Three Quick Tips About Using U.FL 

Quick tips regarding how to connect, protect, and disconnect U.FL connectors.

## Hardware Overview

### Power

Power for this board is **3.3V** and we have provided multiple power options. This first and most obvious is the **USB-C connector**. Secondly, are the **Qwiic Connectors** on the top and bottom of the board. Thirdly, there is a **5V pin** on the PTH header along the side of the board that is regulated down to **3.3V**. Make sure that power your provide to this pin does *not* exceed 6 volts. Finally, just below the 5V pin is a **3.3V** pin that should only be provided a clean 3.3V power signal.

[![Power Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Power_Options.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Power_Options.jpg)

### Battery

The small metal disk in the upper left corner is a small lithium battery. This battery does not provide power to the IC like the 3.3V system does, but to relevant systems *inside* the IC that allow for a quick reconnection to satellites. The time to first fix will about **\~29 seconds**, but after it has a lock, that battery will allow for a **two second** time to first fix. This is known as a **hot start** and lasts for four hours after the board is powered down. The battery provides over a years worth of power to the backup system and charges slowly when the board is powered. To charge it to full, leave your module plugged in for 48 hours.

[![Battery for Hot Start](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Battery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Battery.jpg)

### LEDs

There\'s is a red power LED just to the left of the bottom Qwiic connector and near the board\'s edge to indicate that the board is powered. There is another LED just above the power LED labeled `PPS` that is connected to the *Pulse Per Second* line. When connected to a satellite, this line generates a pulse that is synchronized with a GPS or UTC time grid. By default, you\'ll see one pulse a second.

[![Status LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/LEDs.jpg)

### Jumpers

There are four jumpers on the underside of the product, each labeled with its function. At the upper right of the picture is a three way jumper labeled `I²C` that connects two pull-up resistors to the I^2^C data lines. If you have many devices on your I^2^C data lines, then you may consider cutting these. On the left side of the board is a jumper labeled `PWR`. If you cut this trace it will disconnect the **Power** LED. Just below is the `PPS` jumper that when cut disconnects the **PPS** LED. Finally, there\'s a jumper labeled `SPI` which enables the SPI data bus thus disabling the UART functions on those lines. For more information, check out our [tutorial on working with jumper pads and PCB traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces).

### Chip Antenna, U.FL, or SMA

The SparkFun GPS NEO-M9N with Chip Antenna has a GNSS antenna near its left Qwiic connector while its cousins have either a U.FL and SMA connector in which you can connect a patch antenna.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Qwiic and I^2^C

There are two pins labeled `SDA` and `SCL` which indicates the I^2^C data lines. Similarly, you can use either of the Qwiic connectors to provide power and utilize I^2^C. The [Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is made for fast prototyping by removing the need for soldering. All you need to do is plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic connector and voila!

[![I2C Pins and Qwiic connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Qwiic_I2C_Header.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/Qwiic_I2C_Header.jpg)

The only I^2^C address for this and all u-Blox GPS products is **0x42**, though each can have their address changed through software.

### SPI

There are four pins on the right most header that are labeled with their corresponding SPI functionality. As mentioned in the jumpers section, you\'ll need to close the `SPI` jumper on the underside to enable SPI.

[![SPI Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/SPI.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/SPI.jpg)

### UART

There are two pins on the right most header labeled for their UART functionality.

[![UART Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/UART.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/2/UART.jpg)

### Broken Out Pins

There are four other pins broken out: Pulse per second (`PPS`), Reset (`RST`), Safeboot (`SAFE`), and finally the interrupt pin (`INT`). The first pin `PPS`, outputs pulse trains synchronized with the GPS or UTC time grid. The signal defaults to once per second but is configurable over a wide range. Read the **u-blox Receiver Protocol Specification** in the [Resources and Going Further](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gps-neo-m9n-hookup-guide#resources-and-going-further) tab for more information. The reset pin resets the chip. The next pin, `SAFE` is used to start up the IC in safe boot mode, this could be useful if you somehow manage to corrupt the module\'s Flash memory. The final pin `INT` can be used to wake the chip from power save mode.

### Board Dimensions

Overall, the boards are 1.30\"x1.60\". The location of a majority of the components are the same with the exception of the SMD chip antenna and the u.FL connector.

## Hardware Assembly

For this example, I used a Qwiic capable [RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15123) and [associated USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215). connecting the boards with Qwiic cable, the assembly is very simple. Plug a Qwiic cable between the RedBoard and the SparkFun NEO-M9N with chip antenna and that\'s it! Just as easily I could have used the version with the U.FL connector and plugged in one of our patch antennas to the GPS board. If you need tips on plugging in the U.FL connector, then check out our [U.FL tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl). If you\'re going to be [soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) to the through hole pins for I^2^C functionality, then just attach lines to power, ground, and the I^2^C data lines to a microcontroller of your choice.

For a secure connection with an external antenna, we recommend using the SMA version.

## SparkFun u-blox Arduino Library

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

All of our u-blox based GPS boards share the same library: these two boards, their [predeccesors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gps-breakout-zoe-m8q-and-sam-m8q-hookup-guide) and the higher [precision](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005) [u-blox cousins](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136). The SparkFun u-blox Arduino library can be downloaded with the Arduino library manager by searching \'**SparkFun u-blox GNSS**\' or you can grab the zip here from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library) to manually install:

[SparkFun U-blox Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library/archive/main.zip)

There are 13 example sketches provided to get you up and receiving messages from space. We\'ll go over one of the examples in this tutorial.

**Note:** Example 2 uses the \'**MicroNMEA**\' library by **Steve Marple**. Make sure to install the library as well by searching for it in the Arduino library manager. You could also grab the zip here from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stevemarple/MicroNMEA) to manually install.\

## Example Code

We\'re just going to look at example two (i.e. \"**Example2_NMEAParsing.ino**\") which in my opinion, makes it clear the awesomeness of these GPS receivers. That is to say, talking to satellites and finding out where in the world you are.

    language:c
    #include <Wire.h> //Needed for I2C to GPS

    #include "SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library.h" //Click here to get the library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS
    SFE_UBLOX_GNSS myGNSS;

    void setup()
    

      //This will pipe all NMEA sentences to the serial port so we can see them
      myGNSS.setNMEAOutputPort(Serial);
    }

    void loop()
    

When you upload this code you\'ll have to wait \~29s to get a lock onto any satellites. After that first lock, the backup battery on the board will provide power to some internal systems that will allow for a **hot start** the next time you turn on the board. The **hot start** only lasts four hours, but allows you to get a lock within one second. After you get a lock the [serial terminal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) will start listing longitude and latitude coordinates, as seen below. Make sure to set the serial monitor to **115200 baud**.
