### Machine Learning MicroMod Carrier Board Specific Components

### Digital MEMS Microphones

What\'s better than ONE microphone? TWO!

- Microphone 1 supports a PDM interface and is enabled by default. To disable this mic, cut the EN1 jumper. For more information on this microphone, refer to the [datasheet here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/0/5/1/d/e/SPH0641LM4H-1-952032.pdf).
- Microphone 2 supports an I2S interface and is disabled by default. To enable EN2, solder the jumper pads to close the circuit. For more information on this microphone, refer to the [datasheet here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/9/c/9/1/DS-000069-ICS-43434-v1.2.pdf).

[![IMage of the microphones highlighted on the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-MicsandJumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-MicsandJumpers.jpg)

### GPIO

Along the sides of the Machine Learning Carrier Board, we\'ve broken out dedicated PTHs for UART, digital, analog, pulse width modulation, and SPI. You may also notice that we\'ve included a ground rail on the right side of the board.

[![General GPIO pins are highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-DedicatedGPIO-ALL.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-DedicatedGPIO-ALL.jpg)

#### I^2^C Specific GPIO

Additionally, we\'ve broken out the I^2^C SDA and SCL lines, with 3V3 and GND to complete your I^2^C functionality. These are primary I^2^C pins - they are connected to the Qwiic connector.

[![I2C specific GPIO pins are highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-I2CGPIO.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-I2CGPIO.jpg)

### Accelerometer

The LIS2DH12 is an ultra-low-power, high performance, three-axis linear accelerometer belonging to the "femto" family with digital I^2^C/SPI serial interface standard output. If you need more detail on this little guy, refer to the [Datasheet here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/8/c/3/a/lis2dh12_datasheet.pdf).

[![Image of the board with the accelerometer highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-Accel.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-Accel.jpg)

### Camera Connector

With this 24 pin connector, you can add image recognition to your machine learning board by popping in the [Himax CMOS Imaging Camera](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15570).

[![Image of the board with the camera connector highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-CameraConnector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-CameraConnector.jpg)

### JTAG

An unpopulated JTAG footprint is available for more advanced users who need breakpoint level debugging. We recommend checking out our [JTAG section](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/jtag) for the compatible male header and a compatible JTAG programmer and debugger.

[![Image of the board with SWD pins for JTAG debugging highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-SWD.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-SWD.jpg)

### RTC Battery

We\'ve included a 3V Lithium Rechargeable Battery as a backup power source.

[![Image of the board with the Li battery highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-RTCBattery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-RTCBattery.jpg)

### Jumpers

#### VE Jumper

[![VE Jumper on the back of the board is highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-VEJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-VEJumper.jpg)

#### VIN and 3V3 Jumpers

Cutting these jumpers will disable the VIN and 3V3 LEDs on the front of the board.

[![Highlighted VIN and 3V3 jumpers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-VIN_3V3Jumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-VIN_3V3Jumpers.jpg)

#### I^2^C Jumper

If you are daisy-chaining multiple Qwiic devices, you will want to cut this jumper; if multiple sensors are connected to the bus with the pull-up resistors enabled, the parallel equivalent resistance could create too strong of a pull-up for the bus to operate correctly. As a general rule of thumb, disable all but one pair of pull-up resistors if multiple devices are connected to the bus. To disable the pull up resistors, use an X-acto knife to cut the joint between the highlighted jumper pads.

[![Highlighted I2C jumper](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-I2CJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-I2CJumper.jpg)

#### RESET PTH

Need an external reset button? These PTH allow you to tie in to the reset functionality.

[![Highlighted Reset plated through holes](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-ResetPTH.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-SparkFun_MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-ResetPTH.jpg)

### Machine Learning MicroMod Carrier Pin Functionality

**Note:** You may not recognize the COPI/CIPO labels for SPI pins. SparkFun is working to move away from using MISO/MOSI to describe signals between the controller and the peripheral. Check out [this page](https://www.sparkfun.com/spi_signal_names) for more on our reasoning behind this change.

### Board Dimensions

The Machine learning Carrier Board measures 2.3 inches by 2.05 inches.

[![Machine Learning CB Dimensions in inches](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/MachineLearningCB_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/MachineLearningCB_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Hookup

To get started with the Machine Learning Carrier Board, you\'ll need a compatible processor board. Here we are using the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board.

**Note:** While the MicroMod RP2040 Processor Board is designed to mate with M.2 Connectors that are populated on Carrier Boards, the RP2040 is not compatible specifically with the Machine Learning Carrier Board.

Align the top key of the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board to the screw terminal of the Machine Learning Carrier Board and angle the board into the socket. Insert the board at an angle into the M.2 connector.

**Note:** There is no way to insert the processor backward since the key prevents it from mating with the M.2 connector and as an extra safeguard to prevent inserting a processor that matches the key, the mounting screw is offset so you will not be able to secure an improperly connected processor board.

[![MicroMod Processor Board inserted into the carrier board - Top angle](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/8/9/MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-06_Cropped.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/8/9/MicroMod_Machine_Learning_Carrier_Board-06_Cropped.jpg)

The Processor Board will stick up at an angle, as seen here:

Once the board is in the socket, gently hold the MicroMod Processor Board down and tighten the screw with a Phillip\'s head.

Once the board is secure, your assembled MicroMod system should look similar to the image below!

### Connecting Everything Up

With your processor inserted and secured it\'s time to connect your carrier board to your computer using the USB-C connector on the Carrier. Depending on which carrier you choose and which drivers you already have installed, you may need to install drivers.

[] **Note:** Make sure that for whatever processor board you choose, you have the correct board definitions installed.\
\
For this particular tutorial, we are using the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board. Board definitions for this processor board can be found in the [Software Setup and Programming](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-artemis-processor-board-hookup-guide#software-setup) section of the [MicroMod Artemis Processor Board Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-artemis-processor-board-hookup-guide).\
\
If you are using a different processor board, go to our [MicroMod Processor Boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod#processor_boards) landing page, find your processor board, and head on over to that tutorial for help installing your board definition.

## Example 1: Blink

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

To get started uploading code and working with your Machine Learning Carrier Board, make sure you have the MicroMod Artemis board definition selected under your **Tools** \> **Board** menu (or whatever processor you\'ve chosen to use).

### Loading Blink

Let\'s start with something basic - let\'s blink an LED. Go to **File**-\>**Examples**-\>**01.Basics**-\>**Blink**.

With everything setup correctly, upload the code! Once the code finishes transferring, you should see the STAT LED on the Artemis Processor Board begin to blink!

If the blue LED remains off, it\'s probably still sitting in the bootloader. After uploading a sketch, you may need to **tap the reset button** to get your MicroMod Artemis to run the sketch.

Look at all the blinks!

## Example 2: Accelerometer

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

SparkFun has written a library to work with the LIS2DH12 Accelerometer that\'s included on this board. You can obtain this library through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for \"LIS2DH12\". Find the one written by SparkFun Electronics and install the latest version. If you prefer downloading libraries manually, you can grab them from the GitHub Repository. We\'ve linked the datasheet for the accelerometer in the [Resources and Going Further](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-machine-learning-carrier-board-hookup-guide#resources-and-going-further) section, but if you\'d like it handy, you can also refer to it [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/8/c/3/a/lis2dh12_datasheet.pdf).

[SparkFun LIS2DH12 Arduino Library GitHub](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LIS2DH12_Arduino_Library/archive/master.zip)

With your library installed, navigate to the examples located under **File**-\>**Examples**-\>**SparkFun LIS2DH12 Arduino Library**. Let\'s load up **Example1_BasicReadings** to get you started.

[![File-\>Examples-\>SparkFun LIS2DH12 Arduino Library](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-Example2_Accelerometer_Examples.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/5/16400-Example2_Accelerometer_Examples.png)

Making sure you have the correct board and port selected, go ahead and upload your code. Once the code finishes transferring, **open the [serial monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics)** and set the baud rate to **115200**. You should see x y and z locations flying by, telling you the directions the accelerometer is reading!
