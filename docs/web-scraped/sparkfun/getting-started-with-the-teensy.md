**Note:** Teensy LC does **not** have 5V tolerant I/O pins. This is not the board for you if your project runs 5V signals, unless you want to use a [logic shifter](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/361).

The Teensy LC is 0.98 in^2^. It runs off of the **32 bit ARM Cortex-M0+** at **48MHz** and runs at **3.3V**.

The Digital to Analog converter is on pin A12 of the microcontroller. Pin `17` outputs voltages up to the supplied `Vin` voltage, at 8mA.

Pins `D5`, `D16`, `D17` and `D21` can source signals up to **20mA**. All other pins are limited to **5mA**.

## Soldering Options

When it comes to soldering your Teensy, there are many different options available to you. IF you have not soldered before, make sure to check out the following tutorial!

[](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering)

### How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering 

September 19, 2013

This tutorial covers everything you need to know about through-hole soldering.

### Solder Directly Into Your Circuit

We generally recommend against soldering directly between any two boards you want to connect \-- if something burns out or is connected incorrectly, you\'ve set yourself up for a lot of annoying rework (and the danger of ripping a pad off of the board).

[![Teensy Flush on board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyFlushWithBoard.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyFlushWithBoard.jpg)

*Soldering your Teensy directly to the board leads to a small profile, but you run the risk of needing to desolder a lot of pins!*

One benefit of soldering directly to your circuit however is that it gives a very small profile for the project. If you plan on doing this, we recommend testing your circuit design with [Alligator clips](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12978) or [Pig-tail cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9741) before hand to verify functionality.

### Solder Headers

Most users prefer using male headers on the Teensy and matching female headers on other boards into which the Teensy fits.

If you plan on using this method, you must ensure you solder the headers on straight, otherwise you\'re going to have a hard time inserting or removing the Teensy from other boards.

We recommend inserting headers into a breadboard and soldering the Teensy on from there.

[![Breadboard Teensy](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyBreadboard.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyBreadboard.jpg)

*Teensy 3.1 inserted in a breadboard for soldering. Half the pins are soldered and half aren\'t.*

After you finish soldering the headers along the length of the board, your Teensy may look similar to the image below depending on your project.

[![Breadboard Teensy with Headers Soldered On](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/Male_Headers_Soldered_Teensy.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/Male_Headers_Soldered_Teensy.jpg)

*Teensy 3.2 inserted in a breadboard for soldering with all pins soldered along the length of the board.*

Using male headers with the Teensy allows you to solder the headers on nice and straight, preventing crooked header insertion. As you can see from the images above however, if you intend to use the Teensy LC or Teensy 3.1+ on a breadboard, you cannot solder all of the headers.

[![Breadboard Incompatible](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/BreadboardIncompatiblePins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/BreadboardIncompatiblePins.jpg)

*These pins aren\'t breadboard compatible!*

If you\'ve already soldered together a board that works with the Teensy LC/3.1, you can simply line your headers up in that board to hold them straight while soldering to the Teensy.

*The male headers for the Teensy are being held straight by this [Teensy Arduino Shield Adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13288).*

Once the headers are lined up straight, it\'s easy to simply \'plug\' the Teensy into the headers and solder everything together.

*You can see the Teensy lined up on the headers, waiting to be soldered.*

You can also solder [female headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115) or [stackable headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=stackable) onto the top of the board, allowing other boards to be plugged into the top of the Teensy.

*Teensy with stackable female headers on top, allowing the Audio shield to be plugged in and the Teensy to fit into a breadboard.*

If you do solder your headers on like this, keep in mind it may limit your access to the push button on board, requiring you to break out the reboot/reset signal from the header pin.

### What about Those Additional Headers on the LC/3.1+?

#### Inner Headers

[![Inner Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/FourInternalPins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/FourInternalPins.jpg)

*Inner headers - what to do with those?!*

There are a few options to work with these pins. You can:

a\) Leave them unconnected (boring!)

b\) Solder wires to the pins as you find uses for them

c/d) Solder headers on the top/bottom

If you go for options c or d, there\'s an easy way to solder connectors on there without driving yourself crazy attempting to solder a lonely pin by itself.

If you are using male headers, you can use pliers to push/pull one of the pins out. This will allow you to use the spacer to hold the pins straight, but will remove the non-compatible pin.

[![Using Pliers to modify Headers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/HowToModifyHeaders.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/HowToModifyHeaders.jpg)

*Removing the unnecessary pin using pliers.*

If you are using female headers, this method won\'t work, but you can still use the pliers to pull out the unnecessary pins.

[![Female Header modification](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyHeaderAdaptation.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyHeaderAdaptation.jpg)

*Simply pull the header pin out, and out of the way!*

Once the header strip has been modified, simply line it up with those holes, and solder them.

#### SMD Headers

Both the 3.1+ and LC Teensy boards have SMD pins on the board bottom that you can solder to. If you know you will need access to these pins, we recommend that you solder the headers onto the top side of your Teensy.

If you already have another Teensy soldered, you can use this as a soldering jig to keep the headers straight, as shown below.

[![Headers Soldered On Top](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/HeadersSolderedOnTop.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/HeadersSolderedOnTop.jpg)

*Headers are soldered on the top of the board, enabling access to the SMD pads on the bottom.*

With the headers soldered onto the Teensy this way, the user has access to all of the SMD pads on the bottom of the board. Keep in mind however, this does minimize access to the pushbutton, so balance that with your project needs.

If you need help with soldering to the SMD pads on the bottom of the board, please check out our tutorial [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/36).

## Programming

To start working with the Teensy, all you need to do is plug in your USB cable to your computer and your Teensy board. There are two options for programming the Teensy boards - the Arduino IDE or your favorite C compiler.

### Arduino IDE

**Note:** If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

#### Teensyduino Add-On Installation

You will need to download the Teensyduino add-on for Arduino. You can find the Teensyduino download from PJRC [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html).

[PJRC: Tensyduino Add-On](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

Please follow their installation instructions for the most up-to-date version of the Teensyduino. You will also need to select which Teensy-compatible libraries you\'d like to install at that time. If you aren\'t sure which libraries you will want, you can always download them and install them later from the [curated list](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs.html).

#### Programming the Teensy

When you first plug the Teensy in, the appropriate drivers will be installed (if using a Windows machine). Your Teensy should default to the standard `Blink` sketch. You should see the LED blinking, as a quick check to make sure your board is functioning.

Open up the Arduino IDE, and select the appropriate Teensy board from the `Board` menu. This will provide you with additional options in the `Tools` menu.

[![Arduino Teensy Options](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyArduinoOptions.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyArduinoOptions.JPG)

*Drop-down options in Arduino for Teensy boards.*

If you would like to use the Teensy as an HID, MIDI, or user interface device (such as a keyboard or mouse), you can select that option from the `USB Type` menu.

The CPU speed can be changed for low-power applications.

**Note:** If you are using the Teensy 3.1, you must set the CPU speed to 24MHz or faster for proper functionality.

The `Keyboard Layout` option can be updated to your preferred style.

If this is the first time uploading, click on the Arduino\'s Verify button. The Teensy Loader Program will open (if it is not already open) and prompt you to push the pushbutton (the BOOT button). You should see this window:

[![Teensy Loader](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyLoader.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/5/TeensyLoader.JPG)

*Teensy Loader Window*

Verify your example code, and upload to the board as usual in the Arduino IDE. The Teensy Loader Program will also open when pressing the upload button as well. In some cases, you will need to hit the on-board BOOT button once the IDE has compiled the code to finish uploading it to your Teensy. You should only need to do this the first time you upload code for the duration that your Teensy is powered.

**Note:** Most Arduino libraries work on Teensy. However, modifications to the libraries may be needed to make it cross-platform compatible. There are a few libraries curated on PJRC\'s website with modifications and special instructions specific to Teensy. Check out a few of the libraries below to take advantage of a Teensy\'s features like its [Real Time Clock (RTC)](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html#teensy3) or [capacitive touch pins](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_CapacitiveSensor.html).\

### C Compiler

This is typically a more advanced option. For step-by-step instructions on using a C-compiler for the Teensy, please check out PJRC\'s directions [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html). You will still need to download and install the Teensyduino and modify the Arduino files to use the `Makefile` for the Teensy boards.

[PJRC: GCC Compiler and Tools](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html)

Additional support for other languages is slowly being added. Please check [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/languages.html) for more information.

[PJRC: Using Other Languages](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/languages.html)

### MicroPython

For those that are comfortable with Python language, you can also load [MicroPython](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tags/micropython) on the Teensy! Check out the following tutorial for more information on getting started.
