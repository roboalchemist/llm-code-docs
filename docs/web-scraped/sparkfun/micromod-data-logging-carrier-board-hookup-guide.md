The Data Logging Carrier Board allows you to control power to both the Qwiic connector on the board as well as a dedicated power pin for non-Qwiic peripherals such as serial UART or SPI devices so you can pick and choose when to power the peripherals you are monitoring the data from. It also features a charging circuit for single-cell Lithium-ion batteries along with an RTC battery-backup circuit to maintain power for a real-time clock circuit on your Processor Board.

### Required Materials

Like all of our MicroMod Carrier Boards, there is no processor included but instead you can plug in a Processor of your choice to the MicroMod M.2 connector on the carrier. Below are a few options to choose for your processor:

### Getting Started with MicroMod 

Dive into the world of MicroMod - a compact interface to connect a microcontroller to various peripherals via the M.2 Connector!

## Hardware Overview

In this section we\'ll cover the components on the MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board, how a specific MicroMod Processor Board interacts with it and highlight a few unique features on the board.

### Common Components

Most SparkFun MicroMod Carrier Boards will have some common components and all MicroMod Carrier Boards will have the keyed M.2 MicroMod Connector to plug your processor into. The photo and list below outline some of the components included on most SparkFun MicroMod Carrier Boards.

- **M.2 MicroMod Connector** - This special keyed M.2 connector lets you install your MicroMod Processor Board of choice on your Carrier Board.
- **USB-C Connector** - Connect to your computer to program your Processor Board and also can provide power to your MicroMod system.
- **3.3V Regulator** - Provides a regulated **3.3V** and sources up to **1A**.
- **Qwiic Connector** - The standard Qwiic connector so you can add Qwiic devices to your MicroMod system.
- **Boot/Reset Buttons** - Push buttons to enter boot mode on Processor Boards and to reset your MicroMod circuit.
- **RTC Backup Battery & Charge Circuit** - **1mAh** backup battery for the RTC for certain MicroMod Processor Boards . Receives charge voltage from **3.3V**.
- **microSD Slot** - Insert a µSD card formatted to FAT32 here to log your data.

[![MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board Common Components Labeled](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Common_Components1.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Common_Components1.jpg)

### Power Control Circuit

The Data Logging Carrier Board features two **3.3V/600mA** voltage regulators that have their Enable pins tied to I/O pins on an attached MicroMod Processor Board. This allows control of the regulators\' output with a few lines of code making it extremely simple to control and conserve power in battery-powered applications. The **G1-3V3** line is controlled by G1 on the MicroMod Processor and the **G2-3.3V** circuit is (as you may suspect) is controlled by G2 on the MicroMod Processor. The **G1-3.3V** power circuit is tied to several pins highlighted in the below photo for extra flexibility powering external devices. The **G2-3V3** output is tied to the **3.3V** pin on the Qwiic connector as well as a dedicated PTH pin labeled G2-3V3.

[![Photo highlighting the power control circuit and affected pins/Qwiic connector.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Power_Control.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Power_Control.jpg)

### Battery Charging Circuit

The board also has a MCP73831 Single-Cell Lithium-Ion/Lithium-Polymer Charge IC so you can charge an attached single-cell LiPo battery. The charge IC receives power primarily from USB and can source up to 450mA to charge an attached battery.

[![Photo highlighting the lipo battery circuit.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-LiPo_Circuit.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-LiPo_Circuit.jpg)

### Data Logging Connections

Along with the Qwiic connector mentioned in the Common Components, the Data Logging Carrier Board breaks out several other pins to connect UART, SPI and other I/O devices. The primary SPI pins are netted to the µSD slot and a PTH header near the LiPo battery connector. A second Chip Select pin tied to G0 is broken out to that same header.

**Note:** µSD Chip Select is tied to the SPI_CS chip select pin on the M.2 Connector. Refer to your Processor Board\'s documentation for information on how to properly define that pin in your code.

A UART PTH header connects to RX1 and TX1 for serial data logging and A0, A1, PWM0, PWM1, D0 and D1 are routed to dedicated PTH pins as well. Lastly, if users prefer a soldered connection instead of Qwiic, the primary I^2^C bus is broken out to PTH pins.

[![Photo highlighting the PTH pin connections.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-PTH_Pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-PTH_Pins.jpg)

### JTAG

An unpopulated JTAG footprint is available for more advanced users who need breakpoint level debugging. We recommend checking out our [JTAG section](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/jtag) for the compatible male header and a compatible JTAG programmer and debugger.

[![Photo highlighting JTAG connections](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-JTAG.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-JTAG.jpg)

### Solder Jumpers

If you have never worked with solder jumpers and PCB traces before or would like a quick refresher, check out our [How to Work with Solder Jumpers and PCB Traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces) tutorial for detailed instructions and tips.

There are seven solder jumpers on the Data Logging Carrier Board labeled I^2^C, MEAS, BYP, VIN, 3V3, VE, and BATT. In this section we\'ll detail the functionality and default states of each jumper.

**Jumper Name/Label**

### Board Dimensions

The MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board measures 2.40\" x 1.60\" (60.96mm x 40.64mm) and has five mounting holes that fit a [4-40 screw](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10453). Take note of the mounting hole labeled \"Qwiic Mount\" above the µSD slot as it can work as single mount for a Qwiic breakout (or other sensor) or you can pair it with the outer mount in the \"top-right\" corner for a more secure mounting option. We demonstrate using these two mounts for a Qwiic breakout in the following section, Hardware Assembly.

[![Data Logging Carrier Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MicroMod_Data_Logging_CB-Dimensions.png)

Now that we\'re familiar with the hardware on the MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board, it\'s time to plug your Processor Board and peripheral sensors in and start logging some data. Next up we\'ll cover some assembly tips.

## Hardware Assembly

### Inserting the Processor Board

With the M.2 MicroMod connector, connecting your processor board is easy. Match up the key on your processor\'s beveled edge connector to the key on the M.2 connector on your Carrier Board. At a 45° angle, insert the processor board to the M.2 connector. The Processor board will stick up at an angle as seen here:

[![Processor Board is inserted into the M.2 connector at a 45 degree angle.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Unsecured-Processor.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Unsecured-Processor.jpg)

Once the board is in the socket, gently press the Processor board down, grab the set screw and tighten it with a Phillip\'s head screwdriver:

[![Securing the Processor Board into place using the set screw.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Securing-Processor.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Securing-Processor.jpg)

Once the Processor is secure, your assembled MicroMod system should look similar to the image below!

[![MicroMod Processor Board secured into place on the Data Logging Carrier Board.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Assembled-Processor.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Assembled-Processor.jpg)

**Note:** There is *technically* no way to insert the processor backward since the key prevents it from mating with the M.2 connector. As an extra safeguard to prevent inserting a processor improperly or with a poor connection, the mounting screw will not match up if the Processor is not plugged in entirely.

### Data Logging Peripherals

As we mentioned previously, the Data Logging Carrier Board offers several ways to connect your sensors or other peripherals you intend to log data from.

If you are using a Qwiic breakout just connect it using a Qwiic cable to the Qwiic connector on the Carrier Board. If your I^2^C device is not Qwiic-enabled, you can either use a [Qwiic adapter cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425) or connect the peripheral to the Carrier Board using the 0.1\"-spaced PTH pins for I^2^C. Soldering is strongly recommended for this approach but if you just want a temporary connection for prototyping you can use IC Hooks like [these](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/501) or [these](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9741).

For alternate data inputs using SPI, Serial UART or other inputs (analog, digital, etc.), you will need to connect them to the 0.1\"-spaced PTH pins broken out on either side of the Data Logging Carrier Board using one of the methods covered above. Take note of which **3.3V** rail you are connecting them to for easy reference when controlling power to your devices after everything is soldered together.

[![A Qwiic ZOE-M8Q GPS Module is connected to the Data Logging Carrier Board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Qwiic-GPS.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/2/9/MM_Data_Logging_CB-Qwiic-GPS.jpg)

Before powering everything up, insert your microSD card into the card slot and press it in to lock it into place.

### Connecting Everything Up

With your processor inserted and secured it\'s time to connect your MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board to your computer using the USB-C connector. Depending on which Processor you choose and which drivers you already have installed, you may need to install drivers for your processor board. Refer to your Processor Board\'s Hookup Guide for detailed instructions on how to install them. At this point you can also connect your battery for charging or to power the circuit once USB power is removed.

## Arduino Examples

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

### GPS Demo Circuit Example

We\'ve written a quick example for the demo circuit from the Hardware Assembly section using the [SparkFun GPS Breakout - ZEO-M8Q (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15193) to showcase how to log data from the GPS module to a µSD card. To assemble the circuit, simply plug in your GPS module to the Data Logging Carrier Board via a Qwiic cable and attach the [GPS Antenna](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14986) to the board using a [u.Fl to SMA Adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9145). If you\'ve never worked with u.Fl connectors before [this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl) offers a few quick tips for using them. Also, the SparkFun u-blox Arduino library works with all of our u-blox modules so you can swap in a different u-blox GPS if you prefer.

In order to run this example you will need to have the SparkFun U-blox Arduino library installed. You can install it with the Arduino Library Manager by searching **\'SparkFun u-blox GNSS\'** or you can download the zip here from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library):

[SparkFun U-blox Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library/archive/master.zip)

Copy the code below into a blank Arduino sketch, select your Processor Board (for the demo circuit we select, \"SparkFun Artemis MicroMod\") and the Port your board has enumerated on. If you are not using the MicroMod Artemis Processor, you\'ll need to adjust the define for Chip Select:

      myGNSS.saveConfiguration(); //Save the current settings to flash and BBR

      Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");

      // see if the card is present and can be initialized:
      if (!SD.begin(chipSelect)) 
      Serial.println("card initialized.");

      myFile = SD.open("data.txt", FILE_WRITE); // Create or open a file called "data.txt" on the SD card
      if(myFile)

With the code adjusted, click the Upload button. For debugging, open your [serial monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) and set the baud **115200**. The code will print out if the SD card or GPS do not initialize properly. If the SD initialization fails, check that the card is inserted and locked and that it is formatted to FAT32. If the GPS initialization fails, check the connection to your GPS board or verify it is at the default I^2^C address.

If everything initializes properly, the code will open the \"data.txt\" file and begin logging data once the GPS has a fix and will also print the same data over serial. If the GPS does not have a lock, the code will print out the number of satellites in view over serial.

### Power Control Examples

In addition to this GPS example, we\'ve written two example sketches specifically for the Data Logging Carrier Board demonstrating how to control the **3.3V** regulators powering the Qwiic connector/G2-3V3 pin and G1-3V3 rail. They can be found in the [MicroMod Data Logging Carrier Board GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/MicroMod_Data_Logging_Carrier) or you can download the Zip of the repository by clicking the button below

Take note both Qwiic and 3V3 peripheral power are controlled via the enable pin on dedicated voltage regulators. An external pull-up turns both regulators on by default but can be controlled with standard logic. Power ON = `HIGH` and Power OFF = `LOW`.
