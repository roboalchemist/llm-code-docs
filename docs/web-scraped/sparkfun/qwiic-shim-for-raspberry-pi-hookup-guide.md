## Introduction

The [SparkFun Qwiic SHIM for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15794) is a small, easily removable breakout to add a Qwiic connector to your Raspberry Pi. The SHIM (short for Shove Hardware in the Middle) design allows you to plug directly to the Pi\'s I^2^C bus with no soldering required and the thin PCB design allows for it to be sandwiched on your Pi GPIO with other HATS. The Qwiic SHIM works great when you do not need the full capabilities of the [Qwiic pHAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15351) or if you want to add a Qwiic connector to your Pi but do not have room for yet another HAT.

## Hardware Overview

The Qwiic SHIM uses a unique friction-based connector that wedges itself onto the GPIO header for a secure, solderless connection. As you would expect, it has a single Qwiic connector that connects to your Pi\'s I^2^C bus (SDA, SCL, 5V and Ground). The SHIM also has a 3.3V regulator so it will work with all Qwiic devices.

[![Top view of the qwiic shim.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_for_Raspberry_Pi-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_for_Raspberry_Pi-02.jpg)

*Top View Photo of Qwiic SHIM*

### Press Fit Header

The Press Fit Header on the Qwiic SHIM allows you to easily place the Qwiic SHIM on to your Pi (or other Single-Board Computer with the Pi GPIO) aligning the square pin on the Qwiic SHIM with Pin 1 of your GPIO. Pin one on the GPIO can be identified by the square pin or the beveled corner on the silkscreen. We will cover that in more detail in the Hardware Hookup section.

[![Press Fit Header highlighted.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_for_Raspberry_Pi-PressFitHeader.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_for_Raspberry_Pi-PressFitHeader.jpg)

*Press Fit Header*

### Voltage Regulator

For you savvy readers out there, you may wonder why not just connect directly to the 3.3V rail on the Pi GPIO? A simple answer is the Pi\'s 5V rail is able to source more current than the 3.3V rail so the regulator allows you to connect more devices to the I^2^C bus without needing to worry about overtaxing your Pi.The on board AP2112K 3.3V regulator provides a clean 3.3V out for all attached Qwiic devices and can source up to 600mA@3.3V so you should have plenty of available current for your Qwiic project.

[![Voltage regulator is on the right side of the top of the board, between two capacitors](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_Raspberry_Pi-VoltageRegulator.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/6/5/15794-SparkFun_Qwiic_SHIM_Raspberry_Pi-VoltageRegulator.jpg)

## Hardware Hookup

Getting started with the Qwiic SHIM is a snap (well, actually it\'s more like a push but you get the idea). Making sure to align the Qwiic SHIM\'s Pin 1 with Pin 1 on your Pi\'s GPIO header, press the Qwiic SHIM down onto the header. Pin 1 on both the Qwiic SHIM and the Pi GPIO will be marked with a square pin. There is also a beveled corner on the Pi GPIO header indicating Pin 1 from the top of your Pi. That\'s it! With the SHIM in place you can now attach all your Qwiic devices to your Pi with space to spare for other Pi HATs.

⚡ **Warning!** When connecting the Qwiic SHIM to your GPIO header, make sure to align it properly with Pin 1. If the Qwiic SHIM is not aligned properly (either if it is upside down or not aligned on the correct pins) you can short your 5V rail to Ground!\

\

With the Qwiic SHIM in place, you can now stack all the HATs you would like on top. With a HAT on top of the SHIM, the press fit header will make an even better connection and the thin PCB allows any HAT to still connect fully to the GPIO header.

#### raspi-config Tool [via Terminal]

Again, we can use `raspi-config` to enable it.

1.  Run `sudo raspi-config`.
2.  Use the down arrow to select `5 Interfacing Options`
3.  Arrow down to `P5 I2C`.
4.  Select `yes` when it asks you to enable I2C
5.  Also select `yes` if it asks about automatically loading the kernel module.
6.  Use the right arrow to select the `<Finish>` button.
7.  Select `yes` when it asks to reboot.

[![Enabling I2C on the Raspberry Pi](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/4/9/i2c-menu2.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/4/9/i2c-menu2.png)

*Raspi-config for I2C*

The system will reboot. When it comes back up, log in and enter the following command

    language:bash
    ls /dev/*i2c*

The Pi should respond with

    language:bash
    /dev/i2c-1

Which represents the user-mode I2C interface.

## Scanning for I2C Devices

If you are using the Raspberry Pi to quickly connect to I^2^C devices, the best place to start would be to scan for an I^2^C device on the bus.

### Utilities

There is a set of command-line utility programs that can help get an I2C interface working. You can get them with the apt package manager.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

In particular, the `i2cdetect` program will probe all the addresses on a bus, and report whether any devices are present. Enter the following command in the command line. The `-y` flag will disable interactive mode so that you do not have to wait for confirmation. The `1` indicates that we are scanning for I^2^C devices on I^2^C bus 1 (e.g. i2c-1).

    language:bash
    i2cdetect -y 1

You will get an output from your Raspberry Pi similar to the output below.

    language:bash
    pi@raspberrypi:~/$ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: 60 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

This map indicates that there is a peripheral at address **0x60**. Your address may vary depending on what is connected to the I^2^C bus. For advanced users, you can try to read and write its registers using the `i2cget`, `i2cset` and `i2cdump` commands.

### Qwiic Py Drivers

Now that you have I^2^C set up on your Pi, you can start programming your Qwiic devices on your Pi or if you\'d like to start with some examples, we have a host of Python drivers for Qwiic breakouts available in the GitHub repository linked below. You can read more about Python for the SparkFun Qwiic system in [this blog post](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2958).
