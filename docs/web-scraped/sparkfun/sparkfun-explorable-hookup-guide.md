## Introduction

The [SparkFun LoRa Thing Plus -- expLoRaBLE](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17506) is a feather form-factor development board with the NM180100 [system in package (SiP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_in_a_package), from [Northern Mechatronics](https://www.northernmechatronics.com/). The [NM180100 SiP](https://www.northernmechatronics.com/nm180100) includes a Semtech SX1262 LoRa module paired with the Apollo3 MCU, which is used in the [SparkFun Artemis module](https://www.sparkfun.com/artemis). This provides the board with compatibility in the Arduino IDE, through our [Apollo3 Arduino core](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Apollo3). The Semtech SX1262 is a long range, low power RF tranceiver introduces [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan/) capabilities to the board. Additionally, both the BLE and LoRa capabilities of the expLoRaBLE allow it to operate as a Bluetooth enabled LoRa node.
