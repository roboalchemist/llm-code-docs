The [gator:microphone](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15289) is a small board that combines a microphone and some processing circuitry. It provides not only an audio output, but also a binary indication of the presence of sound, and an analog representation of it\'s amplitude.

### Required Materials

To get started, you\'ll need a micro:bit to control everything. Each of the products below includes a micro:bit, but the kit and bundle also include some additional accessories that you may want as well.
