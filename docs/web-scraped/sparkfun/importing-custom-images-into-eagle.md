## Introduction

Creating custom artwork on your PCB can be a fun way to personalize your project, add a company logo, or go crazy with pin numbering fonts. In this tutorial, we\'ll show you 3 different methods of importing custom images into Eagle. Note that each of the three ways has pros and cons.

*We used Method #1 to import this badger face as a series of polygons in Eagle*

We recommend trying [Method #1 (SVG to Polygon)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/importing-custom-images-into-eagle/method-1-svg-to-polygon) first. It is the most complicated, but, if it works, you\'ll have a set of polygons for your custom image that are much easier to work with than the lines/rectangles created by methods 2 and 3. If that fails, try method 2 or 3 to import an image as a series of lines, but be warned that having that many shapes can slow down your computer.

Additionally, you can import an image with method 2 or 3 and then trace over them with polygons in Eagle.
