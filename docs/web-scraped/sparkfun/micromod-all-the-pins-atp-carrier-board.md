## Hardware Overview

### MicroMod Processor Board

The MicroMod ATP Carrier Board includes a location for a MicroMod Processor Board. Here is where your chosen Processor Board will reside.

[![MicroMod M.2 Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_M_Dot_2.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_M_Dot_2.jpg)

### Power

There are a variety of power-related nets broken out to female header pins and their corresponding through hole pads. The image below highlights those female headers and pads. The board can be powered from the VIN pin with a recommended voltage between **3.3V to 6.0V**. It can also be powered with 5V from the USB C connector. The voltage is regulated down to **3.3V** with the AP7361C voltage regulator to power your devices with up to 1A of current. If your voltage is clean, and regulated, you can also connect it directly to the 3.3V line.

[![Power Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Power_Rails.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Power_Rails.jpg)

#### Backup Battery

The board has a built-in backup battery for Processor Boards with an RTC. Depending on the processor, it may not be connected

[![Backup Battery for the RTC](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Backup_Battery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Backup_Battery.jpg)

### USB Ports

You have the option of connecting the board to a computer using the USB connectors. The [USB Type C connector](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics#usb-connectors) is used to power, program the processor board, or pass serial data to a serial terminal. If your processor board has dedicated pins broken out for USB host, there is an option for USB host through the female USB Type A connector. There is a Schottky diode on the USB host\'s 5V pin to prevent conflicting voltages from the USB host device and USB-C connector. If necessary, you can bypass the diode to power the USB host device by adding a wire between the VHOST pin and VIN pin.

[![USB Ports](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_USB.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_USB.jpg)

**Heads up!** The SAMD51\'s USB host pins are broken out on the same pins as the USB pins for programming. You will need an adapter or a [second USB Type A connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12700) if you decide to use USB host.

### All the \[GPIO\] Pins

Remember our \"All the Pins!\" nickname? Well, we meant it. On the MicroMod ATP, we broke out all the major pins using the [general MicroMod hardware pinout v1.0](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod#hardware_pinout) from the M.2 connector to the female headers. We\'ve also added a secondary rail of plated through-holes alongside them to give you the choice of either plug and play or soldering directly to the board. Your mileage may vary depending on the processor board that you are using.

[![All The Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_All_the_Pins_Broken_Out.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_All_the_Pins_Broken_Out.jpg)

### Qwiic and I^2^C

There are two locations on the board for your favorite Qwiic-enabled device. In addition to the Qwiic connectors, we also have pins that are broken out on the should you need to use jumper wires or solder wire direction to both boards. If you look closely at the port labeled as **I2C**, there is a dedicated I^2^C [interrupt](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/processor-interrupts-with-arduino/all) pin available.

[![Qwiic Connectors and I2C](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Qwiic_I2C_Ports.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Qwiic_I2C_Ports.jpg)

There are mounting holes to attach each standard 1.0\"x1.0\" Qwiic-enabled device.

### Reset and Boot Buttons

The reset button will reset the processor. The boot button will put the processor into a special boot mode. Depending on the processor board, this boot pin may not be connected.

[![Reset and Boot Buttons](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Reset_Boot.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_Reset_Boot.jpg)

### SWD Programming Pins

For advanced users, we broke out the SWD programming pins. Note that this is not populated so you will need a [compatible header and compatible JTAG programmer](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/jtag) to connect.

[![SWD Programming PIns](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_SWD_Programming_Pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_Board_SWD_Programming_Pins.jpg)

### LEDs

There are two LEDs on the board.

- **VIN** - The VIN LED turns on whenever there is voltage applied on the VIN pin. This can be from the USB C connector or the VIN pin on the edge of the board.
- **3V3** - The 3V3 LED turns on whenever there is voltage on the 3.3V pin. This can be from the output of the 3.3V voltage regulator or any of the 3.3V nets located on the edge of the board.

[![LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/16885-SparkFun_MicroMod_ATP_Carrier_LEDs.jpg)

### Jumper Pads

**Note:** If this is your first time working with jumpers, check out the [How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all) tutorial for more information.

There are a few jumpers populated on the board:

- **Bypass (BYP)** - By default, the BYP is left open. Adding a solder jumper bypasses the 2A resettable fuse on the back of the board should you decide to pull more than 2A from your USB source. Proceed with caution should you decide to bypass the jumper.
- **Enable (EN)** - By default, the EN jumper is left open. This jumper is connected to a processor board\'s GPIO pin. The processor board can control the ATP\'s voltage regulator. Depending on the processor, this may not be connected.
- **Current Measurement (MEAS)** - By default, the MEAs is closed. Cutting the jumper and soldering to the PTH pads will allows you to insert a current meter and precisely monitor the how much current your application is consuming.
- **3V3 LED** - By default, the 3V3 LED is closed. Cutting this jumper will disable the LED when there is 3.3V.
- **VIN LED** - By default, the VIN LED is closed. Cutting this jumper will disable the LED whenever there is an input voltage.

### Board Dimensions

The board is 3.30\"x2.20\". There are 4x mounting holes on each corner of the board. There are 2x additional mounting holes by the SparkFun logo for Qwiic-enabled devices.

## Hardware Hookup

If you have not already, make sure to check out the [Getting Started with MicroMod: Hardware Hookup](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod#hardware-hookup) for information on inserting your Processor Board to your Carrier Board.

[](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod)

### Getting Started with MicroMod 

October 21, 2020

Dive into the world of MicroMod - a compact interface to connect a microcontroller to various peripherals via the M.2 Connector!

At a minimum, your setup should look like the image below. In this case, we had the MicroMod SAMD51 Processor Board secured in the M.2 connector. To program and power the microcontroller, we inserted the USB-C cable.

[![Processor Board inserted into Carrier Board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Processor_Board.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Processor_Board.jpg)

Depending on your setup you may need hardware (jumper wire, cables, header pins, breadboard, etc.) to connect to the board. In this case, we used jumper wire to connect to another board.

[![Jumper Wire Connecting Boards](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Hardware_Serial_Out.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Hardware_Serial_Out.jpg)

To Qwiic-ly connect I^2^C devices, simply insert a Qwiic cable between the MicroMod ATP\'s Qwiic port and your Qwiic device.

[![Qwiic-Enabled Device Connected to MicroMod ATP Carrier Board with Qwiic Cable](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Qwiic_Device.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Qwiic_Device.jpg)

To secure the boards together, you could add [standoffs and screws](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/257) to mount a Qwiic-enabled device that have the standard 1.0\"x1.0\" sized board. Keep in mind that this will block a few of the header pins below so make sure to plan accordingly.

[![Qwiic-Enabled Device Mounted with Standoffs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Qwiic_Mounted.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/1/1/MicroMod_ATP_SAMD51_Qwiic_Mounted.jpg)

Depending on the location of the mounting holes, you may need to make an adapter to hold the Qwiic-enabled device securely. Below is an example with mounting holes on the same side instead of diagonal. A piece of cardboard was cut out as shown in the image below. Depending on your personal preference, you could also laser cut, CNC, or 3D printer to make a more sturdy panel for those that need a stronger material.

## Arduino Example

**Note:** If this is your first time using Arduino IDE or board add-on, please review the following tutorials.\
\

- [Installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide)
- [Installing Board Definitions in the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-board-definitions-in-the-arduino-ide)

There are quite a lot of peripherals broken out on the MicroMod ATP Carrier Board. Depending on the design of the Processor Board, not all of the pins may be broken out. For simplicity, we will upload a blink sketch to get started.

### Blink

[] **Note:** Make sure that for whatever processor board you choose, you have the correct board definitions installed. Go to our [MicroMod Processor Boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod#processor_boards) landing page, find your processor board, and head on over to that tutorial for help installing your board definition.

Now that you have a Processor Board secure in the Carrier Board, let\'s upload a simple blink sketch to the board. Copy and paste the following code in the Arduino IDE. Head to **Tools** \> **Board** to select the correct board definition (in this case, **SparkFun MicroMod SAMD51**. Select the correct COM port that the board enumerated to. Hit upload.

      Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

      This example code is in the public domain.

    // Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
    // give it a name
    // uncomment the following lines if the macro is not defined for your architecture
    //#define LED_BUILTIN 13 //Artemis, SAMD51
    //#define LED_BUILTIN 5 //ESP32

    // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
    void setup() 

    // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
    void loop() 

After uploading, you should see the Processor Board\'s LED blink. If not, make sure that to define the pin and check your connections.

What\'s next? Try building a circuit using the design files and associated tutorial for your [Processor Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod#processor_boards) more information. Keep in mind that while each Processor Board uses the same MicroMod interface pinout, each board may have different specifications, software support, and peripherals available for the architecture.
