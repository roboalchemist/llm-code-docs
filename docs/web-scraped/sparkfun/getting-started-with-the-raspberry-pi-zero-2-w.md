## Introduction

The latest entry into the immensely popular Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SBC) catalog, the [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18713), provides an upgraded drop-in replacement to the [Pi Zero W](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14277) powered by a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A53 CPU. This guide highlights the improvements in hardware on the Pi Zero 2 W, how to set it up in a desktop configuration as well as installing and the basics of using the Raspberry Pi OS.

### Required Materials

This guide assumes users have the Pi Zero 2 W Basic Kit so if you do not have the kit, make sure you have the necessary accessories (power adapter, mini HDMI cable, USB OTG cable or USB hub & a microSD card). Along with the Basic Kit, you will need a monitor (or TV), keyboard, mouse and USB hub (for more than one USB device) to follow this tutorial. Users in need of a keyboard/mouse combo may want to consider the [Logitech K400 Plus Wireless Touch Keyboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16300).
