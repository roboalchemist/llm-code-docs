## Introduction to the micro:arcade Kit

**Note:** Please be aware that this documentation and the associated hardware may not be compatible with the latest [micro:bit v2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17287) boards due to the hardware and software changes. For more details, check out these support articles from micro:bit:

- [Getting Started - Details of micro:bit V2](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000119052-details-of-micro-bit-v2)
- [Guidance on using the latest micro:bit revision](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000119053-guidance-on-using-the-latest-micro-bit-revision-for-accessory-makers)

We love games! We love writing games, building games and yes, even building game consoles. So we want to introduce to you the [micro:arcade kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16403) for the micro:bit!

The kit includes our [controller:bit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16129) carrier board for the micro:bit, which gives you access to a number of pins through the form of buttons in a classic game controller layout. But, that isn\'t all!

It\'s one thing to design a \"game controller,\" but what about building a console? A joystick, buttons to mash\...the things that make us hard-core arcade fans drool and daydream. This kit is designed for you! The kit includes all of the parts you need to take this lowly controller breakout to a pinball wizard\'s dream!

### Included Materials
