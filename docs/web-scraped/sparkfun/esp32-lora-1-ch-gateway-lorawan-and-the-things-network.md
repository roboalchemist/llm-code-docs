The [ESP32 LoRa 1-CH Gateway](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14893) combines an ESP32 \-- a programmable microcontroller featuring both WiFi and Bluetooth radios \-- with an RFM95W LoRa transceiver to create a single-channel LoRa gateway. It\'s a perfect, low-cost tool for monitoring a dozen-or-so LoRa devices, and relaying their messages up to the cloud.

Complete with a [Qwiic connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and a breadboard-compatible array of ESP32 pin-breakouts, this board can can also serve as a general-purpose ESP32/RFM95W development platform. So, instead of using it as a LoRaWAN gateway, you can turn it into a **LoRa device**, and use the powerful ESP32 microcontroller to monitor sensors, host a web server, run a display or more.

These boards are a great way to begin dipping your toes into the world of LoRa and LoRaWAN. Not only can they be programmed as versatile single-channel gateway, but they can also be used as a LoRa device, or a general ESP32/RFM95W development board.

The goal of this tutorial is to get you quickly up-and-running with the ESP32 LoRa 1-CH Gateway. It\'ll explain how to program the board in Arduino, how to our recommended gateway firmware, and even how to turn the board into a LoRa device.

### Required Materials

The ESP32 LoRa Single-Channel Gateway is designed to be a nearly-complete LoRa gateway. There are just a few extra components you may need to get it up-and-running. You may not need everything though depending on what you have. Add it to your cart, read through the guide, and adjust the cart as necessary.

To power and program the board, you\'ll need a [micro-B USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215) and a computer with Arduino installed. To boost your LoRa radio\'s signal, you\'ll also need an antenna. You can either use the included U.FL connector \-- with a [U.FL-to-SMA adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/662) and [900 MHz SMA antenna](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9143) \-- or solder on a \~3-inch strip of [wire](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367).

## Hardware Setup

The ESP32 LoRa 1-CH Gateway includes almost everything you need to set up either a LoRaWAN gateway or device. You may not even have to solder anything to it to get started! Here\'s a quick rundown of the bare minimum you\'ll need to get started with the board.

### Antenna

To allow the board to communicate with other LoRa devices, you\'ll need to add an antenna. This can be attached to either the U.FL connector or the **ANT** pin on the board.

The U.FL connector can be attached to an [SMA to U.FL](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/662) adapter cable, which can then be paired with a [900 MHz Duck Antenna](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9143).

[![ESP32/LoRa board with wire antenna soldered in](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/14893-ESP32_LoRa_1-Channel_Gateway-06.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/14893-ESP32_LoRa_1-Channel_Gateway-06.jpg)

*3.07\" strip of 22-AWG solid-core wire soldered to the ANT pin. Use the hole adjacent to the ANT pin for strain relief!*

In lieu of a U.FL antenna, a strip of [wire](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11367) soldered to the ANT pin and sticking straight up will work as well. Here are wire lengths for quarter-wave antennas at 915MHz and 434MHz:

  --------------- --------------------- -----------------
  **Frequency**   **Length (inches)**   **Length (mm)**
  915 MHz         3.07\" (3 + 1/16\")   78mm
  434 MHz         6.47\" (6 + 1/2\")    164mm
  --------------- --------------------- -----------------

### Powering the Board

The board is nominally powered via the on-board **micro-USB** connector. The other end of your USB cable can be plugged into either a computer, [wall adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12890), or a [USB battery pack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14169).

[![Examples power supplies \-- USB or 3.3V](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/14893-ESP32_LoRa_1-Channel_Gateway-05.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/14893-ESP32_LoRa_1-Channel_Gateway-05.jpg)

Alternatively, the board can be powered using a **regulated 3.3V power supply**. This supply should be applied to the 3.3V and GND pins.

Under normal operation the ESP32 LoRa 1-CH Gateway consumes between **50-100mA**. (Running the ESP-sc-gway sketch.)

## Arduino IDE Setup

To set up the gateway software you\'ll need to install the ESP32 Arduino core as well as the library dependencies of the ESP32 LoRa Gateway sketch.

### Arduino Board Setup

The example code and libraries for this board are all written for the Arduino IDE. If you haven\'t already done so, you\'ll need to **install the Arduino core for ESP32**. The ESP32 Arduino core must be installed manually. You can find the core files on espressif\'s GitHub: <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32>. Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions) to add the core to your Arduino IDE.

#### Adding a Custom Board

Although it\'s possible to upload code to the board using the standard board definitions, we recommend customizing the core to add support for the SparkX ESP32 LoRa Gateway.

To add the custom board, begin by downloading the board\'s variant file here below.

[Download the SparkX ESP32 LoRa Arduino variant definition (ZIP)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/sparkx_esp32_lora-v01.zip)

\

Then unzip the contents into **\.../hardware/espressif/esp32/variants**.

[![Variant install location](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/esp32-variant-install-location.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/esp32-variant-install-location.png)

*The \"sparkx_esp32_lora\" folder should live in the \"variants\" folder of your ESP32 hardware directory.*

This custom board file specifies the SPI and built-in LED pins. Without it, you\'ll need to re-define them in your sketch.

Once the custom board has been added to the ESP32 core, open Arduino and select \"**SparkX ESP32 LoRa Gateway**\" under the **Tools \> Board \> ESP32** Arduino menu.

## Single-Channel LoRaWAN Gateway Code

The ESP32 single-channel gateway example code is hosted by [things4u on GitHub](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0). Download it from their repository.

[GitHub: ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0 (ZIP)](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0/archive/master.zip)

This repository includes both the Arduino sketch and the libraries it depends on. Before compiling the sketch you\'ll need to extract all libraries from the repository\'s \"library\" folder into your Arduino sketchbook\'s \"libraries\" folder. For more help installing the libraries, check out the [Getting Started section](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0#getting-started) of the README.

To open the example code, open the **ESP-sc-gway.ino** file. When the IDE loads, it should include another dozen-or-so tabs \-- it\'s a hefty, but well-segmented sketch!

### Configure the Gateway Sketch

Before uploading the ESP-1ch-Gateway sketch to your board, you\'ll need to make a handful of modifications to a couple of files. Here\'s a quick overview:

#### ESP-sc-gway.h

This file is the main source of configuration for the gateway sketch. The definitions you\'ll probably have to modify are:

- Radio
  - **`_LFREQ`** \-- This sets the frequency range your radio will communicate on. Set this to either `433` (Asia), `868` (EU), or `915` (US)
  - **`_SPREADING`** \-- This sets the LoRa spread factor. `SF7`, `SF8`, `SF9`, `SF10`, `SF11`, or `SF12` can be used. Note that this will affect which devices your gateway can communicate with.
  - **`_CAD`** \-- Channel Activity Detection. If enabled (set to 1) CAD will allow the gateway to monitor messages sent at any spread factor. The tradeoff if enabled: very weak signals may not be picked up by the radio.
- Hardware
  - **`OLED`** \-- This board does not include an OLED, **set this to 0**.
  - **`_PIN_OUT`** \-- This configures the SPI and other hardware settings. **Set this to 6**, we\'ll add a custom hardware definition later.
  - **`CFG_sx1276_radio`** \-- Ensure this is defined and CFG_sx1272_radio is *not*. This configures the LoRa radio connected to the ESP32.
- The Things Network (TTN)
  - **`_TTNSERVER`** \-- The server for your LoRa router. E.g. `"router.eu.thethings.network"` or `"us-west.thethings.network"`
  - **`_TTNPORT`** \-- `1700` is the standard port for TTN
  - **`_DESCRIPTION`** \-- Customize the name of your gateway
  - **`_EMAIL`** \-- Your email address, or that of the owner of the gateway
  - **`_LAT`** and **\_`LON`** \-- GPS coordinates of your gateway
- WiFi
  - Add at least one WiFi network to the `wpas wpa[]` array, but leave the first entry blank. For example:

<!-- -->

    language:c
    wpas wpa[] = ,                          // Reserved for WiFi Manager
      
    };

There are a lot of other values which can all optionally be configured. For a complete rundown, check out the [Editing the ESP-sc-gway.h](https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0#editing-the-esp-sc-gwayh-file) part of the README.

#### loramodem.h

This file defines how the LoRa modem is configured, including which frequency channels it can use and which pins the ESP32 uses to communicate with it. Be careful modifying most of the definitions in here, but one section you will have to modify is the `_PIN_OUT` declarations.

First, find the line that says `#error "Pin Definitions _PIN_OUT must be 1(HALLARD) or 2 (COMRESULT)"` and **delete it**. Then copy and paste these lines in its place (between the `#else` and `#endif`):

    language:c
    struct pins  pins;
    #define SCK  14
    #define MISO 12
    #define MOSI 13
    #define SS  16
    #define DIO0 26

The `int freqs[]` array can be adjusted, if you want to use different subbands, but, beyond that, there\'s not much else in here we recommend modifying.

### Upload the Sketch

With your modifications made, try compiling and uploading the sketch to your ESP32. After it\'s uploaded, open up your [serial monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) and set the baud rate to **115200**. Debug messages here can be very handy, and finding your gateway\'s IP address is critical if you want to monitor the web server.

The sketch may take a long time to set up the first time through \-- it will format your SPIFFS file system and create a non-volatile configuration file. Once that\'s complete, you should see the ESP32 attempt to connect to your WiFi network, then initialize the radio.

After the ESP32 has connected, look for it to print out an IP address. Open up your computer\'s web browser and plug that into the address bar. You should be greeted by the ESP Gateway Config web portal:

[![ESP Gateway Config served by the ESP32](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/esp-gateway-config-web.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/esp-gateway-config-web.png)

*Config and log page served by the ESP32.*

This web page can be used to monitor messages coming through and what frequencies and spread factors they came in on. It can also be used to change your gateway\'s configuration on-the-fly. You can adjust the channel or spread factor, or turn CAD on/off, or even turn on simplistic frequency-hopping.

Of course, to see any messages get through you\'ll need a LoRa device (or device_s\_) set up to communicate with your gateway. Check out the next section for a quick guide on setting up a second ESP32 LoRa board as a LoRa device.

## Turning a Gateway Into a Device

If you have a pair of ESP32 gateway\'s you can use one of them as a LoRaWAN device. This section will get you set up with our preferred LoRaWAN Arduino library and a simple example sketch to get started.

### Get the Arduino-LMIC Library to Set Up a Device

If you have a pair of ESP32 Gateways and want to set one of them up as a LoRa device, we recommend using the Arduino-LMIC library. There seem to be many versions of the Arduino-LMIC library hanging around, we\'ve had good success with the library forked by mcci-catena:

[mcci-catena: arduino-lmic](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic)

To install the library, download the ZIP file from GitHub. Then use the Arduino\'s \"Add ZIP library\" feature (**Sketch \> Include Library \> Add .ZIP Library**) to import the zip file into your Arduino sketchbook.

#### Configure LMIC

Before can use an example sketch in the LMIC library, you\'ll need to configure it. To configure the library, navigate to the \"arduino-lmic\" library in your **../libraries** folder. Then go to **project_config** and open **lmic_project_config.h**.

Here you\'ll define which frequency bands your LoRa device will use. You can also turn on debugging and enable/disable a host of features with definitions in this file.

Make sure you uncomment one-and-only-one of the \"CFG\...\" declarations. If you\'re in the USA, uncomment `#define CFG_us915`. Ultimately, this frequency should match what you set in the gateway.

Below is my config file \-- I\'ve turned on debugging, because I\'m a log junkie.

    language:c
    // project-specific definitions
    //#define CFG_eu868 1
    #define CFG_us915 1
    //#define CFG_au921 1
    //#define CFG_as923 1
    // #define LMIC_COUNTRY_CODE LMIC_COUNTRY_CODE_JP   /* for as923-JP */
    //#define CFG_in866 1
    #define CFG_sx1276_radio 1

    //#define LMIC_PRINTF_TO Serial
    #define LMIC_DEBUG_LEVEL 2

    //#define DISABLE_INVERT_IQ_ON_RX

If you try to use the \"raw\" example in this library, you\'ll need to uncomment `DISABLE_INVERT_IQ_ON_RX`, otherwise keep it commented-out.

#### Modify the \"SPI.begin\" call

Just to be sure your pin definitions are correct, I recommend modifying the `SPI.begin` line in **arduino-lmic/src/hal/hal.cpp** (line 136 as of this commit) to:

    language:c
    SPI.begin(14, 12, 13, 16);

This will ensure that your SPI pins are set correctly \-- this may only be necessary if you\'re not using the custom \"SparkX ESP32 LoRa Gateway\" Arduino board.

#### Load the Single-Channel Device Example

We\'ve taken one of the examples in the Arduino-LMIC library and modified it to work more reliably with a single-channel gateway.

Click the button below to download the example. Then open up **ESP-1CH-TTN-Device-ABP.ino**:

[Download the single-channel LoRaWAN device example (ZIP)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ESP-1CH-TTN-Device-ABP-v01.zip)

\

Among the modifications in this example are the pin map between radio and ESP32 \-- set with these lines:

    language:c
    const lmic_pinmap lmic_pins = ,
    };

We\'ve also modified the enabled channels to only use a single channel with the lines below (note this modification hasn\'t yet been tested on non-US frequency bands).

    language:c
    // First disable all sub-bands
    for (int b = 0; b < 8; ++b) 
    // Then enable the channel(s) you want to use
    LMIC_enableChannel(8); // 903.9 MHz

The spread factor is set near the end of setup() with the `LMIC_setDrTxpow(DR_SF7, 14);` line. This can be replaced with `DR_SF8`, `DR_SF9`, or `DR_SF10` at the default 903.9MHz frequency.

But wait! Before uploading this example, there\'s one more modification you need to make: your LoRaWAN application, network session, and device keys! For that, and an application server, we recommend The Things Network.

## Routing to The Things Network

The final components to a LoRaWAN network are a server and application. You can set up a LoRaWAN server of your own, but, for prototyping at least, The Things Network is a great, free tool for authenticating and routing your data.

**Single-Channel Blues**

At the trade-off of being low-cost, this gateway is only capable of monitoring a single LoRa channel on a limited set of spread factors. Single-channel gateway\'s don\'t get much support from LoRaWAN platforms like [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/start/single-channel.html), as they are not, necessarily, LoRaWAN-compliant. They are, however, a great way to begin exploring the world of LoRa and LoRaWAN!

If you haven\'t already, head to [thethingsnetwork.org](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create an account. Once that\'s done, go to your **Console**.

### Create an Application

In order to create a device, you first need to create an application to house it under. In the console, click \"**Applications**\" then click \"**add application**\".

Fill out any ID and description you\'d like. The **Application EUI** will automatically be generated when you create the application. You can also pick your preferred handler for the application (e.g. ttn-handler-us-west).

[![Creating a TTN application](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-application-create.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-application-create.png)

### Create and Configure a Device

Next create a device in your application. Under the \"**Devices**\" section, click \"**register device**\".

This is again pretty simple. Fill out a unique device ID, click the \"**generate**\" button under \"**Device EUI**\" to automatically generate a EUI. Then click \"**Register**.\"

[![Creating a TTN device](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-create.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-create.png)

This example sketch only supports **ABP activation**, so you\'ll need to modify that in the device settings. In the \"Device Overview\" page, click \"Settings\". From there, under \"Activation Method\" click **ABP**. I also recommend **disabling Frame Counter Checks**. The gateway is capable of frame-counter checks, but it can get out of sync \-- especially if you have another gateway nearby.

[![Modifying TTN device settings](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-settings.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-settings.png)

Save the settings and go back to your \"**Device Overview**\" page. You should see new keys, including \"**Network Session Key**\", \"**App Session Key**\", and \"**Device Address**.\" These will need to be plugged into the device sketch and uploaded to the device.

### Update the Example Code

With your application, network session, and device keys in-hand, you\'re ready to finish configuring the ESP32 LoRa device sketch and start posting data!

On the \"**Device Overview**\" page, click the \"**code**\" symbol (`<>`) next to \"**Network Session Key**\" and \"**App Session Key**\" \-- this will make the key visible and display it as a 16-byte array. Copy each of those keys, and paste them in place of the `` place-holders. \"**Network Session Key**\" should be pasted into the `NWKSKEY` variable and \"**App Session Key**\" should be pasted into the `APPSKEY` variable.

The `DEVADDR` variable expects a single 32-bit variable, so copy the \"**Device Address**\" key as shown and paste that into the `PASTE_DEV_ADDR_HERE` placeholder.

[![Grabbing your device keys](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-keys.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-device-keys.png)

Here\'s an example of what your three constants should look like once done:

    language:c
    // LoRaWAN NwkSKey, network session key
    // This is the default Semtech key, which is used by the early prototype TTN
    // network.
    static const PROGMEM u1_t NWKSKEY[16] = ;

    // LoRaWAN AppSKey, application session key
    // This is the default Semtech key, which is used by the early prototype TTN
    // network.
    static const u1_t PROGMEM APPSKEY[16] = ;

    // LoRaWAN end-device address (DevAddr)
    static const u4_t DEVADDR = 0x01234567;

And that\'s it! Now upload the code to your ESP32 LoRa board.

### Testing the Code

After setup, the device should immediately send a \"Hello, World\" message. It\'ll continue to send a message every minute or any time the \"0\" button on the board is pressed.

To check if your gateway is receiving the message, you can either check the Serial Monitor or monitor the ESP Gateway Config page served by the gateway. Every time a message is received it should be added to the \"Message History\" table.

If messages are getting through to your gateway, click the \"**Data**\" tab on your device to check for new messages.

[![TTN device data visible](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-data.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/ttn-data.png)

The message\'s payload \-- which was encrypted between leaving the device and getting to the router \-- should be a series of hex values adding up to \"Hello, world\".

### Troubleshooting

If messages are not getting to your gateway, first make sure the **channel and spread factor** match up. Left unchanged, the device example code should be sending data out on the 903.9MHz channel at a spread factor of 7 (That\'s assuming you\'ve set the LMIC library to `CFG_us915`. If it\'s set to a European frequency spectrum, it\'ll be 868.1MHz, SF7).

You can use the gateway\'s web server to adjust these setting on the fly. Note that the channel numbers should sequentially match the `freqs` array in **loraModem.h** \-- e.g. channel 0 should be 903.9MHz (again, assuming US frequencies).

If messages are getting to your gateway, but not showing up on your TTN device console, consider changing the `_TTNSERVER` variable in \"**ESP-sc-gway.h**\". I haven\'t had success with the us-west router, but **`"router.eu.thethings.network"`** has worked perfectly (even in the US).
