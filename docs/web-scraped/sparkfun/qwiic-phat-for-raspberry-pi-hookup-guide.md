## Introduction

This Qwiic pHAT \[[v2.0](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15945) and [v1.0](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15351)\] for Raspberry Pi is based on the [Qwiic Hat](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14459). The board is the quickest and easiest way to utilize SparkFun\'s Qwiic ecosystem while still using that Raspberry Pi that you\'ve come to know and love. This Qwiic pHAT connects the I^2^C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Raspberry Pi to an array of Qwiic connectors. Since the Qwiic system allows for daisy chaining (as long as your devices are on different addresses), you can stack as many sensors as you\'d like to create a tower of sensing power!

#### Jumpers

There are built-in pull-up resistors on board. If necessary, you can [cut the traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all) to disable depending on the number of boards connected to the I^2^C bus.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_V3.0_Raspberry_Pi_Pull-Up_Resistor_Jumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_V3.0_Raspberry_Pi_Pull-Up_Resistor_Jumpers.jpg)

#### Board Dimensions

The board is about 65.00mm x 30.50mm. There are six mounting holes on the board. Two pairs of mounting holes were optimized to easily mount Qwiic devices that have the standard 1.0\"x1.0\" sized board.

## Hardware Assembly

To get started with your Qwiic pHAT, simply plug it into the headers on the Raspberry Pi with the letters facing you. We\'ll use the Qwiic pHAT v1.0 in the following images to connect a Qwiic device.

[![Qwiic pHat Being Inserted into Raspberry Pi](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHat_Stacking_Raspberry_Pi_.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHat_Stacking_Raspberry_Pi_.jpg)

Once the pHAT is plugged in, you can start plugging in any Qwiic enabled sensors.

[![Qwiic pHat Inserted on Raspberry Pi and Connected to a Qwiic Sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHat_Raspberry_Pi_Sensor.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHat_Raspberry_Pi_Sensor.jpg)

**Note:** The Qwiic pHat is also compatible with single board computers (like the [NVIDIA Jetson Nano](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15297) or the [Google Coral](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15318)) that utilize the 40-pin Raspberry Pi header footprint.

### Stackable Headers

When placing a Raspberry Pi and the pHat in an enclosure (like the Pi Tin), we noticed that the pHAT was not fully inserted in Pi\'s header pins. You will need an [additional pair of stackable headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14311) for a secure connection depending on your enclosure. Otherwise, the original [Qwiic HAT](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14459) would be better if you need to using the boards in an enclosure.

[![Stackable Headers to Extend the HAT on a Raspberry Pi](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHAT_V2_0_Stackable_Header_Extension.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/0/6/Qwiic_pHAT_V2_0_Stackable_Header_Extension.jpg)

## Getting an OS

We recommend checking out the Raspberry Pi 4 Hookup Guide to [install the operating system](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-4-kit-hookup-guide#getting-an-os) to flash the image to your microSD card for detailed instructions.

If you\'re starting from scratch with a blank microSD card, you\'ll want to install Raspbian. If you\'ve already got a working Raspbian system, skip ahead to the next section. Be patient --- each of these steps can take a while depending on the speed of your microSD card.

1.  **Download an Image** --- Download your favorite Linux distribution. For beginners, we recommend getting [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) image.
2.  **Flashing the Image** --- Follow the instructions from the [Raspberry Pi 4 Kit Hookup Guide to flash your microSD card](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-4-kit-hookup-guide/getting-an-os). You can also follow the official Raspberry Pi [installation instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/).

## Configuring the Pi

The peripherals are not turned on by default. For those using Qwiic-enabled devices, you will want to enable I2C port. There are two methods to adjust the settings. This is outlined in our [Raspberry Pi I2C tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-spi-and-i2c-tutorial).

### Raspberry Pi SPI and I2C Tutorial 

October 29, 2015

Learn how to use serial I2C and SPI buses on your Raspberry Pi using the wiringPi I/O library for C/C++ and spidev/smbus for Python.

We\'ve included the following instructions from the tutorial. To enable it, follow the steps below.

#### Raspberry Pi Configuration [via Desktop GUI]

You can use the Desktop GUI by heading to the **Pi Start Menu** \> **Preferences** \> **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.

We recommend restarting your Pi to ensure that the changes to take effect. Click on the **Pi Start Menu** \> **Preferences** \> **Shutdown**. Since we just need to restart, click on the **Restart** button.

#### raspi-config Tool [via Terminal]

Again, we can use `raspi-config` to enable it.

1.  Run `sudo raspi-config`.
2.  Use the down arrow to select `5 Interfacing Options`
3.  Arrow down to `P5 I2C`.
4.  Select `yes` when it asks you to enable I2C
5.  Also select `yes` if it asks about automatically loading the kernel module.
6.  Use the right arrow to select the `<Finish>` button.
7.  Select `yes` when it asks to reboot.

*Raspi-config for I2C*

The system will reboot. When it comes back up, log in and enter the following command

    language:bash
    ls /dev/*i2c*

The Pi should respond with

    language:bash
    /dev/i2c-1

Which represents the user-mode I2C interface.

## Scanning for I2C Devices

The best place to start would be to scan for an I^2^C device on the bus.

### Configuration

Like the SPI peripheral, I2C is not turned on by default. Again, we can use `raspi-config` to enable it.

1.  Run `sudo raspi-config`.
2.  Use the down arrow to select `5 Interfacing Options`
3.  Arrow down to `P5 I2C`.
4.  Select `yes` when it asks you to enable I2C
5.  Select `OK` and then `Finish`

Once you return to terminal, enter this command:

    language:bash
    ls /dev/*i2c*

The Pi should respond with:

    language:bash
    /dev/i2c-1

Which represents the user-mode I2C interface.

### Utilities

There is a set of command-line utility programs that can help get an I^2^C interface working. You can get them with the apt package manager. Enter the following command.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

In particular, the `i2cdetect` program will probe all the addresses on a bus, and report whether any devices are present. Enter the following command in the command line. The `-y` flag will disable interactive mode so that you do not have to wait for confirmation. The `1` indicates that we are scanning for I^2^C devices on I^2^C bus 1 (e.g. i2c-1).

    language:bash
    i2cdetect -y 1

You will get an output from your Raspberry Pi similar to the output below.

    language:bash
    pi@raspberrypi:~/$ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: 60 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

This map indicates that there is a peripheral at address **0x60**. Your address may vary depending on what is connected to the I^2^C bus. For advanced users, you can try to read and write its registers using the `i2cget`, `i2cset` and `i2cdump` commands.
