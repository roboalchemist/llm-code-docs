## Lite Hardware Overview

8BitDo\'s Lite Controller is a D-pad extravaganza. Who needs extra D-pads? I mean, who doesn\'t? They do have the \"push button\" functionality of the joystick but you have to press all four direction buttons down at the same time and it\'s hit or miss. That said, this controller is great for my kiddos - it extremely low profile, so it fits better into their smaller hands and thus it\'s easier for them to maneuver on. Let\'s have a look at some of the specs:

- **Compatibility:** Windows, Steam, Switch
- **Dimension / Weight:** 120*66.2*16.2mm / 84g
- **Special Features:**
  - Dual D-pads
  - Mode switch
  - Customizable turbo functionality ( X-input )
- **Connectivity:**
  - Wireless Bluetooth®
  - USB-C
- **Battery Type / Battery Life:**
  - 480mAh Li-on battery, rechargeable
  - 18 play hours with 1-2 hour charging time
- **Includes:**
  - 8BitDo Lite Bluetooth gamepad
  - USB cable
  - Instruction manual

[![Diagram of 8bitdo Lite buttons](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/LiteDiagram.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/LiteDiagram.png)

### Battery and Charging

The Lite Controller comes with a standard USB-C cable and takes a couple hours to charge up. 8BitDo\'s documentation boasts about 18 hours of play once charged and while I haven\'t done any actual benchmarking on that, I will say that my kids have been playing on this thing for a week and I have yet to need to charge it. So it ain\'t too shabby.

### Cons

All this low profile and portability comes at a bit of a cost. The 8BitDo Lite controller does not have an accelerometer or rumble feature, and there is no NFC reader. But! If you\'re a retro gamer who loves old school Zelda, Mario, etc, this is the controller for you.

## Lite Hardware Pairing

### Switch

The 8BitDo Lite is designed to work with the Nintendo Switch Lite. In fact, the colors of these controllers match the yellow and turquoise versions of the Switch Lite. If you\'re not color coordinated, do you even game, bro?

Let\'s pair. From your main screen, navigate to \"Controllers\".

[![Controllers option from the main screen of the switch](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17266_Controllers_MainScreen.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17266_Controllers_MainScreen.jpg)

Select Change Grip/Order:

### Battery and Charging

Like all of 8BitDo\'s controllers, this one uses a Universal USB-C and charges up in a couple of hours. 8BitDo mentions that a single charge can play for 16 hours, but I haven\'t tested that out. Uh\... I\'ll do that now. BRB\...

## SN30 Pro Hardware Pairing

### Switch

Like it\'s Lite brethren, the 8BitDo SN30 Pro is designed to work with the Nintendo Switch system. And just as similarly, the pairing process is fairly straightforward.

From your main screen, navigate to \"Controllers\".

[![Nintendo Main Screen](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_MainScreen.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_MainScreen.jpg)

Select Change Grip/Order like so:

[![Change Grip Order screen](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_ChangeGripOrder.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_ChangeGripOrder.jpg)

On the SN30 Pro Controller, press **Y** and **Start** simultaneously.

[![The Y button and the start button are highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_HighlightedYandStart.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_HighlightedYandStart.jpg)

### Raspberry Pi

It isn\'t the goal of this tutorial to get you set up with a RetroPie gaming system. If you aren\'t already up and running, the documentation at [RetroPie\'s First Installation Webpage](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/First-Installation/) is a great start.

Here are all the items I\'ve used here:

That said, I did do a few mods after setup. At a broad stroke, here\'s where I went:

- Updated the firmware on my Pro Controller
- [Updated my RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Updating-RetroPie/)
- [Downloaded Game ROMs](https://www.retrostic.com/roms)
- [Transferred my game ROMs](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Transferring-Roms/)
- Reboot!

#### Initial Setup

For your intial setup of the SN30 Pro Controller, you\'ll wanna plug that bad boy in. I know, we want to go wireless. This is just the first go around.

- Using the provided cable, plug the SN30 Pro into your RetriPie and then boot the Pi. You should see a Welcome screen like this:

[![Welcome screen](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/welcome_screen.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/welcome_screen.png)

- Press and hold down the \"A\" button on your Controller. The Welcome Screen should recognize your controller and show you the following:

[![Welcome screen with SN30 pro recognized](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/welcome_screen_sn30.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/welcome_screen_sn30.png)

- Configure your SN30 Pro Controller as prompted. Here\'s mine in progress:

[![Configuring SN30](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/configuring_sn30_startingsome.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/configuring_sn30_startingsome.png)

Once you are finished, you should be taken to the RetroPie main window! WOOOOO!

#### Bluetooth

The easiest way to get gaming is to just leave your controller plugged in. But NO! We want to walk across the room to do something vital while continuing to play our game on the RetroPie! Let\'s take advantage of that fancy Bluetooth capability, shall we?

- To start out, make sure you have a keyboard or other controller plugged in and ready to control and push buttons.
- Get yourself to your RetroPie Main Screen and select \"Bluetooth\"

[![RetroPie Main Screen](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/retropie_screen_main.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/retropie_screen_main.png)

- Once you select Bluetooth, you\'ll see the following show up:

[![RetroPie Bluetooth Screen ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/bluetooth_screen_main.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/bluetooth_screen_main.png)

- On your SN30 Pro controller, hold down X and Start at the same time.

[![X and Start Buton highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_HighlightedXandStart.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_HighlightedXandStart.jpg)

- Once you see the LED blinking at the bottom, push the \"Pair\" button on the top.

[![Pair button highlighted at the top](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_PairButtonOnly.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/17264_PairButtonOnly.jpg)

- If all goes well, you should have some lovely mac addresses and the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro!

[![Mac Address for 8BitDo SN30 Pro tutorial](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/found_sn30.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/found_sn30.png)

- Select \"OK\" and then *1 DisplayYesNo*.

[![Display Yes No hightlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/found_sn30_yesno.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/4/2/8/found_sn30_yesno.png)

- With any luck, you\'ll get a happily paired and functional 8Bitdo SN30 controller that you can now wander around the living room with!

### Troubleshooting

I had some shenanigans happening with Bluetooth for a bit. I finally tracked it down to a mismatch between some updated vs non-updated dependencies, but I suggest that if you find that you cannot pair, verify the version of your controller\'s firmware, update all modules on your RetroPie, and if all else fails, uninstall and reinstall RetroPie (make sure you back up your ROMS!!!).
