## Introduction to the Micro:Climate Kit

We have seen a huge amount of excitement from hobbyists, students and scientists around building a DIY weather station to track what is going on around us on Planet Earth on a daily basis.

We have seen just as much excitement around the BBC\'s newly released micro:bit, which made its debut in the United Kingdom and is now available in the United States through SparkFun.

And then it dawned on us\...why not combine the two? So, here it is: a weather station kit that is built on top of the inexpensive, easy-to-use micro:bit and Microsoft MakeCode. We have also written seven experiments that walk you through how to use each and every component of the kit and how to use them with the micro:bit and Microsoft MakeCode. For more information about the kit, check out the videos below.

### What\'s Included in the Kit?

### How to Use This Guide

Please note that this guide is designed to get you started with the [weather:bit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14214) board and the [SparkFun micro:climate kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14217) in a simple, straightforward way. We demonstrate each component\'s functionality and the corresponding code to make it work.

While you explore this guide, we urge you to take your time and tinker with the sensors, code and ideas shared to build something tailored to your application. Our goal is to get you enough information and know-how to make you dangerous and then release you into the wild, weather station in hand, to do whatever *you* do with a weather station.

Be sure to share your projects with us via Twitter or Facebook! We are excited to see you get creative and Start Something!
