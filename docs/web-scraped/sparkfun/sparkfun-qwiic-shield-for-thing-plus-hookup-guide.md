## Introduction

The [SparkFun Qwiic Shield for Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16790) provides an easy-to-assemble way to add the [SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) to any development board with the Thing Plus Footprint. This shield is also compatible with the Feather Footprint so you can add Qwiic functionality to any development board that uses the Thing Plus or Feather Footprints! It connects the I^2^C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Thing Plus to four SparkFun Qwiic connectors. The Qwiic ecosystem allows for easy daisy chaining so, as long as your devices are on different addresses, you can connect as many Qwiic devices as you\'d like.

### Required Tools

You will need a [soldering iron](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/49), solder, and general soldering accessories to solder the header pins to the Qwiic shields:

## Hardware Overview

### Qwiic Connectors

The Qwiic Shield for Thing Plus has four Qwiic connectors on it. The two on the edges are the standard horizontal connectors and the two in the middle are vertical connectors.

[![Image highlighting Qwiic Connectors](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_Qwiic.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_Qwiic.jpg)

### I^2^C Jumper

This jumper is a little different than our normal I^2^C pull up jumpers as it is **open** by default. The jumper only needs to be closed if your peripheral device does **not** have pull up resistors. Essentially all SparkFun I^2^C breakouts come with pull up resistors on them so if you are using a Qwiic I^2^C device or another SparkFun I^2^C device, you can most likely leave it open. When closed, the SDA and SCL lines are pulled to **3.3V** by **4.7K** resistors. If you have never worked with solder jumpers before, check out [this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces) for some tips and tricks for working with them.

[![Image higlighting I2C Jumper](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_I2C.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_I2C.jpg)

### Board Dimensions

The shield measures 2.00in x 0.90in (50.8mm x 22.86mm) and has four mounting holes that fit a [4-40 screw](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10453).

[![Dimensional Drawing for Qwiic Shield for Thing Plus](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/7/Qwiic_Shield_Thing_Plus_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Assembly

All you need to get started using the Qwiic Shield for Thing Plus is to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) the included stackable headers or whichever headers you choose to the shield and, if necessary, to your Thing Plus (or compatible board). If you have never worked with an Arduino Shield before or need some tips, our [Arduino Shields Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/arduino-shields#installing-headers-preparation) provides detailed instructions on how to assemble and use them.

Once you have soldered headers to your shield and connected it to your Thing Plus, it\'s time to start connecting Qwiic devices! Below you can see the Qwiic Shield connected to a [SparkFun Thing Plus - SAMD51](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14713) using the [Feather Stackable Header Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15187) included with the shield along with a couple of Qwiic Devices chained to it.
