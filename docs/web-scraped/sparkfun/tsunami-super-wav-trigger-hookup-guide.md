## Introduction

**NOTE:** This guide is for the [Tsunami Super WAV Trigger **[(Qwiic)]**](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18159). For the previous version of this board, the [Tsunami Super WAV Trigger](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13810) (without a [Qwiic connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)), please refer to the [original Tsunami hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/622).

**NOTE:** This can be a relatively complex and overwhelming product for novice users, due to the numerous configuration options that make it so versatile. Novice users, may want to consider the [WAV Trigger](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13660) or [MP3 Trigger](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13720) first.

### Required Materials

The Qwiic Tsunami does need a few additional items, including a **pair of** *(corded)* **headphones**, for users to get started with this tutorial. You may already have a few of these items, including the required USB-C cable, so feel free to modify your cart based on your needs.

**Note:** For the best results, we recommend **Class 10** SD cards with a **FAT16** or **FAT32** file system format and a 32kB file allocation size. We recommend avoiding:

- The [1GB SparkX SD Card](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15107), from our catalog, since it isn\'t a Class 10 card and can lead to reliability issues.
- SD Cards with a capacity larger than 32GB, since it can be difficult to convert them to the **FAT16** or **FAT32** file system format with a 32kB file allocation size.

For more information on compatible SD cards, please check out the [Robertsonics website](http://robertsonics.com/microsd-cards-for-audio/).

**[Audio Component Options]**

**Note:** For the best results, we recommend connecting the audio output channels from the Qwiic Tsunami to an active amplifier when speakers are used. Otherwise, when speakers are connected directly to the Qwiic Tsunami, without boosting the signal power, users will notice a significant decrease in sound quality of the audio playback.

*\*Users can connect the audio output channels from any Tsunami board directly to headphones.*

Depending on how user want to configure their audio system, some of these audio components might be of interest:
