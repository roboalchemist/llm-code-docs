## Introduction

The [APA102C addressable LEDs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14863) employ a 2-wire communication protocol consisting of a clock and data line. While this requires one more wire than standard WS2812 addressable LEDs, the advantage is that the communication with the LEDs have a faster data and refresh rates (great for persistence of vision (a.k.a. POV) projects). They are not as strict with timing compared to the WS2812\'s.

### Required Materials

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following materials. You may not need everything though depending on what you have. Add it to your cart, read through the guide, and adjust the cart as necessary.

#### APA102-Based LED Board or Strip

Stating the obvious: you\'ll need a APA102-based board or strip. The more the merrier! In the example hookup, we\'ll be using a 1M LED strip, but the example should be adaptable to the other APA102-based products. Grab however many you think you\'ll need for your project, regardless of how many you have, it\'s not enough.

#### Microcontroller or Single Board Computer?

To get started, you\'re going to need a microcontroller or a single board computer. Something that can send the series of 1\'s and 0\'s used to control the LEDs. Our go-to is the classic Arduino Uno with the ATmega328P, but [any Arduino board that is supported](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#supported-platforms) with the library should do. A [Teensy, ESP8266, ESP32,](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#supported-platforms) or [Raspberry Pi](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lumenati-hookup-guide#example-using-a-raspberry-pi-3) can work as well but for the scope of this tutorial, we will be using a 5V Arduino populated with an ATmega328P, the SparkFun RedBoard Qwiic.

[![Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/140-140/assets/parts/6/5/3/9/11113-01b.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/arduino-pro-mini-328-5v-16mhz.html)

#### Logic Level

The [APA102C addressable LEDs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14863) operate natively with 5V logic, so it will save you trouble to choose a controller that can give you 0-5V, but it can be made to work with 3.3V logic with the use of a level translator. If you are using a 5V microcontroller, you will not need the following.

#### Power Supply

You will also need a 5V power supply to run your controller and new lights. Each APA102C can draw as much as 60mA when red, green and blue are all full-on, so you\'ll want to have something a little beefy. For testing purposes (assuming that you do not turn all the LEDs fully on), you can use a computer\'s USB port and cable. A wall adapter capable of 2.5A should be plenty for our demonstration if you are placing it in an installation. If you\'ve got a bigger project in mind, check out the Mean Well 5V/20A supply.

#### Wires

You\'ll also need some **way to connect** the boards and an Arduino. If you are using a breakout board or pieces of the LED strip, you could use a combination of jumper wires (such as [M/M](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8431) or [M/F](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9140)) and breadboard ([solderless](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11317) or [solderable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12070)). Or you could just go with a few pieces of [hookup wire](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11375) or [4-pin JST-SM pigtail connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14576).

## APA102 Hardware Overview

The APA102-based LED is much more than meets the eye. It may look like a common 5050-sized (5x5mm) LED, but there\'s actually an integrated circuit embedded inside there too. If you look really hard, you can see the tiny black chip hidden in there, along with minuscule gold wires connecting the chip to the LED. Below is a close up of an APA102.

[![apa102](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/1/3/1/3/8/14863-SMD_LED_-_RGB_APA102C-5050__Pack_of_10_-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/3/1/3/8/14863-SMD_LED_-_RGB_APA102C-5050__Pack_of_10_-02.jpg)

*Pretty nifty view at the guts of the APA102.*

### Data Transmission Interface

**Note:** This stuff is ugly, and not critical to understand if you just want to use the APA102. (That\'s what libraries are for, right?!) It\'s interesting to talk about.

The communication interface between a microcontroller and the APA102 is not as strict WS2812\'s timing since it uses a 2-wire communication protocol, which consists of a clock and data line. Basically a simplified SPI interface without a slave pin.

[![APA102 Data and Clock Transmission](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/APA102C_clock_data.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/APA102C_clock_data.jpg)

*APA102 Timing Diagram from the Datasheet*

The data frame consists of a start frame, data field for the LEDs, and an end frame. The data field consists of a frame for each LED attached to the strand. Each LED frame starts with three 1\'s , 5 bits for brightness, 8 bits for blue, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for red. The larger the value of a specific color is, the brighter it will be. If every color is set to 0, the LED will be off. If every color is set to max \-- 255 \-- the LED will be as bright and white as can be.

[![APA102 Data Frame](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/APA102C_data_format_protocol.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/APA102C_data_format_protocol.jpg)

*APA102 Data Frame from the Datasheet*

**Note:** For more on the specifics, check out this post from Tim where he investigates the frame using a logic analyzer.\
\

[Tim\'s Blog: Undertstanding the APA102 \"Superled\"](https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/11/30/understanding-the-apa102-superled/)

With the added clock line, you can use it with both a real-time processor (i.e. an Arduino) and microprocessor (i.e. Raspberry Pi). You will just need to ensure that you are using a logic level converter for 3.3V systems and make sure there is APA102 support for your architecture.

## LuMini

The LuMini is a miniaturized version of the Lumenati LEDs. The LuMini uses the APA102-2020 size for tight pixel densities. While they have a higher resolution, the tradeoff is there is a limitation in how bright they can be turned on. Having a high brightness can result in [damage to the LED and PCB due the ability to dissipate heat with the small package](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lumini-8x8-matrix-hookup-guide#heat_dissipation).

## Addressable LED Strips

If you need an abundance of WS2812 LEDs in a slick, pre-assembled form factor these addressable LED strips might be for you.

[![1M APA102 Bare LED Strip](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/1/1/8/0/8/14015-01.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/1/8/0/8/14015-01.jpg)

The APA102 addressable LED strips come in a few flavors, which vary by size and sealant. You can get them in either 1m or 5m lengths, or high density. For each length the strip, they can be either covered by a waterproof sealant or left bare.

### Connecting to the Strips

**Heads up!** Depending on the manufacturer, the color wires can vary. Additionally, the female housing may be connected to the output side and vice versa. Just make sure to follow the wires to the LED strip\'s pad to ensure that they are properly connected.

Each end of the LED strip is terminated with a set of four colored wires: red, blue, green, and yellow. Two wires are for power, one wire for clock, and another wire transmits data either into or out of the strip:

  Wire Color   Function      Notes for the APA102
  ------------ ------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Red          Vcc           APA102 power supply. Should be a **regulated** supply **between 5V and 5.5V**.
  Blue         Clock         Clock
  Green        Data In/Out   Serial data in/out. Look at arrows and labels on strip to check which it is.
  Yellow       GND           Ground. 0V.

Each of the wire pigtails are terminated by a four-pin JST SM connector, which you can use to connect **string strips together**. Typically, the addressable LEDs use a polarized JST SM connector with the male housing receptacle with (female pin sockets) connected to the DI side as shown with the connector on the left side of the image. The female housing receptacle (with male pins) coming connected to the DO side as shown with the connector on the right side of the image.

For the first strip in a string, you can either connect to a mating connector, or cut and strip the wires, and connect them to your controlling device. To reuse the rest of the LED strip, check out the LED strip pigtail connector to easily connect the cut strips:

## Hardware Hookup

The great thing about these LEDs is they\'re super easy to chain together. Plus just two pins from your microcontroller is required to control an entire strip of LEDs. In this example, we\'ll control one 1M LED strip, but you should be safe to increase that ten-fold or even more.

### Solder/Wire Something

The first assembly step for each of these products is creating a reliable, electrical connection from the LED to your control board. For a secure connection, you\'ll need to solder pigtail wires to a protoboard/shield to connect if you decide to place them into a project with a lot of movement or strip if you cut them into strands. You can also strip and splice some hookup wire to connect the LED strips.

### Working with Wire 

February 8, 2013

How to strip, crimp, and work with wire.

### Connecting to an Arduino

This hookup is fairly straightforward. You can power the breakout board(s) with USB power and the Arduino\'s **5V** and **GND** pins. Then all you need is to send data and clock signal to the LED. Let\'s go with pin **11** and **13**, respectively. We recommend using a hardware pins for your microcontroller for best performance. Simply connect four M/F jumper wires to the RedBoard Qwiic.

[![Arduino APA102 Hookup](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/Arduino_APA102_RGB_LED_Fritzing_bb.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/Arduino_APA102_RGB_LED_Fritzing_bb.jpg)

### Protect Your APA102\'s!

In addition to the hookup above, we recommend adding a capacitor as close as possible to your addressable LEDs like the WS2812\'s to help you get the most out of your APA102-based devices for long strips. Below is an example with an addressable LED strip and separate power supply via the barrel jack connector. Read below for more information on suggested values!

[![Arduino APA102 Hookup Using Long Strips with Capacitor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/Arduino_APA102_RGB_LED_Capacitor_Fritzing_bb.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/0/0/1/Arduino_APA102_RGB_LED_Capacitor_Fritzing_bb.jpg)

#### Add a Big Smoothing Capacitor

Before connecting the APA102 to a power source, connect a big capacitor from power to ground. A cap between [100µF](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/96) and [1000µF](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8982) should be good.

[![1000uF cap](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/300-300/assets/parts/2/3/0/8/08982-03-L.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8982)

This cap will help to smooth out your power supply. The current draw of a APA102 can vary wildly, and as current draw grows and shrinks it\'ll be up to your power source to compensate. The cap will act as a \"power reservoir\" to store energy in case the supply dips.

Try to place this cap **as close to your APA102 as possible** by placing it in parallel to the Vcc and GND pins.

#### Keep Wires Short!

Wires don\'t conduct perfectly. They\'ll inevitably induce some voltage loss, especially when they\'re really long. Try to keep wires between your power supply, Arduino, and APA102 as short as possible to minimize this loss.

## Arduino Library Overview

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

For the scope of this tutorial, we\'ll be using the FastLED library. The library will help you control the APA102\'s and provides example code to get the most our of your project. You can obtain these libraries through the Arduino Library Manager by searching for **FastLED**. The library also [supports other LED chipsets](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference). The second option is to download the ZIP file below from its GitHub repository to manually install it.

[FastLED Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/archive/master.zip)

### Parameters

When using the FastLED library, [certain parameters](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Basic-usage) need to be adjusted at a minimum to be compatible with the chipset. Depending on the example, the `DATA_PIN` can be referred to as `LED_PIN`. You may need to define the `CLOCK_PIN` or it can also be referred to as `CLK_PIN`. We recommend using a dedicated hardware SPI for best performance. However, if you decide to use a different pin, the library [can be reconfigured to bit bang the pins](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/SPI-Hardware-or-Bit-banging). The `LED_TYPE` would be defined as the `APA102` chipset. There are 60 LEDs per LED strip so `NUM_LEDs` needs to be set to `60`. The `COLOR_ORDER` is `BGR`.

Once these parameters are set, you will need to initialize the LED strip configuration using `.addLEDs<>()` in the `setup()` function. Depending on the brightness and complexity of the animation, there are several methods to adjust the quality and appearance of the project like the color temperature, dither mode, refresh rate, FPS, or color correction. Below are two methods of setting up the LED strip for the APA102 configuration that we\'ll be using in this tutorial.

    language:c
    FastLED.addLeds<APA102, DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, BGR>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
    FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE,DATA_PIN,CLK_PIN,COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);

**Warning:** There is also a setting to adjust the global brightness using the FastLED Library. If you are using the smaller APA102-2020 package, we recommend setting the brightness using the `FastLED.setBrightness()` function to `32` in the `setup()` to avoid damaging the LEDs.

### Microcontroller

The library is supported on a variety of Arduino compatible platforms. For a list of supported AVR or ARM microcontrollers, check out the list on the library\'s **README.md**.

[FastLED Library Supported Architectures](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#supported-platforms)

## Arduino Example

The FastLED library includes a few examples for a variety of addressable LED chipsets to get started. The following examples will demonstrate how to modify the example to use with the APA102 chipset. For more information, check out the [FastLED Library\'s wiki](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference#other-stuff).

[FastLED Library Wiki: Chipset Reference](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference#other-stuff)

### FastLED Blink Modification

For simplicity, let\'s blink one LED from the APA102 LED strip using the FastLED\'s **Blink.ino** example by following the steps listed below. After installing the library, head to **File** \> **Examples** \> **FastLED** \> **Blink** to open the example in Arduino.

- First, adjust the number of LEDs (`NUM_LEDs`) in the strip to `60`.
- Change the `DATA_PIN` to pin `11`.
- Change `CLOCK_PIN` to `13`.
- In the `setup()`,
  - Comment out a line by adding `//` in front of `FastLED.addLeds<NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN>(leds, NUM_LEDS);`.
  - Uncomment out the LED arrangement for the `APA102` chipset by removing the `//` before `FastLED.addLeds<APA102, DATA_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, RGB>(leds, NUM_LEDS);`.
- Modify the color order by changing `RGB` to `BGR`.

Once the code is adjusted, select your board and COM port. Then upload the code to blink the first LED of the strand! After uploading, you should see the first LED blink with red.

Now that you have the LED blinking red, try copying and pasting the code in the `loop()` function two more times to see if you can blink a green and blue. This is useful to test if your APA102 is outputting the correct color before mixing the colors.

Or copy and paste the modified example in an Arduino sketch. Select the COM port and board, and hit the upload button.

    language:c
    #include <FastLED.h>

    // How many leds in your strip?
    #define NUM_LEDS 60

    // For led chips like Neopixels, which have a data line, ground, and power, you just
    // need to define DATA_PIN.  For led chipsets that are SPI based (four wires - data, clock,
    // ground, and power), like the LPD8806 define both DATA_PIN and CLOCK_PIN
    #define DATA_PIN 11
    #define CLOCK_PIN 13

    // Define the array of leds
    CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

    void setup() 

    void loop() 

There\'s a [variety of pre-defined colors in the FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/keywords.txt#L147) that you can use. Try looking at the **keywords.txt** to try out the [different colors](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Pixel-reference#predefined-colors-list). Then try adjusting the array number to turn on different LEDs on the strip.

[FastLED Library: keywords.txt](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/keywords.txt#L147)

### Color Palette Modification

There are a few demos with different animations in the library. Let\'s try looking at the color palette demo. The color palette cycles the LED strip with few different palettes. The first is a rainbow, rainbow stripes, purple and green stripes, random, white stripes, cloud-like colors, and red/white/blue stripes. There is an option to blend the LED animation for the palettes depending on your preference and project. Head to **File** \> **Examples** \> **FastLED** \> **ColorPalette** to open the example in Arduino.

- First, comment out a line by adding `//` in front of `#define LED_PIN 5`.
- We\'ll define that pin by adding the following line `#define DATA_PIN 11`.
- We\'ll add an additional pin for the clock by adding the following line `#define CLK_PIN 13`.
- Adjust the number of LEDs (`NUM_LEDS`) to `60`.
- Change the `LED_TYPE` to pin `APA102`.
- Modify the color order by changing `GRB` to `BGR`.
- In the `setup()`,
  - Comment out a line by adding `//` in front of `FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection( TypicalLEDStrip );`.
  - Add the LED arrangement for the `APA102` chipset by adding the following line `FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE,DATA_PIN,CLK_PIN,COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);`.

Or copy and paste the modified example in an Arduino sketch. Or copy and paste the modified example in an Arduino sketch. Select the COM port and board, and hit the upload button.

    language:c
       #include <FastLED.h>

    //#define LED_PIN     5 // redefined in the next line
    #define DATA_PIN     11
    #define CLK_PIN     13
    #define NUM_LEDS    60
    #define BRIGHTNESS  64
    #define LED_TYPE    APA102
    #define COLOR_ORDER BGR
    CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

    #define UPDATES_PER_SECOND 100

    // This example shows several ways to set up and use 'palettes' of colors
    // with FastLED.
    //
    // These compact palettes provide an easy way to re-colorize your
    // animation on the fly, quickly, easily, and with low overhead.
    //
    // USING palettes is MUCH simpler in practice than in theory, so first just
    // run this sketch, and watch the pretty lights as you then read through
    // the code.  Although this sketch has eight (or more) different color schemes,
    // the entire sketch compiles down to about 6.5K on AVR.
    //
    // FastLED provides a few pre-configured color palettes, and makes it
    // extremely easy to make up your own color schemes with palettes.
    //
    // Some notes on the more abstract 'theory and practice' of
    // FastLED compact palettes are at the bottom of this file.

    CRGBPalette16 currentPalette;
    TBlendType    currentBlending;

    extern CRGBPalette16 myRedWhiteBluePalette;
    extern const TProgmemPalette16 myRedWhiteBluePalette_p PROGMEM;

    void setup() 

    void loop()
    

    void FillLEDsFromPaletteColors( uint8_t colorIndex)
    
    }

    // There are several different palettes of colors demonstrated here.
    //
    // FastLED provides several 'preset' palettes: RainbowColors_p, RainbowStripeColors_p,
    // OceanColors_p, CloudColors_p, LavaColors_p, ForestColors_p, and PartyColors_p.
    //
    // Additionally, you can manually define your own color palettes, or you can write
    // code that creates color palettes on the fly.  All are shown here.

    void ChangePalettePeriodically()
    
            if( secondHand == 10)  
            if( secondHand == 15)  
            if( secondHand == 20)  
            if( secondHand == 25)  
            if( secondHand == 30)  
            if( secondHand == 35)  
            if( secondHand == 40)  
            if( secondHand == 45)  
            if( secondHand == 50)  
            if( secondHand == 55)  
        }
    }

    // This function fills the palette with totally random colors.
    void SetupTotallyRandomPalette()
    
    }

    // This function sets up a palette of black and white stripes,
    // using code.  Since the palette is effectively an array of
    // sixteen CRGB colors, the various fill_* functions can be used
    // to set them up.
    void SetupBlackAndWhiteStripedPalette()
    

    // This function sets up a palette of purple and green stripes.
    void SetupPurpleAndGreenPalette()
    

    // This example shows how to set up a static color palette
    // which is stored in PROGMEM (flash), which is almost always more
    // plentiful than RAM.  A static PROGMEM palette like this
    // takes up 64 bytes of flash.
    const TProgmemPalette16 myRedWhiteBluePalette_p PROGMEM =
    ;

    // Additional notes on FastLED compact palettes:
    //
    // Normally, in computer graphics, the palette (or "color lookup table")
    // has 256 entries, each containing a specific 24-bit RGB color.  You can then
    // index into the color palette using a simple 8-bit (one byte) value.
    // A 256-entry color palette takes up 768 bytes of RAM, which on Arduino
    // is quite possibly "too many" bytes.
    //
    // FastLED does offer traditional 256-element palettes, for setups that
    // can afford the 768-byte cost in RAM.
    //
    // However, FastLED also offers a compact alternative.  FastLED offers
    // palettes that store 16 distinct entries, but can be accessed AS IF
    // they actually have 256 entries; this is accomplished by interpolating
    // between the 16 explicit entries to create fifteen intermediate palette
    // entries between each pair.
    //
    // So for example, if you set the first two explicit entries of a compact 
    // palette to Green (0,255,0) and Blue (0,0,255), and then retrieved 
    // the first sixteen entries from the virtual palette (of 256), you'd get
    // Green, followed by a smooth gradient from green-to-blue, and then Blue.

You should see the sequence of colors animating along the strip. There\'s a few more \"preset\" palettes defined in the library that you can use. Try looking at the **colorpalettes.cpp** for more and replacing `ChangePalettePeriodically()`\'s `currentPalette` value to the preset of your choice. You can also manually define your own palette of your choice depending on your project based on the pre-define colors in the **keywords.txt** similar to the ones defined after the `loop()` function.

[FastLED Library: colorpalettes.cpp](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/colorpalettes.cpp)

### Demo Reel Modification

Another example that we will look at is the Demo Reel. Head to **File** \> **Examples** \> **FastLED** \> **DemoReel100** to open the example in Arduino.

- First, adjust the `DATA_PIN` to pin `11`.
- Uncomment the `CLK_PIN` by removing the `//` and defining it as pin `13`.
- Change the `LED_TYPE` to pin `APA102`.
- Modify the color order (`COLOR_ORDER`) by changing `GRB` to `BGR`.
- Adjust the number of LEDs (`NUM_LEDS`) to 60.
- In the `setup()`,
  - Comment out a line by adding `//` in front of `FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE,DATA_PIN,COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);`.
  - Add the LED arrangement for the `APA102` chipset by removing the `//` in front of `FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE,DATA_PIN,CLK_PIN,COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS).setCorrection(TypicalLEDStrip);`.
