## Hardware Overview

The power supply\'s pinout is shown below. The connector\'s molding should have numbers associated with the output to help identify the connection. You will also notice that the connector is polarized with the two chamfered corners.

### Pinout Table

[] **Warning!** Depending on the manufacturer, the [colors of the wires inside the sheath may vary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex_connector). Make sure to test the connection with a multimeter before before connecting to a load and powering your circuit up!

The following table describes the ATX connector\'s pinout and what color the wire may look like.

  ATX Pinout (4-Pin)   12V/5V Power Supply   Notes
  -------------------- --------------------- --------------------------
  1                    **+12V**              \"Red\"
  2                    N/C                   May Not Be Not Connected

## Hardware Hookup

### Breakout Board

To easily connect to the 4-pin connector, we recommend using the ATX power connector (4-pin). For more information, [check out the tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/atx-power-connector-4-pin-breakout-hookup-guide).

### ATX Power Connector (4-Pin) Breakout Hookup Guide 

October 10, 2019

Do you need to power a project with 12V and 5V from one wall adapter? The ATX power connector breaks out the standard 4-pin computer peripheral port for your 12V and 5V devices!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hacking the 4-Pin Connector

Otherwise, you can modify the cable and use a polarized connector of your choice. This requires more time and effort. The following images use the older 12V/5V power supply so the wires may be different depending on the manufacturer. Cut the cable about 1-2 inches from the 4-pin ATX connector.

[![Cut cable](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-02_Cut_Cable.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-02_Cut_Cable.jpg)

Cut into sheath with the flush cutter. Pull it back just enough so that you have enough room to work with the wires. Be careful not to cut yourself!

[![Cut Sheath](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-03_Open_Cable_Sheath_Jacket.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-03_Open_Cable_Sheath_Jacket.jpg)

[Strip](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire#stranded-vs-solid) the power supply\'s three wires. The wires are stranded so feel free to tin the wires by [adding solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder---through-hole-soldering) to the tips.

[![Tin Wires](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-04_Tin_Stranded_Wires.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-04_Tin_Stranded_Wires.jpg)

Then cut and strip a piece of hookup wire. Solder it to the ground wire.

[![Refrence Ground Wire](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-05_Strip_Solder_GND_Wires.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-05_Strip_Solder_GND_Wires.jpg)

Braid the wire and insert into a barrel jack connector. Secure the wires in the screw terminal with a Phillips head. Feel free to add some heat shrink or electrical tape to the connection at this point.

[![Tighten Screw Terminals](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-06_Tighten_Srews_Barrel_Jack_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-06_Tighten_Srews_Barrel_Jack_Connector.jpg)

**Note:** Using screw terminals is one method of modifying the 12V/5V power supply. For a more secure connection, try splicing the wires to a polarized connector and adding heat shrink to your connection. You can also use a USB connector for the 5V side depending on your personal preferences.

### Test the Output

If you modified the cable with barrel jack connectors, power the power supply and test with a multimeter to verify the voltages. Usually power supplies are center positive so make sure that the wires were inserted correctly. Adjust as a necessary for your system.

[![Test outputs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-07_Test_Multimeter.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-07_Test_Multimeter.jpg)

### Label the Output

If you modified the cable with barrel jack connectors, we recommend that you clearly label the barrel jack connector\'s voltage relative to the output using a Sharpie. Feel free to add an additional barrel jack when not in use.

[![Label Barrel Jacks](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-08_Label.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/7/12V_5V_Power_Supply_Tutorial-08_Label.jpg)

### Power Your Circuit!

Connect the power supply to your circuit and power it up! I personally use the power supply as a tool for basic testing. Usually the 12V side is connected to an Arduino\'s barrel jack. The 5V output is used for more power hungry loads such as the the RGB LED Matrix or a few meters of addressable (WS2812B, APA102, etc) LEDs.

## Troubleshooting

Certain power supplies have a lot of noise. While a 12V/5V power supply works great with a microcontroller and a LED strip, it may not work as well when you attach a capacitive touch sensor to the system depending on the manufacturer. Certain dual-voltage power supplies can lack the proper filtering and cause the capacitive touch potentiometer to have a lot of latency. You can try to add additional circuitry to fix it if the current power supply has a lot of noise.

You should not see this issue with the [newer 12V/5V power supply (TOL-15664)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15664). It is more reliable than our previous version. Otherwise, you can also try to use two separate power supplies or a more robust power supply such as a [Meanwell](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/mean-well).

**Warning!** Depending on the manufacturer, dual-voltage power supplies can lack proper filtering and tends to wreak havoc on the Touch Potentiometer. We saw this with our previous [12V/5V power supply (TOL-11296)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/11296). However, we **DO NOT** recommend using the older power supply with the Touch Potentiometer.
