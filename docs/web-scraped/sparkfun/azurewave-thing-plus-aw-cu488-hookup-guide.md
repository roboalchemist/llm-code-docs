## Hardware Overview

In this section, we will highlight the hardware and pins that are broken out on the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488). For more information, check out our [Resources and Going Further](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/azurewave-thing-plus-aw-cu488-hookup-guide#resources-and-going-further) for more information on the AzureWave AW-CU488 module or the Realtek RTL8721DM that is contained within the module.

### GPIO

The AzureWave Thing Plus breaks out the GPIO pins to plated through hole pads on the edge of the board using the Thing Plus/ Feather Form Factor. Additional 1x5 pins are broken out along the extended part of the board.

[![Edge Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/19957_AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488-edge_GPIO_Pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/19957_AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488-edge_GPIO_Pins.jpg)

Note that the pin label might have additional functionality. Below is a graphical datasheet of the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) that highlights the additional functionality.

[![Graphical Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/b/1/c/e/b/GraphicalDatasheet_SparkFun_AzureWave_ThingPlus-v10b.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/9/0/2/b/GraphicalDatasheet_SparkFun_AzureWave_ThingPlus-v10b.pdf)

*Click image for a closer view.*

**Note:** We recommend using the pins for the primary peripheral. For advanced users, you could use mux\'ed pins for at an alternative location (as listed for with (b) and/or (c) ). Some pins are defined with the board add-on, while others may need to be adjusted in the pin definitions.

**Note:** If pin `27` is connected to GND when AW-CU488 boots up, the Arduino bootloader will not boot up properly and enter \"test/debug\" mode. Make sure that this pin is left HIGH at bootup so that it can run your code and enter \"normal\" mode.

### Power

There are a variety of power and power-related nets broken out to connectors and through hole pads. Power is regulated down to **3.3V** for the AW-CU488 so the [logic level is 3.3V for the I/O](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logic-levels/all).

- **VBUS**: The VBUS net is connected to the USB Type C connector and the VBUS PTH. You can use **5V** from a USB port by connecting to the USB Type C connector or connecting power to the VBUS PTH. Make sure that power you provide to this pin does not exceed 6 volts. Power is regulated down with the XC6222 3.3V/700mA voltage regulator. The USB Type C connector is also used to upload code to your processor, send [serial data to a terminal window](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux), or charging the LiPo battery. Of course for portable power, you could connect a USB battery as an alternative to using a LiPo battery.
- **VBAT**: The VBAT net is connected to the 2-pin JST connector, VBAT PTH, and the AW-CU488\'s VBAT MEAS pin. For portable applications, you can connect a nominal 3.7V single cell, LiPo battery to the 2-pin JST connector. This pin is also connected to the MCP73831 charge IC to safely charge the LiPo battery to its maximum voltage of about 4.2V. We recommend connecting only LiPo batteries to the VBAT net to power the board. Of course, you can power a separate device through the VBAT PTH pin. Power is regulated down with the XC6222 3.3V/700mA voltage regulator.
- **3V3**: The 3.3V net is labeled as 3V3. You can apply power to the board if you have a regulated voltage of 3.3V. Otherwise, you could power a separate device through the 3V3 PTH pin. This is also connected to the Qwiic connector\'s 3.3V pin to power Qwiic enabled devices.
- **GND**: of course, is the common, ground voltage (0V reference) for the system.

[![Power Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_Power.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_Power.jpg)

### LiPo Charge Circuit

The board includes the MCP73831 LiPo charger IC (the little black IC with 5 pins) to safely charge a single cell, LiPo battery. In this case, the charge rate is set to a default rate of 500mA. Cutting the trace in the back and adding a solder jumper between the middle pad and the pad labeled as 100mA will set the charge rate to 100mA. The on-board LED labeled as CHG can be used to get an indication of the **charge status** of your battery.

[![LiPo Charge Circuit](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_LiPo_Charge.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_LiPo_Charge.jpg)

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

The board includes 11x [PWM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation/all) pins. These can be found on the pinout table listed earlier in this section: `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `10`, `11`, `14`, `15`, `17`, and `26`.

[![PWM Pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_PWM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_PWM.jpg)

**Note:** Make sure that you are using the correct PWM pins. If a PWM is incorrectly defined in Arduino, all of the PWM pins will cease to function.

**Note:** If you are using the PWM with the ServoSweep.ino or TonePlayMelody.ino, you will need to adjust the preprocesser define after the line for the `BOARD_RTL8721DM`. For example, in the ServoSweep.ino file, they attach PWM pin 3 to servo object. You would need to adjust pin `3` to another PWM pin that is available on the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488).\
\

      .
      .
      .
      #elif defined(BOARD_RTL8721DM)
        // attaches the servo on PWM pin 3 to the servo object
        myservo.attach(3);

### Audio Codec Input Microphone and Analog Output Pins

Not labeled on the board is the microphone pins. Pin `21` is also the \"MIC_BIAS\" while the `22` is also the right microphone \"MIC1_R.\" The analog output for the right and left speakers are on pin `13` (or \"AOUTP_R\") and pin `20` (or \"AOUTP_L\"). Note that the LED is tied to pin `13`. We recommend using a different output pin for the LED if you decide to use this pin for the audio code.

### Antenna

The AzureWave AW-CU488 module includes an internal shielding antenna. Note that the connector that looks similar to a \"u.FL\" connector is used for production testing and is not available to the user.

[![AzureWave Module](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/19957_AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_Module.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/19957_AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488_Module.jpg)

### LEDs

The board includes three status LEDs.

- **PWR** - The PWR LED lights up to indicate when there is a 3.3V available after power is regulated down from the USB connector or LiPo battery. This can be disabled by cutting the jumper labeled as LED.
- **13** - The 13 LED can be configured by the user and is connected to pin 13. Note that this is also connected to the analog output \"AOUTP_R\". You will need to decide between using this pin for an LED or the analog output pin.
- **CHG** - The on-board yellow CHG LED can be used to get an indication of the **charge status** of your battery. Below is a table of other status indicators depending on the state of the charge IC.\
  \

  ------------------ -------------------------------------------
  **Charge State**   **LED status**
  No Battery         Floating (should be OFF, but may flicker)
  Shutdown           Floating (should be OFF, but may flicker)
  Charging           ON
  Charge Complete    OFF
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------

[![LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488-LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/AzureWaveThingPlus_AW-CU488-LEDs.jpg)

### Jumpers

**Note:** If this is your first time working with jumpers, check out the [How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all) tutorial for more information.

The following jumpers are included.

- **CHG** - This three way jumper sets the charge IC\'s charge rate. By default, it\'s connected to the 500mA. Cutting a trace and adding a solder jumper between the center pad and the pad labeled as 100mA will set the charge rate to 100mA
- **USBSHLD-GND** - This jumper connects the USB Type C connector\'s shield pin to GND. Cut this to isolate the USB Type C connector\'s shield pin. This is for advanced users that want to ground their board to their enclosure instead of the ground plane.
- **LED** - By default, this jumper is closed and located on the bottom of the board. Cut this trace to disable the power LED that is connected to 3.3V.
- **JP1** - This jumper is connected to the auto-boot circuit by default. This is for advanced users that want to disable the auto-boot when uploading code. You will need to cut this jumper with JP2.
- **JP2** - This jumper is connected to the auto-boot circuit by default. This is for advanced users that want to disable the auto-boot when uploading code. You will need to cut this jumper with JP1.

### Board Dimensions

The board uses the Thing Plus footprint. Due to the size of the module, there are two mounting holes and the length of the board is extended to accommodate the size of the AW-CU488 module. Thus the board is about 3.05\" x 0.90\" (or 77.47 mm x 22.86 mm).

[![Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/6/a/9/9/a/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Board_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/a/9/9/a/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Board_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Hookup

At a minimum, plug in the USB C cable to the AzureWave Thing Plus to power and program the board.

[![USB C Cable AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_USB-C.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_USB-C.jpg)

## Installing the CP2104 USB Driver

[] **Note:** Make sure to manually install the driver for the CP210X with the following instructions. The driver that Windows auto-installs will not work with the auto-reset circuit on the board and can cause serial uploads to fail.

You will also need to install the SiLabs CP2104 Driver, which can be found here: [USB to UART Bridge VCP Driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

[Download Windows VCP Driver (ZIP)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/5/2/CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver.zip)

[Download Mac OSX VCP Driver (ZIP)](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip)

**Note:** If applicable, make sure you are using the proper driver files for your CPU architecture. This is usually indicated by a folder or file name with \"*x86*\" for 32-bit processors or \"*x64*\" for 64-bit processors.

## Setting Up Arduino

**Note:** If this is your first time using Arduino IDE, library, or board add-on, please review the following tutorials.\

[AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) Fast Fourier Transform Parts Wishlist](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/169282)

### Hardware Hookup

For the following example, you will need the following connection as shown in the Fritzing diagram.

[![Fritzing Diagram Input Microphone Fast Fourier Transform](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Input_FastFourierTransform_FFT_.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Input_FastFourierTransform_FFT_.jpg)

You will need to solder headers to the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488). Then solder headers on the MEMS microphone breakout. In this case, we soldered the straight headers at a right angle to connect a M/F jumper wire. Depending on your personal preference, you could also solder the headers on the MEMS microphone like the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488). Just make sure that the microphone input on the bottom side of the board faces away from the breadboard.

If you are using water soluble flux, make sure to clean off any flux residue remaining on the board. Make sure to be careful not to get any liquid into the MEMs microphone or the AW-CU488 module. Isopropyl alcohol and a Q-tip removes the water soluble flux pretty well. Then insert the board into the breadboard and connect the wires to the MEMS microphone. Finally, connect a USB C cable between the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) and your computer\'s COM port.

[![ MEMs microphone connected to the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) and breadboard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Input_Mic_Fast_Fourier_Transform.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Input_Mic_Fast_Fourier_Transform.jpg)

### Example Code

Let\'s upload the sketch to calculate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of an audio signal. From the menu, select the following: **File** \> **Examples** \> Examples for AW_CU488 Thing Plus (RTL8721DM) \| **AmebaAudioCodec** \> **InputFFT**.

Or you can copy and paste the following code in the Arduino IDE. Select the correct board definition from the menu (in this case, **Tools** \> **Boards** \> **AW-CU488 Thing Plus (RTL8721DM)**). Then select the correct COM port that the board enumerated to (in this case, it was **COM21**). Hit upload button.

    language:c
    #include "AudioCodec.h"
    #include "FFT.h"

    #define SAMPLERATE 16000
    #define SAMPLECOUNT 128

    int16_t audio_buffer[SAMPLECOUNT] = ;
    float fft_buffer[SAMPLECOUNT/2] = ;
    uint16_t freq_bins[SAMPLECOUNT/2] = ;
    int i = 0;

    FFT fft;

    void setup() 
        Serial.println();

        Codec.setSampleRate(SAMPLERATE);
        Codec.begin(TRUE, FALSE);
    }

    void loop()  else 
            }
            Serial.println();
        }
        delay(1);
    }

Open the Arduino Serial Monitor set to **2000000** will output the data similar to the output below. Each line will have a value in place for each frequency:

    language:bash
    0 Hz,125 Hz,250 Hz,375 Hz,500 Hz,625 Hz,750 Hz,875 Hz,1000 Hz,1125 Hz,1250 Hz,1375 Hz,1500 Hz,1625 Hz,1750 Hz,1875 Hz,2000 Hz,2125 Hz,2250 Hz,2375 Hz,2500 Hz,2625 Hz,2750 Hz,2875 Hz,3000 Hz,3125 Hz,3250 Hz,3375 Hz,3500 Hz,3625 Hz,3750 Hz,3875 Hz,4000 Hz,4125 Hz,4250 Hz,4375 Hz,4500 Hz,4625 Hz,4750 Hz,4875 Hz,5000 Hz,5125 Hz,5250 Hz,5375 Hz,5500 Hz,5625 Hz,5750 Hz,5875 Hz,6000 Hz,6125 Hz,6250 Hz,6375 Hz,6500 Hz,6625 Hz,6750 Hz,6875 Hz,7000 Hz,7125 Hz,7250 Hz,7375 Hz,7500 Hz,7625 Hz,7750 Hz,7875 Hz

Try blowing air across the input microphone or playing music from your smartphone. The FFT output will react to the input audio and split the signal into several bands. Better yet, try using a tone generator or playing a video that can generate an audio sample that reaches a desired frequency. The following video below is an audio sample that increases between 20Hz to 20kHz. Play the video below and watch the values for each frequency. You may need to adjust your speaker\'s volume. You will notice that the value will be the largest when the microphone hears a frequency that corresponds to the component. Adjacent components may be greater than 0 depending on your speaker\'s volume.

The example code breaks the audio sample into several components (it should be about half of the sample count, so 64 values for each line) which can make it hard to view through the Arduino Serial Monitor. Try outputting the data with comma separated values by replacing the spaces and `|` between each data with a comma `'`. If the value is less than `0.01`, the value will be considered `0` instead of a `-`. Try scaling the values (i.e. multiplying the `fft_buffer[i]*100`) as well. This will help visualize the data through the Arduino Serial Plotter. Below is the modified example code with the changes described.

    language:c
    //modified inputFFT.ino for Comma Separated Values

    #include "AudioCodec.h"
    #include "FFT.h"

    #define SAMPLERATE 16000
    #define SAMPLECOUNT 128

    int16_t audio_buffer[SAMPLECOUNT] = ;
    float fft_buffer[SAMPLECOUNT/2] = ;
    uint16_t freq_bins[SAMPLECOUNT/2] = ;
    int i = 0;

    FFT fft;

    void setup() 
        Serial.println();

        Codec.setSampleRate(SAMPLERATE);
        Codec.begin(TRUE, FALSE);
    }

    void loop()  else 
            }
            Serial.println();
        }
        delay(1);
    }

Try adjusting the code further and mapping the values to a PWM pin to turn on an LED when the audio reaches a certain frequency!

[AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) Basic Input/Output Parts Wishlist](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/169284)

### Hardware Hookup

For the following example, you will need the following connection as shown in the Fritzing diagram. The Fritzing diagram connects the input from the microphone to the left analog output. Depending on your setup, you could connect the output to two speakers instead of one. In this case, you would also connect the right analog output (i.e. pin \"13\" to \"RIGHT IN\") to the amplifier and add a second speaker (RIGHT OUT and GND) to the setup.

[![Fritzing Diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_Fritzing_AzureWaveBasicInOut_Mic_Amp_Speaker.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_Fritzing_AzureWaveBasicInOut_Mic_Amp_Speaker.jpg)

If you have not already, solder headers to the AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488), MEMs microphone, and Noisy Cricket. As explained in the previous section, make sure to carefully remove any flux residue from the boards so that liquid is not trapped in the microphone or AW-CU488 module. Then [strip two wires and solder the wire ends](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire) to the speaker tabs. Of course, you could solder the pins on the M/M jumper wire to the speaker tab as well without needing to strip the wires as well.

[![Input Microphone and Output Speaker Connected to AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Basic_Input_Output.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Thing_Plus_AW-CU488_Basic_Input_Output.jpg)

**Note:** If you are using the audio codec, you will not be able to use the built-in LED on pin 13. You will need choose another pin for a digital output and connect a separate LED with a current limiting resistor.

**Note:** Adding delays (especially long delays) in the code will affect the performance of the output signal.

**Note:** The example in this section sets the input volume to a certain value. To manually adjust the input volume on the microphone side, simply add a potentiometer to the setup as shown below.\
\

### Example Code

Let\'s upload the sketch to read the input from a microphone and output the signal to one speaker. From the menu, select the following: **File** \> **Examples** \> Examples for AW_CU488 Thing Plus (RTL8721DM) \| **AmebaAudioCodec** \> **BasicInputOutput**.

Or you can copy and paste the following code in the Arduino IDE. Select the correct board definition from the menu (in this case, **Tools** \> **Boards** \> **AW-CU488 Thing Plus (RTL8721DM)**). Then select the correct COM port that the board enumerated to (in this case, it was **COM15**). Hit upload button.

**Warning:** Make sure to turn the volume down on the amplifier. You may get some feedback with the microphone next to the speakers.

    language:c
    //int analog_pin = A0;  //<=== Add this line before including Audio Codec library if you are using the potiometer and  not using the value A0

    #include "AudioCodec.h"

    #define SAMPLECOUNT 512

    int16_t buffer[SAMPLECOUNT] = ;
    unsigned int vol = 1024;

    void setup() 

    void loop() 
        //vol = analogRead(A0);// commented out so we do not need to connect a potentiometer
        vol = 750; // adjust this value between 0 to 1024
        vol = map(vol, 0, 1024, 0, 100);
        Codec.setOutputVolume(vol, vol);
    }

Once uploaded, try blowing some air across the microphone or lightly tapping the microphone on the table. You should hear the same sound but louder on the output speaker. You will notice a small delay on the output as the sound is read in from the microphone and written out to the speakers.

      SFE_MicroOLED Library Demo
      Paul Clark @ SparkFun Electronics
      Original Creation Date: December 11th, 2020

      This sketch uses the MicroOLED library to show all the functionality built into the library
      using the begin function defined in version v1.3 of the library - which allows different
      TwoWire ports and custom I2C addresses to be used.

      If you are using the standard Micro OLED display, its I2C address will be 0x3D or 0x3C
      depending on how you have the D/C or ADDR jumper configured.

      Hardware Connections:

Once uploaded, check out the Qwiic Micro OLED. You should see the SparkFun logo followed by the demo! Try adding a sensor, modifying the code, and displaying the sensor values on the screen.

## More Examples!

Of course, this only skims the surface of what the SparkFun AzureWave Thing Plus (AW-CU488) can do. There are a handful of examples from the board support package that were not highlighted in this tutorial and are being ported by our friends at Realtek with the AW-CU488 module. From the menu, try opening the other examples listed for the board: **File** \> **Examples** \> Examples for AW_CU488 Thing Plus (RTL8721DM).

[![Arduino More Examples](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Arduino_More_Examples.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/5/1/8/SparkFun_AzureWave_Arduino_More_Examples.jpg)

**Note:** Some of the examples listed in the menu may still be under development. Make sure to be patient as they include more support for the AW-CU488 module.

Or try adding another Qwiic-enabled device or a breakout board to your next project!
