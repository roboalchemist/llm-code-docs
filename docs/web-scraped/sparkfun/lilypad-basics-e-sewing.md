## What Are Sewable Electronics?

Sewable electronics combine traditional craft processes (sewing, fashion design, and textile design) with electrical engineering, computer science, and hardware skills.

With sewable electronics, you can create e-textiles (electronic textiles), which are often wearable, flexible projects that look less like traditional electronics and more like craft and art projects. Many e-textile projects replace wiring with flexible conductive materials such as conductive thread and fabric. For the projects in this guide, we will be sewing circuits together with conductive thread.

## What Is LilyPad?

The LilyPad system is a set of sewable electronic pieces designed to help you build soft, sewable, interactive e-textile projects. Using LilyPad pieces is a great way to experiment with electronics through the lens of crafting. Each LilyPad piece has large conductive sew tabs for easy sewing and a rounded shape so as not to snag fabric or cut thread.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Some LilyPad pieces come in a ProtoSnap configuration, which means all of the individual components -- such as LEDs, battery holder, switches, buttons, etc. -- are attached to one another in a single functioning circuit board. This allows you to easily program your circuit to do what you want before embedding it in your project. ProtoSnap boards are designed to be easily snapped apart into individual pieces when you're ready to begin creating LilyPad projects.

## What Is Conductive Thread?

Conductive Thread is a specialty thread made with stainless steel fibers. It can be used instead of copper wiring to connect LilyPad (or other e-textile) pieces together to create circuits.

If you are using a LilyPad kit such as the [LilyPad Sewable Electronics Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13927), you will have a [conductive thread bobbin](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10867) available to use.

SparkFun carries a few conductive thread options:

This tutorial will focus on hand sewing techniques, but conductive thread can also be used in a sewing machine and embroidery machines. Here are some specific resources on using conductive thread in machines:\

- [Embroidering Conductive Thread with a Janome MC 200E embroidery machine](http://v2.nl/lab/blog/embroidering-conductive-thread)
- [Sewing Machines and Conductive Thread](http://www.instructables.com/id/eTextiles-Sewing-Machines-and-Conductive-Thread/)

## Sewing with Conductive Thread

The examples in this tutorial will walk through creating a hand sewn conductive thread circuit connecting a LilyPad Coin Cell Battery Holder to LilyPad LEDs. These techniques will be useful for connecting any LilyPad pieces together.

Most LilyPad projects use conductive thread to complete electrical circuits. The following sections will introduce you to some basic sewing techniques as well as a few special pointers for using conductive thread to build working circuits. Even if you're already familiar with using a needle and thread, this section may still be useful to you, specifically where it pertains to sewing with LilyPad parts.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/LabeledCircuit.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/LabeledCircuit.jpg)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/GlueIcon_1.png) | ## Securing Your Components       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Each LilyPad piece has large holes with conductive silver pads called sew tabs. These tabs are designed to give you plenty of room to pass a needle and thread through the hole several times. Before you begin stitching your circuit, identify the sew tabs you would like to connect, and orient them so they are easily accessible in your design. If following along with SparkFun templates, the pieces will have a specific location on the design for both ease of sewing and visual appeal.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/TabDetail.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/TabDetail.jpg)

We recommend using a small dot of hot glue (preferred) or fabric glue to attach each LilyPad piece to the fabric to keep it from moving while you sew. Make sure not to accidentally seal up the holes in the sew tabs.

[![Glue LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/GlueLEDs.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/GlueLEDs.png)[![Place LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/PlaceLEDs.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/PlaceLEDs.png)

To help plan where the stitches will go, you can use a marker to draw lines between the components.

[![Draw Lines](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/DrawLines.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/0/6/DrawLines.png)

| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ThreadNeedleIcon.jpg) | ## Threading a Needle             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Cut a piece of conductive thread approximately 2 feet long. Push one end of the thread through the eye (opening) of the needle and pull through, leaving a tail of about 5 inches.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Needle.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Needle.jpg)

Before you begin sewing your project, you will need to tie a knot at the long end of the thread to prevent you from completely pulling it through the fabric. You can tie a simple overhand or square knot. The next sections will explain a few other knot methods.

### Starter Knot

A starter knot is a method of starting your stitch with a knot directly on your fabric.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StarterKnot.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StarterKnot.jpg)

### Quilter\'s Knot

The slightly more advanced quilter's knot is a way to tie a quick, secure knot on the thread. After some practice, this knot can be tied very quickly.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/QuilterKnot.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/QuilterKnot.jpg)

[] Always remove your battery when working on your project to avoid damaging your components.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/TabIcon.jpg) | ## Connecting To LilyPad Sew Tabs |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

We'll stitch conductive thread around LilyPad sew tabs in our circuits to connect the pieces together. It's important that you make three to four loops each time you connect your thread around an empty sew tab and pull the thread snug with each pass. This ensures you have made a strong electrical and physical connection between the thread and the sew tab. Pull loops tight before continuing your stitch.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ConnectingTabs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ConnectingTabs.jpg)

| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/SewLEDIcon.jpg) | ## Sewing Basics                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

After sewing loops around a sew tab, a running stitch will enable you to connect LilyPad pieces together with a continuous length of conductive thread. Follow these steps:

Push the needle through the fabric about 1/4\" in the direction of your stitch path.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running1.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running1.jpg)

Pull the slack of the thread through so it sits flush with the fabric.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running2.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running2.jpg)

Push the needle back up through the fabric another 1/4\" along the stitch path.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running3.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running3.jpg)

Pull the slack of the thread through so it sits flush with the fabric.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running4.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running4.jpg)

Repeat this process to travel along the path to the next LilyPad piece you want to connect to, keeping stitches evenly spaced.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running5.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Running5.jpg)

### Running vs. Hidden Stitch

In a basic running stitch, the stitching will be even on both sides of the fabric.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/RunningStitch.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/RunningStitch.jpg)

To hide the stitches so that they are not seen on the outside of the project, make a longer stitch on the back of the project and a very small stitch on the front of the project. This method is called a "hidden stitch."

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/HiddenStitch.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/HiddenStitch.jpg)

As you sew, flip your fabric over every so often to make sure the conductive thread isn't getting knotted or tangled. If you are just starting out with sewing, your stitching may take some practice before it feels comfortable or easy. Remember to be patient with yourself and take your time while stitching. If your thread breaks, you can stitch onto existing conductive thread to continue the electrical connection.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/SewLEDIcon.jpg) | ## Connecting LilyPad Pieces      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Both running and hidden stitches will enable you to connect LilyPad components together with a single length of conductive thread. To connect two LilyPad pieces, continue stitching after completing three to four loops around the sew tab.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StitchingLine1.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StitchingLine1.jpg)

### Connecting Multiple LilyPad Pieces

To connect more than two LilyPad pieces, instead of trimming your thread and starting over, continue stitching to the next piece, make three to four loops, and repeat as necessary. There is no need to use a new length of thread if the pieces will share a connection.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StitchingLine3.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/StitchingLine3.jpg)

| ![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/FinishingIcon.jpg) | ## Finishing Your Connection      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When you have completed connecting components, use a finishing knot. Thread tails can cause electrical shorts, so be sure to trim your thread afterward.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/FinishingKnot.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/FinishingKnot.jpg)

## Checking for Conductive Thread Short Circuits

Watch out for any loose threads or knot tails in your project. If any piece of the conductive thread from the positive (+) side of your circuit accidentally touches the negative (--) side, it can cause a [short circuit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit#short-and-open-circuits). A short circuit connects the battery to itself and bypasses the rest of your project causing an unwanted amount of current draw from the battery. Stitching directly over stitches in another part of the circuit can also cause a short.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ShortCircuit.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ShortCircuit.jpg)

[] One of the most common short circuits in e-sewing happens when a loose thread tail near the negative tab on the battery holder touches the battery. Always check your stitching before powering your project.

It's important that your stitches do not cross over each other or touch other parts of the circuit. The batteries used in these projects shouldn't burn or shock you if they short circuit (although they may heat up), but higher voltage projects or power sources could be dangerous.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ShortCheck.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/ShortCheck.jpg)

## Installing Your Battery and Testing Your Finished Circuit

Once all your pieces are connected with conductive thread, your finished circuit needs a power source. Install your coin cell battery, positive (+) side up, into the battery holder. The image below shows how to place a battery in a LilyPad Coin Cell Battery Holder.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/2/BatteryInsert.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/2/BatteryInsert.jpg)

[] Always remove your battery if you need to continue working on your project to avoid damaging your components.

After completing the conductive thread connections, switch your circuit on, and see what it can do! If the circuit fails to work, you may have a short, a loose connection, a reversed component, or even something as simple as a dead battery.

When you turn on the battery holder switch, current flows through the conductive thread to the other parts of your circuit.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/CurrentFlow.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/CurrentFlow.jpg)

## Troubleshooting

As you work on e-sewing projects, you may encounter problems such as loose connections that keep LEDs from lighting or cause your circuit to malfunction. Most LilyPad tutorials have a troubleshooting section to help you identify and solve problems with your circuit.

### Circuit only working sometimes? Check for loose connections.

If the conductive thread is not making a tight connection to the LilyPad piece\'s sew tabs, current will not be able to flow through consistently. If the project moves, the conductive thread may pull away from the sew tab and disconnect the circuit. To fix, pull stitching tight with tweezers or a needle if possible. You may also sew over the top of existing thread to create more tension and hold the thread securely to a sew tab.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/LooseConnection.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/LooseConnection.jpg)

### Circuit not working? Double check your polarity.

Some LilyPad components are [polarized](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/polarity), meaning electric current can only flow through them in one direction. If sewn into the circuit incorrectly, they will not function. Double check the labeled sew tabs before you stitch to make sure they are oriented correctly.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Polarity.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/Polarity.jpg)

**Other issues to check for:**

- Make sure the switch on your battery holder is in the ON position.
- Check to see if your battery is dead. You can do so with a [multimeter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12966). Try installing a spare battery.
- If following a project template, double check that the components are connected together in the right configuration

If you are still having trouble, you can use a multimeter to check for continuity or issues with your circuit. Our [How To Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter) tutorial will help you get started.

## Caring For Your Project

Unlike copper wire, which has a coating, conductive thread is uninsulated. This means the thread behaves like bare wire and can accidentally short circuit if stray strands come in contact with each other.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/WirevsThread.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/8/1/WirevsThread.jpg)

To avoid any accidental short circuits after the project is stitched and tested, we recommend covering the thread with a thin layer of fabric glue, fabric paint, or an additional layer of fabric. This is especially important for projects that are wearable or three-dimensional. Never work on a metal surface when using conductive thread. For more detailed insulation instructions, take a look at this tutorial:

### Cleaning Your Project

If your project gets dirty, remove the battery and carefully hand wash with mild detergent. Let your project air dry; a dryer can damage the LilyPad pieces or stitching.
