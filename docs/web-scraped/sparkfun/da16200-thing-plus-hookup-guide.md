## Introduction

The [SparkFun Thing Plus - DA16200](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/19696) utilizes a highly integrated ultra-low power WiFi system on chip (SoC) that allows users to develop WiFi and IoT solutions.

[![SparkFun Thing Plus - DA16200](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/1/9/3/9/3/DA16200-_01.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-thing-plus-da16200.html)

Manufactured by [Dialog (a subsidiary of Renesas)](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/), the DA16200MOD contains a 802.11b/g/n radio (PHY), a baseband processor, a media access controller (MAC), on-chip memory, and a host networking application processor, all on a single silicon die. The SoC has full offload capabilities to run the entire networking OS and TCP/IP stack on chip; therefore, an external network processor, CPU, or microcontroller are not required. The module is also Wi-Fi Alliance certified for IEEE802.11b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, WPS functionalities in many countries including the United States (FCC), Canada (IC) and China (SRRC).

This board comes in a [Thing Plus form factor](https://www.sparkfun.com/thing_plus), which includes a Qwiic and LiPo battery connectors, multiple GPIO pins, and JTAG PTH pins for debugging. The SparkFun Thing Plus - DA16200 is ideal for your next IoT project, thanks in part to the multiple sleep modes that allow you to take advantage of current draws as low as 0.2 - 3.5 µA on the WiFi module.

**Note:** Please be aware that the Thing Plus - DA16200 has a **3.3V** logic level voltage.

### Required Materials

To get started, users will need a USB-C cable is needed to connect the DA16200 Thing Plus to a computer. *(You may already have a some of these items; read through the guide and modify your cart accordingly.)*
