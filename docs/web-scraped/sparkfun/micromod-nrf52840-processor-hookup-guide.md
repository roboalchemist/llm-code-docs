## Introduction

The [MicroMod nRF52840 Processor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16984) offers a powerful SoC (system on chip) combination of ARM Cortex-M4 CPU and 2.4 GHz Bluetooth transceiver in the MicroMod form-factor so you can easily plug it in to the Carrier Board of your choice. The specific nRF module on this Processor board features an integrated PCB antenna for the Bluetooth transceiver.

The nRF52840 module includes a BT 5.1 stack and supports Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee & Thread) and 2.4GHz RF wireless protocols (including Nordic\'s proprietary RF protocol) allowing you to pick which option works best for your application.

On top of the processing power and Bluetooth capability of the nRF52840, this board features two I^2^C buses, 2 SPI buses, eleven GPIO, dedicated digital, analog, and PWM pins along with multiple serial UARTs to cover all your peripheral needs.

### Required Materials

You\'ll need a Carrier Board to plug your nRF52840 Processor into. SparkFun offers a variety of MicroMod Carrier Boards to fit your project. Below you can see a few options:
