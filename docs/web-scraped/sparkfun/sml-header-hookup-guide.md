## Introduction

**smôl** is a new board format and, as the name suggests, they\'re *really* small!

Need to do some prototyping with smôl? Or want to connect your smôl stack to a Qwiic board or your favorite SPI sensor? The smôl Header is the perfect solution!

### Required Materials

If you want to connect a Qwiic board to your smôl stack, you\'re going to need some Qwiic cables:

Don\'t forget that you will need Flexible Printed Circuits to connect your smôl boards together. You\'re going to need one FPC per board. Our 36mm FPC is the perfect length if you want the smôl boards to stack neatly, one on top of the other.

[Get started with the smôl Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sml-hookup-guide)

We recommend taking a look through the following tutorials if you are not familiar with the concepts covered in them:

### Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) 

SPI is commonly used to connect microcontrollers to peripherals such as sensors, shift registers, and SD cards.

### I2C 

An introduction to I2C, one of the main embedded communications protocols in use today.

## Hardware Overview

smôl boards are designed to stack one on top of the other, using 16-way 0.5mm-pitch Flexible Printed Circuits (FPCs). We really like FPCs and we\'re using them on more and more of our products. But they can be a bit tricky when it comes to prototyping or if you want to connect other devices to your smôl stack. The smôl Header is here to help!

### FPC Connections

Like all of our smôl boards, the Header is equipped with a 16-way 0.5mm-pitch Flexible Printed Circuit connector. The pin-out for the smôl Header connector is as follows:

  Connector Pin No.   Signal Name   Function
  ------------------- ------------- ----------------------------------
  1                   PROC_PWR_EN   Processor Power Enable
  2                   3V3           3.3V Power Rail
  3                   GND           Power Ground / 0V
  4                   SCLK          SPI Clock
  5                   COPI          SPI Controller Out Peripheral In
  6                   CIPO          SPI Controller In Peripheral Out
  7                   CS0           SPI Chip Select 0
  8                   CS1           SPI Chip Select 1
  9                   CS2           SPI Chip Select 2
  10                  GPIO0         General Purpose Input / Output 0
  11                  GPIO1         General Purpose Input / Output 1
  12                  SDA           I^2^C Data
  13                  SCL           I^2^C Clock
  14                  GND           Power Ground / 0V
  15                  3V3           3.3V Power Rail
  16                  V_USB         USB Power Rail (5V)

### Breakout Pins

You\'ve got full access to all the smôl pins, so connecting your favorite SPI board to smôl is as easy as plug-and-play! The smôl Header breaks out all 16 smôl connections in good old 0.1\" format. The hole pattern is the same as an old school 16-pin 0.3\" Dual-In line Package (DIP). Perfect for soldering [header pins](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116) to and then pushing into standard [breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12044).

[![Pictured are the 16 header breakout pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Pins.jpg)

### Qwiic Connector

We\'ve included a Qwiic connector too, so you can attach your favorite Qwiic boards to your smôl stack qwiicly and easily.

[![Pictured is the header Qwiic connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Qwiic.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Qwiic.jpg)

### Qwiic (I^2^C) Pull-ups

The Header also includes pull-up resistors for the I^2^C SDA and SCL signals. You can disconnect the resistors if required by opening the dual split-pad jumper links.

[![Pictured are the two pull-up resistors and the split pad jumper links](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Pullups.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/5/8/18620_smol_Header_Pullups.jpg)
