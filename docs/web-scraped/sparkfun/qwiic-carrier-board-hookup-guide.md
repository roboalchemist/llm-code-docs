## Hardware Assembly

For those unfamiliar with the MicroMod ecosystem, be sure to review the [Getting Started with MicroMod guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod#hardware-hookup).

[](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod)

### Getting Started with MicroMod 

October 21, 2020

Dive into the world of MicroMod - a compact interface to connect a microcontroller to various peripherals via the M.2 Connector!

### Processor Board

To get started with the Qwiic Carrier Board, users will need a compatible Processor. Insert the MicroMod Processor board into the M.2 socket at an angle, with its edge connector aligned to the matching slots.

**Note:** The dimensions of the Processor board\'s edge connector prevents it from mating with the slots of the M.2 socket in reverse. As an extra safeguard, the screw insert is spaced to only match the screw key of MicroMod Processor boards.

When inserted properly, the Processor board will rest at an angle:

[![MicroMod processor board inserted into the carrier board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/400-400/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/9/6/assembly_processor_insert.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/9/6/assembly_processor_insert.jpg)

*Inserting a processor board into the M.2 socket on the MicroMod Qwiic Carrier Board. (Click to enlarge)*

To secure the processor board, gently hold down on the board and attach the M.2 screw with a Phillip\'s head (PH0 or PH1) screw driver. Below, is an example of an assembled MicroMod system:

### Qwiic Devices

Screw inserts are available in either a [single](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17723) or [double](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17724) configuration to attach/mount 1\" x 1\" Qwiic devices to the Qwiic carrier board. The inserts are compatible with [4-40 screws](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10453); additionally, [4-40 3/8\" standoffs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10463) can also be used to stack boards vertically.

To electronically connect the Qwiic devices to the Carrier Board, users will need [Qwiic cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15081). For more information, check out our [Qwiic ecosystem page](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).

**Note:** We have chosen the [MicroMod ESP32](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16781) for the processor board for this demonstration; however, users are free to utilize the [processor board](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/processor-board) of their choice.

Please note, that the sample code below is intended to program processor boards that are compatible with the Arduino IDE. Therefore, processor boards like the [RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17720) are going to need extra effort to adapt the code (technical assistance for which, is **not available**).

### Assembly

The assemble process is relatively straight forward. The primary thing that users need to **pay attention** to is the orientation of the OLED display relative to the axes of the accelerometer. *The x-axis should point to the right of the OLED display and the y-axis should point to the top of the display (see images below).*

[![Accelerometer attached to single carrier board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/400-200/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/9/6/example_accelerometer.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/9/6/example_accelerometer.jpg)

### Installing an Arduino Library 

January 11, 2013

How do I install a custom Arduino library? It\'s easy! This tutorial will go over how to install an Arduino library using the Arduino Library Manager. For libraries not linked with the Arduino IDE, we will also go over manually installing an Arduino library.

##### **Libraries and Pin Definitions**

This section of the code contains the required libraries and pin definitions for the code.

    language:c
    #include <Wire.h>

    // Accelerometer
    //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    #include "SparkFun_LIS2DH12.h" //Click here to get the library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_LIS2DH12
    SPARKFUN_LIS2DH12 accel;
    //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    // External Display
    //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    #include <SFE_MicroOLED.h> //Click here to get the library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_Micro_OLED
    //#include "icons.h"

    #define PIN_RESET 7
    #define DC_JUMPER 1
    MicroOLED oled(PIN_RESET, DC_JUMPER);
    //=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

##### **Variables**

This section of the code instantiates most of the variables used in the code.

    language:c
    // Set target and dot size
    int radiusLarge = 10; // Target area 2
    int radiusSmall = 4;  // Target area 1
    int radiusBubble = 2; // Bubble size

    // Set initial roll and pitch measurement
    double averagedRoll = 0.0;
    double averagedPitch = 0.0;

#### Setup Loop

This section of the code runs the setup *loop*, which initializes the serial output, I^2^C connection, the OLED display operation, and the accelerometer operation and configuration.

    language:c
    void setup()
    

      // Set sample/data rate for accelerometer
      // The larger the avgAmount the faster we should read the sensor
      //accel.setDataRate(LIS2DH12_ODR_100Hz); //6 measurements a second
      accel.setDataRate(LIS2DH12_ODR_400Hz); //25 measurements a second
    }

##### **Setup Functions**

These functions are executed in the setup *loop*, to initialize the OLED display I^2^C connection and display the splash screen.

    language:c
    // Ping an I2C address and see if it responds
    bool isConnected(uint8_t deviceAddress)
    

    void beginDisplay()
    
    }

#### Main loop

This section of the code runs the main loop. The code retrieves roll and pitch calculation, clears the display buffer, displays the bubble and target circles or areas. If the position of the bubble is within the target are, the roll and pitch angles are displayed as `X` and `Y` coordinates on the screen.

    language:c
    void loop()
    
      else if (bubbleX > LCDWIDTH - radiusBubble) 
      if (bubbleY < radiusBubble) 
      else if (bubbleY > LCDHEIGHT - radiusBubble) 

      // Draw circle relative to dot
      oled.circle(LCDWIDTH / 2, LCDHEIGHT / 2, radiusLarge);
      oled.circle(LCDWIDTH / 2, LCDHEIGHT / 2, radiusSmall);
      oled.circleFill(bubbleX, bubbleY, radiusBubble);

      // Display angle/position once bubble is inside larger target area
      if ( sqrt(averagedPitch * averagedPitch + averagedRoll * averagedRoll) < (radiusLarge - radiusBubble))
      
    //    else 
    //    oled.print(-averagedPitch);
      }

      oled.display();
    }

##### **`getAngles()` Function**

This function is executed in the main loop. The code retrieves accelerometer readings, translates the readings into roll and pitch angles, and calculates an average based on a sample set size (`avgAmount = 16`).

    language:c
    void getAngles()
     // Invert if upside down

        averagedRoll += roll;
        averagedPitch += pitch;

        // Debug Print Statements
        //Serial.print(roll, 6);
        //Serial.print(", ");
        //Serial.print(pitch, 6);
        //Serial.print(", ");
        //
        //Serial.print(accelX);
        //Serial.print(", ");
        //Serial.print(accelY);
        //Serial.print(", ");
        //Serial.print(accelZ);
        //Serial.println("");
      }

      averagedRoll /= (float)avgAmount;
      averagedPitch /= (float)avgAmount;

      // Debug Print Statements
      //Serial.print(averagedRoll, 6);
      //Serial.print(", ");
      //Serial.print(averagedPitch, 6);
      //Serial.println(", ");

    }
