## Introduction

The Qwiic Shield (for [Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14352) or [Particle Photon](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14202)) is the first step in getting acquainted with SparkFun\'s Qwiic connect ecosystem. It connects the I^2^C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Arduino or Photon board to a series of SparkFun Qwiic connectors. The board already has the circuitry to convert the 5V given to the 3.3V required by I^2^C boards in our Qwiic ecosystem. The Arduino shield also has holes for mounting Qwiic boards. Since the Qwiic system allows for daisy chaining (as long as your devices are on different addresses) you can stack as many sensors as you\'d like to create a tower of sensing power!

An update to our classic Arduino Shields Tutorial! All things Arduino shields. What they are and how to assemble them.

## Hardware Overview

### Qwiic Shield for Arduino

**Note:** The shield includes R3 Arduino headers, but they are not pre-soldered onto the board, so some assembly will be required when putting the shield together. The image below shows the shield after the header has been soldered to the PCB to.

The Qwiic Shields have 4x Qwiic connect ports, all on the same I^2^C bus. Logic level converters are included for the Qwiic connect port\'s SDA and SCL lines so you do not have to worry about using the Qwiic system with 5V (or 3.3V) devices.

In addition to this, a large prototyping area is included. As shown in the image below, the Qwiic shield for Arduino has a few neat features such as a few 3-by-1 rails to help with prototyping.

[![1x3 rail Arduino Shield](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/4/qwiicShieldProtoRails.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/4/qwiicShieldProtoRails.png)

There are also buses for ground, 5V and 3.3V on the shield for Arduino outlined below.

[![Voltage and GND Rails on Arduino Shield](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/4/qwiicShieldRails.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/4/qwiicShieldRails.png)

The headers also allow for every pin on the microcontroller of your choice to still be accessed through the female headers.

### Qwiic Shield for Photon

**Note:** The shield includes headers, but they are not pre-soldered onto the board, so some assembly will be required when putting the shield together. The image below shows the shield after the header has been soldered to the PCB to.

The Qwiic shield for the Particle Photon also includes 4x Qwiic connect ports, a prototyping area, and buses for 3.3V and ground. However, they are much smaller. The Photon is a 3.3V system and assumes that you are using 3.3V devices so logic level conversion is not included in the design. If you are using a 5V based I^2^C device, be sure to grab a [bi-directional logic level converter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009).

## Hardware Assembly

To get started with your Qwiic shield, all you\'ll need to do is [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) on headers. For a detailed description of how to do this with Arduino shields, simply check out our [Arduino shield tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/arduino-shields-v2#installing-headers-preparation). It\'ll get you started with attaching those headers to your shield properly. These tips are also useful when installing the headers for the Qwiic shield for Photon.

Once you\'ve attached headers to your Qwiic shield, you\'re ready to plug it into your Qwiic enabled board of choice. Below is an example of a few Qwiic sensors daisy chained to the Qwiic shield for Arduino. If you need to mount a Qwiic sensor, just grab a few [standoffs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10927) and [screws](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10453). Plug in any Qwiic enabled board and get going!
