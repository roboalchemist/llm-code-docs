The MicroMod Main Board - Single and Double are specialized carrier boards that allow you to interface a Processor Board with a Function Board(s). The modular system allows you to add an additional feature(s) to a Processor Board with the help of a Function Board(s). In this tutorial, we will focus on the basic functionality of the Main Board - Single and Main Board - Double.

## Hardware Overview

We\'ve taken the u-blox NEO-M9N and broken the board out to a MicroMod Function Board! In this section, we will go over the main features of the Function Board.

[![u-blox NEO-M9N](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N.jpg)

For a detailed overview of the module, these integrated systems and how to use them, refer to the datasheet and integration manual linked in the Resources and Going Further.

### Power

To power the board, you will need to apply power to a SparkFun Main Board. Power applied from the M.2 connector VCC line will be regulated down with the 3.3V/600mA AP2112K voltage regulator.

[![3.3V/600mA AP2112K Voltage regulator regulating voltage from the M.2 Edge pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_power_Mdot2_edge_pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_power_Mdot2_edge_pins.jpg)

### Communication Ports

The NEO-M9N has four communication ports. You can read NMEA data over I^2^C while you send configuration commands over the UART and vice/versa. The only limit is that the SPI pins are mapped onto the I^2^C and UART pins so it's either SPI or I2C+UART. You will need select the port with the BUS SELECT jumper. The USB port is available at all times. There is a bilateral switch between the M.2 connector and the NEO-M9N\'s Serial, SPI, and I^2^C ports. The switch connects the appropriate port depending on the on the jumper position.

[![USB, Serial, SPI, I2C Ports](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_USB_Serial_SPI_I2C.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_USB_Serial_SPI_I2C.jpg)

**Note:** With the MicroMod M.2 connector, the NEO-M9N\'s UART, SPI, I^2^C ports are available without soldering! Other SparkFun NEO-M9N offerings have this capability, but only after you solder hookup wires appropriately.

### USB

The USB C connector is available for those that are interested in using the u-center software on a computer. There is a TVS diode between the USB port and NEO-M9N\'s USB data pins for protection.

[![USB Connector and TVS Diode IC](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_USB.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_USB.jpg)

**Note:** Power is not connected to the rest of the board to avoid conflicting voltages from the MicroMod system. Make sure to connect a separate power source to the MicroMod Main Board so that the MicroMod GNSS Function Board can be powered through the M.2 connector.

### I^2^C (a.k.a DDC)

The u-blox NEO-M9N has a "DDC" port which is really just an I^2^C port (without all the fuss of trademark issues). These pins are shared with the SPI pins. Connecting the `DSEL` pin to the `Serial/I2C` with the 2-pin jumper disables the SPI data bus while keeping the UART and I^2^C interface available.

[![I2C](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_UART_I2C.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_UART_I2C.jpg)

The only I^2^C address for this and all u-Blox GPS products is **0x42**, though each can have their address changed through software.

### UART/Serial

The classic serial pins are available on the NEO-M9N but are shared with the SPI pins. Connecting the `DSEL` pin to the `Serial/I2C` with the 2-pin jumper disables the SPI data bus while keeping the UART and I^2^C interface available.

- TXO/SDO = TX out from NEO-M9N
- RXI/SDI = RX into NEO-M9N

[![Serial](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_UART_I2C.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_UART_I2C.jpg)

### SPI

The NEO-M9N can also be configured for [SPI communication](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi/all#receiving-data). Connecting the `DSEL` pin to the `SPI` with the 2-pin jumper enables the SPI data bus thus disabling the UART functions on those lines. This also disables I^2^C interface.

[![SPI](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_SPI.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_SPI.jpg)

### Backup Battery

The small metal disk is a small lithium battery. This battery does not provide power to the IC like the 3.3V system does, but to relevant systems *inside* the IC that allow for a quick reconnection to satellites. The time to first fix will about **\~29 seconds**, but after it has a lock, that battery will allow for a **two second** time to first fix. This is known as a **hot start** and lasts for four hours after the board is powered down. The battery provides over a years worth of power to the backup system and charges slowly when the board is powered. To charge it to full, leave your module plugged in for 48 hours.

[![backup battery](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_backup_battery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_backup_battery.jpg)

### u.FL Connector

The MicroMod GNSS Function Board includes a u.FL connector for a secure connection with a patch antenna. Depending on the antenna, you may need a u.FL adapter to connect. The u.FL connector was added as a design choice for users that decide to place the MicroMod Main Board with the GNSS Function Board in an enclosure. With the u.FL adapter, the SMA connector can be mounted to the enclosure. For more information on working with u.FL connectors, we recommend [checking out our tutorial about using u.FL connectors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl/all).

[![u.FL connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_uFL_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_uFL_Connector.jpg)

### EEPROM

The board includes an I^2^C EEPROM. Unfortunately, this is not available for the user and was meant to hold board specific information.

[![EEPROM](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_EEPROM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_EEPROM.jpg)

### LEDs

The board includes two status LEDs.

- **3V3**: The `3V3` LED indicates when the board is powered. This LED is connected to the 3.3V line.
- **PPS**: The `PPS` LED is connected to the *Pulse Per Second* line. When connected to a satellite, this line generates a pulse that is synchronized with a GPS or UTC time grid. By default, you\'ll see one pulse a second.

[![3.3V Power and PPS LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_LEDs.jpg)

### Jumpers

The board includes a few jumpers to configure the NEO-M9N module. For more information, check out our [tutorial on working with jumper pads and PCB traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces).

- **I^2^C Pull-up Resistors** - This three way jumper labeled `I`^`2`^`C` connects two pull-up resistors to the I^2^C data lines. If you have many devices on your I^2^C data lines, then you may consider cutting these.
- **WP** - Adding solder to the jumper pad will disable write protect for the EEPROM.
- **3V3** - The jumper on the opposite side of the board with the label `3V3` is connected to the **3V3** LED. Cutting this jumper will disable the LED.
- **PPS** - The jumper on the opposite side of the board with the label `PPS` is connected to the **PPS** LED. Cutting this jumper will disable the LED.
- **Bus Select**
  - **SPI** - Connecting the `DSEL` pin to the `SPI` with the 2-pin jumper enables the SPI data bus thus disabling the UART functions on those lines. This also disables I^2^C interface.
  - **DSEL** - This pin is connected to the NEO-M9N\'s D_SEL pin to select the interface. Connecting this pin to either side will select the communication protocol.
  - **Serial/I2C** - Connecting the `DSEL` pin to the `Serial/I2C` with the 2-pin jumper disables the SPI data bus while keeping the UART and I^2^C interface available. The UART and I^2^C can also be enabled if the DSEL pin is open and not connected to either side. We recommend keeping the 2-pin jumper connected to avoid misplacing the component.
- **SAFEBOOT** - The PTH pads labeled as `SAFEBOOT` is used to start up the IC in safe boot mode, this could be useful if you somehow manage to corrupt the module\'s Flash memory. Breakaway a row of [2-pins from the header](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116), solder the pins to the board, and connect a [2-pin jumper](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9044) to enable the mode.

### Hardware Pinout

Depending on your window size, you may need to use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the table to view the additional pin functions. Note that the M.2 connector pins on opposing sides are offset from each other as indicated by the bottom pins where it says (Not Connected)\*. There is no connection to pins that have a \"-\" under the primary function.

[![Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/0/f/7/1/2/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board_NEO-M9N_Board_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/0/f/7/1/2/SparkFun_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board_NEO-M9N_Board_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Assembly

If you have not already, make sure to check out the [Getting Started with MicroMod: Hardware Hookup](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod#hardware-hookup) for information on inserting your Processor and Function Boards to the Main Board.

[](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod)

### Getting Started with MicroMod 

October 21, 2020

Dive into the world of MicroMod - a compact interface to connect a microcontroller to various peripherals via the M.2 Connector!

Insert your chosen Processor and GNSS Function board at an angle into the M.2 connector. The Processor Board will stick up at an angle (at around 25°).

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Processor_Board_Inserted_Main_Board.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Processor_Board_Inserted_Main_Board.jpg)

Hold down each board, insert the screws, and to tighten.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Tighten_Screws.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Tighten_Screws.jpg)

After securing the Processor and Function Board to the Main Board, your setup should look like the image below.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Connected_Main_Board.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Connected_Main_Board.jpg)

Insert the u.FL adapter to the MicroMod GNSS Function Board. Connect the patch antenna to the other end of the u.FL adapter. The SMA connector just needs to be finger tight to secure the antenna to the adapter..

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Connect_Antenna.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N_Connect_Antenna.jpg)

Connect a USB Type C Cable to power and program your Processor Board. In this case, we used the MicroMod Main Board - Single and MicroMod Artemis Processor. This will also power the MicroMod GNSS Function Board.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/Programming_Power_Processor_Board_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/9/Programming_Power_Processor_Board_MicroMod_GNSS_Function_Board-NEO-M9N.jpg)

For users that want to connect the NEO-M9N to u-blox\'s u-center, insert a second USB Type C cable to the MicroMod GNSS Function Board\'s USB C connector.

## Software Installation

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review the following tutorials.\
\

- [Installing the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide)
- [Installing Board Definitions in the Arduino IDE](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-board-definitions-in-the-arduino-ide)
- [Installing an Arduino Library](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

### Arduino Board Definitions and Driver

We\'ll assume that you installed the necessary board files and drivers for your Processor Board. In this case, we used the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board which uses the CH340 USB-to-serial converter. If you are using a Processor Board, make sure to check out its hookup guide for your Processor Board.

### Installing Board Definitions in the Arduino IDE 

September 9, 2020

How do I install a custom Arduino board/core? It\'s easy! This tutorial will go over how to install an Arduino board definition using the Arduino Board Manager. We will also go over manually installing third-party cores, such as the board definitions required for many of the SparkFun development boards.

### How to Install CH340 Drivers 

August 6, 2019

How to install CH340 drivers (if you need them) on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

### Arduino Library

All of our u-blox based GPS boards share the same library: this board, their [predeccesors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gps-breakout-zoe-m8q-and-sam-m8q-hookup-guide) and the higher [precision](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005) [u-blox cousins](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136). The SparkFun u-blox Arduino library can be downloaded with the Arduino library manager by searching \'**SparkFun u-blox GNSS**\' or you can grab the zip here from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library) to manually install:

[SparkFun U-blox Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library/archive/main.zip)

There are several example sketches provided that utilize the I^2^C bus to get you up and receiving messages from space. We\'ll go over one of the examples in this tutorial.

**Note:** Example 2 uses the \'**MicroNMEA**\' library by **Steve Marple**. Make sure to install the library as well by searching for it in the Arduino library manager. You could also grab the zip here from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stevemarple/MicroNMEA) to manually install.\

## Arduino Example

We\'re just going to look at example two (i.e. \"**Example2_NMEAParsing.ino**\") which in my opinion, makes it clear the awesomeness of these GPS receivers. That is to say, talking to satellites and finding out where in the world you are.

    language:c
    #include <Wire.h> //Needed for I2C to GPS

    #include "SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library.h" //Click here to get the library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS
    SFE_UBLOX_GNSS myGNSS;

    void setup()
    

      //This will pipe all NMEA sentences to the serial port so we can see them
      myGNSS.setNMEAOutputPort(Serial);
    }

    void loop()
    

When you upload this code you\'ll have to wait \~24s to get a lock onto any satellites. After that first lock, the backup battery on the board will provide power to some internal systems that will allow for a **hot start** the next time you turn on the board. The **hot start** only lasts four hours, but allows you to get a lock within one second. After you get a lock the [serial terminal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) will start listing longitude and latitude coordinates, as seen below. Make sure to set the serial monitor to **115200 baud**.

[![This image shows a screenshot of the Arduino Serial terminal spitting out latitude and longitude data.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/nmeaCapture-ublox2.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/nmeaCapture-ublox2.jpg)
