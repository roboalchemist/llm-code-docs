## Introduction

**Note:** This tutorial was originally written for [KIT-13320](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13320) but applies to the [KIT-14684](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14684). The only differences are the included buttons and thickness of the resistor leads that are included in the kit. Overall, they are functionally the same.

The [SparkFun Inventor\'s Kit for Photon](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14684), also known as the SIK for Photon, is the latest and greatest in Internet of Things kits. Whether you\'re a software developer just getting in to hardware, an electronics engineer learning software, or somewhere in between, this kit will help you get your projects hooked up to the Internet in no time.

For an overview of the Photon RedBoard and a preview of the kinds of experiments you\'ll get to build with this kit, check out the video below.

**[] Set Aside Some Time** - Each experiment in this kit has two parts, with the second half usually containing an Internet-connected component. Please allow yourself ample time to complete each experiment. You may not get through all the experiments in one sitting. Please understand that the second half of each experiment is bonus material and relies on outside services, websites and technologies, to which some of you may not have access.

### Included Materials

Here is a complete list of all the parts included in the SIK for Photon.
