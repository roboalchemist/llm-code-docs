## Introduction

So you\'ve read through the [LogicBlocks introductory tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks--digital-logic-introduction) (or the kit\'s included documentation), and are ready for some experiments!? Time to put those LogicBlocks to use!

[![XNOR circuit](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/46-experiment_XNOR_lg__1_.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/46-experiment_XNOR_lg__1_.jpg)

You\'ll be building big ol\' LogicBlock circuits like this XNOR in no time!

### Table of Contents

Here\'s a breakdown of the experiments we\'ll be exploring in this guide:

1.  [2-Input AND Gate](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/1-2-input-and-gate)
2.  [3-Input AND Gate](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/2-3-input-and-gate)
3.  [NANDs, NORs, and De Morgan\'s Laws](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/3-nands-nors-and-demorgans-laws)
4.  [Combinational Logic](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/4-combinational-logic)
5.  [Ring Oscillator](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/5-ring-oscillator)
6.  [SR Latch](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/6-sr-latch)
7.  [2-to-1 Multiplexer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/7-2-to-1-multiplexer)
8.  [1-to-2 Decoder (De-multiplexer)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/8-1-to-2-decoder-de-multiplexer)
9.  [XOR Gate](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/9-xor-gate)
10. [Beyond LogicBlocks\...](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiments-guide/logic-beyond-logicblocks)

Each experiment includes a schematics, and matching LogicBlock layouts for the circuit under test.
