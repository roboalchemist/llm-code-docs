### The Pinout

All of the Pro Micro RP2040\'s GPIO and power pins are broken out to two, parallel headers. Some pins are for power input or output, other pins are dedicated GPIO pins. Further, the GPIO pins can have special function depending on how they are multiplexed Here\'s a map of which pin is where and what special hardware functions it may have.

*Click on image for a closer view.*

**Note:** For more information on the multiplexed pins, check out \"section 1.4.3 GPIO Functions\"of the RP2040 datasheet.\
\

[RP2040 Datasheet (31.2MB)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040_datasheet.pdf)

### Power

There are a variety of power and power-related nets broken out to connectors and through hole pads. Each pad has a castellated edge. The back of the board also has the USB pins broken out for power

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [![Front of Board with Power Nets Highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_Nets-Top.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_Nets-Top.jpg)   [![Front of Board with Power Nets Highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_Nets-Bottom.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_Nets-Bottom.jpg)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These nets consist of the following:

- **V** is the voltage provided from the USB connector.
- **+** is the raw, unregulated voltage input for the Pro Micro RP2040. If the board is powered via USB (i.e. **V**), the voltage at this pin will be about 4.8V (USB\'s 5V minus a Schottky diode drop). On the other hand, if the board is powered externally, through this pin, the applied voltage can be up to **5.3V**.
- **3.3V** is the voltage supplied to the on-board RP2040. We suggest using regulated 3.3V when connecting to this pin. If the board is powered through the raw \"+\" pin, this pin can be used as an **output** to supply 3.3V other devices.
- **[RST]** can be used to **restart** the Pro Micro RP2040. There is a built-in reset button to reset the board. However, the pin is broken out if you need to access this pin externally. This pin is pulled high by a 10kΩ resistor on the board, and is **active-low**, so it must be connected to ground to initiate a reset. The Qwiic Pro Micro will remain \"off\" until the reset line is pulled back to high.
- **GND**, of course, is the common, ground voltage (0V reference) for the system.

### USB Pins

On the back of the board you can access the USB data pins and power for either USB 1.1 Host or Device.

### GPIO Pins

The Pro Micro RP2040 breaks out the GPIO pins to plated through holes pads on the edge of the board. Each pad is castellated as well.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pro Micro\'s GPIO pins --- 20 in all --- (if you include the two pins on the Qwiic connector as well) are multi-talented. Every pin can be used as a **digital input or output**, for blinking LEDs or reading button presses. These pins are referenced via an integer value between 0 and 29.

Four pins feature [analog to digital converters (ADCs)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-to-digital-conversion) and can be used as **analog inputs**. These are useful for reading potentiometers or other analog devices.

**Note:** There is an additional ADC pin that is not broken out on the RP2040. It is connected to the internal temperature sensor. While it is not broken out on the board, you can access the temperature sensor readings using examples from either the C/C++ or MicroPython SDK.

All pins can be set with the [pulse width modulation (PWM)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation) functionality, which allows for a form of **analog output**. The RP2040 can only provide a total of up to 16 controllable PWM outputs.

There are hardware [UART (serial)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication), [I^2^C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c), and [SPI](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi) pins available as well. These can be used to interface with digital devices like serial LCDs, XBees, IMUs, and other serial sensors.

The RP2040 has 26 external interrupts, which allow you to instantly trigger a function when a pin goes either high, low, or changes state.

### Qwiic Connector

The board includes a Qwiic connector to easily connect Qwiic enabled I^2^C devices to the board. SCL is connected to `GPIO17` while SDA is connected to `GPIO16`

[![Qwiic Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Qwiic_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Qwiic_Connector.jpg)

**Note:** If you decide not to use the I^2^C port with a Qwiic-enabled device, you can technically use the Qwiic cable with either male or female jumpers as GPIO pins.\

### On-Board LEDs

There are two LEDs on the Pro Micro RP2040. The red LED indicates whether **power** is present. The other is the addressable WS2812 RGB LED. The addressable LED is connected to `GPIO25`. You\'ll to define functions or use the WS2812 library to control that LED.

[![Power LED and Addressable WS2812 LED](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_LED_Addressable_WS2812_LED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Power_LED_Addressable_WS2812_LED.jpg)

There is a pad on the back of the board that is connected to the WS2812\'s DO pin. If you decide to daisy chain more LEDs, you\'ll want to solder to this pad.

### External Flash Memory

The Pro Micro RP2040 includes a W25Q128JVPIM, which adds 128Mb (16MB) of flash memory externally.

[![External Flash Memory](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_External_Flash_Memory.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_External_Flash_Memory.jpg)

### Boot Button

The boot button is connected to the external flash memory. Pressing this button forces USB boot mode so that the board shows up as a USB mass storage device.

[![Boot Button](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Boot_Button.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/17717-SparkFun_Pro_Micro_RP2040_Boot_Button.jpg)

### Reset Button

As explained earlier, there is a reset button to reset the RP2040. This adds the option of forcing the RP2040 into bootloader mode without needing to unplug/replug the board back into your USB port. To keep the board size at a minimum, the buttons are not labeled. To distinguish between the two buttons, just remember that the reset button is on the same side of the board as the reset pin.

## Hardware Hookup

Header pins were left off the Pro Micro RP2040 to allow users the flexibility of connecting any type of 0.1\" header to the board. For temporary connections to the I/O pins, you could use IC hooks to test out the pins. However, you\'ll need to [solder headers or wires of your choice to the board](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) for a secure connection. For advanced users, you could also design a PCB to take advantage of the [castellated edges](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-castellated-mounting-holes/all#introduction) for a lower profile. Here are a few tutorials to connect to the pads depending on your personal preference.

### How to Solder: Castellated Mounting Holes 

May 12, 2015

Tutorial showing how to solder castellated holes (or castellations). This might come in handy if you need to solder a module or PCB to another PCB. These castellations are becoming popular with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth modules.

**Note:** For advanced users taking advantage of the castellated edges, you can design a board with the Qwiic Pro Micro Eagle footprint.\
\

[GitHub SparkFun Eagle Library: SparkFun-Boards.lbr](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries)

In order to power and upload to the board, you will simply need a USB C cable connected to your computer.

[![Pro Micro Connected to USB C Cable and Raspberry Pi](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Raspberry_Pi_Programming_Pro_Micro_RP2040.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Raspberry_Pi_Programming_Pro_Micro_RP2040.jpg)

### Connecting to GPIO

There a few methods of connecting to the GPIO. For a temporary connection when prototyping, you can use IC hooks to connect your circuit to a breadboard. Below is an example of a basic 5mm LED connected to a 330Ω current limiting resistor on a breadboard.

[![IC Hooks](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_IC_Hooks_LED_Breadboard.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_IC_Hooks_LED_Breadboard.jpg)

For a secure connection to the Pro Micro RP2040\'s GPIO, it is recommended to [solder header pins](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering). If you designed the board using the footprint, you can also solder the board using the castellated headers. In this case, two 1x12 male header pins are being soldered to the board with the help of a breadboard.

[![Soldering Headers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Soldering_Headers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Soldering_Headers.jpg)

While originally intended to connect Qwiic-enabled devices, you can also use the SDA and SCL pins as a quick, visible test to see if the board is working. In this case, the SCL pin was used as a GPIO pin. Similar to the circuit with the IC hooks, the pin was connected to a basic 5mm LED and a 330Ω current limiting resistor on a breadboard.

[![Pro Micro RP2040 connected to LED via Qwiic connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Breadboard_LED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Breadboard_LED.jpg)

### Qwiic Enabled Device

You can also easily connect a Qwiic enabled device to the Qwiic connector. Below is an example of the Qwiic VL53L1X distance sensor and Qwiic Micro OLED connected to the Qwiic Pro Micro.

[![Pro Micro connected to a Qwiic enabled device](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Qwiic_MicroOLED_Distance_Sensor.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Pro_Micro_RP2040_Qwiic_MicroOLED_Distance_Sensor.jpg)

## UF2 Bootloader

The Pro Micro 2040 is easy to program, thanks the UF2 bootloader. With this bootloader, the board shows up on your computer as a USB storage device **without having to install drivers** for Windows 10, Mac, and Linux!

### What is UF2?

UF2 stands for USB Flashing Format, which was developed by Microsoft for PXT (now known as MakeCode) for flashing microcontrollers over the Mass Storage Class (MSC), just like a removable flash drive. The file format is unique, so unfortunately, you cannot simply drag and drop a compiled binary or hex file onto the board. Instead, the format of the file has extra information to tell the processor where the data goes, in addition to the data itself. For more information about UF2, you can read more from the [MakeCode blog](https://makecode.com/blog/one-chip-to-flash-them-all), as well as the [UF2 file format specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2).

## Software Overview

There are two methods of programming the RP2040. You can use [MicroPython or C/C++](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/) depending your personal preference. The documentation is written for the Raspberry Pi\'s Pico development board but will apply for any board with the RP2040. Just make sure to adjust the pin definition depending on what GPIO is broken out.

[Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/)

## Examples (MicroPython)

The Raspberry Pi foundation has provided the necessary tools, documentation, and examples to get started with the RP2040. If you haven\'t already, check out the documentation on the Pico. We\'ll use this as a reference when using the chip on other development boards to fit your needs in this tutorial.

[Raspberry Pi: Pico Python SDK (PDF)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/sdk/pico_python_sdk.pdf)

We\'ll be using the MicroPython examples from this repo using Thonny IDE.

### Configuring Thonny IDE

**Note:** If you are using a Raspberry Pi, make sure that you are using the latest Raspberry Pi image. Enter the following command in the LXTerminal to download and install the the latest packages. The `&&` combines the two commands into a single line and the `-y` answers \"yes\" to any prompts.\
\

``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

Check to make sure that you are using Thonny v3.3.3 and above. If you are using a Raspberry Pi, type the following command to check the version:\
\

``` bash
thonny -v
```

You should get a result similar to the output below. If you have a version that is equal or higher, you should be good to go!\
\

``` bash
INFO    thonny:Thonny version: 3.3.3
```

If you are using a different operating system, you can also [download the Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).

Open Thonny up from the start menu: **Raspberry Pi Start Menu** \> **Programming** \> **Thonny Python IDE**

[![Open Thonny IDE from the Pi Start Menu](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Open_Thonny_IDE.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Open_Thonny_IDE.jpg)

Set Thonny\'s interpreter for the RP2040. The \"Raspberry Pi Pico\" will work for the RP2040. Head to the menu and select: **Run** \> **Select Interpreter\...**.

[![Selecting Interpreter for Thonny](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_Select_Python_Interpreter.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_Select_Python_Interpreter.jpg)

This will open a new window for the Thonny options. In the **Interpreter** tab, select **MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)** as the interpreter.

In the same window, make sure to select the option to have Thonny automatically detect the COM port for the board: **Port** \> **\< Try to detect port automatically \>**

[![Select COM port](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_Select_COM_Port.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_Select_COM_Port.jpg)

**Note:** If you are on Linux based OS like the Raspberry Pi, the COM port may show up as `tty(AMA0 (/dev/ttyAMA0)`.

### Hello World!

To check if this is working open the Thonny IDE, type the following into the editor. Feel free to adjust the message to whatever you prefer.

    language:python
    print("Hello world!")

Hit the \"Run current script\" button. In the Shell, you will see the following output. Sweet!

    language:bash
    >>> %Run -c %EDITOR_CONTENT
    Hello world!

[![Hello world! printed to the Thonny Shell from the RP2040](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_RP2040_Hello_World.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_RP2040_Hello_World.jpg)

[**Note:**](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide#running-on-start) To save the file and have it run every time the board is powered up, simply select **File** \> **Save As\...** from the menu.\

\
Just make sure to save any code that was edited on your computer (e.g. **Save as\...** \> **This computer**) before closing Thonny.\
\

[![](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_RP2040_Save_As_This_Computer.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/5/6/0/Thonny_RP2040_Save_As_This_Computer.jpg)

\

**Note:** If you are using a terminal window and REPL, you will need to type the functions into the terminal window. While you can copy and paste, the terminal window will not recognize indents for loops or custom defined subroutines. As a result, the pasted code will not be interpreted correctly by REPL. You\'ll want to make sure that you are using the Thonny editor to avoid this error.

### Blink

If you have the MicroPython examples saved, head to the following folder in your downloads **\...**/**pico-micropython-examples**/**blink**/**blink.py** . Your code should look like the following. Of course, you can also copy and paste the code provided after the next paragraph as well.

Once you open it in Thonny, adjust the pin number to the GPIO that the LED is connected to. Since we are using the example that was written specifically for the Pico as opposed to the Pro Micro RP2040, we\'ll need to adjust the pin. In this case, we\'ll use the RP2040\'s **GPIO17** that is connected to the Qwiic connector so that we do not have to solder pins to the board. This is assuming that we are connecting a current limiting resistor and an LED between the **GPIO17** and **GND**.

    language:python
    # ========== DESCRIPTION==========
    # The following code was originally written by 
    # the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can find this
    # example on GitHub.
    #
    #     https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples/blob/master/blink/blink.py
    #
    # Note that the GPIO for the LED was adjusted
    # for the Pro Micro RP2040. Make sure to use 
    # a current limiting resistor with the LED.

    from machine import Pin, Timer

    led = Pin(17, Pin.OUT)
    tim = Timer()
    def tick(timer):
        global led
        led.toggle()

    tim.init(freq=2.5, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=tick)

Hit the \"Run current script\" button. Once the code runs, you will see the LED blink. If you want the board to run blink every time the board is powered up, just follow the [note provided at the end the previous example](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide#running-on-start).

### WS2812

If you have the MicroPython examples saved, head to the following folder in your downloads **\...**/**pico-micropython-examples**/**pio**/**neopixel_ring**/**neopixel_ring.py** . Your code should look like the following. Of course, you can also copy and paste the code provided after the next paragraph as well.

Once you open it in Thonny, adjust the pin number to the GPIO that the LED is connected to for `PIN_NUM`. Since we are using the example that was written specifically for the Pico as opposed to the Pro Micro 2040, we\'ll need to adjust the pin. In this case, we\'ll use the RP2040\'s **GPIO25** that is connected to the WS2812. We will also adjust the NUM_LEDs to `1`.

    language:python
    # ========== DESCRIPTION==========
    # Example using PIO to drive a set of WS2812 LEDs.
    #
    # The following code was originally written by
    # the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can find this 
    # example on GitHub.
    #
    #    https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples/blob/master/pio/neopixel_ring/neopixel_ring.py
    #
    # Note that the 'NUM_LEDs' was adjusted to 1. Also
    # the GPIO for the addressable WS2812 RGB LED called
    # `PIN_NUM` was adjusted for the Pro Micro RP2040. 

    import array, time
    from machine import Pin

    print("chases")
    for color in COLORS:       
        color_chase(color, 0.01)

    while True:
        print("rainbow")
        rainbow_cycle(0)

Hit the \"Run current script\" button. Once the code runs, it will display each color at \"0.2\" brightness. The LED will then animate. Since there is only one LED attached, it will look like it will be blinking through the colors. Once the board jumps into the while loop, the LED will begin cycling between colors smoothly. Remember, you can have the board run the example every time the board is powered up by following the [note provided in an earlier example](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro-rp2040-hookup-guide#running-on-start).
