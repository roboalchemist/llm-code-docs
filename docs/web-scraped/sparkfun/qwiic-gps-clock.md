## Introduction

What time is it? Time for you to\... Qwiic-ly build a [GPS](https://www.sparkfun.com/gps) clock and output it to a display! This project provides you with the current date and time using GPS satellites. Depending on your display, you can draw the time as a digital or analog clock. Or even configure the clock to read military time, adjust the clock for your time zone, or automatically adjust the time for daylight savings time!

We also recommend checking out these tutorials before continuing. You may also need to read additional tutorials related with your choice of display. The DST code is based on Nate\'s Alphanumeric GPS all Clock project.

### GPS Basics 

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an engineering marvel that we all have access to for a relatively low cost and no subscription fee. With the correct hardware and minimal effort, you can determine your position and time almost anywhere on the globe.

### Alphanumeric GPS Wall Clock 

This is a GPS controlled clock - a clock you truly never have to set! Using GPS and some formulas, we figure out what day of the week and if we are in or out of daylight savings time.

### SparkFun Inventor\'s Kit Experiment Guide - v4.1 

The SparkFun Inventor\'s Kit (SIK) Experiment Guide contains all of the information needed to build all five projects, encompassing 16 circuits, in the latest version of the kit, v4.1.2 and v4.1.
