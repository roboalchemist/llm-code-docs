## Introduction

**Note:** This tutorial is for the MyoWare 2 Muscle Sensor and its ecosystem. The MyoWare 2 Muscle Sensor is fully backwards compatible with the MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor. If you are using the \"V1\" version (with only 2 snaps), please refer to the older [MyoWare Muscle Sensor V1 tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/myoware-muscle-sensor-kit).

Using our muscles to control things is the way that most of us are accustomed to doing it. We push buttons, pull levers, move joysticks\... but what if we could take the buttons, levers and joysticks out of the equation and control it with our muscles? The [MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21265) is an Arduino-compatible, all-in-one electromyography (EMG) sensor from Advancer Technologies that allows you to do just that! The MyoWare 2.0 Muscle Sensor has been redesigned from the ground up with a new, easy-to-use, compact design and upgraded with the latest and greatest chipset improving sensor performance and reliability. The innovative snap connector system eliminates the need to solder connections for the [MyoWare 2.0 ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/myoware). It\'s that easy: stick on a few electrodes (not included), read the output voltage and flex some muscles! In this tutorial, we will go over the features and related shields to connect the sensor to a muscle group.

**Note:** This sensor is not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation treatment, or prevention of disease, in a person or other animals.

### Required Materials

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following materials. You may not need everything though depending on what you have. Add it to your cart, read through the guide, and adjust the cart as necessary. You\'ll need at least three biomedical sensor pads per muscle sensor each time you connect to a muscle group.

**Note:** The EMG pads are single use. You\'ll want to make sure that you have spare pads each time that you connect to a muscle group!

#### Minimum Parts

At a minimum, you will need the following parts to connect and power the muscle sensor. You can view the muscle signal from the ENV LED.

### You Will Also Need

You will also need the following.

- Alcohol Swab (Isopropyl alcohol and a cotton ball)
- USB isolator circuit (optional)

### Suggested Reading

If you aren't familiar with the following concepts, we recommend checking out these tutorials before continuing. Depending on the Arduino development board that you are using, you may need to install drivers. The RedBoards use a different USB-to-serial converter compared to the Arduino Uno. Both the Arduino Uno and the RedBoard Plus use 5V for the logic levels.
