## Which GNSS Unit Do I Pick?!

### Size and GNSS Antenna

In each of the following **Hardware Overview** sections we\'ll layout the characteristics of the GNSS boards. Let\'s begin with the more obvious differences between the boards. The SAM-M8Q is a larger board with dimensions of 1.6 x 1.6 inches. The relative larger size of the board helps to enhance the product\'s GNSS antenna that houses the GPS unit *inside*. The ZOE-M8Q is 1 x 1 inch board that does *not* have an onboard GNSS antenna, and instead has a U.FL connector to connect to an external one. This gives you the option to use something that can be attached outside while the GPS unit is inside connected to your microcontroller.

[![This picture shows the size difference between the two GPS products.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/GPS_Module_ZOE-M8Q__GPS_SAM-M8Q_Hookup_Guide-04.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/GPS_Module_ZOE-M8Q__GPS_SAM-M8Q_Hookup_Guide-04.jpg)

### GNSS Capability Comparison

The SAM-M8Q and ZOE-M8Q GNSS receivers both utilize the 72-channel u-blox M8 engine; therefore, their capabilities are so similar that the differences are negligible. The one major difference between them is that the SAM-M8Q does not connect to the Chinese BeiDou GNSS constellation.

#### SPI Interface

Both GNSS receivers support I^2^C and serial communication to receive your NMEA data. However, the ZOE-M8Q also supports a SPI interface. The SPI interface can be enabled by closing the `SPI` jumper on the bottom of the board.

[![This picture shows the SPI jumper and header on the underside of the ZOE-M8Q board.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SPI_Underside_ZOE.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SPI_Underside_ZOE.jpg)

## SparkFun ZOE-M8Q Hardware Overview

### Power

Power for this board should be **3.3V**. There is a 3.3V pin on the PTH header along the side of the board, but you can also provide power through the Qwiic connector.

### Battery

The small metal disk opposite of the Qwiic connector is a small lithium battery. This battery does not provide power to the IC like the 3.3V system does, but to relevant systems *inside* the IC that allow for a quick reconnection to satellites. The time to first fix will about **\~29 seconds**, but after the product has a lock, that battery will allow for a **one second** time to first fix. This is known as a **hot start** and lasts for four hours after the board is powered down. The battery provides over a years worth of power to the backup system and charges slowly when the board is powered.

[![This is a picture highlighting the battery opposite the large Qwiic connector.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/BATTERY.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/BATTERY.jpg)

### LEDs

There\'s a single red power LED just above the Qwiic connector to indicate that the board is powered.

[![Pictured is the RED LED just next to the large Qwiic connector that lights up when the product is powered.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/PowerLED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/PowerLED.jpg)

### Jumpers

There are three jumpers on the underside of the product, each labeled with its function. The first in the top left of the picture is a three way jumper labeled `I²C` that connects two pull-up resistors to the I^2^C data lines. If you have many devices on your I^2^C data lines, then you may consider cutting these. To the right of that jumper at the very edge of the board is the `LED` jumper. If you cut this trace it will disconnect the **Power** LED on the topside of the board. Finally, at the lower left is the `SPI` jumper that when closed enables **SPI** communication. The board defaults to I^2^C and Serial so close that if you\'d rather get your NMEA data over SPI.

[![This is a picture of the underside of the product with the three jumpers highlighted.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Jumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Jumpers.jpg)

### U.FL Connector

The U.FL connector on the board is where you will plug in your antenna. This is a compact connector for RF antennas, that has the same function as the traditional SMA connector. You may be more familiar and even own some antennas that use SMA connectors; never fear, we carry a [U.FL to SMA](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15114) cable adapter. Check out our [tutorial on using U.FL connectors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl), if this be your first.

[![Pictured is the small u.FL connector that is just right of the IC when the Qwiic connector is facing up.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/uFL.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/uFL.jpg)

### FTDI Header

At the bottom of the board we have the traditional pinout for an FTDI header. Make sure that the FTDI that you use is **3.3V** and not 5V!

[![This is a picture of the FTDI header on the left side of the board when the Qwiic connector is facing up. The top six pins can mate with an FTDI. ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/ZOE_FTDI_HEADER.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/ZOE_FTDI_HEADER.jpg)

### Qwiic and I^2^C

Next to the FTDI header at the bottom of the board, there are two pins labeled `SDA` and `SCL` which indicates the I^2^C data lines. Similarly you can just use the Qwiic connector on the left side of the picture. The [Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is made for fast prototyping by removing the need for soldering. All you need to do is plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic connector and voila!

The only I^2^C address for this and all u-Blox GNSS products is **0x42**, though each can have their address changed through software.

[![Pictured is the ZOE with the large Qwiic connector at the top highlighted and the lower two I2C through holes at the bottom left highlighted.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Qwiic_I2C_ZOE.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Qwiic_I2C_ZOE.jpg)

### SPI Header

This sets the ZOE-M8Q apart from the SAM-M8Q. On the underside of the product as mentioned above, is a jumper that can be closed to allow for SPI communication. The header is labeled for the pinout for SPI.

[![This picture highlights the longer through hole header from the underside which is labeled with \"SPI\". ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SPI_HEADER.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SPI_HEADER.jpg)

### Broken Out Pins

There are four other pins broken out: Pulse per second `PPS`, Reset `RST`, Safeboot `SAFE`, and finally the interrupt pin `INT`. The first pin `PPS` outputs pulse trains synchronized with the GNSS or UTC time grid. The signal defaults to once per second but is configurable over a wide range. Read the **u-blox Receiver Protocol Specification** in the Resources tab for more information. The reset pin resets the chip. The next pin, `SAFE` is used to start up the IC in safe boot mode. The final pin `INT` can be used to wake the chip from power save mode.

[![This picture highlights the smaller header of four through holes that are various broken out function pins from the chip.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/EXTRA_FUNCTIONALITY_HEADER.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/EXTRA_FUNCTIONALITY_HEADER.jpg)

### GNSS Capabilities

The ZOE-M8 is able to connect to up to three different GNSS constellations at a time making it very accurate for its size. Below are the listed capabilities of the GNSS unit.

## SparkFun SAM-M8Q Hardware Overview

### Power

Power for this board is **3.3V**. There is a 3.3V pin on the PTH header along the side of the board, but you can also provide power through the Qwiic connector.

### Battery

There is a small metal disk on the board, which is a small lithium battery. This battery does not provide power to the IC bus like the 3.3V system does, but to relevant systems *inside* the GNSS receiver that allow for a quick reconnection to satellites. The time to first fix will about **\~29 seconds**, but after it has a lock, that battery will allow for a **one second** time to first fix. This is known as a **hot start** and lasts for four hours after the board is powered down. The battery provides over a years worth of power to the backup system and charges slowly when the board is powered.

[![Pictured is the small battery on the upper left side of the board, if the board is oriented with the two Qwiic connectors on the sides.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SAM_battery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SAM_battery.jpg)

### LEDs

There\'s a single red power LED just above the Qwiic connector to indicate that the board is powered. There is another LED labeled `PPS` that is connected to the *Pulse Per Second* line on the GNSS chip. When connected to a satellite, this line generates a pulse that is synchronized with a GNSS or UTC time grid. By default, you\'ll see one pulse a second.

[![Pictured is the power LED on the right side just above one of the Qwiic connectors and the PPS LED on the left side of the board just below the other Qwiic connector.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SAM_LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/SAM_LEDs.jpg)

### Jumpers

There are three jumpers on the topside of the board, each labeled with its function. At the bottom right of the picture is a three way jumper labeled `I²C` that connects two 2.2kΩ pull-up resistors to the I^2^C bus. If you have many devices on your I^2^C data lines, then you may consider cutting these. Just above that jumper is the `JP2` jumper. If you cut this trace it will disconnect the **Power** LED just above the Qwiic connector. Finally, on the left side of the product is the `JP1` jumper that when cut disconnects the **PPS** LED.

[![This picture highlights two jumpers, one on the right labeled \"JP1\" and another on the left named \"JP2\". Orientation is Qwiic connectors on a horizontal plane. ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Jumpers_SAM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Jumpers_SAM.jpg)

### Chip Antenna

This GNSS unit at the center of the PCB may look a bit funky to you. In fact you may be thinking, \"Wow, that looks suspiciously like a GNSS Antenna\....\". That\'s very astute dear hookup guide peruser. This GNSS IC is actually built into the antenna giving you an all-in-one GNSS solution.

[![This picture highlights the large chip at the center of the board that is a large GNSS chip antenna.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Chip_Antenna_SAM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Chip_Antenna_SAM.jpg)

**Note:** You may be wondering why the SAM-M8Q\'s PCB is larger than the ZOE-M8Q! To maximize the reception quality, we decided to mount the SAM-M8Q on a large ground plane based on PCB layout suggestions from the u-blox integration manual. Thus the PCB is larger than the breakout board for the ZOE-M8Q.

### FTDI Header

At the top of the board, we have the traditional pinout for an FTDI header. Make sure that the FTDI that you use is **3.3V** and not 5V!

[![This picture highlights the FTDI header at the top of the board that mates directly with any standart FTDI pinout.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/FTDI_SAM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/FTDI_SAM.jpg)

### Qwiic and I^2^C

At the opposite side of the board. There are two pins labeled `SDA` and `SCL` which indicates the I^2^C data lines. Similarly, you can use either of the Qwiic connectors to provide power and utilize I^2^C. The [Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is made for fast prototyping by removing the need for soldering. All you need to do is plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic connector and voila!

The only I^2^C address for this and all u-Blox GNSS products is **0x42**, though each can have their address changed through software.

[![This picture highlights the two Qwiic connectors and the I2C header at the bottom of the board. The four lower right through holes are the I2C pins. Orientation of the board is the two Qwiic connectors on a horizontal plane with the battery at the top left.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Qwiic_Connectors_I2C_SAM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/Qwiic_Connectors_I2C_SAM.jpg)

### Broken Out Pins

There are four other pins broken out: Pulse per second `PPS`, Reset `RST`, Safeboot `SAFE`, and finally the interrupt pin `INT`. The first pin `PPS` outputs pulse trains synchronized with the GNSS or UTC time grid. The signal defaults to once per second but is configurable over a wide range. Read the **u-blox Receiver Protocol Specification** in the Resources tab for more information. The reset pin resets the chip. The next pin, `SAFE` is used to start up the IC in safe boot mode. The final pin `INT` can be used to wake the chip from power save mode.

## Hardware Assembly

### U.FL Connector

If necessary, attach an external GNSS antenna to the U.FL connector. If you need tips on plugging in the U.FL connector, then check out our [U.FL tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl). Of course, if you\'re using the SAM-M8Q then you don\'t need an antenna since it already has one.

### Serial Interface

You will need to access the serial interface of the GNSS receiver, to utilize the u-blox [u-center software](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center). The compact variant of the SAM-M8Q includes a USB-to-serial adapter and USB connector, which will allow you to connect the board directly to a computer. However for the other boards, you will need to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) male headers to the pass-through-hole (PTH) pins. This will allow you attach a [serial-to-USB adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-serial-basic-breakout-ch340c-and-usb-c.html) to the GNSS receiver, to connect the board to a computer.

### I^2^C Interface

For the example below, I used a Qwiic capable [RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15123) and [associated USB cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215). With that and a Qwiic cable, the assembly is very simple. Plug a Qwiic cable between the RedBoard and the GNSS board.

## Software Overview

### u-blox u-center Application

u-blox provides its own testing and evaluation software for its GNSS receivers, called [u-center](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center). There are two software variants available `u-center` and `u-center 2`; make sure to download and install the `u-center` variant, which is designed for u-blox M8, M9, F9, and legacy GNSS products. *(The `u-center 2` variant will not be compatible with any of these products.)*

Below, are archived links to download the u-center application and user manual. However, to find the latest release please visit the [u-center website](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center) instead.

[Download u-center (v25.06)](https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/u-center_v25.06_installer.zip) [User Manual](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/u-center_Userguide_UBX-13005250.pdf)

### SparkFun u-blox Arduino Library

**Note:** The example below, assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

Both the SAM-M8Q and ZOE-M8Q share the same library. These two also share a library with their other u-Blox [high-precision cousins](https://www.sparkfun.com/gnss/gnss-boards/high-precision-gnss-boards.html). The SparkFun u-Blox Arduino library can be downloaded with the Arduino library manager by searching **`SparkFun u-blox GNSS`**; otherwise, you can manually install the library by grabbing the `*.zip` file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library) or by clicking the button below:

[SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library/archive/main.zip)

There are 13 example sketches provided to get you up and receiving messages from space.

## Example Code

We\'re just going to look at example two (i.e. \"**Example2_NMEAParsing.ino**\" of the Arduino library) which in my opinion, makes it clear the awesomeness of these GNSS receivers. That is to say, talking to satellites and finding out where in the world you are.

    language:c
    #include <Wire.h> //Needed for I2C to GPS

    #include <SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library.h> //Click here to get the library:  http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS
    SFE_UBLOX_GNSS myGNSS;

    void setup()
    

      //This will pipe all NMEA sentences to the serial port so we can see them
      myGNSS.setNMEAOutputPort(Serial);
    }

    void loop()
    

When you upload this code, the GNSS antenna will need a clear view of the sky and you\'ll have to wait \~29s to get an initial position fix. After the initial position fix, the backup battery on the board will provide power to some internal systems and store the ephemeris data. This will allow for a **hot start** the next time you turn on the GNSS receiver. The ephemeris data is only valid for about four hours, but it allows you to get a fix within a few seconds. After you get a position fix, the [serial terminal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) will start listing longitude and latitude coordinates, as seen below. Make sure to set the serial monitor to **115200 baud**.

[![This image shows a screenshot of the Arduino Serial terminal spitting out latitude and longitude data.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/nmeaCapture-ublox2.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/6/9/nmeaCapture-ublox2.jpg)
