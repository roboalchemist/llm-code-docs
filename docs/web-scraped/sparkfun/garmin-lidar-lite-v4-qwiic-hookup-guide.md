## Introduction

The new Garmin^®^ LIDAR sensor is now easier to use, as a Qwiic device. The [Garmin^®^ LIDAR-Lite v4 (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18009), fuses the advanced measurement technology of [Garmin^®^\'s LIDAR-Lite v4](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15776) sensor with the simplicity of SparkFun\'s [Qwiic connect system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic), for rapid prototyping.
