## Overview

This tutorial will cover the various ways you can power your electronic projects. It will go into some detail about voltage and current considerations you may want to make. It will also go into the extra considerations you have to make if your project is mobile/remote or, in other words, not going to be sitting next to a wall power outlet.

If this is truly your first electronic project, you have the option of reading through this tutorial or sticking with the recommended supply for the project or development board of your choice. The [SparkFun Inventor's Kit](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11227) contains the USB cable you need for power and works fine for all the projects in the kit as well as many more advanced projects. If you\'re feeling overwhelmed, that kit is the best place to start.

*Four common ways to supply power to your project*

### Which Option Should I Pick to Power My Project?

The answer to this question largely depends on your project specific requirements.

#### USB Power

If you\'re starting off with the [SparkFun Inventor\'s Kit](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11227) or another basic development board, you will likely just need a USB cable. The [Arduino Uno](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) is an example that requires only a [USB A to B cable](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/512) to supply the power to run the example circuits in the kit. Here are a few [USB cables from our catalog to power your project from a USB port](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/71).

#### Variable DC Benchtop Power Supply

If you\'re in the business of building projects and testing circuits regularly, acquiring a [variable DC bench power supply](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9291) is highly recommended. This will allow you to set the voltage to a specific value depending on what you need for your project. It also buys you some protection as you can set a maximum current allowed. Then, if there is a [short circuit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-a-circuit/short-and-open-circuits) in your project, the bench supply will shut down hopefully preventing harm to some components in your project.

Here are a few [variable DC benchtop power supplies from our catalog](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/307).

#### AC to DC Wall Adapters

A specific [AC to DC power supply](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/298) is often used after a circuit is proven. This option is also great if you often use the same development board again and again in your projects. These wall adapters usually have a set voltage and current output, so it\'s important to make sure that the adapter you choose has the correct specifications as the project you will be powering and to not exceed those specifications. Here are a few [wall adapters from the catalog](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/308) that offer a few amps.

If your project needs a certain voltage or a bit more current from a battery, try adding a boost converter or switching regulator. You can take the varying voltage from your battery and output a set voltage 5V. Depending on the board and components used with your project, you could potentially [output 9V](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/buck-boost-hookup-guide) or [10V](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-5v1a-lipo-chargerbooster-hookup-guide#using-multiple-charger-boosters) depending on the configuration. You\'ll just need make sure to get the necessary components to build your circuit in order to output voltages higher than 5V.

## Voltage/Current Considerations

### How Much Voltage Do I Need for Project X?

This depends largely on the circuit, so there is no easy answer to this question. However, most microprocessor development boards like the Arduino Uno have a voltage regulator on board. This allows us to supply a voltage in a specified range above the regulated voltage. A lot of microprocessors and IC\'s on development boards run at 3.3V or 5V but have voltage regulators that can handle anywhere from 6V to 12V.

The power comes from a power supply and is then regulated closely by a voltage regulator so that each chip is powered at a consistent voltage even when the current draw may fluctuate at different times. Here at SparkFun, we use [9V power supplies](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/298) for many of our products that operate in the 3.3V to 5V range. However, to verify what voltages are safe, it is recommended that you check the datasheet for the voltage regulator on the development board to see what voltage range is recommended by the manufacturer.

### How Much Current Do I Need for Project X?

This question also depends on the development board and microprocessor you\'re using as well as what circuits you plan on connecting to it. If your power supply cannot give you the amount of juice the project needs, the circuit may start acting in a strange, unpredictable way. This is also known as a brown-out.

As with voltage, it\'s recommended to check the datasheets and estimate what the different bits and pieces of the circuit might need. It\'s also better practice to round up and assume your circuit will need more current than to not provide enough current. If your circuit includes elements that require massive amounts of current, like motors or large amounts of [LED](https://www.sparkfun.com/leds)s, you may need a large supply or even separate supplies for the microprocessor and the extra motors. Otherwise, the dips in power may cause the microprocessor to reset, not provide enough torque from your motor, or your LEDs may not fully light up. Again, it\'s always in your best interest to get a power supply rated for a higher current and not use the extra compared to having a supply that can\'t provide enough.

*Brown-Outs with [Daisy Chained LED Strips](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/mean-well-led-switching-power-supply-hookup-guide#daisychain)*

### Have No Idea How Much Current Your Project Draws?

Once you\'ve been playing with circuits for a while, it will be easier to estimate the amount of current your project requires. However, the common ways to figure it out experimentally are to either use a variable DC benchtop power supply that has a readout for current or to use a [digital multimeter](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9141) to measure the current going to your circuit while it\'s running. This will give you a general idea of what kind of power supply to choose for your project.

If you don\'t know how to measure current with a multimeter, please see our [multimeter tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/measuring-current).

## Connections

### How Do I Connect My Battery or Power Supply to My Circuit?

There are many ways to actually connect a power supply to your project.

[![Left to right: banana jacks, wire hookup, barrel jack, battery case, JST](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/b/d/b/e/5115786ece395f9b23000000.jpg)](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/b/d/b/e/5115786ece395f9b23000000.jpg)

*Common ways to connect a power to your circuit*

Variable benchtop power supplies commonly connect to circuits using [banana jacks](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics/temporary-connectors#banana) or [wires](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire) directly. These are also similar to the connectors found on the [multimeter probe cables](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter#probe-types).

Once a project is past the prototyping phase, it will usually end up on a [PCB](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics). If you plan on making the circuit once or twice, one can transfer the circuit to a prototyping board and wire the circuit up manually to secure project. If you plan on making the circuit more than a few times, you may want to look into [designing the circuit with a CAD software (i.e. Eagle](https://www.sparkfun.com/EAGLE)) to save time wiring the project or if you plan on shrinking the size of the overall circuit.

## Remote/Mobile Power

### Which Battery Should I Choose?

When you\'re powering a remote circuit, the same issues of finding a battery that delivers the proper voltage and current still apply. Battery life, or capacity, is a measure of total charge the battery contains. The capacity of a battery is usually rated in **ampere-hours** (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh), and it tells you how many amps a fully charged battery can supply over a period of one hour. For example, a 2000mAh battery can supply up to 2A (2000mA) for one hour.

Battery size, shape, and weight is also something to consider when making your project mobile, especially if it\'s going to be on something that flies like a small quad-copter. You can get a rough idea of the variety by visiting this [Wikipedia list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes). Learn more about battery types in our [battery technology tutorial](http://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/battery-technologies).

### Battery Technologies 

February 6, 2013

The basics behind the batteries used in portable electronic devices: LiPo, NiMH, coin cells, and alkaline.

### Batteries in Series and Parallel

You can add batteries in [series or parallel](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/series-and-parallel-circuits) to produce the desired voltage and current needed for your project. When two or more batteries are placed in **series**, the voltages of the batteries are added together. For example, lead-acid car batteries are actually made out of six single-cell lead acid batteries tied together in series; the six 2.1V cells add up to produce 12.6V. When tying two batteries in series, it\'s recommended that they be of the same chemistry. Also, be wary of charging batteries in series as many chargers are limited to single-cell charging.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/400-400/assets/9/9/8/6/a/51eef6b0ce395fe962000000.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/9/8/6/a/51eef6b0ce395fe962000000.PNG)

When you connect two or more batteries in **parallel**, the capacities add. For example, four AA batteries connected in parallel will still produce 1.5V, however the capacity of the batteries will be quadrupled.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/a/3/d/d/6/51eef9cdce395f294b000000.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/3/d/d/6/51eef9cdce395f294b000000.jpg)

### How Much Battery Capacity Do I Need For My Project?

This question is easier to answer once you have determined the amount of current that your circuit normally draws. In the following example, we will use estimation. However, it is encouraged that you measure current draw of your circuit using a [Digital Multimeter](http://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter) to get accurate results.

As an example, let's start with a circuit, estimate its current output, then select a battery and calculate how long it the circuit will run on battery power. Let's choose a [ATmega 328 microcontroller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10524) to be our brains for the circuit. It draws about 20mA under normal conditions. Let's now connect three [red LED's](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9590) and the standard [330 ohm current limiting resistors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8377) to digital I/O pins of the microcontroller. In that configuration, each LED added makes the circuit draw about 10mA more current. Now let's connect two [Micro Metal motors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8910) to the microcontroller as well. Each one of these uses approximately 25mA when turned on. Our total possible current draw is now:

[![Calculating Circuit Current Draw](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/3/3/c/8/51438101ce395f9b09000000.gif)](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/3/3/c/8/51438101ce395f9b09000000.gif)

Let's choose a standard alkaline AA battery for this because it has more than enough current capability (up to 1A), has a decent battery capacity (usually in the range of 1.5 Ah to 2.5Ah), and is very common. We\'ll assume the average is 2Ah for this example. The downside to using a AA is it only has a 1.5V output, and, since the rest of our components will run on 5V, we need to step up the voltage. We can use this [5V step-up breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10968) to get the voltage we need, or we can use three AA batteries in series to get us close to the voltage we need. Three AA's in series gives us a voltage of 4.5 V (3 times 1.5V). You could also add another battery for a total of 6V and regulate the voltage down to what your circuit requires.

To calculate how long a circuit will last on battery power, we use the following equation:

[![The equation for calculating battery life](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/e/1/9/f/51438101ce395f9909000000.gif)](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/e/1/9/f/51438101ce395f9909000000.gif)

For a circuit powered by 3 AA\'s in parallel that\'s connected to a circuit with a constant 100mA current draw, this translates to:

[![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac%7B(3*2Ah)%7D%7B100mA%7D&space;=&space;\frac%7B6000mAh%7D%7B100mA%7D&space;=&space;60h "\frac = \frac = 60h")](http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac%7B(3*2Ah)%7D%7B100mA%7D&space;=&space;\frac%7B6000mAh%7D%7B100mA%7D&space;=&space;60h)

We would ideally get 60 hours of battery life out of these three alkaline AA's in this parallel configuration. However, it's good practice to 'derate' batteries, which means to assume you're going to get less than ideal battery life. Let's conservatively say that we'll get 75% of the ideal battery life, and therefore about 45 hours of battery life for our project.

Battery life can also vary based on the actual current draw amount. Here\'s a graph from an Energizer AA battery showing its expected battery life based on constant current draw.

[![Energizer AA E91 Specifications](//cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/1/e/3/d/511580dace395f1b23000000.jpg)](//dlnmh9ip6v2u.cloudfront.net/assets/e/1/e/3/d/511580dace395f1b23000000.jpg)

## Stress Testing

Now that you have chosen your power supply and connector, make sure to test your project out and observe its behavior. Depending on the manufacturer, power supplies may have varying performances. Make sure to test the wall adapter over a certain period of time to ensure that the microcontroller won\'t brownout, and power supply won\'t reset under a load. For certain projects using capacitive touch sensors, make sure to test to see if there are any latencies caused by noisy power supplies.

If you are powering your project remotely, make sure to always test it with the battery. Batteries can provide varying outputs depending on the load attached and battery chemistry. This can also cause the microcontroller to brownout or stop providing power.
