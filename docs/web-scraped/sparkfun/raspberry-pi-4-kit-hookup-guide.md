## Introduction

**Heads up!** The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has the same mechanical footprint as both the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. This guide will show images of the Pi 4 Model B but you can still follow along with the [previous Pi Models](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-3-starter-kit-hookup-guide) to configure your Pi\'s software settings!

The improved Raspberry Pi 4 Model B \[ [2GB](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15446), [4GB](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15447), and [8GB](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16811) \] is another upgrade in the line of Raspberry Pi single board computers, what\'s new? This hookup guide goes through the same process of getting going that worked with the previous Raspberry Pi Models.

### Materials Required

You\'ll need a mouse, keyboard, monitor, wall adapter with minimum power requirements, and cables to begin. Once configured, the Pi can be operated from its own peripherals or another computer connected over the Internet.

## Kit Versions

There are three versions of the kit available at SparkFun. Each version includes a Raspberry Pi 4 with a different size RAM. Check out below for the different kit versions available!

- [Basic](#basic)
- [Desktop](#desktop)
- [Hardware Starter Kit](#hardware)

### [][Basic Kit Version](#basic)

The basic kit offers the bare bones of what you need to get up and running. This is assuming that you have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and card reader ^[\[1\]](#card_reader)^ on hand. The connectors are different on the Pi 4 so the kit provides a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable and USB-C wall adapter at a minimum. The kits include a raw microSD card and SD card adapter so that you can flash your favorite Linux distribution. A Qwiic Shim is included to easily connect a I^2^C device to the Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi 4 with either a 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB RAM is included in the kit. We also have a kit without a Raspberry Pi 4 if you already have one.

### [][Desktop Kit Version](#desktop)

The desktop kit is pretty much the basic. However, a wireless keyboard with touchpad is included. We also include a heat sink case to keep your Pi cool as a cucumber when pushing your Pi\'s processing capabilities. The power supply included in this kit is provides a modular power system with the USB Type C wall adapter and Type C to Type C USB cable. Compared to the basic kit, the raw microSD card ^[\[1\]](card_reader)^ included in this kit has a faster read/write speeds to take advantage of the Pi 4\'s processing power. This cuts the amount of time to flash or update the Linux distribution of your choice down significantly. A Raspberry Pi 4 with either a 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB RAM is included in the kit. We also have a kit without a Raspberry Pi 4 if you already have one.

## Getting an OS

**Note:** You will need a microSD card with **minimum size of at least 8GB**! Not all microSD cards are the same. This is obvious in the memory size but the performance can also vary between microSD cards. The microSD card included in the basic kit (as shown on the left) is sufficient enough to run an image on the Pi 4. The microSD card included in the desktop kit (as shown on the right) has a faster read/write speed which enables you to flash, update, or boot an image in a shorter amount of time. Programs can also load faster as well.\

If you are looking to test the performance of your microSD card, there is a tool that you can download to test how well the microSD card performs. Don\'t be alarmed by the pass/fail. A slower performing microSD card is still be sufficient to run on the Pi 4. It just means that the Pi 4 may not be running at the optimum speed. The microSD card will .

\

[Raspberry Pi SD Card Speed Test](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/sd-card-speed-test/)

The microSD card included in each kit does not have an image flashed. You\'ll need to flash a new image to the microSD card if you are just starting out or if your existing image becomes corrupt somewhere down the line. There are a few Linux-based images available depending on your application. Or feel free to power down your Pi and switch microSD cards out to experiment with a different image. For beginners, we recommend getting NOOBS. Otherwise, the Raspbian with the PIXEL desktop would be the best.

- [NOOBS (i.e. New Out-Of-the Box Software)](#noobs) - Contains Raspbian and LibreELEC. Other images can also be downloaded from the internet and installed.
- [Raspbian](#raspbian) - Official Raspberry Pi Debian-based computer operating system. There are three downloads. We recommend the desktop version with recommended software. The other downloads are the same but with less software. For advanced users, Raspbian Lite is the minimal text-only version and requires users to navigate using the command line interface (CLI).
- [Other 3rd Party OS Images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) - There are other distributions available from third-party. If you are feeling adventurous, check out the other images available!

For the scope of this tutorial, we will summarize two of the images from the Pi foundation.

### [][Flashing the Image [NOOBS]](#noobs)

If you decide to use NOOBS, you will need to:

- **Insert** the microSD card into a card reader.
- **Download** the ZIP file for NOOBS.\
  \

  ::: 
  [Download NOOBs from the Pi Foundation Here!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/)
  :::

  \
- **Extract** the ZIP file.
- **Format** your Raspberry Pi\'s microSD card if needed.
- **Copy** all the contents from the unzipped folder into the microSD card.
- **Eject** the microSD card from your computer.

### [][Flashing the Image [Raspbian and 3rd Party OS Images]](#raspbian)

**Note:!** There are several tools available to flash your image distribution to a microSD card. For the scope of this tutorial, we\'ll assume that you are using the [Raspberry Pi Imager for your OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). Make sure to install the software before continuing further.

Then follow the steps below to flash an image using the Raspberry Pi Imager.

- **Insert** the microSD card and card reader into your computer\'s port.
- Open the **software imaging tool** ^[\[2\]](#alt_software_imagers)^ of your choice (in this case, we\'ll use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) for your OS but you can use other images as well).\
  \

  ::: 
  [Download the Latest Raspbian Here!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) [Download a 3rd Party OS Here!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
  :::

  \
- Press **CHOOSE OS** to select the Operating System from the list (in this case, we\'ll use one of the Raspbian images but you could use any of the 3rd party images ).
- Press **CHOOSE SD CARD** to select mounted microSD Card.
- Press **Write** (it will take a while depending on the image and microSD card so just do a little dance as you wait).
- **Eject** the microSD card when finished.

[][\[2\]](#alt_software_imagers) **Note:** Check out this [extensive guide to flashing images to a microSD card](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sd-cards-and-writing-images). You could use Etcher.io, Win32DiskImager, or a command line tool depending on your personal preference.\

### Attaching a Heat Sink Enclosure [Optional]

**Note:** Under normal conditions, the Pi 4 can be run without the need for a heat sink enclosure. However, adding a heat sink will help prevent the Raspberry Pi 4 from throttling when you are pushing the Pi to its limits, such as running multiple displays at once. The following instructions are for those that are using the Raspberry Pi 4 with a heat sink enclosure. The basic kit does not include the heat sink enclosure. Make sure to add it to your cart with your favorite color!\

If you are using the heat sink enclosure, grab the thermal pad that matches the size of the Pi\'s CPU. Remove the thin, clear plastic film and paper from both sides of the thermal pad. Attach the side that had the paper to the Pi\'s CPU. There are thermal pads shaped for other IC and can be added on those chips as well. However, those do not get hot.

[![Thermal Pad](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_4_Thermal_Tape.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_4_Thermal_Tape.jpg)

Grab the top of the heat sink case with the cutout for the GPIO pins and place it on the Pi. If you are using the DSI port or Raspberry Pi camera, now would be good time to insert the ribbon cable between the Pi and the top of the heat sink.

### Attaching Peripherals

Attach desired consumer computer equipment. At a minimum to get up and running or navigate through the Pi, we recommend using a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The following images will use a Pi without an enclosure to show where to connect the peripherals.

#### Monitor

Using a monitor with a HDMI port ^[\[3\]](#monitor_adapter)^, insert the HDMI end of the cable to the connector. Then connect the mini-HDMI end of the cable to the connector. Note that the Pi 4 has two mini-HDMI outputs. You will need to connect to the **HDMI0** port. closest to the USB-C connector.

#### Keyboard and Mouse

Connect a keyboard and mouse to the USB ports. In this case, we were using a wireless keyboard and mouse that had a USB dongle. While you can insert the HID device into any USB port, we recommend connecting it to the USB 2.0 port so that you have the faster USB 3.0 ports (with blue) are available for certain devices (i.e. flash drives).

The Qwiic SHIM is not intended to be used with the heatsink case, as it prevents the case from properly connecting with the single board computer. The top of the case needs to be off should you use the SHIM or decide to use an [extension header \[ PRT-16764 \]](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16764) in conjunction with a Pi HAT. You can also use an [extension header \[ PRT-16763 \]](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16763) with the Pi Wedge\'s IDC cable. Note the differences in the pin length. The header with 7.30mm pin length uses three plastic spacers, which cover the pins more when using a HAT or the Pi Wedge\'s IDC cable.\

The height of the enclosure and PCB varies depending on the design. The image below shows a Pi 3 in the enclosure. The overall height of the enclosure is lower than the Pi 4\'s heat sink enclosure so one 2x20 extension header was needed when stacking the Qwiic pHAT v2.0 on the Pi. You may need to stack additional extension headers so that the boards have enough clearance when using other enclosures and HATs.\

## Methods of Working with the Pi

Once the Pi is configured, there are a few methods of using it depending on if you want to use it like a desktop or manage it remotely.

This section covers using the Pi in the following ways

- **[Using HDMI-out with Monitor](#hdmi)** \-- Operate your Pi like a desktop computer.
- **[Headless without a Monitor](#headless)**
  - **Using the serial terminal** \-- Some functionality.
  - **Using SSH** \-- Operate through a network linked to another computer.
  - **Using VNC** \-- Control the Pi\'s graphical desktop remotely over the Internet using a computer. This is useful if you decide to remotely connect to a Pi that may or may not be connected to a monitor.

### [][Using HDMI-out [with a Monitor]](#hdmi)

If this is the first time you are booting NOOBS, you\'ll need to connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor and follow the installer. In the window, select **Raspbian Full \[RECOMMENDED\]** and click on the button to **Install**. You\'ll need to be patient as the software installs the OS to the microSD card. Once finished, click on **OK**. This will restart the Pi.

#### PIXEL Desktop (GUI)

By selecting NOOBS with Raspbian, it automatically logs in and starts a graphical user interface. Once the desktop installs, follow the wizard to configure your Raspberry Pi! You\'ll need to configure the settings based on your region, monitor, keyboard, Internet settings, and password. It is best to have the Pi check for updates and restart for the changes to take effect.

[![Set Up Wizard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_PIXEL_Desktop_Init_Setup_1.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_PIXEL_Desktop_Init_Setup_1.png)

If you ever need to update the settings, just head to the **Raspberry Pi Start Menu** \> **Preferences** \> **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.

[![Raspberry Pi Configuration from Start Menu](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_Configuration_Desktop.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_Configuration_Desktop.png)

A window will pop up allowing you to easily update the region, monitor, keyboard, password, and turn on any peripherals.

[![Raspberry Pi Configuration](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Preferences_Raspberry_Pi.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Preferences_Raspberry_Pi.png)

**Warning:** We recommend changing your password from the default to secure your Raspberry Pi. Make sure to write down the password somewhere safe before saving! You can also change the username as well.

As for the Internet settings, simply click on the \"Wireless & Wired Network icon\" in the menu bar. This should be by the clock on the upper right corner of the screen. Then select the network and enter its respective password.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

If configured to boot to shell, log in with the following credentials:

     **username**: `pi`\
     **password**: `raspberry`

Then, enter in the command line to enter a graphical environment should you decide to take advantage of the desktop-type menu-driven operating system.

    language:bash
    startx

If you need to get back to text land, you can either

- Log off through the Task Bar Menu
  - drops back to the shell, closing down the X window system
- Open xterm from the Task Bar
  - opens a shell in a graphical window
- Use [CTRL]+[ALT]+[1] through [CTRL]+[ALT]+[8]
  - gives you a number of shells, with 7 being the graphic environment (if loaded).

Remember, shutdown with the task bar menu or enter the following command from a shell, and wait for the system to halt before removing power ^[\[6\]](#shutdown)^.

    language:bash
    sudo shutdown -h now

[][\[6\] ⚡**Warning:**](#shutdown) Removing power before properly shutting down will corrupt your Raspberry Pi\'s image. Make sure that you properly shut down before removing power from the Pi. Alternatively, you could write a [Python script to turn off the Pi using a GPIO](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-safe-reboot-and-shutdown-button).\

Safely reboot or shutdown your Raspberry Pi to avoid corrupting the microSD card using the built-in general purpose button on the Qwiic pHAT v2.0!

### [][Headless [without a Monitor]](#headless)

As an alternative, you can also log into the Pi as a \"headless\" computer. This is basically a Raspberry Pi without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. You can decide to connect to the Pi using a serial UART or SSH. For advanced users, you will need to turn on the interfaces before you can take advantage of these setups.

### How to Use Remote Desktop on the Raspberry Pi with VNC 

July 9, 2018

Use RealVNC to connect to your Raspberry Pi to control the graphical desktop remotely across the network.

## Configuring the Pi

This section goes over configuring the keyboard, wired, and wireless internet.

The Raspbian distribution comes defaulted to European hardware. With US keyboards, the [\"] (quotation mark) symbol is replaced by [@] (commercial at) and our number sign [\#] is replaced by the European pound sign [£]. This can make it aggravating when trying to `#define` things.

### PIXEL Desktop (GUI)

The easiest method of configuring the Pi is using the PIXEL desktop. For those that need to adjust the settings again after the initial setup, check below!

#### Configuring the Keyboard Layout

To configure the keyboard layout again, head to the Task Bar Menu by clicking the **Pi Start Menu** \> **Preferences** \> **Raspberry Pi Configuration** \> **Localisation** \> **Set Keyboard\...**.

[![Raspberry Pi Configuration Region](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_Configuration_Region.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Raspberry_Pi_Configuration_Region.png)

#### Configuring the Internet Interfaces

Raspbian does a good job of configuring wireless networks automatically. By default, DHCP is configured so that the Pi will receive an IP address when a network cable is plugged it to the Ethernet port or when a wireless network is connected.

To use the graphical network tool, right click on the icon on the right side of the task bar, and click \"WiFi Networks (dhcpcdui) Settings\". Then, select the interface desired (wlan0 or eth0) to disable the DHCP and set your own IP, if necessary.

To connect to a wireless network, click on the icon, select the desired network, and enter the password.

[![Raspberry Pi Wireless and Wired Connections Icon Desktop](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Wireless_Wired_Network_Icon_Raspberry_Pi.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/3/1/Wireless_Wired_Network_Icon_Raspberry_Pi.png)

Hovering over the icon will bring up a status of wlan0 and eth0 that also shows the IP address.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

For advanced users using the command line, you can use the CLI to adjust the settings. Open a Terminal Window to configure the Raspberry Pi.

#### Configuring the Keyboard Layout

Invoke the config tool with the following command in the command line:

    language:bash
    sudo raspi-config

Then take the following actions to change the keyboard settings. We\'ll change the settings to US in the following example. If you are in another region, just select the option that best fits your preferences:

- **Set the default locale for the system**
  - Select \"**Internationalisation Options**\"
  - Select \"**Change Locale**\"
  - Deselect **en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8**
  - Select **en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8**, (Ok)
  - Set **default to en_US.UTF-8**, (Ok)\
    \
- **Change the keyboard layout** \-- from the Internationalisation Options menu,
  - Change **Keyboard Layout**
  - Leave set as: **Generic 105-key (Intl) PC** (Ok)
  - Select **Other** (Ok)
  - Select **English (US)** (Ok)
  - Select **English (US)** (Ok)
  - Select **default** (Ok)
  - Select **No compose key** (Ok)
  - Set **Ctrl+Alt+Bksp function** (Ok)\
    \
- **Finish with the dialog and get back to the shell**
  - Try the [\"] and [\#] keys at the prompt.

We recommend restarting the Pi at this point to ensure that the changes take effect.

#### Changing Your Password

Type the following command to change the password.

    language:bash
    sudo passwd

You will be prompted to enter your new password. Type in your new password, and your Pi will be that much more secure from unwanted visitors.

**Warning:** If this is the first time booting up your Raspberry Pi, we recommend changing your password from the default to secure your Raspberry Pi. Make sure to write down the password somewhere safe before saving! You can also change the username as well.

#### Configuring the Internet Interfaces

At this time, the network configuration works out of the box so there\'s really nothing to configure, but in case something goes awry, here\'s the basics of what can be played with and a known-working configuration to compare with.

A configuration file, `interfaces`, configures both wired and wireless devices. Enter the following command into a terminal to edit the interfaces file.

    language:bash
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

Replace \"nano\" with \"leafpad\" if you prefer graphics. Here\'s what our Pi 3 is using:

    language:bash
    # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)

    # Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
    # For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

    # Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
    source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    iface eth0 inet manual

    allow-hotplug wlan0
    iface wlan0 inet manual
        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

    allow-hotplug wlan1
    iface wlan1 inet manual
        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

By default, this file is set up to get its configuration from `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`, which is really the proper place for wifi information. Here are the contents:

    language:bash
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1

    network=

**A note on network configuration:** Try the GUI tool first, and only modify the files as a last resort. If you find the tool doesn\'t work, save your configuration files as a backup, and don\'t be afraid to try your hand at a manual configuration.

#### Applying the Changes

Sometimes the link should be cycled for a new configuration to take. Rather than shutting down the pi and restarting, use `ifdown` and `ifup` to bring the link down and back up.

For **wireless** connections, use

    language:bash
    sudo ifdown wlan

and

    language:bash
    sudo ifup wlan0

For **wired** connections, use

    language:bash
    sudo ifdown eth0

and

    language:bash
    sudo ifup eth0

### Updating Software

Software packages are constantly updated. Luckily, Linux uses a package manager. All we have to do is tell our package manager to update everything, and then sit back and watch. Make sure to update the image so that we have the latest distribution. Enter the following commands in the command line individually to update your image.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get update

This will go fetch the latest package information and tell the package manager what needs to be updated.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get upgrade

This will download and upgrade all the packages. Please note that this upgrade will take a while. It will also prompt you if this is really what you want to do, the correct answer is \"[Y]\".

**Note:** By replacing the argument `upgrade` to `dist-upgrade`, the apt-get tool will automatically update or remove any unnecessary dependencies.\
\

    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

If needed, type the following command to restart.

    language:bash
    sudo reboot 

#### **What\'s the difference between `apt` vs `apt-get`?**

The `apt-get` command is older and has more functionality. It\'s meant for system use, low level interfaces, or scripts. The tool is backward compatible and predictable.\
\
The `apt` command is newer, user friendly, and includes a progress bar as the packages are installed. The `apt` command combines commonly used functions from `apt-get`, `apt-cache`, and `apt-config` into one simplified tool. There may be additional options and output. It\'s meant to be for the Linux user and high level interfaces. The tool is continually being developed and commands may change in the future.\
\
Overall, both `apt` and `apt-get` function the same. However, the syntax is slightly different between the two.

Over time, you\'ll start accumulating old packages during updates. To save space and remove unnecessary packages that were automatically installed that are no longer needed, you can enter the following command. It will also prompt you if this is really what you want to do, the correct answer is \"[Y]\".

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get autoremove

Then clear the package cache by entering the following command.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get clean

### Other Useful Linux Commands

A few other useful commands for use in the terminal command line:

- `pwd` - Print Working Directory, if you\'re not sure what folder you are in this will tell you where you are in the filesystem.
- `ls` - List, this will show you the contents of the folder. To show all files, including hidden ones, type `ls -a` to show all files/folders. Alternatively, typing `ls -al` will show you all files/folders as well as their permission settings.
- `cd` - this is how you change directories.
  - `cd foldername` - will move you to that folder.
  - `cd ..` - will back you up one level.
  - `cd ~` - will take you back to your home directory.
- `passwd` - this will allow you to change your password
- `man` - this stands for manual. Type man before a command to get a summary of how to use it.
- `nano` - this will open a basic text editor that is fairly easy to use.

At this point you should be interacting with your Raspberry Pi like you would any other computer. You can teach yourself the finer points of Linux, learn Python, program the GPIO pins, setup a minecraft server, build a network storage system, game console, or media center, or just surf the web.
