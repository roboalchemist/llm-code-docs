## Introduction

[] **Important!** This tutorial is for the [SparkFun Tinker Kit (KIT-18577)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18577). If you are using one of the previous versions of the Tinker Kit: [KIT-14556](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14556) or [KIT-13930](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13930), you\'ll want to refer to their respective guides:\

KIT-14556 - [Activity Guide for SparkFun Tinker Kit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/activity-guide-for-sparkfun-tinker-kit)

KIT-13930 - [Experiment Guide for SparkFun Tinker Kit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-the-sparkfun-tinker-kit)

The SparkFun Tinker Kit is your starter tool kit for beginning with embedded electronics, robotics and citizen science using the SparkFun RedBoard Qwiic without breaking the bank. This guide contains all the information you will need to explore the 11 circuits of the Tinker Kit. At the center of this guide is one core philosophy \-- that anyone can (and should) play around with cutting-edge electronics in a fun and playful way.
