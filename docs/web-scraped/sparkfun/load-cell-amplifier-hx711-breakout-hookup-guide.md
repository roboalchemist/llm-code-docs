If you are planning on using [load sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10245)^[1](#fn1)^ you will need to obtain or purchase four units. We recommend our [Combinator Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13878) to make it easy to turn the four strain gauges into a wheatstone bridge type load cell. (Single strain gauge load cells only have three wires instead of four.)

## Load Cell Setup

Depending on the type of load cell you are using, the configuration of how it should be hooked up to plates or surfaces will change. We\'ll list a few different types of setups below.

[![Four types of strain gauge load cells, two bar load cell and two disc load cells](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-05.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-05.jpg)

*A selection of different load cells*

### Bar-Type Load Cell

Usually with larger, non-push button bar load cells you will want to hook up the load cell between two plates in a \"Z\" shape.

[![Two bar strain gauge load cells](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-06.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-06.jpg)

*Bar strain gauge based load cells*

As shown below, the bar-type load cell is mounted with fitting screws and spacers so that the strain can be correctly measured. Note that only one side of the load cell is screwed into each board when a bar-type load cell is placed between two plates. This provides a moment of force, or torque, on the strain gauge rather than just compression force, which is easier to measure and much more accurate.

[![Bar strain gauge load cell set up in a \"Z\" formation between two plates](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-02.jpg)

*Bar load cell between a two plate configuration*

### S-Type Load Cell

S-type load cells can measure compression, tension, or both due to its design.

[![S Type Load cell](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/parts/1/2/2/3/8/14282-01.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/parts/1/2/2/3/8/14282-01.jpg)

Besides placing the load cell between plates, the s-type can be used to measure suspended tanks or hoppers. You can think of this as a load attached to a crane. Below is an s-type load cell with two threaded, rod end bearings.

[![S type load cell hooked up to two loops](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/S_cell2.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/S_cell2.JPG)

*S-type load cell configuration*

### Single, Strain Gauge Load Cells (i.e. Load Sensors)

For single, strain gauge load cells, they can be placed at equal distances with respect to each other underneath a platform.

[![load cell](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/4/5/9/5/10245-01a.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/4/5/9/5/10245-01a.jpg)

The image below shows four, single strain gauge (i.e. the load sensor) arranged in a wheatstone bridge configuration. This configuration is also possible with four button-type load cells.

*SparkFun\'s strain gauge load cell combinator board hooked up to a home scale, possible four disc load cell configuration in something like a bathroom scale*

**Note:** If you are hooking together four of the [SparkFun Load Sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10245) using the [Combinator board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13878), you should position the four load sensors **equidistant** from each other, just like the bathroom scales shown in this tutorial.

### Button/Disk-Type Load Cells

For smaller, push-button or disc load cells, you will want to make sure to screw in the disc to a bottom plate (or surface you are measuring force against), and center the beam, plate, or whatever else you are wishing to measure the force of onto the \"button\" on the top.

[![Two disc strain gauge load cells](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-07.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-07.jpg)

Usually another plate with a hole is used to make sure whatever you are measuring is hitting the same spot on the load cell each time, but it is not necessary. Below are images of four button-type load cells placed at equal distances with respect to each other under a platform. Make sure to read the datasheet for the load cell you are using and get the correct screws to fit into it.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Variances in Measurements

Load cell measurements can be off by +/- 5% due to a range of things including temperature, creep, vibration, drift, and other electrical and mechanical interferences. Before you install your scale, take a moment and design your system to allow for easy calibration or be able to adjust the code parameters to account for these variations.

## Hardware Hookup 

The HX711 Load Cell Amplifier accepts five wires from the load cell. These pins are labeled with colors; **RED, BLK, WHT, GRN, and YLW**.

[![Sparkfun\'s HX711 load cell amplifier breakout board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/13879-04_HX711_Breaout_Board.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/13879-04_HX711_Breaout_Board.jpg)

These colors correspond to the conventional color coding of load cells, where red, black, green and white wires come from the strain gauge on the load cell and yellow is an optional ground wire that is not hooked up to the strain gauge but is there to ground any small outside EMI (electromagnetic interference). Sometimes instead of a yellow wire there is a larger black wire, foil, or loose wires to shield the signal wires to lessen EMI.

[![Different strain gauge load cell output wires](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-10.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/HX711_and_Combinator_board_hook_up_guide-10.jpg)

*Here we have a large black wire, some loose wires, and foil and loose wires respectively as EMI buffers*

In general, each load cell has four strain gauges that are hooked up in a **wheatstone bridge** formation as shown below.

[![Load cell wiring, wheatstone bridge formation](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/Wheatstone-Bridge-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/Wheatstone-Bridge-02.jpg)

*Four strain gauges (SG1 through 4) hooked up in a wheatstone bridge formation*

The four wires coming out from the wheatstone bridge on the load cell are \"usually\":

  Wheatstone Bridge Node                           \"Typical\" Wire Color
  ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------
  Excitation+ (E+) or VCC                          RED
  Excitation- (E-) or GND                          BLACK or YELLOW
  Output- (O-), Signal- (S-), or Amplifier- (A-)   WHITE
  O+, S+, or A+                                    GREEN or BLUE

Some load cells might have slight variations in color coding such as blue instead of green or yellow instead of black or white if there are only four wires (meaning no wire used as an EMI buffer). You might have to infer a little from the colors that you have or check the datasheet on the load cell, but in general you will usually see these colors.

If the readings from the HX711 are opposite of what you are expect (for example the values decrease as you increase weight) simply reverse the O+/O- wires.

[![Strain gauge load cell hooked up to SparkFun\'s HX711 amplifier breakout board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Load_cell_combinator_tutorial_updates-04.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Load_cell_combinator_tutorial_updates-04.jpg)

*Load cell wires hooked up to the [HX711 Amplifier board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13230)*

Once the load cell is is hooked up to the amplifier, you can hook up VDD, VCC, DAT, CLK, and GND to a microcontroller such as a [RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757) or [Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113) board.

**Note:** VCC is the analog voltage to power the load cell. VDD is the digital supply voltage used to set the logic level.

**PRO TIP:** In many cases, you can just short VCC and VDD together. If your microcontroller uses 3.3V logic however, you\'ll want to connect VCC to 5V and VDD to 3.3V.

The example code has **DAT and CLK** hooked up to **pin 3 and 2** respectively, but this is easily changed in the code. Any GPIO pin will work for either. Then VCC and VDD just need to be hooked up to **2.7-5V** and GND to ground on your microcontroller.

### [][Strain Gauges with the Load Cell Combinator Board](#combinator)

Now, if you would like to set up four single load sensors with our [combinator board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13878) and amplifier, connect the five pins labeled RED, BLK, WHT, GRN, YLW on the combinator to the matching pins on the amplifier. Next, connect each of the four load sensors to the following pins:

**Note:** The combinator board also has room for an [8 pin RJ45 socket](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/643), which can be used to connect your project via [Ethernet cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8915) for long distance applications.\

Another nice thing about our combinator board is that most home scales use four single strain gauge load sensors, so this is a handy board for hacking your own scales at home!

[![SparkFun\'s strain gauge load cell combinator board hooked up to a home scale](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Load_cell_combinator_tutorial_updates-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Load_cell_combinator_tutorial_updates-02.jpg)

*Hacked home scale\'s four load sensors hooked up to our combinator board*

For load sensors, there isn\'t a set color coded standard. The hacked home scale can have different wire colors. Comparing the scale pictured above with the load sensor schematic, while the black wires matched, the red and white wires were swapped. Also, only two of the four sensors used a white wire for the \'center tap\' of the load sensor, the other two used green. I connected the black wires to \"**-**\", the red to \"**+**\", and the white and green wires to \"**C**\".

[![Schematic of Single Strain Gauge load sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/20100816-3wirestraingauge.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/8/3/20100816-3wirestraingauge.png)

*Example of a single strain gauge, or load sensor. Here RED is the center tap*

To determine how to hook up your single strain gauge load cells to the combinator, [measure the resistance with a multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter#measuring-resistance) between the three wires. You should find a larger resistance (close to double) between a pair. In our example, the resistance between red and black was 1.6 kΩ (i.e. 1600Ω), and the resistance between white/green and red was 800 Ω. Therefore, the center tap to the strain gauge is the white/green wire. The center tap or center pin of your strain gauge connects to the \"C\" pin on the combinator. The larger resistance wires (red and black in this example) connect to the \"+\" and \"-\" pins on the combinator.

The combinator board hooks up the four load sensors in such a way that two resistors in the wheatstone bridge configuration are constant values and the other two are variable in this way:

[![Singe Strain Load Sensors Connected in Wheatstone Bridge Configuration using Combinator](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Wheatstone_Bridge_Load_Sensor_bb_Fritzing.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/Wheatstone_Bridge_Load_Sensor_bb_Fritzing.jpg)

Once you have the combinator board successfully soldered to the twelve wires, you can now connect it to the HX711 amplifier board via the 4 standard load cell wires. Connecting the yellow pin is optional. You can use short jumper wires or if your electronics are a long distance away from your scale consider using an RJ45 connector and an ethernet cable to connect the combinator to the HX711 amplifier.

[![Singe Strain Load Sensors Connected in Wheatstone Bridge Configuration using Combinator, HX711, and RedBoard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/SparkFun_Wheatstone_Bridge_Load_Sensor_HX711_bb_Fritzing.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/4/6/SparkFun_Wheatstone_Bridge_Load_Sensor_HX711_bb_Fritzing.jpg)

When finished, your setup should look similar to the image below. Make sure to secure the wires before placing it in an enclosure.

## Installing the HX711 Arduino Library and Examples

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

### Arduino Library

Now that you have your load cell, amplifier, and microcontroller hooked up, you can add your code and start calibrating your setup. You will need to download the excellent HX711 library from user **bogde**. As of the writing of this tutorial, [the library has been tested](https://github.com/bogde/HX711#hardware-support) on ATmega328P, ESP8266, ESP32, and STM32. Open the Arduino IDE\'s library manager and search for \"**HX711 Arduino Library**\". Click on the library to install. You can also download the **\*.ZIP** file from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bogde/HX711) to manually install the library.

## Arduino Example

The first thing you will want to work with is the calibration code \"*SparkFun_HX711_Calibration.ino*\" from the SparkFun examples.

     This is the calibration sketch. Use it to determine the calibration_factor that the main example uses. It also
     outputs the zero_factor useful for projects that have a permanent mass on the scale in between power cycles.

     Setup your scale and start the sketch WITHOUT a weight on the scale
     Once readings are displayed place the weight on the scale
     Press +/- or a/z to adjust the calibration_factor until the output readings match the known weight
     Use this calibration_factor on the example sketch

     This example assumes pounds (lbs). If you prefer kilograms, change the Serial.print(" lbs"); line to kg. The
     calibration factor will be significantly different but it will be linearly related to lbs (1 lbs = 0.453592 kg).

     Your calibration factor may be very positive or very negative. It all depends on the setup of your scale system
     and the direction the sensors deflect from zero state

     3 -> DOUT
     5V -> VCC
     GND -> GND

     Most any pin on the Arduino Uno will be compatible with DOUT/CLK.

     The HX711 board can be powered from 2.7V to 5V so the Arduino 5V power should be fine.

    #include "HX711.h"

    #define DOUT  3
    #define CLK  2

    HX711 scale;

    float calibration_factor = -7050; //-7050 worked for my 440lb max scale setup

    void setup() 

    void loop() 
    }

Once you have calculated your calibration factor of your load cell set up, you can move on to other code, such as the simple scale output example code, \"*SparkFun_HX711_Example.ino*\":

     This example demonstrates basic scale output. See the calibration sketch to get the calibration_factor for your
     specific load cell setup.

     The HX711 does one thing well: read load cells. The breakout board is compatible with any wheat-stone bridge
     based load cell which should allow a user to measure everything from a few grams to tens of tons.
