### Qwiic Shield for Arduino & Photon Hookup Guide 

Get started with our Qwiic ecosystem with the Qwiic shield for Arduino or Photon.

## Hardware Overview 

Listed below are some of the operating ranges and characteristics of the Qwiic Micro OLED.

  Characteristic   Range
  ---------------- ----------------------------------------
  Voltage          3.3V
  Temperature      -40°C to 85°C
  I^2^C Address    0X3D (Default) or 0X3C (Closed Jumper)

### Pins

Power and I^2^C pins are broken out to the 1x4 PTH pins as well as the two horizontal Qwiic connectors.

  Pin    Description   Direction
  ------ ------------- -----------
  GND    Ground        In
  3.3V   Power         In
  SDA    Data          In
  SCL    Clock         In

### Jumpers

There are several jumpers on board that can be changed to facilitate several different functions. The first of which is the I^2^C pull-up jumper to disable the 2.2kΩ pull up resistors on the I^2^C data and clock lines, highlighted below. If multiple boards are connected to the I^2^C bus, the equivalent resistance goes down, increasing your pull up strength. If multiple boards are connected on the same bus, make sure [only one board has the pull-up resistors connected](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/i2c-at-the-hardware-level).

[![I2C Pull-Up Jumper](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/pu.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/pu.PNG)

The ADDR jumper (highlighted below) can be used to change the I^2^C address of the board. The default jumper is open by default, pulling the address pin high and giving us an I^2^C address of **0X3D**. Closing this jumper will ground the address pin, giving us an I^2^C address of 0X3C.

[![Address Jumper](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/addr.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/addr.PNG)

### Board Dimensions

**Revision Change:** For V11, we have optimized the two mounting hole locations to match the mounting holes located on a standard 1.0\" x 1.0\" Qwiic-sized board. The overall functionality of the Qwiic Micro OLED breakout board is the same as the previous version!

The overall board size is 1.08\" x 1.17\". There is a v-score for users that want to remove the mounting holes.

## Hardware Assembly 

If you haven\'t yet [assembled your Qwiic Shield](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-shield-for-arduino--photon-hookup-guide), now would be the time to head on over to that tutorial. With the shield assembled, SparkFun\'s Qwiic environment means that connecting the screen could not be easier. Just plug one end of the Qwiic cable into the OLED display, the other into the Qwiic Shield and you\'ll be ready to start displaying images on your little display.

[![Qwiic Micro OLED Connected to Arduino and Qwiic Shield](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/Qwiic_OLED-03.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/Qwiic_OLED-03.jpg)

If you have a built-in Qwiic connector, you can skip the hardware assembly of the Qwiic Shield and simply insert a Qwiic cable between the two boards. Have more than one Qwiic-enabled device? You can daisy chain it to the board as well! Below is an example with the RedBoard Qwiic, SAM-M8Q, and the Qwiic Micro OLED daisy chained together.

[![Qwiic Micro OLED Connected to RedBoard Qwiic and Qwiic GPS(SAM-M8Q)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/6/3/Qwiic_GPS_Clock_microOLED_Arduino_RedBoard.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/6/3/Qwiic_GPS_Clock_microOLED_Arduino_RedBoard.jpg)

**Note:** The initial launch of the Qwiic micro OLED breakout board had the OLED loosely attached to the breakout board. For users that received those boards, be careful handling it! You can either use your own enclosure for the OLED display, or you can use some double sided foam tape for a less permanent solution.\

## Micro OLED Examples

**Note:** The following examples has been updated to reflect changes in the Micro OLED Arduino Library.

### Example: Feature Demo

This first example demonstrates many of the available features of the screen through several applications. Keep in mind when looking at this example that drawing anything takes two steps. You must first write what you want the screen to display into the screens memory, then you must tell the screen to display what is in its memory.

To begin, we must include our `Wire` library to use I^2^C, and the `SFE_MicroOLED` library to control the screen. The code also includes modular functions to tell the microcontroller how to print each example. This is a good place to look to see examples of how the functions discussed earlier are implemented. The example code will then loop between all of the examples. This is a good way to see exactly what your code looks like on the screen.

    language:c
    /*
      SFE_MicroOLED Library Demo
      Paul Clark @ SparkFun Electronics
      Original Creation Date: December 11th, 2020

      This sketch uses the MicroOLED library to show all the functionality built into the library
      using the begin function defined in version v1.3 of the library - which allows different
      TwoWire ports and custom I2C addresses to be used.

      If you are using the standard Micro OLED display, its I2C address will be 0x3D or 0x3C
      depending on how you have the D/C or ADDR jumper configured.

      Hardware Connections:
        This example assumes you are using Qwiic. See the SPI examples for
        a detailed breakdown of connection info.

### Example: Drawing Bitmaps

It is also possible to load bitmaps of your own custom images into the screen. This can be done using this [Bitmap generator](http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/). The tool is pretty self explanatory, just load in an image, tell the tool that your screen is 64x48, go to File, and Save the output.

[![Bitmap Converter Program](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpconvert.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpconvert.PNG)

Open the file generated as a text file, it should look something like the below image.

[![Generated Text File](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmptext.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmptext.PNG)

This array is the image that will be displayed by the screen, so now we just have to paste it into the `bitmaps.h` header file as the correct data type so our compiler is able to find the image. Make sure you change the array to a `uint8_t`. The pasted bitmap should look something like the below image, with the variable type changed to `uint8_t`.

[![Include the Bitmap Header File](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpfinal.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpfinal.PNG)

You will also need to change the name of the array when referencing them in the example code. In this case, we named it rick and morty.

    language:c
    uint8_t rick [] = ;

    uint8_t morty [] = ;

Now we will be able to call `drawBitmap(Untitled)` to draw our image. Some example code showing how to display some Rick and Morty bitmaps is shown below.

## Qwiic OLED Arduino Library

First, you\'ll need to download and install the **SparkFun Qwiic OLED library**. You can install this library automatically in the Arduino IDE\'s Library Manager by searching for \"**Qwiic OLED**\". Or you can manually download it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Arduino_Library).

[Download the SparkFun Qwiic OLED Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Also, make sure to download the Qwiic example sketches, which we will be reviewing in this tutorial.

[Download the SparkFun Qwiic OLED Examples (ZIP)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/Arduino_Sketches_Qwiic_OLED_2.zip)

**Note:** The Qwiic example sketches were modified specifically for the Qwiic OLED Arduino Library. Due to the differences in Arduino Libraries, the functions and methods to control the Qwiic Micro OLED are slightly different.

### Arduino Library Overview

For more information about the available functions of the library, check out the API Reference on GitHub Pages.

[Arduino Library API Reference](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Arduino_Library/api_device/)

## Qwiic OLED Examples

### Example: Feature Demo

The demo in this part of the tutorial is similar to the micro OLED Arduino Library. However, the setup is slightly different. While we display the pixels, line, shapes (e.g. pong), and text, you will noticed differences in the functions and methods. Note that the output of the text is also slightly different.

    language:c
    /*
      Example_Multi_Mod.ino

      This demo performs multiple examples from the library. Note that
      this example is similar to example 8. The difference is that it prints the
      text of the graphic before the animiation. The example also includes example 4
      as part of the demo.

      This library configures and draws graphics to OLED boards that use the
      SSD1306 display hardware. The library only supports I2C.

### Example: Drawing Bitmaps

Similar to the Micro OLED bitmap example, it is also possible to load bitmaps of your own custom images into the screen using the Qwiic OLED Arduino Library. This can be done using this [Bitmap generator](http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/). The tool is pretty self explanatory, just load in an image, tell the tool that your screen is 64x48, go to File, and Save the output.

[![Bitmap Converter Program](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpconvert.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpconvert.PNG)

Open the file generated as a text file, it should look something like the below image.

[![Generated Text File](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmptext.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmptext.PNG)

This array is the image that will be displayed by the screen, so now we just have to paste it into the `bitmaps.h` header file as the correct data type so our compiler is able to find the image. Make sure you change the array to a `uint8_t`. The pasted bitmap should look something like the below image, with the variable type changed to `uint8_t`.

[![Include the Bitmap Header File](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpfinal.PNG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/1/8/bmpfinal.PNG)

With the Qwiic OLED Arduino Library, we will need to know the size of the bitmap image so we have included a few variables below the arrays to indicate the width and height of the image. You will also need to change the name of the array when referencing them in the example code. In this case, we named it rick and morty. The pasted bitmap should look something similar to the following.

    language:c
    uint8_t rick[] = ;

    uint8_t rick_Height = 48;
    uint8_t rick_Width = 64;

    uint8_t morty[] = ;

    uint8_t morty_Height = 48;
    uint8_t morty_Width = 64;

Now we will be able to call `displayBitmap()` to draw our image. Some example code showing how to display some Rick and Morty bitmaps is shown below.
