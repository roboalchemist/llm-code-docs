*Source: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNdd7tzkvEs) Doris from [Disney\'s Meet the Robinsons](https://movies.disney.com/meet-the-robinsons)*

Terrible pun aside, this product isn\'t capable of creating DOR-15 (aka Doris), but it will get you started on your robotics adventure.

### [SparkFun Auto pHAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-auto-phat-for-raspberry-pi.html) 

[ ROB-16328 ]

The Auto pHAT is an all in one package that focuses on quickly adding robot functionality and advanced support to your Raspbe...

[ [\$39.95] ]

This device combines a few of our existing products onto a single pHAT. On the Auto pHAT you will find the following components:

4 Channel Servo Controller

A 9-DoF IMU

USB-C Power Input

Qwiic Motor Driver

Rotary Encoder Input

A Qwiic connector

There are dozens of applicable projects for this product, you can even use it to get started with your rover and robotics applications. Its limits are up to you.

### Required Materials

The required materials will depend on your project. However, at minimum, users will need:

- A single board computer (SBC)
  - Must have a 40-pin Raspberry Pi compatible header
- An SD card
- Power supply (or power source)
- Additional accessories:
  - Servos
  - Motors
  - Encoders
  - Chassis and Wheels
  - Header (*optional*)
- Tools:
  - Small Flathead Screw Driver

#### Single Board Computers

Each of the SBCs that we offer have a unique facet that separates it from the others. There is a 40-pin Raspberry Pi compatible header on each of the SBCs.

**Note:** When using the Raspberry Pi 4 with [heat sink case](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15773), a compatible header that provides enough clearance and interfaces with the Auto pHAT is required.

#### SD Cards

These SD cards in our catalog are tested and known to work with all the models of the Raspberry Pi and the Jetson Nano (*excluding the NOOBS card*).

**Note:** For first time Raspberry Pi users, we recommend using the [NOOBS version](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15052) as it has the required OS pre-installed.

#### Power Supplies

Use the appropriate power supply for the SCB you choose. The [battery pack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15204) and [USB-C cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14743) are specifically for the Auto pHAT to supplement the current draw of the motor driver and servo controller.

#### Servos

The Auto pHAT has 4 available servo channels. This is perfect if for users looking to add a pan-tilt bracket for their camera, a claw, or any other servo or PWM related mechanism (like a [robotic arm](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15293)).

#### Chassis, Motor, and Wheels

The motor driver on the Auto pHAT has 2 H-Bridge drive channels for DC motors. We recommend the [hobby motor with encoder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16413) as the Auto pHAT was designed to match the pin layout of this product.

**Note:** Users looking to add brushless DC motors, which are usually driven by an ESC, shouldn\'t be using the H-Bridge. ESCs are controlled through a PWM signal and required a specific power source. The servo/PWM controller may work, but users should also consider the arming process.

Besides a motor, users will also need a chassis or some kind of structure to assemble all the components on. *You can\'t really call it a vehicle, if all you have is a motor.*

#### Header

This is an optional item. For users looking to stack HATs, a header might be required for additional clearance between boards or components.

[![Extended GPIO Header - Female (PTH, 0.1in., 2x20-Pin, 13.5mm/9.80mm)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/140-140/assets/parts/1/5/6/5/3/16764-2_X_20_Pin_Extended_GPIO_Header_-_Female_-_13.5mm_9.80mm-01.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/extended-gpio-female-header-2x20-pin-13-5mm-9-80mm.html)

[ PRT-16763 ]

This 2x20 pin female header is meant to allow you to extend the reach of any board with the standard 2x20 GPIO pin footprint.

[ [\$3.25] ]

**Note:** Users shouldn\'t use the [Raspberry Pi GPIO Tall Header (PRT-14017)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14017), as the (male) pins on the header aren\'t quite long enough to reach into the (female) socket on the Auto pHAT.

#### Screw Driver

To tighten and loosen the screw terminals, users will need a small flathead screw driver. The head will need to be \~1.5mm; anything around 2mm will most likely be too large.
