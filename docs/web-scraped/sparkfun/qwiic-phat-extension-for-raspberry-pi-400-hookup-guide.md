## Hardware Overview

### 2x20 Raspberry Pi Header

The Qwiic pHAT extension connects to the Raspberry Pi 400\'s 2x20 port via the right angle header.

[![Right Angle 2x20 Header](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Right_Angle_Header.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Right_Angle_Header.jpg)

The Raspberry Pi 400\'s horizontal headers are rerouted and extends out to the vertical headers at the top of the board. Each pin includes a label with their associated pin function.

[![Vertical Header Pins with Labels](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Straight_Header_Labels.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Straight_Header_Labels.jpg)

### Qwiic Connectors

The Qwiic pHAT extension includes Qwiic connectors on both sides of the board.

[![Qwiic Connectors](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Connector_Port.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Connector_Port.jpg)

### Mounting Holes

There are 10 mounting holes on the board. Below is the board highlighted for boards designed with the Pi Zero footprint. You can add standoffs to the mounting holes where the arrows are pointing.

[![Mounting Holes for pHATs with Pi Zero Footprint](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Mounting_Holes_pHAT.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Mounting_Holes_pHAT.jpg)

For boards designed with the Raspberry Pi footprint, you can add standoffs to the mounting holes where the arrows are pointing.

[![Mounting Holes with Raspberry Pi Footprint](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Mounting_Holes_HAT.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Mounting_Holes_HAT.jpg)

For Qwiic-enabled devices utilizing the standard 1.0\"x1.0\" sized boards, you can add two standoffs for each Qwiic-enabled device where the arrows are pointing.

[![Mounting Holes for Standard Sized 1.0\"x1.0\" Qwiic-Enabled Device](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Mounting_Holes.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/17512-SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Mounting_Holes.jpg)

### Board Dimensions

The board is about 65mm x 78.42mm (\~2.55in x \~3.08in).

[![Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/3/6/4/8/8/SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_for_Raspberry_Pi_400.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/3/6/4/8/8/SparkFun_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_for_Raspberry_Pi_400.png)

By adding two large silicone bumpers under the board for stability, the height comes to about \~21.32mm (\~0.84in) between the header pin and the bottom of the Silicon bumper.

## Hardware Assembly

Included with the Qwiic pHAT extension board is a set of large silicone bumpers. These are meant to hold the board up when it is attached to a Raspberry Pi 400 and placed on a table. You only need 2 out of the 4 silicone bumpers so you can use the left over bumpers for other projects.

[![Large Silicone Bumpers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/300-300//assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Large_Silicone_Bumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Large_Silicone_Bumpers.jpg)

To attach the two silicone bumpers, peel one bumper and attach it to the bottom of the board between the mounting holes of the Pi Zero\'s footprint. Repeat for the second bumper. Your setup should look similar to the image below.

[![Large Silicone Bumpers Attached to the Bottom of the Qwiic pHAT Extension Board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Silicone_Bumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Silicone_Bumper.jpg)

**Note:** Due to the design of the Raspberry Pi 400, the Qwiic pHAT extension will be closer to the table as you move toward the right angle headers. Care must be taken when sticking the large silicone bumpers to the board as this may add additional stress to the connection between the Qwiic pHAT extension and the Pi 400. We recommend placing the silicone bumpers close to the vertical header pins to reduce the amount of stress applied on the connection.

At this point, we\'ll assume that you have flashed an image and inserted the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi 400. With the straight header pins facing up, slide the Qwiic pHAT extension into the Raspberry Pi 400\'s GPIO port. The right angle connector is keyed so there\'s only one way to insert the board into the GPIO port.

[![Qwiic pHAT Extension being Inserted into a Raspberry Pi 400](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Inserting_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Inserting_Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400.jpg)

When removing the pHAT extension, simply wiggle the board slowly up and down as the board is being pulled away from the Raspberry Pi 400.

### Qwiic-Enabled Devices

If you have a Qwiic-enabled device, simply insert a Qwiic cable of your choice between the Qwiic board and the Qwiic pHAT extension. While you can connect to either Qwiic connector, the right side of the Qwiic pHAT extension will provide more space since most of the Pi\'s peripherals will be inserted to the left of the board.

[![Qwiic-Enabled Device Connected to the Qwiic pHAT Extension](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Device_9DoF.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Qwiic_Device_9DoF.jpg)

### Breadboard Prototyping

Connecting to the [Raspberry Pi 400\'s GPIO](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-gpio/all) is easy with the pin functions printed on the board for reference. We recommend using [M/F jumper wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12794) to connect when prototyping your circuit on a breadboard.

[![Prototyping on a Breadboard using the Qwiic pHAT Extension](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Breadboard_LED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Breadboard_LED.jpg)

### Stacking pHATs

Boards designed with the Raspberry Pi or Pi Zero footprint can be stacked on top of the Qwiic pHAT Extension allowing it to be viewed right-side up. Below is an image of the Top pHAT connected to the Raspberry Pi 400.

[![Top pHAT Stacked on the ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Top_pHAT_Display_LED_Buzzer.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Top_pHAT_Display_LED_Buzzer.jpg)

Depending on the design of the pHAT, you may require additional height if there are any wires being attached to the bottom of the pHAT. If this is the case, you can add additional height using an extended GPIO headers.

### Mounting with Standoffs

You can attach [standoffs](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/257) to two of the Qwiic mounting holes to secure an Qwiic-enabled device.

[![Qwiic 9DoF secured to the Qwiic pHAT Extension](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Standoffs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/3/9/9/Qwiic_pHAT_Extension_Raspberry_Pi_400_Standoffs.jpg)

Got a wobbly pHAT on the Qwiic pHAT extension? You can attach standoffs to two of the mounting holes across from the vertical header pins on the Qwiic pHAT extension. Of course, you can always use all four mounting holes depending on your personal preference. Below is a Top pHAT using the Raspberry Pi\'s footprint but you can also mount a board that uses a Raspberry Pi Zero\'s footprint as well.

#### raspi-config Tool [via Terminal]

Again, we can use `raspi-config` to enable it.

1.  Run `sudo raspi-config`.
2.  Use the down arrow to select `5 Interfacing Options`
3.  Arrow down to `P5 I2C`.
4.  Select `yes` when it asks you to enable I2C
5.  Also select `yes` if it asks about automatically loading the kernel module.
6.  Use the right arrow to select the `<Finish>` button.
7.  Select `yes` when it asks to reboot.

*Raspi-config for I2C*

The system will reboot. When it comes back up, log in and enter the following command

    language:bash
    ls /dev/*i2c*

The Pi should respond with

    language:bash
    /dev/i2c-1

Which represents the user-mode I2C interface.

## Scanning for I2C Devices

If you are using the Raspberry Pi to quickly connect to I^2^C devices, the best place to start would be to scan for an I^2^C device on the bus.

### Utilities

There is a set of command-line utility programs that can help get an I^2^C interface working. You can get them with the apt package manager. Enter the following command.

    language:bash
    sudo apt-get install -y i2c-tools

In particular, the `i2cdetect` program will probe all the addresses on a bus, and report whether any devices are present. Enter the following command in the command line. The `-y` flag will disable interactive mode so that you do not have to wait for confirmation. The `1` indicates that we are scanning for I^2^C devices on I^2^C bus 1 (e.g. i2c-1).

    language:bash
    i2cdetect -y 1

You will get an output from your Raspberry Pi similar to the output below.

    language:bash
    pi@raspberrypi:~/$ i2cdetect -y 1
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: 60 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

This map indicates that there is a peripheral at address **0x60**. Your address may vary depending on what is connected to the I^2^C bus. For advanced users, you can try to read and write its registers using the `i2cget`, `i2cset` and `i2cdump` commands.

### Qwiic Py Drivers

Now that you have I^2^C set up on your Pi, you can start programming your Qwiic devices on your Pi or if you\'d like to start with some examples, we have a host of Python drivers for Qwiic breakouts available in the GitHub repository linked below. You can read more about Python for the SparkFun Qwiic system in [this blog post](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2958).

[SparkFun Qwiic Py GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)

## GPIO Pins

The Raspberry Pi 400 uses the standard 2x20 GPIO pins. With the help of the Qwiic pHAT extension, the Pi 400\'s horizontal GPIO pins are rerouted to a vertical position. There are several programming languages available to use on the Raspberry Pi. We recommend Python to control the pins. Check the following tutorials below to get started.
