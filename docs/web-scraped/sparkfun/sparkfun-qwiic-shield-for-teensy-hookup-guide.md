## Introduction

The [SparkFun Qwiic Shield for Teensy](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17119) and [SparkFun Qwiic Shield for Teensy Extended](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17156) provide an easy-to-assemble way to add the SparkFun [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) ecosystem to [Teensy](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/267) development boards. Both of these shields connect the I^2^C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Teensy to four SparkFun Qwiic connectors. The Qwiic ecosystem allows for easy daisy chaining so, as long as your devices are on different addresses, you can connect as many Qwiic devices as you\'d like.

### Required Materials

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need a Teensy development board with either the \"standard\" or \"extended\" form factor. Here are is a collection of the compatible boards. Note, some of them come with headers pre-populated, so keep that in mind when considering which headers to populate on your shield.

### Required Tools

## Hardware Overview

### Qwiic Connectors

The Qwiic Shields for Teensy each have four Qwiic connectors on them. The two on the edges are the standard horizontal connectors and the two in the middle are vertical connectors.

Note, the horizontal Qwiic connector on the \"top\" (aka North end) of the non-extended version is positioned slightly downward to allow space for proper cable insertion, and to avoid any conflicts with the nearby 6-pin header on the edge of the board.

### Program Button

Each of these shields have a \"PROG\" button. This is to allow easier access to a programming button for each time you want to upload to the Teensy. Note, it is electrically in parallel with the \"PROG\" button on the Teensy boards themselves. This means that you can choose to use either the button on your Teensy or the button on the shield. If your shield is located on top of your Teensy (using stack-able headers), then it will be much more accessible to use the button on the shield, rather than trying to reach under the shield.

### I^2^C Jumper

This jumper is a little different than our normal I^2^C pull up jumpers as it is **open** by default. The jumper only needs to be closed if your attached I^2^C device does **not** have pull up resistors. Essentially all SparkFun I^2^C breakouts come with pull up resistors on them so if you are using a Qwiic I^2^C device or another SparkFun I^2^C device, you can most likely leave it open. When closed, the SDA and SCL lines are pulled to **3.3V** by **4.7KΩ** resistors. If you have never worked with solder jumpers before, check out [this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces) for some tips and tricks for working with them.

### External Power Input

These shields include an optional **3.3V** power input. The **3.3V** pin off of the Teensy is rated to supply **250mA**. If your project requires more than that on the Qwiic **3.3V** power rail, then you should consider supplying a separate power source and soldering it into the header pins labeled \"ALT 3V3\". Note, you must also cut the jumper labeled \"ISO\" to properly isolate the Teensy\'s **3.3V** power rail from your external.

Note, when using the external power input header, you may notice a slight voltage drop. This is because we have included a protective diode in the circuit. For most applications, this will be fine to leave in place. For more advanced users, we have included a bypass jumper to easily bypass this jumper and have a direct connection to the **3.3V** power net.

### Board Dimensions

The Qwiic Shield for Teensy measures 0.70in x 1.40in (17.78mm x 35.56mm). The extended version measures 0.70in x 2.40in (17.78mm x 60.96mm). Note, because these are such small form factor boards, they do not have any standoff holes. They simply rely on the headers for both electrical connections and \"mounting hardware\".

## Hardware Assembly

To get started using the Qwiic Shield for Teensy, [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) the headers onto your Teensy board and your Qwiic Shield. You may choose to use the included stackable header kit or any combination of male/female breakaway headers. Below we show a couple options using standard breakaway headers. Note, for best access to the program button on the shield and the two vertical Qwiic connectors, it is best to have it be the top of your stack.

Once you have soldered headers to your shield and connected it to your Teensy, it\'s time to start connecting Qwiic devices! Below you can see an example of each shield connected to the appropriate Teensy ([4.0](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15583) or [4.1](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16771)). Here we used our standard breakaway headers along with a couple of Qwiic Devices chained to it.

If you are using the upper-most qwiic connector on the Qwiic Shield for Teensy, please check out the following tips. It helps to bend/curl your Qwiic cable a bit before inserting it into the right-angle connector on the sheild.

*Qwiic Cable with a bend.*

With the bend in place, you can better align it before inserting it all the way.

*Initial alignment.*

To avoid stressing the cable wires, it is best to push the Qwiic connector using your fingernails on the sides of the connector plastic. Tweezers can also do the trick.

*Pressing on the sides of the plastic is ideal.*
