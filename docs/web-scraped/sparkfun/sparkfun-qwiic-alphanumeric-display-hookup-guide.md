## Introduction

Seven segment displays are SO 2020. I mean, we see them in our clocks, ovens, and microwaves on the daily. But what happens when you add more segments to each digit? You can upgrade your appliances and let everyone know how you REALLY feel. Introducing SparkFun\'s newest Qwiic-Enabled Alphanumeric Display in [Pink](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16919), [Green](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18566), [Blue](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16917), [Red](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16916), [Purple](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16918), and [White](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18565). Customize that microwave alert - \"Your food is done, fool!\" Or hack those oven messages - \"I pity the fool that doesn\'t pre-heat!\" These fourteen-segment digits allow you display all sorts of numbers, characters, and symbols. Let\'s jump in and have a look, shall we?

We would also suggest reading through the following tutorials if you are not familiar with the concepts covered in them:

[](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c)

### I2C 

An introduction to I2C, one of the main embedded communications protocols in use today.

## Hardware Overview

As mentioned in the introduction, the Qwiic Alphanumeric Displays use the VK16K33 LED driver chip to control the segments. In this section of the guide we\'ll go into more detail on the LED driver and the display, as well as the other components included on the board.

### VK16K33 LED Driver

The Qwiic Alphanumeric Display boards use the VK16K33 LED driver chip to control the segments. The VK16K33 is a memory mapping and multifunction LED controller driver with a maximum display segment number of 128 patterns (16 segments and 8 commons) and a 13×3 matrix key scan circuit. There\'s an integrated RC oscillator and a 16-step dimming circuit as well. More information can be found in the [VK16K33 Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/c/8/7/2/5/VK16K33Datasheet.pdf).

[![LED Driver on the back of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_HT16K33.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_HT16K33.jpg)

### Alphanumeric Display

Look at all those beautiful segments ready to display (almost) whatever your heart desires!

[![Display screen on the front of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_DisplayScreen.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_DisplayScreen.jpg)

### Qwiic

Our [Qwiic Ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) makes sensors pretty much plug and play. There are two Qwiic connectors on either side of the Alphanumeric Display board to provide power and I^2^C connectivity simultaneously.

The default I^2^C address of the board is **0x70**. Additional addresses are available - see the *Jumpers* section below.

[![Qwiic connectors on either side of the back of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Qwiic.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Qwiic.jpg)

### I^2^C Address Jumpers

Two jumpers have been provided to allow you to choose the I^2^C address of the peripheral. See the table below for configuration details.

[![A0 and A1 jumpers are on the far right of the back of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Bothjumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Bothjumpers.jpg)

  Address   A0       A1
  --------- -------- --------
  0x70      Open     Open
  0x71      Closed   Open
  0x72      Open     Closed
  0x73      Closed   Closed

### I^2^C Bus Resistor Jumper

The Qwiic Alphanumeric Display Breakout has onboard I^2^C pull up resistors; if multiple sensors are connected to the bus with the pull-up resistors enabled, the parallel equivalent resistance will create too strong of a pull-up for the bus to operate correctly. As a general rule of thumb, disable all but one pair of pull-up resistors if multiple devices are connected to the bus. If you need to disconnect the pull up resistors they can be removed by cutting the traces on the corresponding jumpers highlighted below.

[![Jumper is on the lower left side of the back of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_I2CJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_I2CJumper.jpg)

### I^2^C Pins

If you\'ve got mad [soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) skillz and really want to access the I^2^C pins, we\'ve made these bad boys available to you. Check it:

- **C** - SCL
- **D** - SDA
- **3** - 3.3V
- **G** - GND

## Hardware Hookup

Using the Qwiic system, assembling the hardware is a breeze. All you need to do is connect your SparkFun Qwiic Alphanumeric Display to your chosen development board with a Qwiic cable or [adapter cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425).

[![Alphanumeric plugged into RedBoard via Qwiic cables](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/Alphanumeric_Hookup_Guide-09.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/Alphanumeric_Hookup_Guide-09.jpg)

If you decide to use the PTH pins broken out on the display you will need to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) some headers to them. If you are not familiar with through-hole soldering take a look at this tutorial:

As before, once you have the code, make sure you\'ve got the correct port selected, and then go ahead and click on the upload button. You won\'t need your serial monitor for this one though, unless you want it. If all goes well, you should see your display light up like so:

[![One segment of each display bit is lit up](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/Alphanumeric_Hookup_Guide-03.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/Alphanumeric_Hookup_Guide-03.jpg)

It looks weird, but it\'s one segment of each letter lit up.

This is just the beginning - there are more examples to get you going with your SparkFun Qwiic Alphanumeric Display. We won\'t go through them all here, but feel free to tinker with these to see what all you can come up with!

If you haven\'t downloaded the library yet, get it either [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Alphanumeric_Display_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or by clicking on the link below and get hackin!

## Arduino Examples - The Fun Stuff

Okay. You got the basics done - you can light up segments, yes? Now lets do a couple of fun things!

### Example_08_MultiDisplay

This example tests printing across multiple displays. In order to make this example work, you\'ll need to do some [soldering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) on the jumpers on the back of the board. For this example, we\'ll use 0x70 and 0x71 as the addresses, so the jumpers for the second display should look like this:

[![A0 Jumper is soldered together](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Bothjumpers-A0Soldered.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/0/9/16919-SparkFun-Qwiic-Alphanumeric-Display_Bothjumpers-A0Soldered.jpg)

\

Once your jumper is soldered, go ahead and hook your boards together with your [Qwiic cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/qwiic-cables) and plug em on into your RedBoard.

Once your hardware is ready to go, head back to your File Menu and open up **File**-\>**Examples**-\>**SparkFun Qwiic Alphanumeric Display Library**-\>**Example_08_MultiDisplay**.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code below to a shiny new Arduino file:

     * Attach a second Alphanumeric display using Qwiic cable.
     *  Close address jumper A0 so that this display's address become 0x71.

      Serial.println("Displays acknowledged.");

      display.print("Get Milk");
    }

    void loop() 
    

Once you\'ve got your code, make sure you\'ve got the correct port selected, and then go ahead and click on the upload button. You should see the following:
