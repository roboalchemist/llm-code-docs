## Introduction

***Drum roll please\...*** Introducing, the [Top pHAT](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16301)! The pHAT for the top of all your other HATs. **Ta-da!!! It makes the perfect GIF(t).**

[![Grammys GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ixo57j8UBWgIo/giphy.gif)](https://giphy.com/gifs/thevoice-television-the-voice-nhrbZDj6BmnLy)\
*Source: [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/thevoice-television-the-voice-nhrbZDj6BmnLy)*

Haha\... all jokes aside, this pHAT comes bundled with multiple goodies to begin your Raspberry Pi adventure; including a 2.3\" TFT screen, which would be a shame to cover up other HATs.

[ DEV-16653 ]

The SparkFun Top pHAT is the fundamental machine learning add-on for Raspberry Pi or any 2x20 GPIO SBC!

**Retired**

Additionally, on the Top pHAT you will find the following components:

6 addressable WS2812 RGB LEDs

2 MEMS microphones

A *mono* speaker

A 5-way tactile switch

2 momentary buttons

A Qwiic connector

There are dozens of applicable projects for this product, you can even use it to get started with your machine learning applications. The limits are up to you.

### Required Materials

The required materials will depend on your project. However, at minimum, users will need a Raspberry Pi, an SD card, and a power supply (or power source). Users can include additional accessories and peripherals for their setup.

#### Raspberry Pi

Each of the models of the Raspberry Pi that we offer have a unique facets that separate them from each other.

[ [\$17.60] ]

**Note:** When using the Raspberry Pi 3 or Pi 4, a compatible [header](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16763) that provides enough clearance and interfaces with the Top pHAT is required. This is especially important for a Raspberry Pi 4 with [heat sink case](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15773), which may require multiple headers to allow air flow for thermal dissipation.

#### SD Cards

These SD cards in our catalog are tested and known to work with all the models of the Raspberry Pi. For first time users, we recommend using the [NOOBS version](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15052) as it has the required OS pre-installed.

[ [\$13.95] ]

**⚡ Note:**

The Raspberry Pi 3 and Zero models require a micro-USB power supply. We recommend using the [5.1V 2.5A power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13831).

The Raspberry Pi 4 models require a USB-C power supply.We recommend using the [Official Raspberry Pi power supply](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15448) to avoid this issue.

#### Extension Header

As noted in a previous section, an extension header is required for the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 4 to provided enough clearance between the Top pHAT and Raspberry Pi.

[![Extended GPIO Header - Female (PTH, 0.1in., 2x20-Pin, 13.5mm/9.80mm)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/140-140/assets/parts/1/5/6/5/3/16764-2_X_20_Pin_Extended_GPIO_Header_-_Female_-_13.5mm_9.80mm-01.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/extended-gpio-female-header-2x20-pin-13-5mm-9-80mm.html)

**Retired**

This is especially important for a Raspberry Pi 4 with [heat sink case](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15773), which may require multiple headers to allow air flow for thermal dissipation. There are some alternatives for that, listed above.

#### Peripherals

For users looking to use the desktop graphical user interface (GUI), they will also need the following:

- TV, Display, or Monitor
- Compatible HDMI Cable
- USB Keyboard and Mouse

##### Displays

For beginners we recommend using a modern TV (*i.e. with an HDMI input*) or computer monitor, as it will undoubtedly be easier and more intuitive for users to setup.

##### Compatible HDMI Cable

If you don\'t have an HDMI cable (and possible adapter), these have been tested to work with following Raspberry Pi models:

**Raspberry Pi Zero W model:**\

[![Mini HDMI Cable - 3ft](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/1/2/2/2/9/14274-01.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/mini-hdmi-cable-3ft.html)

[ [\$8.95] ]

**Note:** If your display doesn\'t have an HDMI input, you will need to source an appropriate adapter. There are DVI and VGA to HDMI adapters, that will work on older computer monitors. *Unfortunately, we don\'t have any adapters or a list of optional products for more outdated inputs (i.e. RCA, S-video, Component, or coaxial inputs).*

##### USB Keyboard and Mouse

If you don\'t already have a USB keyboard and mouse, we do offer a multimedia keyboard that has been tested as a plug-and-play option for the Raspberry Pi models in our catalog.
