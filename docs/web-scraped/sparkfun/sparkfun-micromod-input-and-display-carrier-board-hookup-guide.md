### Power

The Input and Display Carrier Board takes an input voltage range from **2.7V - 6V** via the USB-C connector. We\'ve incorporated a power regulation circuit that caps the voltage for power sensitive circuits and the Qwiic connector.

### Input & Display Carrier Board Specific Components

#### ATTiny84

We\'ve populated this carrier board with Atmel\'s ATtiny84 with 8kB of programmable flash. This little guy is preprogrammed to communicate with the processor over I^2^C to read button presses.

[![ATTiny is highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-ATTiny.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-ATTiny.jpg)

#### TFT Display

4DLCD\'s 24320240-IPS is a color active matrix LCD module incorporating amorphous silicon TFT (Thin Film Transistor). The module display area measures 2.4\" and contains 240 x 320 pixels.

**Note:** IPS displays have higher display quality, better colors, and much better viewing angles than their non-IPS counterparts.

[![4DLCD screen](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-Screen.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-Screen.jpg)

#### LEDs

The Input and Display Carrier Board has 6 Addressable APA102 LEDs.

[![APA102 LEDs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-LEDS.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-LEDS.jpg)

#### Input Buttons

Button button, who\'s got the button? We do! We have two input buttons (A and B), and a 5 way switch that allows you to navigate a UI or play an onboard game.

[![A Button, B button, and 5 way button](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-ABButtonsand5way_Cropped.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-ABButtonsand5way_Cropped.jpg)

#### JTAG Debugging

We\'ve populated the JTAG footprint for more advanced users who need breakpoint level debugging. We recommend checking out our [JTAG section](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/jtag) for the compatible JTAG programmer and debugger.

[![JTAG debugging pins](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-SWD_Back.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-SWD_Back.jpg)

### Jumpers

[![Jumpers are highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-Jumpers_WithMeas.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985-SparkFun_MicroMod_Input_Display-Jumpers_WithMeas.jpg)

#### I^2^C Jumper

If you are daisy-chaining multiple Qwiic devices, you will want to cut this jumper; if multiple sensors are connected to the bus with the pull-up resistors enabled, the parallel equivalent resistance could create too strong of a pull-up for the bus to operate correctly. As a general rule of thumb, disable all but one pair of pull-up resistors if multiple devices are connected to the bus. To disable the pull up resistors, use an X-acto knife to cut the joint between the two jumper pads highlighted below.

#### PWR Jumper

Cutting this jumper will disable the \"Power\" LED on the front of the board.

#### 3V3CTRL Jumper

Many of the MicroMod carrier boards have an RTC backup battery on board and as part of the standardized voltage regulation circuit we include a 3V3 jumper that, when closed, allows you to control the 3V3 control regulator. This shuts down everything on the 3V3 rail but the battery keeps the processor awake. The Input and Display Carrier Board does not have a backup battery, so this jumper should remain open.

#### BYP Jumper

If you really, really, REALLY need more power, closing this jumper will bypass the 2A fuse. Close at your own risk!

#### Measure Jumper

Want to measure the juice running through your circuits? Cut the trace between these PTH pads in order to measure the current with a Digital MultiMeter.

### PinOuts

**Note:** You may not recognize the COPI/CIPO labels for SPI pins. SparkFun is working to move away from using MISO/MOSI to describe signals between the controller and the peripheral. Check out [this page](https://www.sparkfun.com/spi_signal_names) for more on our reasoning behind this change.

### Board Dimensions

The Input and Display Carrier Board measures 3.25 inches by 2.25 inches.

[![MicroMod Input and Display Carrier Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/MicroMod_InputDisplayCarrier_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/MicroMod_InputDisplayCarrier_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Hookup

To get started with the Input and Display Carrier Board, you\'ll need a processor board. Here we are using the MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board.

Align the top key of the MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board to the screw terminal of the Input and Display Carrier Board and angle the board into the socket. Insert the board at an angle into the M.2 connector.

**Note:** There is no way to insert the processor backward since the key prevents it from mating with the M.2 connector and as an extra safeguard to prevent inserting a processor that matches the key, the mounting screw is offset so you will not be able to secure an improperly connected processor board.

[![MicroMod Processor Board inserted into the carrier board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985_MicroMod_InputDisplay_CB_PB_AnotherAngle.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985_MicroMod_InputDisplay_CB_PB_AnotherAngle.jpg)

The Processor Board will stick up at an angle, as seen here:

\[![\[MicroMod Processor Board inserted into the carrier board\](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985_MicroMod_InputDisplay_CB_PBAngle.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/2/3/0/16985_MicroMod_InputDisplay_CB_PBAngle.jpg)

Once the board is in the socket, gently hold the MicroMod Processor Board down and tighten the screw with a Phillip\'s head.

Once the board is secure, your assembled MicroMod system should look similar to the image below!

### Connecting Everything Up

With your processor inserted and secured it\'s time to connect your carrier board to your computer using the USB-C connector on the Carrier. Depending on which carrier you choose and which drivers you already have installed, you may need to install drivers.

[] **Note:** Make sure that for whatever processor board you choose, you have the correct board definitions installed.\
\
For this particular tutorial, we are using the MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board. Board definitions for this processor board can be found in the [Software Setup and Programming](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-esp32-processor-board-hookup-guide#software-setup-and-programming) section of the [MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-esp32-processor-board-hookup-guide).\
\
If you are using a different processor board, go to our [MicroMod Processor Boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod#processor_boards) landing page, find your processor board, and head on over to that tutorial for help installing your board definition.

## Software Setup and Programming

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

To get started, you\'re going to want to get familiar with our HyperDisplay libraries. HyperDisplay is an abstracted library for pretty much any 2D graphics display and has a focus on extensibility. Since the interface is standardized you can write display applications just once and make them work on many different displays with a few small changes. If you want to go more in depth check out [this HyperDisplay tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/everything-you-should-know-about-hyperdisplay).

Check out this tutorial on [how to install an Arduino library](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library/all) if you are unfamiliar.

Each of the libraries above contain some examples, however the ones that will actually make your Input and Display Carrier Board light up are contained in the \'HyperDisplay 4DLCD-320240 Arduino Library\' \-- in case you are wondering, that name comes from the name of the display module that is used on the board. Once your libraries have been installed move on to the next section and try out a few of the examples.

## Example Code

The HyperDisplay library for the Input and Display Carrier Board is named after the LCD module that it uses - the 4DLCD-320240. If you\'ve properly installed the required libraries, you\'ll notice a number of examples in **File**-\>**Examples**-\>**SparkFun HyperDisplay 4DLCD-320240**. If you haven\'t already, make sure you\'ve got the following three libraries installed:

- [SparkFun HyperDisplay Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_HyperDisplay/archive/master.zip)
- [SparkFun HyperDisplay ILI9341 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/HyperDisplay_ILI9341_ArduinoLibrary/archive/master.zip)
- [SparkFun HyperDisplay 4DLCD-320240 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/HyperDisplay_4DLCD-320240_ArduinoLibrary/archive/master.zip)

[] You will also need to make sure that you have the board definitions for your chosen processor board installed.\

For this particular tutorial, we are using the MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board. Board definitions for this processor board can be found in the [Software Setup and Programming](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-esp32-processor-board-hookup-guide#software-setup-and-programming) section of the [MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-esp32-processor-board-hookup-guide).

All of the following examples are explained in depth in the [Everything You Should Know About HyperDisplay Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/everything-you-should-know-about-hyperdisplay). We\'ll show you a quick overview of each example here, but if you want more information on how these examples and their code work, head on over to the HyperDisplay Tutorial.

### Everything You Should Know About HyperDisplay 

February 20, 2019

This is a tutorial to go in-depth about the SparkFun HyperDisplay Arduino Library.

[] **Note:** The display\'s colors are inverted from the standard ILI9341 driver library. If you\'re using the HyperDisplay libraries, this is taken care of in the HyperDisplay 4DLCD-320240. But if you prefer using a different ILI9341 library, no hard feelings, but you will have to run that library\'s invert display function in order for the colors to display like you expect. .

### Example 1: Display Test

Example one verifies that your display is working, and gives you some basic code to draw lines and shapes. To start, go to **File**-\>**Examples**-\>**SparkFun HyperDisplay 4DLCD-320240** and load **Example1_DisplayTest**. In windows, it will look like this:
