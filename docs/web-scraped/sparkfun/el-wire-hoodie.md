## Introduction

[] The design and build time of this project depends on your experience manually sewing, the length of EL wire used, and where you are sewing it to. This can take about \~1 - 3 hours if you are following the edges of a hoodie.

**Heads up!** The hoodie that was used in this tutorial was a **youth medium sized** hoodie with standard EL wire sewn around the front, hood, and shoulders. The length of wire used was 3 meters. [Depending on the size of the hoodie](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/el-wire-hoodie#diff_size), you may end up needing more or less EL wire as explained further below. Make sure to plan accordingly.

In this tutorial, we will sew standard EL wire onto a hoodie.

### How to Make a Custom EL Wire Extension Cable 

In this tutorial, we will make a custom EL Wire extension cable as an alternative to splicing wire.

## Prepare the EL Wire

**Note:** The images below is using standard EL wire with a **youth medium sized hoodie**. The length of wire used was 3 meters. [Depending on the size of the hoodie](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/el-wire-hoodie#diff_size), you may end up needing more or less EL wire as explained further below. Make sure to plan accordingly.

### Testing the EL Wire and EL Inverter

Before sewing the EL wire to a piece of clothing, make sure to test it out to see if it is functioning. To test, connect the EL wire to an inverter. In this case, we are using AA batteries and the 3V EL inverter battery pack.

[![Insert EL Wire\'s JST Connector into EL Battery Pack](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Insert_EL_Wire_Inverter_JST.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Insert_EL_Wire_Inverter_JST.jpg)

With the battery in the EL inverter battery pack, press the button to test. If the EL wire lights up, both the EL wire and EL inverter are good to go!

### Planning the Path

Plan out where to add EL wire. While you can [sew the EL wire on the arms](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/el-wire-hoodie#sewing-in-arms), it will be harder due to the amount of room available to work with in the arm. The easiest would be to follow the edge of the hoodie. To hold down the EL wire when sewing, we will be using binder clips. Depending on what you have, you could also try to use pins or tape. Place the EL wire into the binder clip and clamp it down against the fabric. Make sure to avoid clamping the EL wire down where the binder clip pinches as this can damage the corona wires.

[![EL Wire Held to the Hoodie with a Binder Clip ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Binder_Clip_Hoodie.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Binder_Clip_Hoodie.jpg)

In this case, all 3 meters of EL wire were used starting under the pocket, running up the side of the zipper, around the shoulders, up to the brim of the hood, around the shoulders, down the zipper, and ending at the pocket on the other side. Make sure to avoid sharp bends. If you decide to use a shorter length, you can cut the EL wire. Just make sure to re-seal the cut end with hot glue, otherwise you could end up getting a good jolt..

**Heads up!** Loose fabric like cotton can be harder to sew unless you have a something to hold the thread down. Make sure to choose your material wisely.

### Prepare the Needle and Thread

For this tutorial, we will double up the clear thread. Prepare your needle and thread by inserting the end of the clear thread through the eye (opening) of the needle and pull it through. Cut about an arms length of thread (approximately 2 feet long) to work with. Tie the two ends of the fishing wires into a knot. You may need to use the needle to help guide the knot close to the end of the thread.

[![Pulling the Knot Closer To the End Using a Needle](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Clear_Thread_Needle_EL_Wire.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Clear_Thread_Needle_EL_Wire.jpg)

Repeat the steps again for a second knot. Cut of any excess tail left over.

**Tip:** The clear thread is non-conductive. However, try checking out the section on [sewing with conductive thread](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lilypad-basics-e-sewing#sewing-with-conductive-thread) for other alternatives to start a knot.

## Sewing EL Wire

**Heads up!** The hoodie that was used in this tutorial was a **youth medium sized** hoodie with standard EL wire sewn around the front, hood, and shoulders. The length of wire used was 3 meters. [Depending on the size of the hoodie](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/el-wire-hoodie#diff_size), you may end up needing more or less EL wire as explained further below. Make sure to plan accordingly.

**⚡ Please note:** While sewing, make sure that your EL wire is disconnected from power. Also, make sure you do not stab yourself or the EL wire while sewing.

Start sewing at the EL wire\'s heat shrink and tie a knot around the EL wire. Continue making a loop around the EL wire to hold it down. When sewing with clear thread, make sure to pull the thread all the way through since the thread is slippery when sewn in certain fabrics. Be careful not to sew the front and back of the hoodie together. Also, ensure that the distance between each stitch is not too long. About 0.5\" to 1.0\" is a good stitch. Longer stitches can cause the EL wire to snag or become loose when wearing the EL hoodie.

[![Start Sewing at the Heat Shrink of the EL Wire](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Stitch_Loop_Clear_Thread.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Stitch_Loop_Clear_Thread.jpg)

After about 5x stitches, loop back through the last stitch with an overhand knot to lock the thread in and prevent it from sliding.

[![Tying a Knot After 5x Stitches to Prevent the Clear Thread from Sliding](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Overhand_Knot_Stitch_Clear_Thread.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Overhand_Knot_Stitch_Clear_Thread.jpg)

Continue sewing and remove any binder clips holding the EL wire down against the fabric. When sewing EL along the zipper, avoid looping the thread against the zipper.

[![Sewing EL Wire Beside Zipper](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Sewing_EL_Wire_Down_Along_Zipper_of_Hoodie.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Sewing_EL_Wire_Down_Along_Zipper_of_Hoodie.jpg)

While sewing the EL wire, try holding the EL down against the fabric using your non-dominant hand. Pinch below the area that you are sewing using your thumb and ring finger. Then pinch above the area that you are sewing using your index and middle finger. This keeps the center area (where you will be working with the needle) taut so that it is easier to sew.

[![Repeat the Steps Outlined Above](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Sewing_More_EL_Wire_Down_Along_Zipper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Sewing_More_EL_Wire_Down_Along_Zipper.jpg)

Once you begin to run out of thread to work with, tie the clear thread down against the fabric. Then repeat the steps outlined above with another piece of clear thread.

[![Clear Thread Tied in a Knot](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Clear_Thread_EL_Wire.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Clear_Thread_EL_Wire.jpg)

When you are finished sewing the EL wire down, make a loop with the end of the EL wire cable and sew the wire down for strain relief. Make sure this loop is beyond the heat shrink as the connection at the heat shrink is sensitive to bending.

[![Strain Relief](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Strain_Relief.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Strain_Relief.jpg)

Plug the EL wire back into the EL inverter to test it out. If it lights up, you are good to go! Place the EL inverter in a pocket or clip to a belt to enjoy! If you are using an EL inverter battery pack, you may want to [make an extension cable](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-custom-el-wire-extension-cable).

[![EL Wire in Pocket](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_EL_Inverter_Battery_Pocket.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_EL_Inverter_Battery_Pocket.jpg)

Remember, EL wire works best in low light. It may be hard to see in daylight or in rooms with sources of light.

### [][Different Hoodie Sizes](#diff_size)

Remember what I said about the size of the hoodie? Different hoodie sizes will require different lengths of EL wire - this variation can cause the EL wire to not start or end where you expect it to. Note the difference in the image in the bottom right.

### [][Sewing Into The Arms](#sewing-in-arms)

Looking for a challenge? Sewing EL wire onto the arms can be difficult depending on the fabric being used and the amount of space you have to work with. Three pieces of corrugated cardboard were custom cut to fit inside a hoodie\'s arm to help with sewing. To assemble, cut half way into the cardboard about 0.5\"-1\"\" away from the edge. It does not have to be perfect. Slide the cardboard pieces together and hot glue the joints.

[![Front View of Cardboard Braket](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Front_View_Cardboard_Bracket.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/7/0/Front_View_Cardboard_Bracket.jpg)
