## Introduction

The [SparkFun Qwiic adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14495) board is the perfect board to use if you need to make any old I^2^C board into a Qwiic enabled board. This adapter breaks out the I^2^C pins from the Qwiic connectors to pins that you can easily solder with your favorite I^2^C enabled device.

**Note:** Depending on your development board and system\'s voltage level, you may also need to use a logic level converter. Certain stackable breakout boards have a built in logic level converter (such as the [Qwiic Shield for Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14352). If it is not included in the design, you will need to grab the [bi-directional logic level converter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009).

### Tools

You will need a soldering iron, solder, and [general soldering accessories](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/49). To modify the headers, you will also need needle nose pliers and diagonal cutters.

## Hardware Overview

There are a few things you should know about the Qwiic system before you go plugging in I^2^C devices willy nilly. The first thing to be aware of is that all Qwiic devices run on **3.3V**. So if you have a 5V device and you are not using a stackable breakout board with a logic level converter (such as the [Qwiic Shield for Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14352)), you\'ll need to grab a [logic level converter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) to boost your signals up to 5V. Also, be aware that all Qwiic devices have pull-up resistors on the I^2^C lines. So if your device does not have it, you\'ll need to add those in or use the ones on your microcontroller.

The Qwiic adapter is populated with two [4-pin 1mm JST connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14417) to quickly connect your I^2^C devices together. Four plated through holes are broken out for SCL, SDA, 3.3V, and GND. These pins can be used to convert an old I^2^C enabled device into a Qwiic enabled board.

[![Top view of Qwiic Adapter](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/9/14495-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/9/14495-02.jpg)

## Hardware Assembly 

There are several different ways to connect your I^2^C device to the Qwiic adapter. The simplest and probably cleanest method would be to use headers. This also allows the adapter to be reattached to a different I^2^C device in the future. I\'ve found that I enjoy the look of the [90 degree male headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/553) on the Qwiic Adapter, combined with a 90-degree bend in the legs on the [female headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115) I^2^C device. However, you can really use any combination you\'d like depending on how you want the adapter to be oriented relative to your I^2^C enabled board.

Using [pliers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8793), snap off a row of 4 pins from the right angle male header. Using [diagonal cutters](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8794), you will need to sacrifice one socket in order cut off a row of 4 pins from the female header. Carefully bend the female header\'s pins using the pliers to make a right angle with the I^2^C device. [Solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) the male headers to the Qwiic adapter and the female headers to the I^2^C device as shown in the image below.

[![Qwiic Adapter attached with 90-degree Headers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/9/Qwiic_Adaptwe_Hookup_Guide.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/6/8/9/Qwiic_Adaptwe_Hookup_Guide.jpg)

Once you\'ve got headers soldered onto each of your boards, simply plug your adapter into your I^2^C enabled device. Using a Qwiic cable, plug your Qwiic adapter into a stackable Qwiic board of your choice. Assuming that there is example code loaded on your development board, you can now start reading data from your I^2^C enabled device!
