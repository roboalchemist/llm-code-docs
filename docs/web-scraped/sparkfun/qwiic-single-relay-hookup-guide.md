### Qwiic Shield for Arduino & Photon Hookup Guide 

Get started with our Qwiic ecosystem with the Qwiic shield for Arduino or Photon.

## Hardware Overview

First let\'s check out some of the characteristics listed in the [relay\'s datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/5/e/e/d/f/3V_Relay_Datasheet_en-g5le.pdf) that we\'re dealing with, so we know what to expect out of the board.

  **Characteristic**            **Range**
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Operating Voltage             **1.7V-3.6V**
  Supply Current                100mA
  Coil Resistance               23.5Ω
  I^2^C Address                 **0x18 (Default)**, *(Jumper changes to 0x19)*
  Max Current (Through Relay)   5.5A (240 VAC)

### Pins

The following table lists all of the relay\'s pins and their functionality.

  Pin    Description       Direction
  ------ ----------------- ----------------
  GND    Ground            In
  3.3V   Power             In
  SDA    Data              Bi-directional
  SCL    Clock             In
  NC     Normally Closed   Switch
  NO     Normally Open     Switch
  COM    Switch Common     Switch

### Optional Features

The Qwiic Relay has pull up resistors attached to the I^2^C bus; if multiple sensors are connected to the bus with the pull-up resistors enabled, the parallel equivalent resistance will create too strong of a pull-up for the bus to operate correctly. As a general rule of thumb, disable all but one pair of pull-up resistors if multiple devices are connected to the bus. If you need to disconnect the pull up resistors they can be removed by cutting the traces on the corresponding jumpers highlighted below.

## Hardware Assembly

If you haven\'t yet [assembled your Qwiic Shield](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-shield-for-arduino--photon-hookup-guide), now would be the time to head on over to that tutorial. Depending on the microcontroller and shield you\'ve chosen, your assembly may be different, but here\'s a handy link to the Qwiic Shield for Arduino and Photon Hookup Guide to get you started!

[Qwiic Shield for Arduino Photon Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-shield-for-arduino--photon-hookup-guide)

With the shield assembled, SparkFun\'s new Qwiic environment means that connecting the relay could not be easier. Just plug one end of the Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Relay, the other into the Qwiic Shield and you\'ll be ready to upload a sketch and start turning things on and off. It seems like it\'s too easy too use, but that\'s why we made it that way!

*SparkFun RedBoard and Qwiic Shield with the Qwiic Relay attached*

**Note:** Not sure about what color insulation wiring is used in you region? Check out the [standard wire insulation colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring) listed online for reference. If you are unsure about the standard wiring color in your region, please consult a certified electrician to connect to the AC input voltage side.

⚡ **Warning!** Make sure the cable is **not** plugged into the wall as you cut into the wire in the following section.

You\'ll also need to place the relay in line with the AC powered item you\'re attempting to control. You\'ll have to cut your live AC line (usually black or red) and connect one end of the cut wire to `COM` and the other to `NC` or `NO`, depending on what you want the resting state of your device to be. If your AC device is going to be on for most of the time, and you occasionally want to turn it off, you should connect one end to `COM` and the other to `NC`. Connect to `NO` if the device will be off for most of the time. Check out the picture below for a visual aid.

[![Relay Example Connection](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/3/2/connected.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/3/2/connected.png)

*Relay Example Connection*

⚡ **Warning!** Make sure that your wires connecting to the wall outlet are secure and are rated to handle the current! Please be careful when handling the contacts when the cable is plugged into a wall outlet. **Touching the contacts while powered could result in injury.**\

Looking for information about safety and insulation? Check out the notes about [Safety and Insulation from our Beefcake Relay Control Kit](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/beefcake-relay-control-hookup-guide/saftey-and-insulation).

⚡ **Each relay takes just over 100 mA to power** Daisy chaining these boards together on the same bus will result in pretty large power spikes, you may need a separate 3.3V source depending on what else is included in your project

## Arduino Library

We\'ve written a library to make it even easier to get started with the SparkFun Qwiic Single Relay. The library will give you the full functionality of the Qwiic Single Relay without the hub bub of the I²C data transactions. You can click the link below to download the file or navigate through the Arduino Library Manager by searching **SparkFun Qwiic Relay**. You can also go the [Github page](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Relay_Arduino_Library) and get it directly.

[SparkFun Qwiic Relay Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Relay_Arduino_Library/archive/master.zip)

This library also works with our [Qwiic Quad Relay board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15102). If you need more relays on one PCB, then go check it out!

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide) If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

### Library Functions Overview

The list below outlines the functions of the Qwiic Relay Arduino Library designed to work with the Qwiic Single Relay along with short descriptions of what they do. The examples cover nearly all of these functions so take a look at them for help integrating them into your own code.

- `bool begin(TwoWire &wirePort = Wire);` - Initialize the Qwiic Single Relay on the I^2^C bus
- `float singleRelayVersion();` - Returns the firmware version present on the Qwiic Single Relay.
- `void turnRelayOn();` - Turn the relay on.
- `void turnRelayOff();` - Turn the relay off.
- `void toggleRelay()` - Toggles the relay to the opposite state. The function first checks the status of the relay and is toggled to either `on` or `off` depending on what the status check returns.
- `uint8_t getState();` - Returns the status of the relay. Returns `1` if on or `0` if off.
- `bool changeAddress(uint8_t newAddress);` - Changes the I^2^C address of the Qwiic Relay to the value set for `newAddress`. Valid `newAddress` values can be between **0x07** and **0x78**. The new address is written to the memory location in EEPROM that determines the address.

## Example Code

The Qwiic Relay is pretty simple, so all of the functions to control it are simply contained in the first example of the SparkFun Qwiic Relay Arduino Library.

### Example 1 - Single Relay Basics

Go ahead and unzip the folder to a directory of your choosing and open up `Example1_Single_Relay_Basics`.

Starting at the top, we have `#include`-ed the path to the library\'s header file as well as to Arduino\'s I²C library: `Wire.h`. To use the functions in the SparkFun Qwiic Relay Library we create a version of it, and name it `relay`. You\'ll notice that in parentheses we have given it the board\'s address. If you have changed this address or closed the address jumper, than change the `RELAY_ADDR` to *your* address.

    language:c
    #include <Wire.h>
    #include "SparkFun_Qwiic_Relay.h"

    #define RELAY_ADDR 0x18 // Alternate address 0x19

    Qwiic_Relay relay(RELAY_ADDR); 

Let\'s look at the setup. First we check that we can communicate correctly with the Single Qwiic Relay with the `relay.begin()` function call. If there are some connection issues we\'ll find out about them here. Note that the code will not stop if there is an error, so keep an eye out for an eror message. Next we check the version of the firmware that is on your product with the `relay.singleRelayVersion()` function.

    language:c
    void setup()
    

Using the `getState` function we can check whether or not the relay is on or off without looking at the board. This can help you programmatically make decisions based on your project\'s needs.
