[![JTAG pins are highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_JTAG.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_JTAG.jpg)

### LED

There is only one LED available which is the Power LED. The LED lights up to indicate availability for the DA16200 from the 3.3V voltage regulator. You can disable it by cutting the jumper on the back of the board (see Jumpers below).

[![Power LED is just below the WiFi module on the right side of the board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_PwrButton.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_PwrButton.jpg)

### Jumpers

**Note:** If this is your first time working with jumpers, check out the [How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all) tutorial for more information.

The following jumpers are included to configure the board.

- **PWR** - By default, the jumper with the label `PWR` is closed. This jumper connects the 3.3V line and LED. Cutting this jumper will disable the LED.

[![Power LED Jumper is on the back of the board on the opposite side from the M2 connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_PwrLEDJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_PwrLEDJumper.jpg)

- **I^2^C Pull-up Resistors** - By default, this three way jumper labeled `I`^`2`^`C` is closed and connects two pull-up resistors to the I^2^C data lines. If you have [many devices on your I^2^C data lines](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all#i2c-at-the-hardware-level), then you may consider cutting these two jumpers.

[![I2C jumper is on the front of the board to the left of the WPS button](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_I2CJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_I2CJumper.jpg)

- **WP** - By default, write protect for the EEPROM is on. To disable write protection, close this jumper.

[![Write protect jumper is on the back of the board just next to the M2 Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_WPJumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_WPJumper.jpg)

### Board Dimensions

The board uses the standard MicroMod Function Board size which measures about 1.50\"x2.56\".

[![Board Dimensions](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/9/6/3/c/8/BoardOutline.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/6/3/c/8/BoardOutline.png)

## Hardware Hookup

### Adding a Processor Board to the Main Board

Align the top key of the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board to the *Processor* screw terminal of your Main Board and angle the board into the socket. Insert the board at an angle into the M.2 connector.

**Note:** There is no way to insert the processor backward since the key prevents it from mating with the M.2 connector and as an extra safeguard to prevent inserting a processor that matches the key, the mounting screw is offset so you will not be able to secure an improperly connected processor board.

The Processor Board will stick up at an angle, as seen here:

[![Main board with Processor Board sticking up at an angle](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-01.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-01.jpg)

Once the board is in the socket, gently push the MicroMod Processor Board down and tighten the screw with a Phillip\'s head.

[![Main board with Processor Board screwed in](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-02.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-02.jpg)

### Adding a Function Board to the Main Board

As with the Processor Board, align the top key of the MicroMod WiFi Function Board to the screw terminal of your Main Board on the *Function Board* side and angle the board into the socket. Insert the board at an angle into the M.2 connector.

[![Main board with Function Board sticking up at an angle](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-03.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-03.jpg)

Once the board is in the socket, gently push the MicroMod Function Board down and tighten the screws with a Phillip\'s head.

[![Main board with Function Board screwed in](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-04.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-04.jpg)

Once both boards are secure, your assembled MicroMod system should look similar to the image below!

[![Assembled main board with both processor and function boards securely fastened](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-05.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/DA16200_Function_Board_Hookup_Guide-05.jpg)

### DA16200 Firmware Update

To update the firmware you will need to connect the USB C cable to the MicroMod WiFi Function Board (DA16200) to a computer\'s COM port. An additional Main Board with a second USB C cable is also needed to power the Main Board and MicroMod WiFi Function Board.

[![USBC outlet on function board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_FirmwareUpload.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/0/6/1/18594-MicroMod-DA16200-Function-Board_FirmwareUpload.jpg)

## Software Installation

**Note:** This example assumes you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using Arduino, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide)

### Arduino Board Definitions

We\'ll assume that you installed the necessary board files for your Processor Board. In this case, we used the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board.
