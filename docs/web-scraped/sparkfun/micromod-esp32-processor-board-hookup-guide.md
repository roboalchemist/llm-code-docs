## Introduction

Introducing the [SparkFun MicroMod ESP32 Processor Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16781)! This bad boy pops an M.2 connector onto the ESP32 so you can take advantage of all that lovely ESP32 power with any of our MicroMod carrier boards. Grab yourself an ESP32 MicroMod Processor Board and let\'s dive in!

### Required Materials

In addition to your ESP32 Processor Board, you\'ll need a carrier board to get started. Here we use the Input and Display Carrier Board, but there are a number of others you can choose from.

You\'ll also need a USB-C cable to connect the Carrier to your computer and if you want to add some Qwiic breakouts to your MicroMod project you\'ll want at least one Qwiic cable to connect it all together. Below are some options for both of those cables:
