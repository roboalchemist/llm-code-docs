## Introduction 

In this tutorial, we will make a custom EL Wire extension cable as an alternative to splicing wire.

This is useful if you need to:

- extend the cable on the EL wire to an EL Inverter
- easily disconnect the EL Wire if the inverter is in an enclosure or attached to a separate piece of clothing
- provide additional flexibility for the cable to move around in wearable projects

Handling PCB jumper pads and traces is an essential skill. Learn how to cut a PCB trace, add a solder jumper between pads to reroute connections, and repair a trace with the green wire method if a trace is damaged.

## Hardware Assembly

First, break off a 2x6 grid of plated through holes from the snappable protoboard.

[![Snap Off 2x6 Grid Snappable ProtoBoard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/400-400/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/SparkFun_13268_snap_off_2x6_grid_snappable_protoboard.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/SparkFun_13268_snap_off_2x6_grid_snappable_protoboard.jpg)

Insert the JST connector connected to the jumper wire assembly such that the socket\'s end is flush with the board. This should be 3x plated through holes into the grid.

[![Insert JST Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Insert_JST_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Insert_JST_Connector.jpg)

Loop the wire around and insert the tinned wires on the opposite end so that they are adjacent to the JST connector\'s pins. To be consistent, connect the red wire\'s terminals together. Repeat for the black wire. Leave some room with 4x through holes at the end of the protoboard to reinforce the wire connection and provide some strain relief.

[![Insert Tinned Wires into Protoboard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Insert_Tinned_Wires.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Insert_Tinned_Wires.jpg)

Add a solder jumper between the pin and wire for the red wire. Repeat for the black wire. When finished, remove the JST connector from the socket.

[![Add Solder](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/Solder_Bridge_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/Solder_Bridge_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable.jpg)

Remember, EL wire runs on AC power. It's important to mention that the AC power coming from the inverter is not enough to hurt or kill you. However, it is enough to give you a good shock so it is a good idea to insulate the connection. Start by wrapping a piece of electrical tape around the middle of the JST connector\'s socket.

[![Insulate Connection with EL Tape](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Electrical_Tape.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/8/How_to_Make_a_Custom_EL_Wire_Extension_Cable_Electrical_Tape.jpg)

Add a drop of hot glue in the middle to secure the piece of tape and connection further. Make sure to not get any hot glue inside the JST connector\'s socket.

Finish wrapping the remaining electrical tape around the cable. The electrical tape will become tapered as you move away from the JST connector.

Add the extension cable between the inverter and EL wire. In the image below, the EL Wire extension cable provided easy access to the EL inverter battery pack from a hoodie\'s pocket.
