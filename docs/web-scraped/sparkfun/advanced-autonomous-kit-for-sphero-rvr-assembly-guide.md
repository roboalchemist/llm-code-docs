## Introduction

The [SparkFun Advanced Autonomous Kit for Sphero RVR](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15303) provides all the functionality of the basic kit with the addition of time-of-flight distance sensing in the front and rear. Based around Raspberry Pi's small yet powerful Zero W model, the kit provides distance sensing, global positioning, and vision to the Sphero RVR. In this tutorial we\'ll cover assembly of the kit\'s hardware. Most of the steps are fairly straight forward and just require a little bit of patience.

### Before We Begin

If you haven\'t already, start charging the RVR battery. It takes a while to charge, so now would be a good time to get it going.
