## Introduction

The [SparkFun Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16789) allows you to add the [SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) to development boards that use the Arduino Nano Footprint in an easy-to-assemble shield. It connects the I^2^C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Arduino Nano to four SparkFun Qwiic connectors. The Qwiic ecosystem allows for easy daisy chaining so, as long as your devices are on different addresses, you can connect as many Qwiic devices as you\'d like.

### Required Tools

You will need a [soldering iron](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/49), solder, and general soldering accessories to solder the header pins to the Qwiic shields.

## Hardware Overview

The Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano is pretty straight forward shield but has a few extra bits we\'ll cover in this section.

### Qwiic Connectors

Just like our other Qwiic adapter boards, the Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano comes with several Qwiic connectors. There are two horizontal Qwiic connectors on the edges of the board and two vertical ones in the center.

[![Image highlighting Qwiic Connectors on Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_Qwiic.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_Qwiic.jpg)

### Logic Shifting Circuit and IOREF Jumper

The Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano has a configurable logic shifting circuit depending on the voltage your Arduino Nano runs at. There is a jumper on the shield to set the IOREF voltage for the logic shifting circuit. The jumper defaults to **3.3V** which works fine for 33 Nanos like the [Arduino 33 Nano BLE](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15588) but you will need to switch the jumper to **5V** for Arduino Nanos that run at **5V** like the [Arduino Nano Every](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15590).

[![Image Highlighting logic circuit for Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_Logic_Circuit.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_Logic_Circuit.jpg)

### How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces 

April 2, 2018

Handling PCB jumper pads and traces is an essential skill. Learn how to cut a PCB trace, add a solder jumper between pads to reroute connections, and repair a trace with the green wire method if a trace is damaged.

### I^2^C Jumper

The I^2^C jumper pulls the Qwiic SDA and SCL lines up to **3.3V** through **4.7K** resistors. The reference voltage set by the IOREF Jumper has no effect on the voltage of the pull up resistors. You can disable them by severing the trace in between the pads if you have many devices on your I^2^C bus.

[![Image highlighting I2C Jumper on the Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_I2C_Jumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/SparkFun_Qwiic_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano_I2C_Jumper.jpg)

### Board Dimensions

The shield measures 1.7in. x 0.7in. (43.18mm x 17.78mm) and has four mounting holes with a 0.07in diameter that match those on the Nano footprint.

[![Dimensional Drawing for Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/Qwiic_Shield_Nano_Dimensions.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/0/6/Qwiic_Shield_Nano_Dimensions.png)

## Hardware Assembly

All that is needed to get started using the Qwiic Shield for Arduino Nano is to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) the included stackable header kit or your chosen headers to the shield and, if necessary, to your Arduino Nano. If you have never worked with an Arduino Shield before or need some tips, our [Arduino Shields Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/arduino-shields-v2#installing-headers-preparation) provides detailed instructions on how to assemble and use them. Take care to match the markings on the Qwiic Shield to the appropriate pins on your Nano to avoid shorting anything out and possibly damaging your Nano. Also, some variants of the Nano like the [Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15580) have sensors or antennas that can be affected by the Qwiic Shield\'s placement on top such that you may want to consider placing the Qwiic Shield below your Arduino Nano.

Once you have soldered headers to your shield and connected it to your Nano, it\'s time to start connecting some Qwiic devices! Below you can see the Qwiic Shield attached to an [Arduino Nano Every](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15590) using some female and male headers with a couple of Qwiic devices attached.
