## Introduction

Looking for a one square inch sized microcontroller to use with the Qwiic system? At it\'s heart is the powerful and versatile ATSAMD21E18, which is an ARM Cortex M0+, 32-bit microcontroller, with 256KB of flash memory that can run at up to 48MHz. We\'ve programmed it with an [UF2 Bootloader](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1) making the Qwiic Micro easy to program whether you want to use Arduino or CircuitPython. In this hookup guide we\'ll walk through all of the features available on the SparkFun Qwiic Micro.

### Required Materials

In addition to the Qwiic Micro, you\'ll also need a [Micro-B Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215) (as if you don\'t already have dozens in your USB cable drawer!). That\'s all you\'ll need to get started. You can also take advantage of its LiPo battery port with a [single-cell Lithium Polymer battery](https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=lithium%20polymer). You may not need everything though depending on what you have. Add it to your cart, read through the guide, and adjust the cart as necessary.

#### Optional Materials

There are a few options to connect and power to the board depending on your project. If you are connecting a Qwiic sensor to the Qwiic connector, you\'ll need a Qwiic cable. For those that want access to the plated through hole pads on the side, you\'ll need to solder [header pins](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/381) or wires on the side for a secure connection. For anyone using a LiPo battery with the board, you\'ll need to solder the JST connector on the back.

### SAMD21 Mini/Dev Breakout Hookup Guide 

An introduction to the Atmel ATSAMD21G18 microprocessor and our Mini and Pro R3 breakout boards. Level up your Arduino-skills with the powerful ARM Cortex M0+ processor.

## Hardware Overview

**Note:** This hookup guide will not go into the specific details of the SAMD21 IC, because we already have a nice write up on that here: [SAMD21 Overview](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/samd21-minidev-breakout-hookup-guide/samd21-overview). Here is a link to the [datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-42181-sam-d21_datasheet.pdf) for any additional details not covered in the overview.

Before we get into programming the SAMD21, let\'s first cover some of the features built into the [SparkFun Qwiic Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15423). The Qwiic Micro is similar to our other SAMD21 boards such as the [SAMD21 Dev Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13672), except much much smaller. In this section, we\'ll cover the hardware on the SparkFun Qwiic Micro, including its I/O pins and the various LEDs. We\'ll also cover the different options for powering the board.

### Supplying Power and Power Switch

The SparkFun Qwiic Micro operates at **3.3 volts** which makes it ideal for the Qwiic eco-system. Power can be supplied to the SparkFun Qwiic Micro through **micro-USB**. It is also possible to supply power through the through holes labeled `3V3` and `GND` located in the lower right hand section of the board.

[![This image shows the top of the SparFun Qwiic Micro and highlights the Micro-USB connector, and the lower two pins on the right side header.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Power_Input.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Power_Input.jpg)

The power header pins are **not** regulated, so make sure that you have a steady 3.3V power supply when providing power through here.

Additionally, we\'ve provided pads for an SMD LiPo battery connector if you have it, see the **Optional Circuitry** section below. The **micro-USB** connector should work with one of the many USB phone-charging cables you have lying around, or one of our micro-USB cables. Below is a list of micro-USB options that SparkFun offers.

### Pin Mapping

⚡ **3.3V Logic Levels!** When you start interfacing with the SAMD21\'s I/O pins using external sensors and other components, keep in mind that each I/O will produce, at most, 3.3V for a high-level output.

When configured as an input, the maximum input voltage for each I/O is 3.6V (VDD+0.3V). If you\'re interfacing the SAMD21 with 5V devices, you may need some [level shifters](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) in between.

The [graphical datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/4/8/4/f/b/Qwiic_Micro_Graphical_Datasheet.pdf) for the SparkFun Qwiic Micro below, shows the complete functionality of each pin; which pins are analog, digital, where [SERCOM](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/adding-more-sercom-ports-for-samd-boards/all) ports are located, and which data buses are available. All **PWM-capable** pins except the DAC are capable of PWM output. The DAC pin provides a true 10-bit analog output. In [Example: Analog Input and Output](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#example-3-analog-input-and-output), there are steps on how to take full advantage of this feature.

[![Graphical Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Micro_SAMD21E_Graphical_Datasheet_V1a.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Micro_Graphical_Datasheet_V1a.pdf)

*Click on image for a closer view.*

**Note:** There was an error in the initial graphical datasheet for PORTA, analog pins, and secondary pin functions. The current graphical datasheet reflects the correct pinout. Additionally, there is a silkscreen error on the hardware UART pins. D16 should be RX while D17 should be Tx. There are plans to change the silkscreen in a future revision.

### Qwiic Connector

On the opposite edge of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro is a Qwiic connector.

[![This image shows the top of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro and highlights the black connector also known as a qwiic connector, located on the lower edge of the board.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Connector.jpg)

If you\'re not familar with the [Qwiic Ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic), the short of it is that we have integrated *Qwiic Connectors* on many sensors and development boards that allow for quick (get it?) I^2^C connections through cables rather than soldering. It\'s an *extremely* useful tool. Check out the banner below for more information.

[![Qwiic Connect System](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/custom_pages/2/7/2/qwiic-logo.png "Qwiic Connect System")](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)

### LEDs

The SparkFun Qwiic Micro has a red power LED that has become emblematic of our [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) eco-system and indicates power is being supplied to the board and that the power switch is in the **ON** position. Additionally, there is a stat LED that is attached to pin D13 and is labeled **D13**.

[![This image shows the top of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro and highlights the two LEDs located on each side of the Qwiic connector on the lower edge of the board.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/LEDs.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/LEDs.jpg)

*D13 Stat LED on the Left, Power LED on the right*

If you want to minimize the current draw of your Qwiic Micro or just don\'t like the power LED we\'ve provided a jumper on the underside to disconnect it; see **Jumper** section below.

### Jumper

On the underside of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro just below the power LED we\'ve provided a jumper to disconnect the power LED to help keep the current draw of the microcontroller low. Simply take a hobby knife and cut the trace in between the two pads to sever its\' connection. Simply re-solder this jumper to reconnect it. If you need some instructions for working with jumper pads then [check out our tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all).

[![This image shows the bottom of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro with the USB facing up and highlights a small jumper located in the lower left of the board near the screw hole. ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/LED_Jumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/LED_Jumper.jpg)

### Reset Button

On the topside of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro is a reset button which resets the board when pressed. If you find yourself with a botched Circuit Python installation, or a sketch that has left your board inoperable, then you can **tap** this button **twice** to re-enter **bootloader mode**. You\'ll know you\'ve done it correctly when the **D13 Stat LED** is dimming and brightening in a *breathing* pattern.

[![This image shows the top of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro and highlights the small reset button located on the right side of the board.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Reset_button.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Reset_button.jpg)

### Programming Header

There is a small four pin programming header exposed on both the top and bottom side of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro. This header breaks out the following pins for SWD programming:

[![Programming Header Top Side](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Programming_Header.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Programming_Header.jpg)

[Programming through this header](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/arm-programming) would allow you to put a different bootloader on the chip, or to configure the SAMD21\'s flexible SERCOM ports to add another I^2^C port for example. You can check out [this guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/adding-more-sercom-ports-for-samd-boards/all) to see how this is done.

**Tip:** To keep the board size at a minimum, the pins are not the standard 2x8 headers that you see on other ARM boards. To connect a programmer, try using 0Ω resistors (or [thin solid wires](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14914)) to connect to the 1.27mm spaced headers. We use this trick to [program an AVR microcontroller with ICSP pins broken out on test pads](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-a-bootloader-on-the-microview#connect-by-resistor) similar like the image shown below.\

### Optional Circuitry

#### LiPo Battery

On the underside we\'ve included empty pads for a few optional items. First in the upper right is a space for a [LiPo Battery Connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8612). You\'ll need to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) connector if you decide to power your project though this connector.

[![This image shows the bottom of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro and highlights a grouping of SMD pads near the top edge of the board, directly under the micro-USB where a lipo battery connector can be soldered onto.](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Lipo_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Lipo_Connector.jpg)

While it\'s possible, I strongly recommend against soldering wires directly to these pads unless you feel confident in this decision. If you\'re going to solder directly to the pads, make sure to solder your RED or power wire, onto the pad labeled with the \"**+**\" symbol and the BLACK or GND wire onto the \"**-**\" pad.

#### Optional Flash Memory Chip

Just below that is a space for a flash memory chip.

[![This image shows the bottom of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro and highlights a grouping of SMD pads located in the center the board where a flash chip can be soldered onto. ](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/EEPROM.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/EEPROM.jpg)

If you want to add extra memory to the SparkFun Qwiic Micro than you can solder an 8 pin SOIC to these pads. The [4MB flash chip from Winbond: the W25Q32FV](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15809) which works with the very useful Arduino Library [SPI Memory](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory). Check out [Example 4: Flash Memory](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#example-4-flash-memory-with-spimemory) to see how to use an external flash with the SparkFun Qwiic Micro. In addition we\'ve provided **CircuitPython firmware** for the SparkFun Qwiic Micro that can use this memory as well.

**Heads up!** Please be aware that the SparkFun Qwiic Micro is **NOT currently supported on Windows 8** due to a lack of support drivers.

The SparkFun Qwiic Micro comes with a UF2 bootloader which has the unique benefit of sidestepping driver installation on modern operating systems like Windows 10, Mac, and Linux! The UF2 bootloader turns the SparkFun Qwiic Micro into a USB mass storage device and so behaves like a flash drive when you plug it into your computer. However in the Arduino IDE, nothing will change: you\'ll still select its COM Port when uploading your code.

### \....yes but what *is* UF2?

UF2 stands for USB Flashing Format, which was developed by Microsoft for PXT (now known as MakeCode) for flashing microcontrollers over the Mass Storage Class (MSC), just like a removable flash drive. The file format is unique, so unfortunately, you cannot simply drag and drop a compiled binary or hex file onto the Qwiic Micro. Instead, the format of the file has extra information to tell the processor where the data goes, in addition to the data itself.

For Arduino users, the UF2 bootloader is **BOSSA compatible**, which the Arduino IDE expects on ATSAMD boards. For more information about UF2, you can read more from the [MakeCode blog](https://makecode.com/blog/one-chip-to-flash-them-all), as well as the [UF2 file format specifiation](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2).

### [][Windows 7](#windows-7)

Unfortunately if you are using a Windows 7 OS, you will still need to install the SAMD drivers using the [SAMD Windows 7 Installer](https://github.com/sparkfun/samd_windows7_installer/releases).

## Setting Up Arduino

While the SAMD21 alone is powerful enough, what truly makes it special is its growing support in the Arduino IDE. With just a couple click\'s, copies, and pastes, you can add ARM Cortex-M0+-support to your Arduino IDE. This page will list every step required for getting SparkFun Qwiic Micro installed into the Arduino IDE.

**Update Arduino!** This setup requires *at least* Arduino version 1.6.4 or later. We\'ve tested it on 1.6.5 and the latest version -- 1.8.8. If you\'re running an older version of Arduino, consider visiting [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to get the latest, greatest release.

### Install Arduino SAMD Board Add-Ons

First, you\'ll need to install a variety of tools, including [low-level ARM Cortex libraries](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php) full of generic code, [arm-gcc](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) to compile your code, and [bossa](http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa) to upload over the bootloader. These tools come packaged along with Arduino\'s SAMD board definitions for the Arduino Zero.

To install the Arduino SAMD board definitions, navigate to your board manager (**Tools** \> **Board** \> **Boards Manager\...**), then find an entry for **Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M0+)**. Select it, and install the latest version (recently updated to *v1.8.4*).

[![Installing the Arduino SAMD boards](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/arduino-arduino-board-install.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/arduino-arduino-board-install.png)

Downloading and installing the tools may take a couple minutes \-- arm-gcc in particular will take the longest, it\'s about 250MB unpacked.

Once installed, Arduino-blue \"Installed\" text should appear next to the SAMD boards list entry.

### Install SparkFun Board Add-On

Now that your ARM tools are installed, one last bit of setup is required to add support for the SparkFun SAMD boards. First, open your Arduino preferences (**File** \> **Preferences**). Then find the **Additional Board Manager URLs** text box, and paste the below link in:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/main/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json

[![Arduino IDE Preferences Additional Moard Manager URLs](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/arduino-board-add.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/arduino-board-add.png)

Then hit \"OK\", and travel back to the **Board Manager** menu. You should (but probably won\'t) be able to find a new entry for **SparkFun SAMD Boards**. If you don\'t see it, close the board manager and open it again. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

[![Installing the SparkFun SAMD Boards](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/sparkfun-arduino-board-install.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/sparkfun-arduino-board-install.png)

This installation should be much faster; you\'ve already done the heavy lifting in the previous section. When writing this tutorial, the board version used in this tutorial should be **v1.7.0**. You may have a higher version as the board if there are any updates.

### Select the Board and Serial Port

Once the board is installed, you should see a new entry in your **Tools** \> **Board** list. **Select your SparkFun Qwiic Micro.**

Finally, select the SparkFun Qwiic Micro\'s **port** when the board is connected to your computer with the power switch in the ON position. Navigate back up to the **Tool** \> **Port** menu. The port menu will have the SparkFun Qwiic Micro\'s port, labeled as such here. On a Windows machine, the serial port should come in the form of \"**COM#**\". On a Mac or Linux machine, the port will look like \"**/dev/cu.usbmodem####**\".

[![Board and COM Port Selection in the Arduino IDE](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Selecting_BOARD_and_COM_PORT.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Selecting_BOARD_and_COM_PORT.JPG)

In the picture above my Qwiic Micro is listed under **COM93**; this is because I\'ve plugged in about as many microcontrollers into my computer, but the one in your port menu should be a lot smaller.

## Example 1: Blink

Here\'s a quick example sketch to get the iconic blinking blue stat LED for Arduino blinking on the SparkFun Qwiic Micro; simply copy and paste from below, then click upload!

    language:c
    const int LED = 13; // Blue "stat" LED on pin 13

    void setup() 
    

    void loop() 
    

Now that you\'ve passed the Arduino litmus test, you\'re all set up to start building your first project. If you haven\'t already, go check out our [Qwiic eco-system](www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) which allows you to easily connect with sensors and other devices without the need for soldering.

[![Qwiic Connect System](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/custom_pages/2/7/2/qwiic-logo.png "Qwiic Connect System")](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)

In addition each add-on board within this eco-system has a library to get you started right away. For example, do you want to turn on a [lamp](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15093) with your SparkFun Qwiic Micro, better yet [four](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15102) lamps, or perhaps you\'d like to see how much [light](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15436) your plants are getting?

## Example 2: Serial Ports

One of the SAMD21\'s most exciting features is SERCOM \-- its multiple, configurable serial ports. The Arduino IDE equips the SAMD21 with a hardware serial port, by default, plus a \"USB serial port\" for communicating between the serial monitor.

Each of these serial ports has a unique `Serial` object which you\'ll refer to in code:

  Serial Object   Serial Port                   RX Pin   TX Pin
  --------------- ----------------------------- -------- --------
  `SerialUSB`     USB Serial (Serial Monitor)            
  `Serial`        Hardware Serial Port          D16      D17

**Note:** There is a silkscreen error on the hardware UART pins. D16 should be RX while D17 should be Tx. There are plans to change the silkscreen in a future revision. Just be aware of the connections listed when making a connection to the hardware UART pins on the other device.

There are a couple critical things to notice here. First of all, if you\'re trying to use the Serial Monitor to debug, you\'ll need to use `SerialUSB.begin(<baud>)` and `SerialUSB.print()`. (Thankfully find/replace exists for adjusting example code.) You can also add ` #define Serial SerialUSB ` to the beginning of a sketch. This will tell the IDE to replace \"Serial\" with \"SerialUSB\" everywhere it sees it before it compiles.

Here\'s a quick example demonstrating the differences between [Serial Monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) and `Serial`. It is designed to route data from `Serial` to the Serial Monitor, and vice-versa.

    language:c
    void setup()
    

    void loop()
    
        // Print a message stating what we're sending:
        SerialUSB.println("Sending " + toSend + " to Serial");

        // Send the assembled string out over the hardware
        // Serial port (TX pin 1).
        Serial.print(toSend);
      }

      if (Serial.available()) // If data is sent from device
      
        // Print a message stating what we've received:
        SerialUSB.println("Received " + toSend + " from Serial");
      }
    }

Then try typing something into the serial monitor. Even with nothing connected to the hardware serial port, you should see what you typed echoed back at you. It should look similar to the image below similar to the SAMD21 breakout.

[![Example serial monitor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/serial-monitor-example.png)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/5/4/serial-monitor-example.png)

**Note:** Not seeing any serial data?! If you reset the board while the Arduino Serial Monitor is open, you may need to close the window, check that you have selected the correct COM port, and then reopen the Arduino Serial Monitor. As a last resort, try closing the Arduino IDE and reopening the program before opening the Arduino Serial Monitor again.

You can further test this sketch out by connecting an [3.3V FTDI Basic](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873) or any other serial device to the SAMD21\'s pins 17 (RX) and 16 (TX). You\'ll need [IC hooks](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9741) for a quick temporary connection. Otherwise, you\'ll need to solder pins or wires to the board. By opening up a [serial terminal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/tera-term-windows), any data sent from the FTDI should end up in your Arduino Serial Monitor, and data sent to your Arduino Serial Monitor will route over to the FTDI. Here\'s a table that shows what pins to connect together.

**Note:** There is a silkscreen error on the hardware UART pins. D16 should be RX while D17 should be Tx. There are plans to change the silkscreen in a future revision. Just make sure to connect the following pins on the Qwiic Micro V1.0 to the respective hardware UART pins on the other device.

  Qwiic Micro Pins   3.3V FTDI (or any USB-to-Serial Converter) Pins
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------
  D16/TX             TXO
  D17/RX             RXI
  GND                GND

## Example 3: Analog Input and Output

While it still has PWM-based \"analog outputs\", the SAMD21 also features true analog output in the form of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This module can produce an analog voltage between 0 and 3.3V. It can be used to produce audio with more natural sound, or as a kind of \"digital potentiometer\" to control analog devices.

The DAC is only available on the **Arduino pin A0**, and is controlled using `analogWrite(A0, <value>)`. The DAC can be set up to 10-bit resolution (make sure to call [analogWriteResolution(10)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWriteResolution) in your setup), which means values between 0 and 1023 will set the voltage to somewhere between 0 and 3.3V.

In addition to the DAC, the SAMD21\'s ADC channels also stand apart from the ATmega328: they\'re equipped with up to **12-bit resolution**. That means the analog input values can range from 0-4095, representing a voltage between 0 and 3.3V. To use the ADC\'s in 12-bit mode, make sure you call [analogReadResolution(12)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogReadResolution) in your setup.

### Serial Plotting the DAC

The **Serial Plotter** in this example requires Arduino 1.6.6 or later. Visit [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to get the latest, greatest version.

Here\'s an example that demonstrates both the 10-bit DAC and the 12-bit ADC. To set the experiment up, **connect A0 to A1** with a jumper \-- we\'ll drive A0 with an analog voltage, then read it with A1. To keep the board size to a minimum, we were not able to include additional labels for each pin\'s functions. Therefore, **A0** is labeled as **D1/DAC** and **A1** is labeled as **D2**. Since there are no headers soldered, you will need to hold the jumper wire in place to with your thumb and index finger for a temporary connection. It\'s the simplest circuit we\'ve ever put in a tutorial:

[![Jumper Connected to DAC and Analog Pin](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic-Micro_Analog-Input-Output-Jumper.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic-Micro_Analog-Input-Output-Jumper.jpg)

*Jumping a temporary connection between A0 (our DAC) and A1. On the board, A0 is labeled D1 and A1 is labeled as D2.*

Then copy and paste the code below into your Arduino IDE, and upload!

    language:c
    // Connect A0 to A1, then open the Serial Plotter.

    #define DAC_PIN A0 // Make code a bit more legible

    float x = 0; // Value to take the sin of
    float increment = 0.02;  // Value to increment x by each time
    int frequency = 440; // Frequency of sine wave

    void setup() 
    

    void loop() 
    

This sketch produces a sine wave output on A0, with values ranging from 0 to 3.3V. Then it uses A1 to read that output into its 12-bit ADC, and convert it into a voltage between 0 and 3.3V.

You can, of course, open the serial monitor to view the voltage values stream by. But if the sine wave is hard to visualize through text, check out Arduino\'s new **Serial Plotter**, by going to **Tools** \> **Serial Plotter**.

[![Arduino IDE Serial Plotter](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Arduino_Serial_Plotter.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Arduino_Serial_Plotter.jpg)

And take in the majesty of that sine wave. Since we are temporarily holding the jumper wire in place with our fingers, the sine wave may not be perfect whenever you release pressure on the jumper wire.

## Example 4: Flash Memory with SPIMemory

**Note:** As stated in the Hardware Overview, you will need to [solder](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering) a flash memory IC to the board in order to follow along with this example!\
\

[![Serial Flash Memory - W25Q32FV (32Mb, 104MHz, SOIC-8)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/140-140/assets/parts/1/1/3/6/6/15809-Winbond_W25Q32FV_32Mb__4MB__Serial_Flash_Memory_-_SOIC_8_Package-01.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/serial-flash-memory-w25q32fv-32mb-104mhz-soic-8.html)

### Installing the SPI Memory Arduino Library

**Note:** If you have not previously installed an Arduino library, please check out our [installation guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library)

The following example shows you the basic way to start writing information to the optional flash memory that can be soldered to the underside of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro. The example simply shows you how to set up the code to interact with the flash chip and demonstrates this by writing a single number to an address space on it.

To begin you\'ll first need to download and install the SPIMemory Arduino Library. You can download it directly from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory) or download a zip from the button below. If you\'ve never installed a library before then follow our helpful tutorial [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-an-arduino-library/all) for directions on how to do it.

[SPI Memory Arduino Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory/archive/master.zip)

### Example Code

The setup is a bit different than the example code supplied by the library because the flash is connected to a seperate SPI bus that is different then the default one broken out to the SparkFun Qwiic Micro\'s headers. At the top we use the library by calling `SPIFlash` and creating an instance of the library, calling it `flash`. `Flash` takes *two* arguments: the flash chip\'s chip select pin, and secondly the alternate SPI port to be used. Since the memory chip is on **SPI1**, we\'ll give it that but precede it with an ampersand as demonstrated: `&SPI1`.

    language:c
    #include "SPIMemory.h"

    const int blinkLED = 13; 
    const int flashCS = 21; // Chip select for Flash

    SPIFlash flash(flashCS, &SPI1); // Our Flash is on a different SPI bus

    unsigned long addr = 0x01; // Random selection
    byte data = 0x03; // Random data

In the setup, confirm we enable SPI1 bus with `SPI1.begin()` and that\'s all you need! Further into the setup, we erase the address that\'s going to be written to, and then write to it. We double check this was done correctly by reading that address to the serial monitor. Just make sure to set the baud rate at **115200** to view the output.

    language:c
    void setup() // Wait until the Serial Port is opened. 
        SerialUSB.println("Hello!");

        if(flash.eraseBlock32K(addr))
        else
            SerialUSB.println("Error.");

        if(flash.writeByte(addr, data, true))
        else
            SerialUSB.println("Nothing written");

        }

    void loop()

## CircuitPython

CircuitPython is Adafruit\'s version of MicroPython. We like it here at SparkFun because of it\'s support for the SAMD based microcontrollers. If you\'re not familiar with CircuitPython, then I encourage you to check Adafruit\'s website for more information.

We\'ve provided two different CircuitPython builds for the Qwiic Micro in the Qwiic Micro\'s [hardware repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Micro_SAMD21E/tree/main/Firmware/Circuit%20Python%20Firmware/Firmware_no_flash), one for those of you have soldered the flash chip sold on SparkFun and one for those without flash chip. You can also get both firmware zip files by clicking the respective buttons below. If you\'re not familiar with the optional flash chip you can add to the SparkFun Qwiic Micro, head back to the [Hardware Overview](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#hardware-overview) and take a look.

[CircuitPython Firmware **NO** flash](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Firmware_no_flash.zip)

[CircuitPYthon Firmware **WITH** flash](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Firmware_with_flash.zip%20)

Inside the zipped file are three different files which all do the same things. One of the files has a **.uf2** file extension which is designed to work with [UF2 bootloaders](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#uf2-bootloader-and-drivers). In the next section, we\'ll focus on installing CircuitPython using this method.

## Installing CircuitPython

When you plug the SparkFun Qwiic Micro into your computer, it should pop up in a window titled **Qwiic Micro** like the one below. If not, press the reset button twice.

[![Qwiic Micro Showing Up as a Removable Drive](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Micro_UF2_Firmware.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Qwiic_Micro_UF2_Firmware.JPG)

To the right of the SparkFun Qwiic Micro pop up window is the **firmware_no_flash.uf2** file from the zipped file\'s **firmware** folder that will install CircuitPython. Again, if you\'ve soldered the flash chip, then you\'ll choose the **firmware_with_flash.uf2** file instead. To install the file, simply drag the **.uf2** from the desktop into the SparkFun Qwiic Micro window. The window should close and the re-open but this time it will be titled **CIRCUITPY**.

[![alt text](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Installed_CircuitPYthon.JPG)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/1/7/Installed_CircuitPYthon.JPG)

That\'s it!

## Reinstalling CircuitPython

If you\'ve installed CircuitPython but have decided to use Arduino instead, but then decided to use CircuitPython again (make up your mind), then use the following instructions to reinstall CircuitPython onto the SparkFun Qwiic Micro. I\'ll assume you know where to get the CircuitPython firmware files since you had to follow the instructions to install CircuitPython to get to this point. *Hint: there in the [Installing CircuitPython](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#installing-circuitpython) section above.*

### Reset Board to Bootloader

We want the board to reset to the UF2 bootloader (which as mentioned [above](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-qwiic-micro-samd21e-hookup-guide#uf2-bootloader-and-drivers)) enables the board to act like a flash drive. After plugging the SparkFun Qwiic Micro into your computer, *double* tap the reset button. If done correctly, the board will pop up as a removable drive titled **Qwiic Micro** and the D13 LED will have a slow breathing pattern. Now it\'s just a matter of dragging the **.uf2** Circuit Python file into the Qwiic Micro window. It will close and re-open in a window now titled **CIRCUITPY**.

## Using CircuitPython

If this is your first foray into CircuitPython, then I urge you to visit Adafruit\'s website to learn about [everything CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython).
