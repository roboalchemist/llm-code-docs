## Hardware Overview

### ATX Connector Side

The board has the option of soldering a 4-pin right angle ATX power connector.

Depending on your application, you may want to add a vertical connector. Have no fear! The PTH pads were adjusted so that a 4-pin vertical connector can be added. Just follow the dashed silkscreen that outlines the perimeter of the connector.

### 5mm Screw Terminals

On the output side of the breakout, there is a spot for two 2-pin 5mm screw terminals.

### Breadboard Compatible Pins

There is also an option of adding vertical or SMD right angle header pins if you need to connect the breakout to a breadboard or jumper wires. Just keep in mind that the amount of current the headers can handle is less than the screw terminals.

### Board Dimensions

The board is 1.33in x 1.35in and includes four mounting holes to secure the board on a panel or enclosure.

## Hardware Assembly

You\'ll need to solder the connectors of your choice to the breakout. If you have not soldered before, check out our tutorial below for tips!

### How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering 

September 19, 2013

This tutorial covers everything you need to know about through-hole soldering.

### Soldering the Input Connector

You\'ll need to decide on an ATX connector to solder on the breakout board. The board is compatible with both right angle and vertical connectors. We\'ll be using the right angle connector since the board is available in SparkFun\'s catalog. When inserting the right angle connector, make sure to insert the support legs first before inserting the pins into the through hole pads.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have chosen the ATX connector of your choice, solder each pin to the breakout.

Your board should look similar to the image to the left for the right angle connector. If you happen to have a vertical connector from a different distributor, your board should look similar to the image on the right.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Soldering the Output Connector

Depending on your application, you can solder screw terminals or header pins to the breakout. With the screw terminals you can easily secure fork connectors or wires. If you choose the screw terminal route, you may need to [strip wires](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire#how-to-strip-a-wire) before tightening the screws down for each respective pin. Should you decide to solder straight header pins, you can insert the board into a breadboard or protoboard. There is also an option to solder [right angle SMD headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12638) to the board as well depending on your application. Below are a few configurations depending on the connector and header that you choose. Remember, the SparkFun catalog only has the right angle connector available.

## Power Supply Options

Below are options where you will encounter the 4-pin connector.

### ATX Power Supply

[ATX power supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#Main_changes_from_AT_and_LPX_designs) usually have a number of power connectors available to power components for a desktop computer. The connector of interest in the image below is the second connector from the right. This [4-pin power connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex_connector#Disk_drive) is intended to power 12V and 5V computer peripherals (such as disk drives). Depending on the manufacturer of the power supply, the quantity of each connector can vary. If you want to grab some juice for your project from this type of power supply, you\'ll need to connect the breakout board to this port.

[![ATX power supply with power connectors](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/6/7/HEC_350W_ATX_power_supply.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/6/7/HEC_350W_ATX_power_supply.jpg)

*Image Courtesy of [User \"Smial\" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#Main_changes_from_AT_and_LPX_designs)*

**Heads up!** Depending on your power supply (especially older ones), the voltage may become unstable or turn off unless there is a minimum \"dummy\" load. If you are using only one side of the voltage, make sure to check the datasheet and ensure that you are meeting the minimum load requirement. For more information, check out this article below.\

- [Instructables: Convert a Computer Power Supply to a Variable Bench Top Lab Power Supply](https://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-A-Computer-Power-supply-to-a-Bench-Top-Lab/)

\
In most cases, a minimum of about [10Ω 10Watt power resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13053) is needed. Otherwise, just use [Ohm\'s Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law#ohms-law) and [calculate the amount of power](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power#calculating-power) that the power resistor will absorbing to ensure that it can handle the current. Depending on your power supply, the power resistor can become hot so make sure to use a heat sink and enough air flow to dissipate the heat. You can also add a few of power resistors in parallel.\

### 12V/5V (2A) Power Supply

Certain wall adapters also take advantage of this standard 4-pin port like the 12V/5V (2A) power supply in the catalog. If your project requires either/both 12V and 5V for power you can also connect the breakout board to this power supply.

[![4-Pin ATX Connector and Wires Inserted to Breakout Board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/9/6/7/ATX_Power_Connector_12V_5V_Wires.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/9/6/7/ATX_Power_Connector_12V_5V_Wires.jpg)

**Heads up!** If you are using only one of the voltages from the 12V/5V power supply, the other side may become unstable if there is not a minimum load (10mA) just like the note in the ATX power supply above. Depending on your project, you may need to add load in order for the voltage to become stable for long term installations. When testing it out with a multimeter without a load on both sides, the voltages appeared to be stable.\

A minimum of about [10Ω 10Watt power resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13053) is needed if you are seeing this instability. In most cases, a minimum of about [10Ω 10Watt power resistor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13053) is needed. Otherwise, just use [Ohm\'s Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law#ohms-law) and [calculate the amount of power](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/electric-power#calculating-power) that the resistor will absorbing to ensure that it can handle the current.
