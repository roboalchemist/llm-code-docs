## Introduction

Who doesn\'t love a Bee? With these 2 versions of SparkFun\'s XBee3 Thing Plus - the [XBee3 Thing Plus (u.FL)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15435) and the [XBee3 Thing Plus (PCB Antenna)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15454), we\'ve taken DIGI\'s XBEE^3^ 802.15.4 and plopped it into the Thing Plus footprint and the result has us all abuzz. For all intents and purposes, the 2 variants are the same board - the difference being in the antenna.
