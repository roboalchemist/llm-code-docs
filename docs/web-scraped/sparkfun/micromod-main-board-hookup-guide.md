## Hardware Overview

The overall functionality of the Single and Double Main Boards are the same. We\'ll use the Single Main Board more in this section to highlight the features since this is also included in the Double Main Board. We\'ll switch to the Double Main Board when necessary to highlight the features that are only included in the Double Main Board.

The only differences are that the Double Main Board includes:

- two jumper shunts
- ability to add a second MicroMod Function Board to the mix
- board\'s width

### Power

There are two ways to power the Main Boards, Processor Board, and Function Board(s).

- USB
- Single Cell LiPo Battery

It is fine to connect a power source to the USB connector and LiPo battery\'s JST connector at the same time. The MicroMod Main Board has power-control circuitry to automatically select the best power source.

### Power [USB]

One option of powering the board is through the USB Type C connector. You will need a USB Type C cable to power the board with **5V**. Power connected to the board\'s USB C connector will go through a resettable PTC fuse (rated at 2A max) and then the AP7361C 3.3V voltage regulator (rated at 1A max). The little green component close to the USB connector is the resettable PTC fuse while the square IC is the voltage regulator. The voltage regulator accepts voltages between *\~3.3V to 6.0V.*

[![USB Connector, PTC Fuse, and AP7361C Voltage Regulator](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_USB_Voltage_Regulator_PTC_Fuse.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_USB_Voltage_Regulator_PTC_Fuse.jpg)

The USB Type C connector is also used to upload code to your Processor Board, send [serial data to a terminal window](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux), or charge the LiPo battery. Of course for portable power, you could connect a USB battery as an alternative to using a LiPo battery.

Power applied to the connector will light up the VIN and 3V3 LED. If you decide to bypass the PTC fuse, simply add a solder blob to the jumper labeled as PTC. There is also a jumper labeled as MEAS to measure the current consumption at the output of the 3.3V voltage regulator for your project.

### Power [LiPo]

The other option is to connect a single cell LiPo battery (i.e. nominal **3.7V**, **4.2V** fully charged) to the 2-pin JST connector as shown below. A MCP73831 charge IC is included on the boards to safely charge the LiPo batteries via USB Type C connector. A switch is included to set the charge rate. The charge rate is probably set to **\~166mA** with both switches flipped to the ON position. This may vary depending on the position of the switch when it was pulled from the reel. Flip the switch to adjust the charge rate to either *100mA* or *500mA* using a precision flat head screw driver or tweezers.

[![LiPo Charge IC, Charge Rate Switch, and 2-Pin JST Connector](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_JST_Connector_Switch_Charger.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_JST_Connector_Switch_Charger.jpg)

The voltage from the LiPo battery is regulated down to **3.3V** as it goes through the AP7361C 3.3V voltage regulator (rated at 1A max).

**Note:** For more information on proper handling of LiPo batteries, check out the [LilyPad Basics: Powering Your Project - LiPo Battery Safety Care](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lilypad-basics-powering-your-project/power-options-rechargeable-lithium-polymer-batteries#lipo_safety_care).\

### MicroMod Processor Board

The MicroMod ecosystem allows you to easily swap out processors depending on your application. The location of the M.2 connector labeled as Processor is where you would connect and secure a MicroMod Processor Board.

[![Processor Board Socket](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun-MicroMod_Main_Board_Single_Processor_Board_Mdot2_Connector.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun-MicroMod_Main_Board_Single_Processor_Board_Mdot2_Connector.jpg)

### MicroMod Function Board

Beside the MicroMod Processor\'s socket is another M.2 connector for MicroMod Function Boards, which allow you to add additional functionality to your Processor Board. The Single Main Board includes one socket for a single Function Board while the Double Main Board includes two sockets for up two Function Boards.

**Note:** Note that the CS pin on the MicroMod Main Board - Single is on **Processor Board\'s `D1`** while the MicroMod Main Board - Double is on the **Processor Board\'s `G4`**.

### LEDs

There are three LEDs on the board:

- **VIN** - The VIN LED lights up to indicate when power available from the USB connector.
- **3V3** - The 3V3 LED lights up to indicate when there is a 3.3V available after power is regulated down from the USB connector or LiPo battery.
- **CHG** - The on-board yellow CHG LED can be used to get an indication of the **charge status** of your battery. Below is a table of other status indicators depending on the state of the charge IC.\

### Jumpers

**Note:** If this is your first time working with jumpers, check out the [How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-jumper-pads-and-pcb-traces/all) tutorial for more information.

The following five jumpers are included on both the Single and Double Main Boards.

- **MEAS** - By default, the jumper is closed and located on the top side of the board. This jumper is used to measure your system\'s current consumption. You can cut this jumper\'s trace and connect the PTHs to a ammeter/multimeter to probe the output from the 3.3V voltage regulator. Check out our [How to Use a Multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter#measuring-current) tutorial for more information on measuring current.
- **PTC** - By default, the jumper is open and located on the bottom of the board. For advanced users that know what you are doing, add a solder blob to the jumper to bypass the resettable PTC fuse to pull more than 2A from the USB source.
- **3.3V EN** - By default, this jumper is open and located on the bottom of the board. Closing this jumper enables processor control of the 3.3V bus.
- **VIN LED** - By default, this jumper is closed and located on the bottom of the board. Cut this trace to disable the LED that is connected to the input of the USB
- **3.3V LED** - By default, this jumper is closed and located on the bottom of the board. Cut this trace to disable the LED that is connected to the output of the 3.3V voltage regulator.

Included only on the Double Main Board are two 1x3 male headers with 2-pin jumper shunts to enable the 3.3V voltage regulator for any Function Board connected to Function Zero and Function One using alternative Processor GPIO pins. Since certain processors have limited GPIO and may not be broken out on certain locations, alternative pins have been provided on the board. The **ALT PWR EN0** jumper allows users to control the 3.3V voltage regulator on any Function Board that is connected to **Function Zero**. When the jumper shunt is on the left side toward the 2-pin JST connector, the jumper shunt connects the **PWR EN0** to the Processor Board\'s GPIO **G5** pin. Moving the jumper shunt to the other side connects the Processor Board\'s GPIO **G5** pin to Function Board One\'s GPIO **G3** pin.

[![Main Board - Double Jumpers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18576-SparkFun-MicroMod_Main_Board_Double_Jumpers.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18576-SparkFun-MicroMod_Main_Board_Double_Jumpers.jpg)

The **ALT PWR EN1** jumper allows users control power from the 3.3V voltage regulator for any Function Board that is connected to **Function One** when the jumper shunt is connecting **PWR EN1** and Processor Board\'s GPIO **G6** pin. Moving the jumper shunt to the other side connects the Processor Board\'s GPIO **G6** pin to Function Board One\'s GPIO **G4** pin.

### Qwiic and I^2^C

The board includes a vertical and horizontal Qwiic connector. These are connected to the primary I^2^C bus and 3.3V power on both the Processor and Function Board connectors allowing you to easily add a Qwiic-enabled device to your application.

[![Qwiic Connectors](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_Qwiic_Connectors.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/18575-SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_Qwiic_Connectors.jpg)

Note that there are two mounting holes for Qwiic-enabled boards that have a standard 1.0\"x1.0\" size board. The image below highlighted with a black square is where you would place the board.

### Board Dimensions

The board dimension of the MicroMod Main Board - Single is 2.90\" x 3.40\" while the MicroMod Main Board - Double is 2.90\" x 4.90\". Both boards include 5x mounting holes. Four are located on the edge of each board. The fifth mounting hole is located 0.80\" away from another mounting hole to mount Qwiic-enabled boards that have the standard 1.0\"x1.0\" size board.

**Note:** You\'ll notice that the Main Boards have the USB C connector, microSD card socket, and Qwiic connector on one side of the board. This is part of the design for users deciding to place the MicroMod Main Board in an enclosure. The JST connector for the LiPo battery is facing in toward the board is also part of the design. Users can insert a LiPo battery and have its wires neatly tucked into their enclosure.

## Hardware Hookup

If you have not already, make sure to check out the [Getting Started with MicroMod: Hardware Hookup](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-micromod#hardware-hookup) for information on inserting your Processor and Function Boards to the Main Board.

### Getting Started with MicroMod 

October 21, 2020

Dive into the world of MicroMod - a compact interface to connect a microcontroller to various peripherals via the M.2 Connector!

### USB

To program and power the Main Board, you will need to insert the USB-C cable into the USB connector. We will leave the other end disconnected when connecting a Processor or Function board to the Main Board.

When the boards are secure, insert the other end to a computer. When you are finished programming the processor, you can use a USB battery via the USB connector or LiPo battery via the JST connector to power the board.

### Processor Board

Align the Processor Board\'s key into its M.2 connector\'s socket. Insert the board at an angle (\~25°), push down, and tighten the screw. In this case, we had the MicroMod Artemis Processor Board secured in the M.2 connector socket. Depending on your application, you may have a different Processor Board.

### Function Boards

Align the Function Board\'s key into its M.2 connector\'s socket. Insert the board at an angle (\~25°), push down, and tighten one of the screw to hold the board down. Attach the second screw on the other side of the board. Once the board is aligned, tighten both screws fully to secure the board. In this case, we had the Environmental Function Board secured in the M.2 connector socket. Depending on your application, you may have a different Function Board.

[![Main - Single, Processor, and Function Board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_-Single_Processor_and_Function_Board_Environmental.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_-Single_Processor_and_Function_Board_Environmental.jpg)

If you decide to have two function boards attached to the Main Board - Double, we recommend tightening the screw between the two Function Boards first to hold them down before attaching the remaining screws on either side of the Function Boards. In this case, we had the WiFi Function Board and the Environmental Function Board secured in the M.2 connector socket. Depending on your application, you may have different function boards.

**Note:** You may notice a film that is covering over the switch. This is used by the pick and place machine to pick the component up from the reel and place it on the PCB. You will need to peel the film back to access the switches and adjust the charge rate.

A [precision flat head](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12891) (or a tiny, rounded object) is needed to set the charge rate for your single cell LiPo battery. When the switch is flipped to the ON position on the 500mA side, the charge rate will be **500mA**. When the switch is flipped to the ON position on the 100mA side, the charge rate will be **100mA**. When the switch is flipped to the ON position on both the 100mA and 500mA sides, the charge rate will be **166mA**.

[![Setting the LiPo Charge Rate on the DIP Switch](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_Charge_Rate_DIP_Switch.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_Charge_Rate_DIP_Switch.jpg)

For mobile applications, attach a single cell LiPo battery to the 2-pin JST connector. Attach a USB cable to a USB port or charger when the battery is low to begin charging.

[![LiPo Battery Connected](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_Battery.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_LiPo_Battery.jpg)

To remove the LiPo battery, you can pull the white JST connector away from the socket while also wiggling the connector side to side using your thumb and index finger.

### Qwiic-Enabled Devices

To Qwiic-ly connect I^2^C devices, simply insert a Qwiic cable between one of the MicroMod Main Board\'s Qwiic ports and your Qwiic device.

[![Qwiic-Enabled Board Connected](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_Qwiic_Board.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_Qwiic_Board.jpg)

If you need to mount a Qwiic-enabled board to the MicroMod Main Board, you can grab some [standoffs](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/257) and mount a standard Qwiic 1.0\"x1.0\" sized board using the two mounting holes near the USB Type C connector. Place the standoff between the boards and tighten the screws to mount. The image below used standoffs with built-in threads.

### MicroSD Card

With power removed from the board, insert a [microSD card](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/351) (with the pins facing toward the board) into the socket. You\'ll hear a nice click indicating that the microSD card is locked in place.

[![MicroSD Card Inserting into the MicroSD Card Socket](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_MicroSD_Card.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/9/9/4/SparkFun_MicroMod_Main_Board_MicroSD_Card.jpg)

To remove, make sure power is off and press the microSD card into the socket to eject. You\'ll hear a nice click indicating that the card is ready to be removed from the socket.

### Example 3: Reading and Writing to a MicroSD Card

**Note:** For the MicroMod Teensy, make sure to check out the SdFat library included with the Teensyduino add-on. You\'ll need to modify the macro\'s value for the CS pin for the microSD card from:\
\

    #define SD_CS_PIN SS

To one of the following values.\
\

    //TEENSY
    #define SD_CS_PIN 5 // The microSD Card CS pin is D1 for the MicroMod Main Board - Single and Teensy Processor (5). Adjust for your processor if necessary.
    //#define SD_CS_PIN 44 // The microSD Card's CS pin is G4 for the MicroMod Main Board - Double and Teensy Processor (44). Adjust for your processor if necessary.

The example below uses the built-in SD Arduino library. The only difference in the code is the CS pin for the microSD card, which you will need to adjust for your processor board (in this case we use the Artemis Processor Board). Make sure to reference your Processor Board\'s CS pin for either the Main Board - Single (D1) or Main Board - Double (G4).

**Note:** The SPI pins will be defined as macros with your processor\'s board definitions so we won\'t need to define COPI, CIPO, or CLK pins. Sweet!

If you have not already, select your Board (in this case the **MicroMod Artemis**), and associated COM port. Copy and paste the code below in your Arduino IDE. Hit the upload button and set the serial monitor to **9600** baud.

    language:c
    /*
      SD Card Read/Write

      This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file
      The circuit:

      SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:

       SD Card  - MicroMod Artemis Processor Board
       -----------------------------------
       COPI/SDO - pin 38
       CIPO/SDI - pin 43
       CLK      - pin 42
       CS       - pin 1 (Main Board - Single) or 28 (Main Board - Double)

      created   Nov 2010
      by David A. Mellis
      modified 9 Apr 2012
      by Tom Igoe

      This example code is in the public domain.

    */

    #include <SPI.h>
    #include <SD.h>

    //ARTEMIS
    //const int SD_CS_PIN = 1; // The microSD Card CS pin is D1 for the MicroMod Main Board - Single and Artemis Processor (D1). Adjust for your processor if necessary.
    const int SD_CS_PIN = 28; // The microSD Card's CS pin is G4 for the MicroMod Main Board - Double and Artemis Processor (D28). Adjust for your processor if necessary.

    File myFile;

    void setup() 

      Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");

      if (!SD.begin(SD_CS_PIN)) 
      Serial.println("initialization done.");

      // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
      // so you have to close this one before opening another.
      myFile = SD.open("test.txt", FILE_WRITE);

      // if the file opened okay, write to it:
      if (myFile)  else 

      // re-open the file for reading:
      myFile = SD.open("test.txt");
      if (myFile) 
        // close the file:
        myFile.close();
      } else 
    }

    void loop() 

If all goes well, you should see the following output if this is the first time writing to the card!

    language:bash
    Initializing SD card...initialization done.
    Writing to test.txt...done.
    test.txt:
    testing 1, 2, 3.

If you are looking to go the extra mile to see if data was saved, close the Serial Monitor and remove power from the MicroMod Main Board. Eject your microSD card from the socket and insert into a microSD card adapter. Then insert the microSD card into your computer\'s card reader or USB port. Open the **test.txt** file in a text editor. You should see an output similar to what you saw in the Serial Monitor after the file was opened as shown below.

    language:bash
    testing 1, 2, 3.

Besides verifying the data in the file, this step is also useful if you adjust the code to continuously log data in a CSV format. After logging data, you could the open text document in a spreadsheet and graph the values!

### More Examples!

Sweet! Now that we know that we can read and write to the microSD card, try exploring the other examples in either the SD or SdFat Arduino libraries. Or check out the following MicroMod tutorials that have a built-in microSD card socket for ideas on data logging. Better yet, try adding a sensor and write some code to log some data!
