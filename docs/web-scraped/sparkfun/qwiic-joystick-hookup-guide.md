[![Qwiic Connect System](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/custom_pages/2/7/2/qwiic-logo.png "Qwiic Connect System")](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic)

The Qwiic Joystick utilizes the [Qwiic connect system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic). We recommend familiarizing yourself with the **Logic Levels** and **I^2^C** tutorials (above) before using it. Click on the banner above to learn more about our [Qwiic products](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/399).

## Hardware Overview

The Qwiic Joystick will report the *thumbstick* position over I^2^C and is designed to be compatible with the Qwiic system so you can add it to your project [solder-free]!

### Power LED

There is a power status LED to help make sure that your Qwiic Joystick is getting power. You can power the board either through the *polarized* **Qwiic connector** system or the **breakout pins** (**PWR** and **GND**) provided. The Qwiic system is meant to run on **3.3V**, be sure that you are **NOT** using another voltage when using the Qwiic system.

[![Power LED on board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Power_LED.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Power_LED.jpg)

### Joystick

The joystick is similar to the *analog* joysticks on PS2 (PlayStation 2) controllers. Directional movements are simply measured with two **10 kΩ** potentiometers, one for each axis. This joystick also has a select button that is actuated when the joystick is pressed down.

[![Thumb Joystick](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/parts/2/4/2/7/09032-03-L.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/thumb-joystick.html)

[ [\$5.25] ]

The two potentiometers are connected to the analog to digital converter (ADC) of the ATtiny85. The select button operates as a digital input on the ATtiny85. This allows the firmware to read the knob position and any button presses.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Due to resistor manufacturing tolerances, the joystick may not read exactly half of VCC when at rest. You may want to make a note of the \"zero\" reading, and store that value into your program if necessary.

#### Joystick Orientation

The joystick contains two potentiometers, connected with a gimbal mechanism that separates the *horizontal* and *vertical* movements (orientation shown below).

[![Notated image with joystick axis orientation](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Joystick_Orientation.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Joystick_Orientation.jpg)

The potentiometers are the two blue or black boxes on the sides of the joystick. If you move the joystick while watching the center shaft of each potentiometer, you\'ll see that each of the potentiometers will pick up movement on only one axis. Clever, isn\'t it?

[![Potentiometers highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Potentiometer.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Potentiometer.jpg)

#### Select Button

The joystick also contains a momentary button which activates when you push down on the cap. The button is the small black box on the side of the joystick. If you push down on the cap, you can see a lever pushing down on the head of the button. The lever works no matter what position the joystick is in. That is pretty cool!

[![button highlighted](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Momentary_Button.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Momentary_Button.jpg)

### ATtiny85

With the pre-installed firmware, the ATtiny85 is acts as an intermediary (microcontroller) for the analog and digital inputs from the joystick. This allows the Qwiic Joystick to report its position over I^2^C.

[![ATtiny85 on board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/ATtiny85.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/ATtiny85.jpg)

**Note:** To flash your own firmware, at minimum, you will need an [programmer for the ATtiny](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825) and a [pogo pin adapter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11591). Writing and uploading firmware is not easily done, unless you know what you are doing; this is **inadvisable** for beginners.

### Qwiic & I^2^C

#### I^2^C Address

In the firmware, the Qwiic Joystick's I^2^C address is configurable so you can add a bunch of them to the same bus without collision issues.

**Factory Default I^2^C Slave Address:** 0x20

#### I^2^C Registers

Address

Description

0x00

Default I^2^C Slave Address from EEPROM

0x01 - 0x02

Firmware Version (MSB First)

0x03 - 0x04

Current Horizontal Position (MSB First)

0x05 - 0x06

Current Vertical Position (MSB First)

0x07

Current Button Position

0x08

Button Status: Indicates if button was pressed since last read of button state. Clears after read.

0x09

Configuration or \"*Locking*\" Register - Prevents random I^2^C address changes during I^2^C scans and register dumps. Must be set to 0x13 before an address change gets saved to the EEPROM.

0x0A

Current/Set I^2^C Slave Address (Write). *Stored in EEPROM.*

\

**Note:** In the registers for the joystick position, the MSB contains the first 8 bits of the 10-bit ADC value and the LSB contains the last two bits. As an example, this is how the library converts the two registers back to a 10-bit value.\
\
` uint_16t full10bitvalue = ((MSB << 8) | LSB) >> 6;`\
\
You could potentially only look at the MSB and get an 8-bit reading (for 256 positions). The firmware was intentionally written this way in the hopes that it would be useful for customers who didn\'t need the full resolution of the joystick position.

**Troubleshooting Tip:**\
Please be aware, the first time the joystick position registers are read, it will have a maximum value (all 1\'s in binary). I am not sure if it is something in the firmware or if has something to do with the ATtiny85, but the initial read will be 1023. Once that is read, everything reading after should be accurate (excluding the manufacturing tolerances mentioned above). If you have a fix for this issue, please feel free to [comment on this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide/discuss) or create a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick).

#### Connections

The board provides four labeled breakout pins. You can connect these lines to the I^2^C bus of your microcontroller and power pins (**3.3V** and **GND**), if it doesn\'t have a Qwiic connector.

[![breakout pins on board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Breakout_Pins.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Breakout_Pins.jpg)

However, the simplest way to use the Qwiic Joystick is through the Qwiic connect system. The connectors are polarized for the I^2^C connection and power. (*\*They are tied to the breakout pins.*)

[![Qwiic connectors on board](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Qwiic_Connectors.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Qwiic_Connectors.jpg)

#### I^2^C Pull-up Jumpers

Cutting the **I^2^C** jumper will remove the **2.2kΩ** resistors from the I^2^C bus. If you have many devices on your I^2^C bus you may want to remove these jumpers. Not sure how to cut a jumper?

## Hardware Assembly

### Arduino Examples

With the Qwiic connector system, assembling the hardware is simple. All you need to do is connect your [Qwiic Joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) to the [RedBoard Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15123) with a [Qwiic cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15081). Otherwise, you can use the I^2^C pins of your microcontroller; just be aware of logic levels, that the operating voltage of the ATtiny85 ranges from 1.8 to 5.5V, and the EEPROM needs at least 2V or it will get corrupted .

[![Hardware assembly with RedBoard Qwiic](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Assembly-Arduino.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/7/Assembly-Arduino.jpg)

**Note:** This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Arduino products and you are using the latest stable version of the Arduino IDE on your desktop. If this is your first time using the Arduino IDE, please review our tutorial on [installing the Arduino IDE.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-arduino-ide)

**Troubleshooting Tip:**\
It is best to power the board at the recommended 3.3V of the Qwiic system. However, if you have a board with firmware version 2.3 and happen to accidentally corrupt the EEPROM and inject a new, random I^2^C address. There is a way to replace the I^2^C address and store it in the EEPROM again. Follow the following steps exactly, you will need to use the Arduino Library from below:\
\

1.  Connect the Qwiic Joystick to a RedBoard Qwiic with a Qwiic cable.
2.  Run Example 3 to find the current I^2^C address.
3.  Modify Example 2 to use the I^2^C address you just found.
4.  Run Example 2 and change the I^2^C address back to the default address.
5.  Unplug and the Qwiic Joystick and plug it back in. The EEPROM should be reset to the default I^2^C address and be ready to use again.

### Raspberry Pi Example

With the Qwiic connector system, assembling the hardware is simple. You will need a [Qwiic cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15081), a [SparkFun Qwiic HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14459), and a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14643) setup with the [Raspbian OS](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13945), monitor, and [standard peripherals](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/398).

### Library Functions

The Arduino library is commented and the functions should be self-explanatory. However, below is a detailed list of the available library functions.

`.begin()` or `.begin(Wire, deviceAddress)`\
Creates a connection to an I^2^C device over the I^2^C bus using the default or specified I^2^C address.

Input: uint8_t *deviceAddress*

Unasssigned 8-bit integer for device address. If not defined, the library will use the default I^2^C address stored in the I^2^C library (0x20).

Output: Boolean

True- Connected to I^2^C device.\
False- No device found or connected.

`.isConnected()`\
Tries to connect to the device at the I^2^C address stored in the library.

Output: Boolean

True- Connected to I^2^C device.\
False- No device found or connected.

`.setI2CAddress(newAddress)`\
Changes the I^2^C address to *newAddress*. Once changed, the new I^2^C address is saved in the EEPROM of the Qwiic Joystick. Reconnects to device using new I^2^C address. (*The new address is printed out in the Serial Monitor.*)

Input: uint8_t *newAddress*

Unasssigned 8-bit integer for device address.

`.getHorizontal()`\

Output: uint16_t

Unasssigned 10-bit integer \[0 - 1023\] for ADC value of the joystick position in the vertical axis.

`.getButton()`\
Returns the current button state (clears check button indicator - see below).

Output: byte

0 - Button is currently being pressed.\
1 - Button is currently unpressed.

`.checkButton()`\
Indicates if the button was pressed between reads of the button state or calls of this function. The register for this indicator is then cleared.

Output: byte

0 - Button is was [NOT] pressed.\
1 - Button is was pressed.

`.getVersion()`\
Returns a string of the firmware version number.

Output: String *AAA.BBB*

AAA - Firmware Version (Major)\
BBB - Firmware Version (Minor)

### Examples

There are four examples in the [Qwiic Joystick Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Joystick_Arduino_Library) to get you started with using Qwiic Joystick. These example files are named with self-explanatory titles, but in case you want more information, see the descriptions below.

- **Example1_Basic_Readings**

  This example connects to the Qwiic Joystick using the default I^2^C address saved in the library. The sketch looks at the registers for the current joystick position and button state. The example then prints out those values over the Serial Monitor.

- **Example2_I2C_Address_and_Firmware**

  This example connects to the Qwiic Joystick using the default I^2^C address set in the sketch and then prints out the I^2^C address and firmware version over the Serial Monitor. The sketch then, takes an input from the Serial Monitor to change the I^2^C address using a decimal value (DEC). Once the I^2^C address is changed, it is stored in the EEPROM of the Qwiic Joystick. After, the sketch connects to the joystick using the new I^2^C address and reads the registers for the firmware version again. The example then prints out those values over the Serial Monitor again.

- **Example3_I2C_Scanner**

  This example is from the [I^2^C scanner example](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner) from the Arduino Playground webpage. The sketch scans for devices on the I^2^C bus and reports them on the Serial Monitor. This is useful for users who have forgotten the changed I^2^C address of their boards.

- **Example4_Joystic_Serial_Output**

  This example shows a basic example of how to begin to use the Qwiic Joystick as an HID. The example sketch takes values of the joystick and converts it to directional printouts on the Serial Monitor.

On the (full) Raspbian OS, `i2ctools` should be pre-installed (if it is not, follow the [instructions here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-hat-for-raspberry-pi-hookup-guide)). With the Qwiic Joystick and Qwiick Hat attached to the Raspberry Pi, run the following command in the terminal/commandline.

`i2cdetect -y 1`

### Download and Run Python Examples

Download the [Python Examples](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick/tree/master/Firmware/Python%20Examples) from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick). All you need to do is open an example python file and execute the module. You can do this in Python 3 or another compatible, programming text editor like Geany.

#### Basic Readings

Below is a screenshot of the python shell from the **Basic Readings** example file.

#### Snake Game

When you run the **Snake Game** example code, you only need to click the button to start the game. (*\*Shout out to Al Sweigart for his [**Wormy** example](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter6.html), which was adapted to work with the Qwiic Joystick.*)

**Troubleshooting Tip:** I did run into an error with the python example codes. Unfortunately, I am not an *expert* in Python and the Raspberry Pi. However, I got around this by having the error print out instead of terminating the script. From what I could deduce based on the available information on the internet, the error `[Errno 121] Remote I/O error` is an issue with the I^2^C bus and how SMBUS interacts with the slave device.\
\
You will also get an `[Errno 121] Remote I/O error` if your I^2^C address is defined wrong.
