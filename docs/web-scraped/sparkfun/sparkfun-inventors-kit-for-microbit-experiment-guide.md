- **Piezo Buzzer** \-\-- BUZZZZ! Used to make different frequencies of sound.
- **USB micro-B Cable** \-\-- This 6-foot cable provides you with a USB-A connector at the host end and standard B connector at the device end.
- **Male-to-Male Jumper Wires** \-\-- These are high-quality wires that allow you to make connections with components on the breadboard.
- **TMP36 Temperature Sensor** - A sensor for detecting temperature changes.
- **Photocell** \-\-- A sensor to detect ambient light. Perfect for detecting when a drawer is opened or when nighttime approaches.
- **Tri-Color LED** \-\-- Because everyone loves a blinky.
- **Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green LEDs** \-\-- Light-Emitting Diodes make great general indicators.
- **Momentary Pushbutton Switch** \-\-- Go crazy with buttons.
- **10kΩ Trimpot** \-\-- Also known as a variable resistor, this is a device commonly used to control volume and contrast, and makes a great general user control input.
- **100Ω Resistors** \-\-- Great current-limiting resistors for LEDs, and strong pull-up resistors.
- **10kΩ Resistors** \-\-- These make excellent pull-ups, pull-downs and current limiters.
- **2x AAA Battery Pack** \-\-- AAA battery pack with the JST connector that fits the micro:bit
- **Alligator Clip with Pigtail** \-\-- A great way to connect individual components on a breadboard to the micro:bit ring connectors.
