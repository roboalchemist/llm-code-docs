## Arts and Crafts

I\'ve got a cookie exchange to go to this holiday season, and I spent a little bit of time mulling over a way to add electronics to my box without breaking the bank. I settled on a quick and dirty [throwie](http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Throwies/) hack, and I thought I\'d share. I used this trick for cookie boxes, but it would also make beautiful wedding favor boxes, gift boxes, or even a safe substitute for tealight walkway lights!

I bought plain favor boxes, but I\'ve seen laser cut ones that would look beautiful illuminated from within!

You\'ll need boxes or bags, as well as tape and a hobby knife. The wishlist below is for the parts I used to make 10 boxes. You can modify the numbers to suit your purpose, you need one of each part per box. You can also use any LED color you like!

## Make your Boxes

I started with plain white favor boxes and painted a design on each one while they were still disassembled. Do whatever works stylistically for you \-- you can skip this step if you want to cut in the design, or are using precut boxes.

Next, use your craft knife cut a hole (or holes) where you want the light to shine through the brightest. Unless you get a black or very thick box, the whole thing will glow softly in the dark, but you\'ll get a nice bright light wherever you put the hole(s). Make sure you put a piece of cardboard in the box before you cut, unless you want to cut straight through both sides.
