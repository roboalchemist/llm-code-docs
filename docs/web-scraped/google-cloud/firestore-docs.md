# Firestore in Native mode documentation

[Read product documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/overview)

Firestore in Native mode is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. While the Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.  **Key Point:** Firestore now has MongoDB API compatibility. See [Firestore with MongoDB compatibility](/firestore/mongodb-compatibility/docs?).
