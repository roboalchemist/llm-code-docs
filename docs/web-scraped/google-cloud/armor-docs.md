Google Cloud Armor helps protect your infrastructure and applications from Layer 3/Layer 4 network or protocol-based volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, volumetric Layer 7 attacks, and other targeted application attacks. It leverages Google's global network and distributed infrastructure to detect and absorb attacks and filter traffic through user-configurable security policies at the edge of Google's network, far upstream of your workloads.
