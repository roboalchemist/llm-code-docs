# Cloud Logging documentation

[Read product documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/logging/docs/overview)

**Cloud Logging** is a fully managed service that allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Using [ Bindplane](https://bindplane.com/google), you can also collect this data from over 80 additional applications, on-premises systems, and hybrid cloud systems.

Logging includes storage for logs through [log buckets](/logging/docs/buckets), a user interface called the [Logs Explorer](/logging/docs/view/logs-viewer-interface), and [an API](/logging/docs/reference/api-overview) to manage logs programmatically. Logging lets you read and write log entries, query your logs, and control how you route and use your logs.
