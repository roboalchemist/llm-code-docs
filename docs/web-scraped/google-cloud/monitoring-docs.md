# Cloud Monitoring documentation

[Read product documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs/monitoring-overview)

**Cloud Monitoring** collects metric data and provides tools that let you monitor and visualize how your applications and services are performing.

To collect metrics data from your Compute Engine instances, [create an Agent Policy](/stackdriver/docs/solutions/managing-agent-policies) that automatically installs and maintains the Google Cloud Observability agents across your fleet of VMs.

To collect metrics from on-premises and hybrid-cloud systems and applications, we recommend using [ Bindplane](https://bindplane.com/google).
