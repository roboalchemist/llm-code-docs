#  What file types are supported? 

AccessLint will review all files in your pull requests, and identify issues in files that have HTML-style syntax, as well as Markdown. 

Note that server-side code (e.g. image_tag and label_tag in Rails) is not evaluated. Only fully formed HTML tags will be tested.
