Welcome
-------

Welcome to the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) documentation. Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes, and you can read detailed background information in the [CNCF Helm Project Journey report](https://www.cncf.io/cncf-helm-project-journey/).

How the documentation is organized
----------------------------------

Helm has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

*   [Tutorials](https://helm.sh/docs/v3/chart_template_guide/getting_started) take you by the hand through a series of steps to create your first Helm chart. Start here if you’re new to Helm.
*   [Topic guides](https://helm.sh/docs/v3/topics/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
*   [Community Guides](https://helm.sh/community) discuss topics centered around Helm’s community. Start here if you want to learn more about the development process of Helm itself and how you can contribute.
*   [How-to guides](https://helm.sh/docs/v3/howto/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Helm works.
