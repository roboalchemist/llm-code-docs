# Streaming data through file-like support[¶](#streaming-data-through-file-like-support "Permalink to this heading")

In this example, we will show how to decode streaming data. That is, when files do not reside locally, we will show how to only download the data segments that are needed to decode the frames you care about. We accomplish this capability with Python [file-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object). Our example uses a video file, so we use the [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") class to decode it. But all of the lessons here also apply to audio files and the [[`AudioDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder") class as well.

First, a bit of boilerplate. We define two functions: one to download content from a given URL, and another to time the execution of a given function.

    import torch
    import requests
    from time import perf_counter_ns

    def get_url_content(url):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to download video. .")
        return response.content

    def bench(f, average_over=10, warmup=2):
        for _ in range(warmup):
            f()

        times = []
        for _ in range(average_over):
            start = perf_counter_ns()
            f()
            end = perf_counter_ns()
            times.append(end - start)

        times = torch.tensor(times) * 1e-6  # ns to ms
        std = times.std().item()
        med = times.median().item()
        print(f"ms +- ")

## Performance: downloading first vs. streaming[¶](#performance-downloading-first-vs-streaming "Permalink to this heading")

We are going to investigate the cost of having to download an entire video before decoding any frames versus being able to stream the video's data while decoding. To demonsrate an extreme case, we're going to always decode just the first frame of the video, while we vary how we get that video's data.

The video we're going to use in this tutorial is publicly available on the internet. We perform an initial download of it so that we can understand its size and content:

    from torchcodec.decoders import VideoDecoder

    nasa_url = "https://download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/stream-api/NASAs_Most_Scientifically_Complex_Space_Observatory_Requires_Precision-MP4.mp4"

    pre_downloaded_raw_video_bytes = get_url_content(nasa_url)
    decoder = VideoDecoder(pre_downloaded_raw_video_bytes)

    print(f"Video size in MB: ")
    print(decoder.metadata)

    Video size in MB: 253
    VideoStreamMetadata:
      duration_seconds_from_header: 206.039167
      begin_stream_seconds_from_header: 0.0
      bit_rate: 9958354.0
      codec: h264
      stream_index: 0
      duration_seconds: 206.039167
      begin_stream_seconds: 0.0
      begin_stream_seconds_from_content: 0.0
      end_stream_seconds_from_content: 206.039167
      width: 1920
      height: 1080
      num_frames_from_header: 6175
      num_frames_from_content: 6175
      average_fps_from_header: 29.97003
      pixel_aspect_ratio: 1
      end_stream_seconds: 206.039167
      num_frames: 6175
      average_fps: 29.97003

We can see that the video is about 253 MB, has the resolution 1920x1080, is about 30 frames per second and is almost 3 and a half minutes long. As we only want to decode the first frame, we would clearly benefit from not having to download the entire video!

Let's first test three scenarios:

> <div>
>
> 1.  Decode from the *existing* video we just downloaded. This is our baseline performance, as we've reduced the downloading cost to 0.
>
> 2.  Download the entire video before decoding. This is the worst case that we want to avoid.
>
> 3.  Provde the URL directly to the [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") class, which will pass the URL on to FFmpeg. Then FFmpeg will decide how much of the video to download before decoding.
>
> </div>

Note that in our scenarios, we are always setting the [`seek_mode`] parameter of the [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") class to [`"approximate"`]. We do this to avoid scanning the entire video during initialization, which would require downloading the entire video even if we only want to decode the first frame. See [[Exact vs Approximate seek mode: Performance and accuracy comparison]](approximate_mode.html#sphx-glr-generated-examples-decoding-approximate-mode-py) for more.

    def decode_from_existing_download():
        decoder = VideoDecoder(
            source=pre_downloaded_raw_video_bytes,
            seek_mode="approximate",
        )
        return decoder[0]

    def download_before_decode():
        raw_video_bytes = get_url_content(nasa_url)
        decoder = VideoDecoder(
            source=raw_video_bytes,
            seek_mode="approximate",
        )
        return decoder[0]

    def direct_url_to_ffmpeg():
        decoder = VideoDecoder(
            source=nasa_url,
            seek_mode="approximate",
        )
        return decoder[0]

    print("Decode from existing download:")
    bench(decode_from_existing_download)
    print()

    print("Download before decode:")
    bench(download_before_decode)
    print()

    print("Direct url to FFmpeg:")
    bench(direct_url_to_ffmpeg)

    Decode from existing download:
    med = 239.32ms +- 1.07

    Download before decode:
    med = 1478.32ms +- 114.79

    Direct url to FFmpeg:
    med = 302.21ms +- 9.00

Decoding the already downloaded video is clearly the fastest. Having to download the entire video each time we want to decode just the first frame is many times slower than decoding an existing video. Providing a direct URL is much better, but we're still probably downloading more than we need to.

We can do better, and the way how is to use a file-like object which implements its own read and seek methods that only download data from a URL as needed. Rather than implementing our own, we can use such objects from the [fsspec](https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec) module that provides [Filesystem interfaces for Python](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest). Note that using these capabilities from the fsspec library also requires the [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) module. You can install both with pip install fsspec aiohttp.

    import fsspec

    def stream_while_decode():
        # The `client_kwargs` are passed down to the aiohttp module's client
        # session; we need to indicate that we need to trust the environment
        # settings for proxy configuration. Depending on your environment, you may
        # not need this setting.
        with fsspec.open(nasa_url, client_kwargs=) as file_like:
            decoder = VideoDecoder(file_like, seek_mode="approximate")
            return decoder[0]

    print("Stream while decode: ")
    bench(stream_while_decode)

    Stream while decode:
    med = 259.41ms +- 0.70

Streaming the data through a file-like object is much faster than downloading the video first. And not only is it also faster than providing a direct URL, it's more general. [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") supports direct URLs because the underlying FFmpeg functions support them. But the kinds of protocols supported are determined by what that version of FFmpeg supports. A file-like object can adapt any kind of resource, including ones that are specific to your own infrastructure and are unknown to FFmpeg.

## How it works[¶](#how-it-works "Permalink to this heading")

In Python, a [file-like object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-like-object) is any object that exposes special methods for reading, writing and seeking. While such methods are obviously file oriented, it's not required that a file-like object is backed by an actual file. As far as Python is concerned, if an object acts like a file, it's a file. This is a powerful concept, as it enables libraries that read or write data to assume a file-like interface. Other libraries that present novel resources can then be easily used by providing a file-like wrapper for their resource.

For our case, we only need the read and seek methods for decoding. The exact method signature needed is in the example below. Rather than wrap a novel resource, we demonstrate this capability by wrapping an actual file while counting how often each method is called.

    from pathlib import Path
    import tempfile

    # Create a local file to interact with.
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    nasa_video_path = Path(temp_dir) / "nasa_video.mp4"
    with open(nasa_video_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(pre_downloaded_raw_video_bytes)

    # A file-like class that is backed by an actual file, but it intercepts reads
    # and seeks to maintain counts.
    class FileOpCounter:
        def __init__(self, file):
            self._file = file
            self.num_reads = 0
            self.num_seeks = 0

        def read(self, size: int) -> bytes:
            self.num_reads += 1
            return self._file.read(size)

        def seek(self, offset: int, whence: int) -> int:
            self.num_seeks += 1
            return self._file.seek(offset, whence)

    # Let's now get a file-like object from our class defined above, providing it a
    # reference to the file we created. We pass our file-like object to the decoder
    # rather than the file itself.
    file_op_counter = FileOpCounter(open(nasa_video_path, "rb"))
    counter_decoder = VideoDecoder(file_op_counter, seek_mode="approximate")

    print("Decoder initialization required "
          f" reads and "
          f" seeks.")

    init_reads = file_op_counter.num_reads
    init_seeks = file_op_counter.num_seeks

    first_frame = counter_decoder[0]

    print("Decoding the first frame required "
          f" additional reads and "
          f" additional seeks.")

    Decoder initialization required 9 reads and 11 seeks.
    Decoding the first frame required 2 additional reads and 1 additional seeks.

While we defined a simple class primarily for demonstration, it's actually useful for diagnosing how much reading and seeking are required for different decoding operations. We've also introduced a mystery that we should answer: why does *initializing* the decoder take more reads and seeks than decoding the first frame? The answer is that in our decoder implementation, we're actually calling a special [FFmpeg function](https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/6.1/group__lavf__decoding.html#gad42172e27cddafb81096939783b157bb) that decodes the first few frames to return more robust metadata.

It's also worth noting that the Python file-like interface is only half of the story. FFmpeg also has its own mechanism for directing reads and seeks during decoding to user-define functions. The [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") object does the work of connecting the Python methods you define to FFmpeg. All you have to do is define your methods in Python, and we do the rest.

## Performance: local file path vs. local file-like object[¶](#performance-local-file-path-vs-local-file-like-object "Permalink to this heading")

Since we have a local file defined, let's do a bonus performance test. We now have two means of providing a local file to [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder"):

> <div>
>
> 1.  Through a *path*, where the [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder") object will then do the work of opening the local file at that path.
>
> 2.  Through a *file-like object*, where you open the file yourself and provide the file-like object to [[`VideoDecoder`]](../../generated/torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder.html#torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder "torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder").
>
> </div>

An obvious question is: which is faster? The code below tests that question.

    def decode_from_existing_file_path():
        decoder = VideoDecoder(nasa_video_path, seek_mode="approximate")
        return decoder[0]

    def decode_from_existing_open_file_object():
        with open(nasa_video_path, "rb") as file:
            decoder = VideoDecoder(file, seek_mode="approximate")
            return decoder[0]

    print("Decode from existing file path:")
    bench(decode_from_existing_file_path)
    print()

    print("Decode from existing open file object:")
    bench(decode_from_existing_open_file_object)

    Decode from existing file path:
    med = 241.28ms +- 1.32

    Decode from existing open file object:
    med = 239.58ms +- 1.24

Thankfully, the answer is both means of decoding from a local file take about the same amount of time. This result means that in your own code, you can use whichever method is more convienient. What this result implies is that the cost of actually reading and copying data dominates the cost of calling Python methods while decoding.

Finally, let's clean up the local resources we created.

    import shutil
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
