Thank you so much for this incredible piece of software! Knip is one of the most impressive tools I've seen in my career.

2:00 PM · Jun 5, 2025

Got my first plugin merged into Knip by @webpro.nl today! ☺️The contribution experience was fantastic: the docs were super clear, the code was straightforward to navigate, and the helper script to generate a new plugin got me 90% of the way there. Awesome. Thanks Lars!https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/pull/1022

All of the TanStack monorepos make use of knip.devIt's like eslint for detecting unused dependencies or even your own files/modules.

6:05 PM · Mar 25, 2025

The joy of adding knip.dev (by @webpro.nl) on a codebase! Right in time for spring cleaning 🧹🍃

8:32 PM · Mar 24, 2025

Knip helped us delete ~300k lines of unused code at Vercel.

6:40 AM · Jan 2, 2025

Knip may be the greatest tool ever conceived.https://www.npmjs.com/package/knip

7:57 PM · Oct 28, 2024

`knip` is the best code maintenance tool I've used in my 20 years of development, just an absolute work of art

5:33 PM · Jul 29, 2023

knip is great.A great example of stuff just working. It detects your environment so well and its defaults are almost too good because I didn’t realise it was doing everything automatically.

3:19 AM · Jul 4, 2024

Then was like “this is how tooling should be, this has taken me an hour not a day and it’s faster and more accurate and more future proof”Five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

12:20 PM · Jul 4, 2024

Crazy useful tool. Thought it would be a nightmare to setup in my Next.js+Workers repo but it has crazy good automatic detection for code dependencies. In short, Knip creates a graph of code use and highlights dead code for you to snip (knip).

12:35 PM · Jun 18, 2024

Lars is singlehandedly building the best tool to keep your code clean and your dependencies minimal. And he's so engaging and helpful. Can't imagine going back to not using knip 👏

9:55 AM · May 24, 2024

warning: do not use a tool like knip.dev + code search to delete a ton of unused code. It works too well.I just did this in https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/pull/2705, and my boss said if I end the week with net negative lines of code committed, I'm in deep trouble.

1:55 AM · Jan 13, 2024

Ran knip.dev in @argos_ci, and boom 💥! Dead code detected instantly. With a good config, it can run on CI to keep projects clean. Installing this tool should be a no-brainer, like Prettier or ESLint.Kudos, @webprolific! 👏

11:00 AM · Nov 30, 2023

Problem:🚫 Your project has unused files.🚫 It has unused npm dependencies.🚫 It has unused TypeScript exports.But you haven't noticed, because these things are hard to spot.Solution: knipI just used knip to find and resolve dozens of issues.https://t.co/QmN3sNlmbm

2:44 PM · Aug 15, 2023

Knip helped me get rid of over 41k lines of code in legacy codebase 🥺🥺💕

4:51 PM · Nov 27, 2023

Big fans of Knip at @Contra. Such an extremely well developed and maintained project

3:18 PM · Nov 27, 2023

Just tried this onhttps://github.com/getsentry/sentry/- got some super useful results! Nice work.

7:03 PM · Nov 21, 2023

I've manage to delete 6k LOC in the last 30 minutes 🫣Great job here @webprolific 👍🏽

3:38 AM · Nov 21, 2023

knip is an amazing tool. Shoutout to @webprolific for building it 🙌.Not cleaning up correctly has a real maintenance cost. I've deleted lots of dead code - functions that were only used in tests and components that were only used in stories - all thanks to knip 🚀.

🛠️ Knip👉🏻 Knip finds unused dependencies, exports and files in your JavaScript and TypeScript projects.👉🏻 Less code and dependencies lead to improved performance, less maintenance and easier refactorings.https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip

Knip is wonderful at finding out unused code/dependencies in a legacy JavaScript/TypeScript applicationRecommend 💯Here's how Josh used it to remove code bloat in Centered:

11:13 AM · Aug 22, 2023

Unused files, exports, and dependencies often clutter projects, as it’s difficult knowing when one thing relies on another and scary to remove something you’re not sure is in use. 👀↬ Meet Knip, which scours projects for these unused artifacts:https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/knip-automated-tool-find-unused-files-exports-dependencies/

4:10 PM · Aug 14, 2023

Recommendation update: use knip to find dead code, types and dependencies in your @typescript ✂️https://effectivetypescript.com/2023/07/29/knip/

Found a bunch of unused code, -dependencies, and unnecessary exports. Had just one false positive but overall pretty good. 10/10 would recommend.If you’ve got a JavaScript package/project use Knip and remove unnecessary code. ✂️
