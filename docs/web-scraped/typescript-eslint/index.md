It runs a set of rules to find likely problems and suggested fixes to improve your code.
**TypeScript** is a language and a type checker. The language adds syntax for types to JavaScript.
The type checker analyzes code to find mismatches between uses of values and types.
**typescript-eslint** is necessary for JavaScript tools such as ESLint to work with TypeScript&#x27;s new syntax.
It also adds lint rules for TypeScript, including many that use the power of types to better analyze code.
