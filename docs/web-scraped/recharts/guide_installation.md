### Installation 

#### NPM 

NPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Recharts. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

#### UMD 

The UMD build is also available on unpkg.com  ( [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) )   :

You can find the library on `window.Recharts`

#### Dev Build
