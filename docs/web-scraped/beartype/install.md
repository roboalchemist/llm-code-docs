# Install[¶](#install)

Install beartype with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io), because [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/beartype) is the cheese
shop and you too enjoy a [fine Venezuelan beaver cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch) while mashing disconsolately on your keyboard late on
a rain-soaked Friday evening. Wherever expensive milk byproducts ferment,
beartype will be there.
pip3 install beartype

Install beartype with [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), because package managers named after vicious
South American murder reptiles have finally inspired your team to embrace more
mammal-friendly packages. Your horoscope also reads: “Avoid reckless ecotourism
in places that rain alot.”
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install beartype

## [Platform](#id8)[¶](#platform)

Beartype is also installable with platform-specific package managers, because
sometimes you just need this thing to work.

### [macOS](#id9)[¶](#macos)

Let’s install beartype with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) courtesy our third-party
tap:
brew install beartype/beartype/beartype

Let’s install beartype with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) on [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS):

sudo port install py-beartype

A big bear hug to [our official macOS package maintainer &#64;harens](https://github.com/harens)
for [packaging beartype for our Apple-appreciating audience](https://ports.macports.org/port/py-beartype).

### [Arch Linux](#id10)[¶](#arch-linux)

Let’s install beartype with `pacman` on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) – where beartype is now
[officially packaged](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-beartype) in the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-beartype) itself:
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/python-beartype.git
cd python-beartype
makepkg -si

Truly, Arch Linux has now seen the face of quality assurance. It looks like a
grizzled bear with patchy fur, one twitchy eye, and a gimpy leg that
spasmodically flails around.

### [Gentoo Linux](#id11)[¶](#gentoo-linux)

Let’s install beartype with `emerge` on [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org) – where beartype is
now [officially packaged](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-python/beartype) in the Portage tree itself:
emerge beartype

Source-based Linux distributions are the CPU-bound nuclear option. What could
be simpler? O_o
