## Installation

 

 

[Mirror driver only get downloaded, NOT installed.  This need to be done manual.]

[For first time install you best don\'t register it as service, this can always be done later from the\
winvnc systray.  First test if it works, and then register as service when needed.]

 

## Automate Installation

[If you need to install UltraVNC on a large number of computers, you might consider automating the installation.\
The following command line parameters can be passed to the setup:\
][`/dir="`*`Dirname`*`"`\
][Sets installation directory to *`Dirname`*.\
][`/no restart`\
][Suppresses a reboot at the end of the installation.\
Not required since the installation no longer requires are boot.\
][`/silent` or `/very silent`\
][Suppresses either pop-up of dialog boxes or any GUI at all.\
][`/loadinf="`*`Filename`*`"`\
][Loads the configuration file *`Filename`*for the installation.\
This configuration file can be generated by going through setup with `UltraVNC-xxxx-Setup.exe /saveinf="`*`Filename`*`"`.\
`Filename` should be fully qualified.\
][`/log`\
][Writes a log file to the Temp directory.\
Could be used for debugging.]
