#  Installing YAML with Helm

Tilt supports Helm out-of-the-box.

There are two major ways we see teams use Helm charts with Tilt.

  * Install a Helm chart from the rich library of existing charts.

  * Iterate on a Helm chart that youâre building.

Letâs dig into each one.

## Installing existing charts

Many off-the-shelf tools have Helm charts. The chart is an easy way to install
a collection of objects into your Kubernetes cluster.

The [`helm_resource` extension](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-
extensions/tree/master/helm_resource) makes this easy.

Hereâs an example that deploys the [Bitnami `mysql`
chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mysql):

    
    
    # Tiltfile
    
    load('ext://helm_resource', 'helm_resource', 'helm_repo')
    helm_repo('bitnami', 'https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami')
    helm_resource('mysql', 'bitnami/mysql', resource_deps=['bitnami'])
    

Visit [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/) to find Helm charts for many
off-the-shelf tools. They each list the repo URL and chart name to use with
`helm_resource`.

### Pros and Cons of `helm_resource()`

The `helm_resource` function has additional options for adding flags to `helm
install`, redeploying on file changes, and injecting images built locally.

Under the hood, hereâs how it works:

  * On `tilt up`, `helm_resource` will install your chart with `helm install`.

  * When the install is finished, `helm_resource` will tell about the objects it installed.

  * Tilt will display any logs, events, or health checks in the Tilt UI.

This is perfect if youâre installing a new operator or server into your dev
environment, but donât need to debug the installation process.

If youâre using Helm to organize your own servers, this can be a bit opaque.
So Tilt also offers a second approach.

## Iterate on chart YAML

The `helm` built-in function lets you load from a chart on your filesystem.

Calling `helm()` runs `helm template` on a chart directory and returns a blob
of the Kubernetes YAML, which you can then deploy with `k8s_yaml`.

    
    
    k8s_yaml(helm('./charts/my-chart'))
    

When you make edits to the files in the chart directory, Tilt will
automatically re-deploy the chart.

### `helm()` Options

The `helm` function has a few options for common arguments:

    
    
    yaml = helm(
      'path/to/chart/dir',
      # The release name, equivalent to helm --name
      name='release-name',
      # The namespace to install in, equivalent to helm --namespace
      namespace='my-namespace',
      # The values file to substitute into the chart.
      values=['./path/to/chart/dir/values-dev.yaml'],
      # Values to set from the command-line
      set=['service.port=1234', 'ingress.enabled=true']
      )
    k8s_yaml(yaml)
    

### Pros and Cons of `helm()`

The `helm()` function treats Helm as a YAML templating tool. You then register
the YAML so that Tilt can deploy it.

Tilt can validate your YAML, split it into individual resources for each
server, and auto-inject images that you built locally. This makes it a good
fit when youâre developing your own chart.

But modern Helm charts are more than just YAML. Helm supports [chart
hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) for modifying the install
process. Helm can also read settings from your cluster, and make installation
decisions based on what cluster youâre using.

The `helm()` function uses Tiltâs deployment engine, so skips the chart
hooks. Itâs offline-only. If you want to install a remote chart, you need to
use the `helm_remote` extension to download the chart locally.

### Remote charts

The [`helm_remote` extension](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-
extensions/tree/master/helm_remote) downloads remote charts and loads their
YAML with `helm()`.

Hereâs an example that deploys the `bitnami/mysql` chart:

    
    
    # Tiltfile
    
    load('ext://helm_remote', 'helm_remote')
    helm_remote('mysql',
                repo_name='bitnami',
                repo_url='https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami')
    

To customize the chart with your own `values.yaml` settings, see the
[`helm_remote` README](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-
extensions/tree/master/helm_remote) for additional options to configure the
chart.

### Sub-charts and requirements.txt

If you have chart dependencies, you need to run:

    
    
    helm dep update
    

outside of Tilt to download the dependencies to your repo. Then create a
`.tiltignore` with the contents:

    
    
    **/charts
    **/tmpcharts
    

Or, if you want be more cautious:

    
    
    path/to/your/chart/charts
    path/to/your/chart/tmpcharts
    

When Helm runs, it touches these chart directories. Adding these lines ensures
that Tilt doesnât reload the Tiltfile every time Helm touches them.

## Advanced Helm

Helm can also do more advanced templating â like downloading remote charts
and injecting run-time variables.

Fortunately, Tilt has a plugin API. You can tell it how to shell out to other
build and deploy tools.

The plugin API has two important functions:

  * `local()` for running local shell commands

  * `watch_file()` for telling Tilt to reload its configuration when a file changes

Letâs take a look at some common recipes for using the plugin API with Helm.

### Example Repo

If you prefer to play with a code sample, see

[tilt-dev/tilt-helm-demo](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-helm-demo)

### Re-implementing the `helm()` built-in

To start, letâs try implementing the `helm()` built-in ourselves.

    
    
    k8s_yaml(local('helm template path/to/chart/dir'))
    watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
    

The real `helm()` built-in handles some extra optimizations and edge cases,
but thatâs basically all it does!

### Passing a single variable

Now that we know how to shell out to `helm`, we can pass arbitrary flags.
Letâs try using `--set` to set a variable.

    
    
    k8s_yaml(local('helm template --set key1=val1,key2=val2 path/to/chart/dir'))
    watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
    

### Passing a values file

If youâre passing a lot of variables, itâs usually better to put those in
a values.yaml file.

    
    
    k8s_yaml(local('helm template -f ./values.yaml path/to/chart/dir'))
    watch_file('path/to/chart/dir')
    watch_file('values.yaml')
    

### Other Helm tools

There are other helm tools like
[helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) for working with Helm charts.

We can use the same plugin commands to implement those as well. In this
example, we factor out `helmfile` into a helper function.

    
    
    # Helper function to read K8s config YAML from helmfile.
    def helmfile(file):
      watch_file(file)
      return local("helmfile -f %s template" % file)
    
    # Tell Tilt to apply to k8s config generated by helmfile.
    k8s_yaml(helmfile("k8s/staging/helmfile.yaml"))
    

You can try out this example yourself in [this example
repo](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-helmfile-demo).
