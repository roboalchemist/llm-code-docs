#  Getting Started with Image Builds

This is a brief intro to automatically build and deploy images to a local dev
environment.

Weâll start with a single image.

## Going from `docker build` to `docker_build`

On the command-line, an image build looks like this:

    
    
    docker build -t my-image .
    

`my-image` is the image name. `.` is the directory of files that youâre
including in the image.

To make this part of your dev environment, add this to your Tiltfile:

    
    
    docker_build('my-image', '.')
    

`.` is still the directory of files youâre including. Tilt will
automatically watch them for changes.

`my-image` is an image selector. Tilt will scan all your workload manifests
for images, and match any object that contains the image name `my-image`
(regardless of tag).

This creates a dependency between your workload and `my-image`. Every time the
image rebuilds, Tilt knows it may need to restart your containers.

  * If the image hasnât changed, the containers wonât restart.

  * If the image has changed, the containers should always restart with a fresh image.

(Note that this is different than what usually happens in prod, where you want
more control over the gradual rollout of a new image. Tilt has some tricks to
make this work well in dev. The implementation details are discussed a bit in
[our custom_build guide](custom_build.html).)

### Advanced Image Matching

`my-image` is a matcher that ignores tags.

Some teams have one mega image with all their services, and use tags to denote
which service to run.

    
    
    docker_build('my-mega-image:service-a', '.', entrypoint='/service-a')
    docker_build('my-mega-image:service-b', '.', entrypoint='/service-b')
    

If you specify a tag, Tilt will only match deploy objects with that exact tag
in their image name.

If youâre trying to inject images into [Custom
Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-
extension/custom-resources/) (in other words, if youâre not using built-in
Kubernetes objects like Deployment and Job), check out our [custom resource
guide](custom_resource.html).

## Multiple Images

When you start adding multiple services to your app, itâs easiest to just
copy a new Dockerfile for each service and tweak a few parameters.

Once you have a few services, you may find that duplication can start to feel
messy. Sometimes you update one Dockerfile but forget to update the others.
Building all the services is slow.

A common pattern is to create a common base image with the dependencies for
multiple services.

So letâs set up a dependency tree of `docker_build`s that build on each
other.

### Building a `node_modules` Base Image

Letâs look at an example. We want to create a NodeJS server with two Docker
images:

  1. A Docker image that contains the node_module dependencies.

  2. A Docker image that contains the server source code.

First we write a Dockerfile for the base node_modules image. Weâll call this
image `nodejs-express-base-image`.

    
    
    # nodejs-express-base-image
    # base.dockerfile
    
    FROM node:16-alpine
    
    # Default value; will be overridden by build_args, if passed
    ARG node_env=production
    
    ENV NODE_ENV $node_env
    
    WORKDIR '/var/www/app'
    ADD package.json package.json
    RUN npm install
    ENTRYPOINT node server.js
    

Next weâll create a Dockerfile for the app image. This is just an empty base
image to build on.

    
    
    # nodejs-express-app-image
    # app.dockerfile
    
    FROM nodejs-express-base-image
    
    WORKDIR '/var/www/app'
    
    ADD . .
    

Lastly, weâll add a Tiltfile that knows how to build both images.

    
    
    # Set up the Kubernetes resources.
    k8s_yaml('app.yml')
    
    # Configure image build for our external dev dependencies.
    docker_build('nodejs-express-base-image',
                 './package',
                 dockerfile='base.dockerfile',
                 build_args={'node_env': 'development'})
    
    # Configure build to copy our source code.
    docker_build('nodejs-express-app-image',
                 '.',
                 dockerfile='app.dockerfile')
                 
    # Configure the Kubernetes deploys.
    k8s_resource('nodejs-express-app', port_forwards=3000)
    

Notice that the Docker build for `nodejs-express-deps` uses the subdirectory
`./package`. Tilt will only rebuild this image when files under `./package`
change.

When you run `tilt up`, Tilt will build both images, and make sure that the
first image gets injected into the second image.

    
    
    STEP 1/5 â Building Dockerfile: [nodejs-express-base-image]
    Building Dockerfile:
      FROM node:16-alpine
      
      # Default value; will be overridden by build_args, if passed
      ARG node_env=production
      
      ENV NODE_ENV $node_env
      
      WORKDIR '/var/www/app'
      ADD package.json package.json
      RUN npm install
      ENTRYPOINT node server.js
    
    ...
    
    STEP 3/5 â Building Dockerfile: [nodejs-express-app-image]
    Building Dockerfile:
      FROM localhost:5005/nodejs-express-base-image:tilt-19328501fd376562
      
      WORKDIR '/var/www/app'
      
      ADD . .
    
    
         Tarring contextâ¦
         Building image
         copy /context / [done: 44ms]
         [1/3] FROM localhost:5005/nodejs-express-base-image:tilt-19328501fd376562
         [2/3] WORKDIR /var/www/app [cached]
         [3/3] ADD . . [done: 18ms]
         exporting to image [done: 21ms]
    

If you make a change to server.js, Tilt knows it can skip the first image
build and just do the second.

### Adding Live Updates

Once youâve got the two image builds working, you can add a live update rule
to sync files into your app. This is much faster than building the app image
each time.

In this example, weâll use a `sync` step to copy the files.

Then weâll add a custom `entrypoint` that runs our server with `nodemon`,
which does the reload.

Hereâs what it looks like:

    
    
    docker_build('nodejs-express-app-image',
                 '.',
                 dockerfile='app.dockerfile',
                 live_update=[
                   sync('.', '/var/www/app')
                 ],
                 entrypoint='yarn run nodemon /var/www/app/server.js')
    

Every app needs to specify both a sync step and a reload step. But reload
steps tend to be specific to the programming language and framework youâre
using. Some frameworks even handle it automatically. This example uses an
entrypoint with `nodemon`, but the reload step for your project will probably
look different. For more examples, see the language-specific example projects
or [the live update reference](live_update_reference.html).

Note that live update steps should always be attached to the deployed image,
never the base image. Tiltâs live update system matches the image in the
container, so needs to be attached to the deployed image to figure out which
container to update.

## Troubleshooting

If youâre confused about an imageâs build context or seeing rebuilds you
donât expect, the [debugging file changes guide](file_changes.html) gives a
thorough breakdown of how Tilt watches and ignores files, and the [live update
reference](live_update_reference.html) will walk you through the relationship
between an imageâs build context and `live_update` rules.

## Example Code

  * An example of a base image for package.json dependencies: [tilt-example-base-image](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-example-base-image)

  * An integration test that uses 2 levels of base images: [live_update_base_image](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/blob/master/integration/live_update_base_image/Tiltfile)

  * An integration test that uses tag-based image matching: [imagetags](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/blob/master/integration/imagetags/Tiltfile)
