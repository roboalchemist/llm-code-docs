#  Extensions

Tilt lets you define your dev environment with a Tiltfile.

We have many built-in APIs for defining local tasks, image builds, and
containerized servers.

But we also see dev rules that are particular to a team like:

  * Checks that the right versions of local tools are installed.

  * Scripts for defining image builds or deploys.

  * Custom buttons for operations like resetting a dev database or upgrading a dependency.

And you want to share those snippets across repos or even across companies!

Thatâs why Tilt has an extension system for writing and sharing snippets of
Tiltfile functionality!

## Using an extension: âHello world!â

As an easy introduction, letâs look at the `hello_world` extension.

The source code for this extension is [here](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-
extensions/blob/master/hello_world/Tiltfile) and has exactly two (2) lines of
code:

    
    
    def hi():
      print("Hello world!")
    

It exports one function, `hi`, that simply prints âHello world!â.

Letâs load this extension into our project:

    
    
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    hi()
    

When you run `tilt ci` in this project, youâll see output like:

    
    
    Initial Build â¢ (Tiltfile)
    Loading Tiltfile at: /home/nick/src/scratch/Tiltfile
    Hello world!
    Successfully loaded Tiltfile (1.990905ms)
    ERROR: No resources found. Check out https://docs.tilt.dev/tutorial.html to get started!
    

Tilt printed the message! Tilt also printed an error because it doesnât make
any sense to have a dev environment that only prints âHello world!â. ð

## Discovering extensions

The [tilt-extensions repo](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions)
contains many general-purpose extensions from the Tilt community.

    
    
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

The `load()` call above is loading the extension from the `tilt-extensions`
repo!

In particular,

  * The `tilt-extensions` repo gets checked out in the background.

  * Tilt reads the Tiltfile under `hello_world/Tiltfile`

  * Tilt sets the variable `hi` in the local scope to the `hi` function in the extension.

## Sharing Tiltfile Code in a Single Repo

If the common Tiltfile code you want to share is in a single repo, you donât
need the extension system at all!

The first argument to `load()` can be a relative file path.

    
    
    load('./common/Tiltfile', 'hi')
    

The `load()` function has a nice syntax for binding variables, but that makes
its API a bit rigid. For more complex scripting, thereâs a `load_dynamic`
function.

    
    
    symbols = load_dynamic('./common/Tiltfile')
    hi = symbols.get('hi')
    

For more on `load()` and `load_dynamic()`, see the [API
reference](https://docs.tilt.dev/api.html#api.load) or our blog post [Load
Dynamic](https://blog.tilt.dev/2020/11/03/load-dynamic.html).

## Modifying the Default Extensions Locally

In Tilt v0.25, weâve made it easy to load the default extension repo
locally.

Letâs start with the `hello_world` example above:

    
    
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

This is a shorthand with nice defaults. You could write it like this:

    
    
    v1alpha1.extension_repo(name='default', url='https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions')
    v1alpha1.extension(name='hello_world', repo_name='default', repo_path='hello_world')
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

These two snippets are equivalent. The second snippet explicitly spells out
that thereâs an extension repo called `default` at `https://github.com/tilt-
dev/tilt-extensions`. The extension `hello_world` gets loaded from the path
`hello_world` in the `default` repo.

We could also use a repo on local disk:

    
    
    v1alpha1.extension_repo(name='default', url='file:///usr/nick/src/tilt-extensions')
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

The `file:///` syntax only accepts absolute paths. You would only use it for
local experimentation. `load()` and `load_dynamic()` are better fits when you
want to load shared functions from a relative path.

## Managing Your Own Extension Repo

The `extension_repo` API lets you replace the default repo with your own fork.

For example, you can fork the shared `tilt-extensions` repo, use a `v0.25.0`
tag to denote the version that most people should use, then add some code to
your Tiltfile to pin it:

    
    
    v1alpha1.extension_repo(name='default', url='https://github.com/my-org/tilt-extensions', ref='v0.25.0')
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

Alternatively, you can add new extension repos alongside the default one.

    
    
    v1alpha1.extension_repo(name='my-repo', url='https://github.com/my-org/tilt-extensions')
    v1alpha1.extension(name='hello_world', repo_name='my-repo', repo_path='hello_world')
    load('ext://hello_world', 'hi')
    

Notice that in the above, we define `hello_world` to pull its source from `my-
repo` rather than `default`.

If your extension repo is private, youâll need to configure git to
authenticate against the private repo in the background. A common pattern
(borrowed from [the Go FAQ](https://go.dev/doc/faq#git_https)) is to setup
your Git repo for SSH and add these lines to your `~/.gitconfig`:

    
    
    [url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
    	insteadOf = https://github.com/
    

## Debugging Extension Loading with the CLI

A Tilt session publishes the names of all repos and extensions itâs using
and where they live on disk.

You can read this info with the CLI. Here are some common commands you might
use to explore the status. (We use `jq` to prettify the JSON.)

    
    
    $ tilt get extensionrepo
    NAME      CREATED AT
    default   2022-02-04T18:56:38Z
    
    $ tilt get extensionrepo default -o jsonpath='{.status}{"\n"}' | jq
    {
      "checkoutRef": "6f4d3436c557d70bb0810b0da1acb99c364120b6",
      "lastFetchedAt": "2022-02-04T17:18:44Z",
      "path": "/home/nick/.local/share/tilt-dev/tilt_modules/github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions"
    }
    
    $ tilt get extension
    NAME          CREATED AT
    hello_world   2022-02-04T18:56:38Z
    
    $ tilt get extension hello_world -o jsonpath='{.status}{"\n"}' | jq
    {
      "path": "/home/nick/.local/share/tilt-dev/tilt_modules/github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions/hello_world/Tiltfile"
    }
    

## Sharing Extensions with the Community

If you have an extension that you think would be generally useful, we love to
see people contribute them!

Check out our [contributing extensions](contribute_extension.html) guide for
more detail on the pull request and review process.

## A Note on Upgrading from Old Versions

Before `v0.25.0`, Tilt would download your extension code in `tilt_modules`
directory next to your Tiltfile.

We found this led to a lot of grief for both extension authors and for teams
setting up dev environments, in particular:

  * How vendoring should work in a monorepo.

  * How vendoring should work when there are multiple independent Tiltfiles.

  * Where extensions should store files that they download.

  * How to exclude extension code from Docker builds and file watching.

With `v0.25.0`, Tilt stores your extension code in your XDG data directory, a
standard for storing application data. The specific location of the downloaded
extension will depend on your OS. You can use the XDG environment variables to
customize where the extension code is stored. See the [XDG Base Directory
guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory) for more details.
