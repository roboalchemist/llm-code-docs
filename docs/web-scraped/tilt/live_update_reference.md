#  Live Update Reference

Live Update optimizes your setup to get updates down from minutes to
**seconds**.

This document is a technical specification of `live_update`. If youâre
looking for sample projects and examples for your project, see:

  * [Go](/example_go.html)
  * [NodeJS](/example_nodejs.html)
  * [Python](/example_python.html)
  * [Java](/example_java.html)

  * [C# + ASP.NET Core](/example_csharp.html)
  * [Bazel](/example_bazel.html)

## Tiltfile API

When specifying how to build an image (via `docker_build()` or
`custom_build()`), you may optionally pass the `live_update` argument.

`live_update` takes a list of `LiveUpdateSteps` that tell Tilt how to update a
running container in place (instead of paying the cost of building a new image
and redeploying).

The list of `LiveUpdateSteps` must be, in order:

  * 0 or more [`fall_back_on`](api.html#api.fall_back_on) steps
  * 0 or more [`sync`](api.html#api.sync) steps
  * 0 or more [`run`](api.html#api.run) steps

When you `tilt up`, your initial build will be a full buildâi.e., the
specified Docker build or Custom build.1

When a file changes:

  1. If it matches any of the files in a `fall_back_on` step, we will fall back to a full rebuild + deploy (i.e. the normal, non-live_update process).
  2. Otherwise, if it matches any of the local paths in `sync` steps, a live update will be executed as follows: 
     1. copy any changed files according to `sync` steps
     2. for every `run` step: 
        1. if the `run` specifies one or more `triggers`, execute the command iff any changed files match the given triggers
        2. otherwise, simply execute the command

## LiveUpdateSteps

Each of the functions above returns a `LiveUpdateStep` â an object like any
other, i.e. it can be assigned to a variable, etc. That means that something
like this is perfectly valid syntax:

    
    
    sync_src = sync('./source', '/app/src')
    sync_static = sync('./static', '/app/static')
    docker_build('my-img', '.', live_update=[sync_src, sync_static])
    

As part of Tiltfile validation, we check that all of the `LiveUpdateSteps`
youâve created have been used in at least one Live Update call. If not, we
throw an error.

### [sync(local_path: str, remote_path: str)](api.html#api.sync)

`sync` steps are the backbone of a Live Update. (For this reason, weâll
discuss them first, even though they may be preceeded by one or more
`fall_back_on` steps in a Tiltfile.)

_Tilt will only run a Live Update if it detects a change to one or more files
matching a`sync` step._

A `sync` call takes two args: the local path of a file/directory, and the
remote path to which Tilt should sync that file/directory if it changes. (This
includes deleting the file remotely if it is deleted locally.)

#### What files can I sync? How are builds triggered?

When you tell Tilt how to build an image, you specify some set of files to
watch. In the case of a `docker_build` call, Tilt watches the directory that
you pass as `context`. Your syncâd local paths must fall within that
context. (If youâre using `custom_build`, all of the above applies, only
with `deps` in place of `context`.) Letâs look at some examples:

![An illegal 'sync'](/assets/img/liveupdate-sync-illegal.png) An illegal
'sync': attempting to sync files that aren't included in the docker_build
context

The `sync` above is invalid, because it attempts to sync files that weâre
not even watching (seen here highlighted in blue). To put it another way:
thereâs no way for those files to get into the container in the first place,
because they would never be included in the Docker build.

![A valid use of 'sync' \(all sync'd files are subsets of
docker_build.context\)](/assets/img/liveupdate-sync-docker-context.png) A
valid use of 'sync' (all sync'd files are subsets of docker_build.context)

Above is an example of a valid `sync`s. A change to any of the green files
will kick off a Live Update, because they match a `sync` step. A change to any
of the yellow files will kick off a full Docker build + deploy, because
theyâre part of the Docker context but we donât have instructions on how
to Live Update them. (Want to be more selective in which files do/donât kick
off full builds? Check out [context filters for
`docker_build`](https://blog.tilt.dev/2019/06/07/better-monorepo-container-
builds-with-context-filters.html).)

![How to use 'sync' with multiple dependent docker
images](/assets/img/liveupdate-sync-dep-images.png) An example of 'sync' used
with dependent Docker images

If you have multiple Docker images that depend on each other, you can sync
files from anywhere within the contexts of any of the images. (In the diagram
above, Tilt is building two images; the yellow image in the `server1`
directory depends onâi.e. `FROM`âsâthe red image in the `common`
directory.)

The rule of thumb is: if Tilt is watching it, you can `sync` it. (Tilt will
watch it if itâs in a `docker_build.context` or `custom_build.deps`).

#### Letâs review

For instance, take the following sync statements:

    
    
    docker_build('my-img', './server', live_update=[
        sync('./server/src', '/app'),
        sync('./server/package.json', '/app/web/package.json')
    ])
    

  1. change to `./server/src/A.txt` => synced to `/app/A.txt`
  2. change to `./server/package.json` => synced to `/app/web/package.json`
  3. change to `./server/some_file.txt` => doesnât match any `sync` statements, but _does_ match the `docker_build` context; instead of a Live Update, Tilt performs a Docker Build
  4. change to `./stuff.txt` => doesnât match a `sync` statement OR the `docker_build` context; nothing happens

### [fall_back_on(files: str || List[str])](api.html#api.fall_back_on)

This step is optional, though if provided, it must come at the beginning of
the `live_update` call. The argument is a filepath (string) or multiple
filepaths (list of strings) on your local machine, either absolute or relative
to the Tiltfile. Whenever Tilt detects a change to your local filesystem that
would otherwise trigger a LiveUpdate, it first checks if it matches any
`fall_back_on` files; if yes, instead of doing a LiveUpdate, Tilt _falls back_
to a full rebuild + deploy.

### [run(cmd: str, trigger=None: str || List[str])](api.html#api.run)

The first argument to `run` is a the command to be executed _on the running
container_. Currently, all commands are executed from `/`, so be sure to use
absolute paths!

Currently, all of your `run` steps must come after all of your `sync` steps.

If you provide multiple `run` steps, the commands will be executed in the
order given.

#### Run triggers

The second arg, `trigger`, is optional. If you donât provide a trigger, then
the command is executed on the container whenever Tilt performs a LiveUpdate
(i.e. whenever Tilt detects a change to one or more files matching a `sync`).

A trigger is a filepath (string) or multiple filepaths (list of strings) on
your local machine, either absolute or relative to the Tiltfile. If a trigger
is provided, Tilt _only_ executes the command if a changed file matches one
the trigger paths.

Note that specifying a file as a trigger does _not_ tell Tilt to watch and/or
sync that file; that is, all `trigger` files must also be included in a `sync`
step.

Letâs walk through what will and wonât happen when various files change,
given this example Tiltfile:

    
    
    docker_build('my-img', '.', live_update=[
        sync('./src', '/app'),
        run('/app/setup.sh'),
        run('cd /app/web && yarn install', trigger='./src/web/yarn.lock'),
        run('/app/run_configs.sh', trigger=['./configs/foo.yaml', './configs/bar.yaml'])
    ])
    

  1. change to `./src/main.py` => this file matches a sync step, so we run the Live Update. We run `setup.sh`, because it has no triggers and so runs on every Live Update. We run neither of the other `run` steps, b/c this file doesnât match any of their triggers.
  2. change to `./src/web/yarn.lock` => run the Live Update; run `setup.sh`; run `cd /app/web && yarn install`, because this file matches that commandâs trigger
  3. change to `./configs/foo.yaml` => whoops, this file doesnât match any `sync` steps! Even though it matches a trigger (for the third `run`), we wonât do a Live Update for this change; instead, we do a full Docker build (see notes on `sync`, above, for what changes trigger a Live Update vs. a full build + deploy).

## Restarting your Process

Some apps or invocations thereof (e.g. Javascript apps run via `nodemon`, or
Flask apps run in debug mode) detect and incorporate code changes without
needing to restart. For other apps, though, youâll need to re-execute them
for changes to take effect.

For most setups, youâll be able to use the [`restart_process`
extension](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-
extensions/tree/master/restart_process): import the extension, replace your
`docker_build` call with a `docker_build_with_restart` call, and specify the
`entrypoint` parameter (i.e. the command to run on container start and _re-
run_ on Live Update).

There are a few exceptions to the above; the `restart_process` extension
doesnât work for:

  * Docker Compose resources; you should use the [`restart_container()`](api.html#api.restart_container) Live Update step instead
  * Images build via `custom_build`
  * Container images without a shell (e.g. `scratch`, `distroless`)
  * CRDs

If any of the exceptions above apply to you, or `restart_process` doesnât
otherwise work for your use case, read on.

### Workarounds for Restarting Your Process

Tilt is flexible enough that you can employ any number of workarounds for
restarting your process as part of a Live Update. The basic idea is to invoke
your process such that a single command (specified as a `run` step) causes it
to restart. Here are a few approaches we recommend:

  * Weâve written a [set of wrappers for your process](https://github.com/tilt-dev/rerun-process-wrapper). Put these scripts in your container and invoke your process as: 
        
        /path/to/start.sh /path/to/bin
        

You can then restart your process with Live Update step:
`run('/path/to/restart.sh')`. (Requires that shell be available on your
container.)

  * [`entr`](https://github.com/eradman/entr/) is a neat utility for (re)running processes when specified files change. You can designate an arbitrary file to trigger process restart, say `/restart.txt`, and invoke your process like this: 
        
        echo /restart.txt | entr -rz /path/to/bin
        

You can then your process with Live Update step: `run('date > /restart.txt')`.
(Youâll have to ensure that `entr` is present in your Docker image, and that
your arbitrary file for restarting exists.) (Requires that shell be available
on your container.)

Recall that you can change the command run by your container in a few ways:

  * in the Dockerfile, via `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD`
  * in your Kubernetes YAML, via `spec.containers.[the_container].command`
  * in your Tiltfile, via the `docker_build.entrypoint` parameter (or analogously, `custom_build.entrypoint`)

## More Examples

If you need more specifics on how to set up Live Update with your programming
language, all our major example projects use Live Update:

  * [Plain Old Static HTML](/example_static_html.html)
  * [Go](/example_go.html)
  * [NodeJS](/example_nodejs.html)
  * [Python](/example_python.html)
  * [Java](/example_java.html)
  * [C#](/example_csharp.html)
  * [Bazel](/example_bazel.html)

* * *

  1. The initial build is always a full build because Live Update needs a running container to modify. Thus, your base build (Docker/Custom Build) should be sufficient to create your dev image, and should not rely on any `sync`âd files or `run` commands.Â ↩
