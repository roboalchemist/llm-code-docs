# Repository Management[¶](#repository-management "Permanent link")

Here\'s a short description of how the Typer repository is managed and maintained.

## Owner[¶](#owner "Permanent link")

I, [\@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), am the creator and owner of the Typer repository. 🤓

I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I\'m the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). 😅

## Team[¶](#team "Permanent link")

There\'s a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎

They have different levels of permissions and [specific instructions](../management-tasks/).

Some of the tasks they can perform include:

-   Adding labels to PRs.
-   Editing PR titles.
-   Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
-   Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
-   Merge some specific types of PRs.

Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.
