# How Apiable helped Pirate Weather surpass 10,000 developers
In this short case study we will dig deeper into how Apiable helped Pirate Weather reach over 10,000 developers on their weather data API products.

Apiable customer, Pirate Weather, provides detailed weather data Building off public models hosted on the AWS open data platform, Pirate Weather targets both general users and developers through an API designed to make complex weather forecasts clear and easy. This API allows for straightforward weather data integration into apps, websites, and other digital platforms, catering to various needs, from basic weather updates to complex forecasting for specific applications.

‍

Alexander Rey, the visionary behind Pirate Weather, once navigated the turbulent seas of API management with a homemade solution. This setup, reliant on donations, was both admirable and cumbersome, especially when it came to manually onboarding users to the Amazon API Gateway—a process fraught with inefficiency and error.

‍

Enter apiable.io, a beacon of innovation in API management. Their intervention was akin to the arrival of favorable winds, propelling Pirate Weather towards smoother seas. The self-service portal they introduced was a game-changer, empowering developers to independently generate API keys and manage their subscriptions. This breakthrough meant that Alexander could now focus on what he loved most—building and refining Pirate Weather's offerings.

‍

Since adopting Apiable, Pirate Weather has onboarded over 10,000 developers onto the platform. Alexander Rey's endorsement of apiable.io speaks volumes: "Their product works exactly as promised. Their portal handles all the frustrating parts of running an API (sign-up and monetization) and lets me focus on building! Plus, their team is responsive and super quick to address issues and add new features." This partnership has not only simplified operations but has also redefined Pirate Weather's business model.

‍

Transitioning from a donation-based system to a structured revenue model, Pirate Weather introduced a spectrum of weather packages catering to a wide range of needs—from casual users to enterprise clients. This diversification of services, underpinned by apiable.io's seamless monetization platform, ensured a sustainable and scalable business model. The ability of serverless AWS infrastructure to support this operation highlights the technical strength and reliability of Pirate Weather's services.

‍

Moreover, this collaboration has set a precedent for how API-centric businesses can evolve. By addressing the critical challenges of API management, such as user onboarding, subscription management, and monetization, apiable.io has demonstrated that the right partnership can unlock tremendous value. For Pirate Weather, this meant transforming from a service powered by goodwill into a formidable player in the weather forecasting domain.

‍

The ongoing relationship between Pirate Weather and apiable.io shows their shared vision for innovation, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
