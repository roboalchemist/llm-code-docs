#### Redefining Insurance with APIs
Embedded insurance isn’t just about protection; it’s about delivering convenience and value where it matters most—at the point of sale. For Bikmo, a company passionate about cycling, the journey to embedded insurance wasn’t just a pivot but a transformation powered by API technology.

Historically, insurance was complicated, detached, and burdensome. Bikmo began by simplifying bike insurance, but the real breakthrough came when they integrated their services directly into partner platforms. This shift allowed Bikmo to embed insurance into the purchasing journey seamlessly, creating a frictionless experience for both customers and partners.

The catalyst for this transformation? A strategic partnership with Apiable.io.

#### How Apiable Enabled Bikmo’s Embedded Insurance
For Bikmo, the move to an API-first model was essential to scaling its insurance offerings. But building the necessary infrastructure required time, resources, and expertise they couldn’t spare. That’s where Apiable stepped in, offering:

**A Plug-and-Play API Platform:** Apiable enabled Bikmo to transform their backend into an API-led system with minimal development effort.**Partner-Friendly Onboarding:** With a secure API portal, comprehensive documentation, and sandbox environments, partners like buycycle could easily integrate Bikmo’s insurance into their systems.**Business-Focused Communication:** By demystifying technical jargon, Apiable helped Bikmo present their API as a business solution, making it accessible to non-technical stakeholders.This approach turned what could have been a resource-intensive process into a streamlined operation, allowing Bikmo to focus on delivering value rather than managing integrations.

#### Embedded Insurance in Action: The buycycle Story
The partnership with buycycle, a global marketplace for pre-owned bikes, highlights the power of embedded insurance. Using Bikmo’s API-enabled solution, buycycle integrated insurance directly at checkout. This seamless experience provided:

**Ease for Customers:** Insurance is now a one-click add-on during bike purchases, eliminating lengthy forms or separate processes.**Increased Revenue:** buycycle earns commissions on every policy sold, unlocking a new revenue stream.**Customer Trust:** By addressing concerns about theft or damage upfront, buycycle builds trust and loyalty with its buyers.Apiable’s API platform was central to this success, enabling buycycle to self-manage integration and quickly move from testing to production—all while maintaining robust data security and compliance.

#### Why Embedded Insurance Matters
Embedded insurance isn’t just a convenience—it’s a paradigm shift. By integrating insurance into existing customer journeys, businesses can:

**Enhance Customer Experiences:** Offering protection as part of the purchase feels natural and builds confidence.**Boost Revenue Streams:** Embedded insurance opens doors to new business opportunities without additional overhead.**Streamline Operations:** API-driven solutions reduce the complexity of integration and maintenance.With Apiable’s tools and expertise, companies like Bikmo are proving how embedded insurance can transform industries beyond traditional insurance, setting a new standard for simplicity and scalability.
