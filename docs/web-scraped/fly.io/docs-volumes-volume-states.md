---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We always soft delete volumes before destroying them permanently, so that we can recover them if needed. Soft-deleted volumes are in the `pending_destroy` state.

When you destroy a volume (whether by flyctl commands or the Machines API), the volume stays in the `pending_destroy` state for 24 hours before being permanently deleted.

When we destroy a volume during migration to a new host, the volume stays in the `pending_destroy` state for 1 week before being permanently deleted.
