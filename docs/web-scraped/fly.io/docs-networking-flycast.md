With Flycast, requests to your private apps get routed through the Fly Proxy, rather than Machine-to-Machine via default [private networking](/docs/networking/private-networking/). And unlike private networking using `.internal` addresses you don't need to keep Machines running for the app to be reachable. Use Flycast within your organization's private network to: * Have [Fly Proxy autostop/autostart](/docs/launch/autostop-autostart/) Machines based on network requests. * Get Fly Proxy's [geographically aware load balancing](/docs/reference/load-balancing/) for private services. * Connect to a service from another app that can't use DNS. * Connect from third-party software, like a database, that doesn't support round-robin DNS entries. * Access specific ports or services in your app from other Fly.io organizations. * Use advanced Fly Proxy features like TLS termination or PROXY protocol support. ## Flycast quickstart The fastest way to create a new private app with a Flycast address: ``` fly launch --flycast ``` Access the services on the Flycast private IPv6 address, or with `my-app-name.flycast`, from other apps in the organization's default private network. ## Flycast requirements To use Flycast for your app, you need: - A Flycast private IPv6 address for your app on one of your Fly.io organization networks. - Your app to bind to `0.0.0.0:port`. (Binding to `fly-local-6pn:<port>` won't work for Flycast.) - Services configured in your app's `fly.toml` with an [`[http_service]`](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) or [`[services]`](/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections) section.

Use the `--org` option when you allocate the Flycast address: ```cmd fly ips allocate-v6 --private --org my-other-org ``` ### Access an app from another private network You can also use Flycast to expose an app on one private network to another private network in your organization; the app won't be accessible via Flycast from its own network. Use the `--network` option to specify the network from which requests will originate: ```cmd fly ips allocate-v6 --private --network custom-network-name ``` Learn more about [custom private networks](/docs/networking/custom-private-networks/). ## Flycast and Fly.io DNS Flycast addresses can also be found by using the Fly.io DNS.

Flycast - Private Fly Proxy services
====================================

![Image 2: Illustration by Annie Ruygt of apps resting on clouds, all connected by pathways](https://fly.io/static/images/flycast-private-proxy.png)
Flycast provides network addressing and routing for private apps on Fly.io private networks. With Flycast, requests to your private apps get routed through the Fly Proxy, rather than Machine-to-Machine via default [private networking](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/). And unlike private networking using `.internal` addresses you don’t need to keep Machines running for the app to be reachable.

Use Flycast within your organization’s private network to:

*   Have [Fly Proxy autostop/autostart](https://fly.io/docs/launch/autostop-autostart/) Machines based on network requests. 
*   Get Fly Proxy’s [geographically aware load balancing](https://fly.io/docs/reference/load-balancing/) for private services. 
*   Connect to a service from another app that can’t use DNS. 
*   Connect from third-party software, like a database, that doesn’t support round-robin DNS entries. 
*   Access specific ports or services in your app from other Fly.io organizations. 
*   Use advanced Fly Proxy features like TLS termination or PROXY protocol support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fastest way to create a new private app with a Flycast address:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard 

```
fly launch --flycast
```

Access the services on the Flycast private IPv6 address, or with `my-app-name.flycast`, from other apps in the organization’s default private network.

[](https://fly.io/docs/networking/flycast/#flycast-requirements)Flycast requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use Flycast for your app, you need:

*   A Flycast private IPv6 address for your app on one of your Fly.io organization networks. 
*   Your app to bind to `0.0.0.0:port`. (Binding to `fly-local-6pn:<port>` won’t work for Flycast.) 
*   Services configured in your app’s `fly.toml` with an [`[http_service]`](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-http_service-section) or [`[services]`](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-services-sections) section. Don’t use `force_https`; Flycast is HTTP-only. 

**Warning:** If you have public IP addresses assigned to your app, then services in `fly.toml` are exposed to the public internet. Verify your app’s IP addresses with `fly ips list`, and remove public IP addresses as needed with: `fly ips release [ip address] [ip address] ...`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Flycast address is an app-wide private IPv6 address that Fly Proxy can route to over the private network. By default, the Flycast IP address is allocated on an app’s default organization network.

There are a few ways to add a Flycast address to an existing app.

Allocate a Flycast address on deploy:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard 

```
fly deploy --flycast
```

Allocate a Flycast address without deploying:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard 

```
fly ips allocate-v6 --private
```

### [](https://fly.io/docs/networking/flycast/#access-an-app-from-another-organization)Access an app from another organization

You can use Flycast to expose an app in one Fly.io organization to another Fly.io organization; the app won’t be accessible via Flycast from its own organization. Use the `--org` option when you allocate the Flycast address:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard 

```
fly ips allocate-v6 --private --org my-other-org
```

### [](https://fly.io/docs/networking/flycast/#access-an-app-from-another-private-network)Access an app from another private network

You can also use Flycast to expose an app on one private network to another private network in your organization; the app won’t be accessible via Flycast from its own network. Use the `--network` option to specify the network from which requests will originate:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard 

```
fly ips allocate-v6 --private --network custom-network-name
```

Flycast addresses can also be found by using the Fly.io DNS. If an app has a Flycast address allocated to it, there will be an AAAA record at `my-app-name.flycast`.
