--- title: OpenID Connect layout: docs nav: firecracker redirect_from: /docs/reference/openid-connect/ --- <figure><img src="/static/images/key-hole.png" alt="Illustration by Annie Ruygt of a key hole revealing a pink sky" class="max-w-lg"></figure> Fly Machines sometimes need to access 3rd-party services or cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP. To authenticate against these 3rd parties, your Machines need to supply credentials such as a password or token to the cloud provider; usually these are stored as `fly secrets` and then passed into your Machine's environment variables. However this approach involves creating hardcoded long-lived credentials on the 3rd party platform and involves either managing a lot of tokens or sharing the same token across multiple apps. Using OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows for a more secure approach by using short-lived access tokens directly from 3rd party platforms. The only caveat is that the 3rd party platform needs to support OIDC tokens and you need to establish a trust between Fly.io and the 3rd party. Providers which currently support OIDC include Amazon Web Services, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and HashiCorp Vault, among others. ## Benefits of OpenID Connect (OIDC) Adopting OIDC to manage access to 3rd party services allows your apps to easily use good security practices like: * No hardcoded credentials, these are often shared across Machines and apps. OIDC allows for every Machine to have its own credential. * Granular control over Machines access to 3rd party resources through leveraging the authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) tools of the 3rd party. * Rotating credentials: credentials issued from 3rd parties are only valid for 15 minutes before they expire. ## Understanding OpenID Connect Every request to the token endpoint generates a unique Json Web Token (JWT). When you give this JWT to a 3rd party they validate the token against the OIDC configuration hosted at the endpoint in the issuer (`iss`) claim. Below is an example of an issued OIDC token. A useful feature here is that the subject (`sub`) claim references the Machine's org name, app name and Machine name. This allows for regex checks to be built against the claim which can restrict accepted tokens to a specific app or Machine. ```json { "app_id": "11111111", "app_name": "example-app", "aud": "https://fly.io/exmaple-org", "exp": 1712099653, "iat": 1712099053, "image": "docker-hub-mirror.fly.io/you/image:latest", "image_digest": "sha256:2c1cdaded1b3820020c9dc9fdd1d6e798d6f6ca36861bb6ae64019fad6be9ee3", "iss": "https://oidc.fly.io/exmaple-org", "jti": "93ca09e1-70e0-477b-a260-1d8fcd4ef4f4", "machine_id": "148e21ea7e46e8", "machine_name": "example-machine", "machine_version": "01HTGGC1TZ2JHK83J4AC0R3VET", "nbf": 1712099053, "org_id": "11111111", "org_name": "example-org", "region": "sea", "sub": "example-org:example-app:example-machine" } ``` ## Customizing OIDC token claims Customizing tokens allows for powerful authorization clauses in the platform you're authenticating against. For example, with AWS, you can require that a role can only be assumed by tokens which match certain `aud` and `sub` claims. This allows you to lock down and provide credentials only to a specific Fly.io app or Machine. You can customize the audience (aud) claim of your tokens by providing a value for aud in the body of the POST request. This lets you specify the recipient of the token. This is what it looks like in a curl request with the `aud` claim set to `sts.amazonaws.com`. ```cmd curl --unix-socket /.fly/api -X POST "http://localhost/v1/tokens/oidc" --data '{"aud":"sts.amazonaws.com"}' ``` ## OpenID Connect Trust Policies in AWS You can leverage the trust policy of an IAM role to restrict which Machines in your organisation can assume a role in AWS. For example the following policy would only allow Machines in the app`foo-bar`within your org to assume the role it’s attached to. ```json { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123456123456:oidc-provider/oidc.fly.io/<org-name>" }, "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity", "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "oidc.fly.io/<org-name>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com", }, "StringLike": { "oidc.fly.io/<org-name>:sub": "org-name:foo-bar:*" } } } ] } ``` ## Reading from an S3 Bucket on a Fly Machine To read from an S3 bucket using a Fly Machine you'll first need to set up a trust between AWS and Fly.io by creating an OIDC provider in AWS and then attaching a trust policy to the role policy your Machine will assume. If you've already packaged up your app in a Dockerfile, then you can follow these steps to read from an S3 bucket: 1. Create a Fly.io app by running `fly launch` in the same directory as your Dockerfile. 1. Find the slug for the organisation you want to launch your app in. ```cmd fly orgs list ``` 1. Create an [OpenID Connect Identity provider](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/identity_providers/create) in your AWS account with your org slug and the following settings: ``` Provider URL: https://oidc.fly.io/<org-slug> Audience: sts.amazonaws.com ``` 1. Create an [IAM Role](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles/create) with the following settings: * Trusted Identity: `Web Identity -> Identity Provider -> oidc.fly.io` * Select the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy. 1. Set the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` as an environment variable in your `fly.toml`. ```toml [env] AWS_ROLE_ARN = "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>" ``` 1. Deploy your app and let the AWS SDK will do the rest. ```cmd fly deploy ``` <div class = "note icon"> **Notes**: If you’re setting this up for your personal org the slug is a little harder to find but you can find it in the url when you click on “Apps” on the [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard) </div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To read from an S3 bucket using a Fly Machine you’ll first need to set up a trust between AWS and Fly.io by creating an OIDC provider in AWS and then attaching a trust policy to the role policy your Machine will assume. If you’ve already packaged up your app in a Dockerfile, then you can follow these steps to read from an S3 bucket:

1.   Create a Fly.io app by running `fly launch` in the same directory as your Dockerfile. 
2.   Find the slug for the organisation you want to launch your app in.

fly orgs list
```  
3.   Create an [OpenID Connect Identity provider](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/identity_providers/create) in your AWS account with your org slug and the following settings:

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard ```
Provider URL: https://oidc.fly.io/<org-slug>
Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
```  
4.   Create an [IAM Role](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles/create) with the following settings:

    *   Trusted Identity: `Web Identity -> Identity Provider -> oidc.fly.io`
    *   Select the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy. 

5.   Set the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` as an environment variable in your `fly.toml`.

 Wrap text  Copy to clipboard ```
[env]
  AWS_ROLE_ARN = "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>"
```  
6.   Deploy your app and let the AWS SDK will do the rest.

```  

**Notes**: If you’re setting this up for your personal org the slug is a little harder to find but you can find it in the url when you click on “Apps” on the [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard)
