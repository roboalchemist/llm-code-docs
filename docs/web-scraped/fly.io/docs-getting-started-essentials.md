But if you want to know a bit more about what's what on the Fly.io platform, then read on. You can skip to the [glossary](#fly-io-glossary) for the tl;dr. Two big concepts to know about how Fly.io works, and one small one: Fly Machines, Fly Launch, and Fly Apps. ## Fly Machines: The basic unit of Doing Stuff on Fly.io Fly Machines are fast-launching virtual machines (VMs) that are individually runnable and controllable. We build Machines out of the images you give us and we run them where you tell us to. Machines are the compute on Fly.io,[ our lowest level of orchestration](https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/). When you just have to run a VM of a specific size in a specific place, Machines are what you want. If you're thinking about individual VMs, rather than applications comprising groups of VMs, then you're thinking about Machines. Learn more about [Fly Machines](/docs/machines/). ## Fly Launch: Manage applications built on Fly Machines Fly Launch is how you manage the whole lifecycle of an application on top of Machines, from starting to scaling to changing and redeploying. If you're not thinking of an individual VM, but rather of an application, like "sandwich-ratings.fly.dev", then you're thinking of Fly Launch. Fly Launch is our built-from-scratch-for-Fly-Machines orchestrator: - Create your app with the `fly launch` command. Fly Launch detects your framework and gives you useful defaults. - Configure your app's deployment and services with the [`fly.toml`](/docs/reference/configuration/) configuration file. - Deploy your app's Machines as a group with the `fly deploy` command. - Scale your app's Machines [horizontally](/docs/launch/scale-count/) or [vertically](/docs/launch/scale-machine/) with the `fly scale` command. [Scaling based on metrics](/docs/launch/autoscale-by-metric/) is also possible. Again, Fly Launch is built on Machines: you can use Fly Launch to manage the scale of your application with a single command, or you can interact directly with Machines for fine-grained control. Learn more about [Fly Launch](/docs/launch/). ## Fly Apps: We're not here to tell you what to build Fly Apps are how we group Machines on the Fly.io platform. A Fly App can be a web app, or a database, or a bunch of task Machines, or whatever you want to deploy. When we talk about "your app" in our how-to docs, we're talking about a Fly App. You can manage a Fly App's Machines as a group with Fly Launch features, or you can run and manage individual Machines with the Machines API or with `fly machine` flyctl commands. You can even do all of these things in one Fly App. Learn more about [Fly Apps](/docs/apps/overview/). ## Fly.io glossary **The Fly.io platform**: All the primitives, products, and features that make up the Fly.io public cloud. **[Fly Apps](/docs/apps/):** The way Machines are grouped for admin and management on the Fly.io platform. **[Fly GPUs](/docs/gpus/):** Machines, but with GPUs.

Fly Machines are fast-launching virtual machines (VMs) that are individually runnable and controllable. We build Machines out of the images you give us and we run them where you tell us to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fly Launch is how you manage the whole lifecycle of an application on top of Machines, from starting to scaling to changing and redeploying. If you’re not thinking of an individual VM, but rather of an application, like “sandwich-ratings.fly.dev”, then you’re thinking of Fly Launch.

Fly Launch is our built-from-scratch-for-Fly-Machines orchestrator:

*   Create your app with the `fly launch` command. Fly Launch detects your framework and gives you useful defaults. 
*   Configure your app’s deployment and services with the [`fly.toml`](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/) configuration file. 
*   Deploy your app’s Machines as a group with the `fly deploy` command. 
*   Scale your app’s Machines [horizontally](https://fly.io/docs/launch/scale-count/) or [vertically](https://fly.io/docs/launch/scale-machine/) with the `fly scale` command. [Scaling based on metrics](https://fly.io/docs/launch/autoscale-by-metric/) is also possible.
