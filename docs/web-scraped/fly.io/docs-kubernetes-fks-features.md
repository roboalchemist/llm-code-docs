Fly Kubernetes features
=======================

![Image 2: Illustration by Annie Ruygt of a ship's wheel](https://fly.io/static/images/k8s-features.png)
Fly Kubernetes benefits from the features of the Fly.io platform.

[](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-features/#fly-io-infrastructure)Fly.io infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FKS is built on top of Fly.io infrastructure:

*   Compute is backed by [Fly Machines](https://fly.io/docs/machines/), our fast-launching VMs built with Firecracker. 
*   Volumes are handled with [Fly Volumes](https://fly.io/docs/volumes/); local, fast NVMe drives.

*   Networking is built on our [internal WireGuard mesh](https://fly.io/docs/networking/private-networking/#private-network-vpn) with routing performed by Fly Proxy. 

[](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-features/#cluster-scalability)Cluster scalability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pods are scheduled across our fleet of bare-metal servers, not limited to a specific node. Workloads are automatically distributed across the fleet, enabling a cluster to scale with ease.

[](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-features/#security)Security
-----------------------------------------------------------------

With Fly Kubernetes, you get all the security benefits of our platform.

*   Private network traffic flows over our internal WireGuard mesh, ensuring it is encrypted. 
*   FKS clusters are secured within a private VPN. 
*   Compute is built on Firecracker microVMs — lightweight and secure virtual machines. This provides improved isolation guarantees ensuring your application code is safe. 
*   Volumes are encrypted at rest for additional protection of the data on the volume. 
*   Secrets are automatically stored in an encrypted vault. 

[](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-features/#simple-and-secure-client-authentication)Simple and secure client authentication
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connect to your cluster using kubectl. Clients are authenticated with our API tokens. They expire after an hour and are rotated automatically after expiration.

[](https://fly.io/docs/kubernetes/fks-features/#not-supported)Not supported
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few features we don’t support yet but are part of the roadmap:

*   Sidecars and init processes 
*   EmptyDir volumes 
*   Horizontal pod autoscaling 
*   Network policies 
*   CronJob 

Features we don’t support:

*   Node affinity 
*   Inter-pod (anti) affinity 
*   DaemonSets
