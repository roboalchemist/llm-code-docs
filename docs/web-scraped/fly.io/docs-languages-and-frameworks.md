Fly.io can run pretty much any type of application. If you don't see it listed here, it's a matter of finding and configuring a Dockerfile that runs it.

Comprehensive Guides
--------------------

Fly.io supports all languages and frameworks, but you'll notice some have much more extensive documentation and support. That's because we have people at Fly.io who work full time on documenting and nurturing these frameworks.
