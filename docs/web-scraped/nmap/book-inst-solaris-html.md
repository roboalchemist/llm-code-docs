Most Nmap users run the software on Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X. We consider those our top priority platforms and we maintain build and test machines to ensure that each build supports them well.

Nmap also runs on many other platforms that we don't have the resources to personally test or build binaries packages for as frequently. We rely on a passionate user community to help Nmap maintain top-notch support for the platforms on this page, and we're always happy to see Nmap expand onto other platforms.

The following sections provide tips for running Nmap on specific platforms.

### FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
The BSD flavors are well supported by Nmap, so you can simply compile it from source as described in [the section called “Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code”](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html "Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code"). This provides the normal advantages of always having the latest version and a flexible build process. If you prefer binary packages, these *BSD variants each maintain their own Nmap packages. Many BSD systems also have a _ports tree_ which standardizes the compilation of popular applications. Instructions for installing Nmap on the most popular *BSD variants follow.

#### OpenBSD Binary Packages and Source Ports Instructions

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
According to the [OpenBSD FAQ](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/), users “are HIGHLY advised to use packages over building an application from ports. The OpenBSD ports team considers packages to be the goal of their porting work, not the ports themselves.” That same FAQ contains detailed instructions for each method. Here is a summary:

Installation using binary packages

1.   Choose a mirror from [`http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html`](http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html), then FTP in and grab the Nmap package from `/pub/OpenBSD/<version>/packages/<platform>/nmap-<version>.tgz`. Or obtain it from the OpenBSD distribution CD-ROM.

2.   As root, execute: **pkg_add -v nmap-_`<version>`_.tgz**

Installation using the source ports tree

1.   If you do not already have a copy of the ports tree, obtain it via CVS using instructions at [`http://openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html`](http://openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html).

2.   As root, execute the following command (replace `/usr/ports` with your local ports directory if it differs):

**cd /usr/ports/net/nmap && make install clean**

#### FreeBSD Binary Package and Source Ports Instructions

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
The FreeBSD project has a whole [chapter](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html) in their Handbook describing the package and port installation processes. A brief summary of the process follows.

##### Installation of the binary package

The easiest way to install the binary Nmap package is to run **pkg_add -r nmap**. You can then run the same command with the `zenmap` argument if you want the X-Window front-end. If you wish to obtain the package manually instead, retrieve it from [`http://freshports.org/security/nmap`](http://freshports.org/security/nmap) and [`http://freshports.org/security/zenmap`](http://freshports.org/security/zenmap) or the CDROM and run **pkg_add _`<packagename.tgz>`_**.

##### Installation using the source ports tree

1.   The ports tree is often installed with the system itself (usually in `/usr/ports`). If you do not already have it, specific installation instructions are provided in the FreeBSD Handbook chapter referenced above.

2.   As root, execute the following command (replace `/usr/ports` with your local ports directory if it differs):

**cd /usr/ports/security/nmap && make install clean**

#### NetBSD Binary Package Instructions

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
NetBSD has packaged Nmap for an enormous number of platforms, from the normal i386 to PlayStation 2, PowerPC, VAX, SPARC, MIPS, Amiga, ARM, and several platforms that I have never even heard of! A list of NetBSD Nmap packages is available from [`ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/nmap/README.html`](ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/net/nmap/README.html) and a description of using their package system to install applications is available at [`http://netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/using.html`](http://netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/using.html).

### Oracle/Sun Solaris

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
Solaris has long been well-supported by Nmap, though we rely heavily on the Nmap community to help keep it that way. We recommend compiling and installing Nmap from source as described in [the section called “Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code”](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html "Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code"). If you have trouble, try sending a report with full details to the _nmap-dev_ mailing list[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html), as described in [the section called “Bugs”](https://nmap.org/book/man-bugs.html "Bugs"). Also let us know if you develop a patch which improves Solaris support so we can incorporate it into Nmap for the benefit of other Solaris users.

### IBM AIX

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
Nmap can be installed from source on IBM AIX by following the instructions in [the section called “Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code”](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html "Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code"). You need only pay attention to a few details.

You must use the **gcc**[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) compiler, not **xlc**. Nmap's configure script will automatically find **gcc** if it is somewhere in the `PATH`[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) environment variable.

Some editions of the default **as**[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) assembler either [crash](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33577) or [produce object files that can't be linked](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46072). This is what's happening if you see compiler output like this:

g++: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault (program as)
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs.html> for instructions.
ld: 0711-596 SEVERE ERROR: Object ../nsock/src/libnsock.a[nsock_core.o]
        An RLD for section 2 (.data) refers to symbol 1794,
        but the storage class of the symbol is not C_EXT or C_HIDEXT.

You can work around this problem by installing the **as** from GNU binutils[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html). (But not **ld**; you want to continue using the default **ld**.) These instructions were tested on AIX 7.1 with `binutils-2.22` from `http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils`.

$ **`bzip2 -dc binutils-2.22.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -`**
$ **`cd binutils-2.22`**
$ **`./configure --disable-werror --disable-largefile CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall"`**
$ **`gmake`**
$ **`cd gas`**
$ **`su`**
# **`gmake install`**

This will install **as** in `/usr/local/bin`. The custom `CFLAGS`[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) omit `-g`,[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) which would otherwise cause one of the **as** errors you are trying to work around. You must make sure that `/usr/local/bin` appears before `/usr/bin` in `PATH`[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) while building and configuring Nmap.

$ **`export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"`**

In some cases GCC is configured to use an absolute path to the assembler. In this case you will have to temporarily move the default assembler out of the way. You can test whether this is the case by passing the `-print-prog-name=as` option to **gcc**:

$ **`gcc -print-prog-name=as`**
/usr/bin/as

If you see the output `/usr/bin/as`, then you must disable the system `as` with a command like **mv /usr/bin/as /usr/bin/as.backup**. If you see the output `as`, then no other changes should be required.

Now follow the instructions in [the section called “Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code”](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html "Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code").

### AmigaOS

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
One of the wonders of open source development is that resources are often directed towards what people find exciting rather than having an exclusive focus on profits as most corporations do. It is along those lines that the Amiga port came about. Diego Casorran[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html) performed most of the work and sent in a clean patch which was integrated into the main Nmap distribution. In general, AmigaOS users should be able to simply follow the source compilation instructions in [the section called “Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code”](https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html "Linux/Unix Compilation and Installation from Source Code"). You may encounter a few hurdles on some systems, but I presume that must be part of the fun for Amiga fanatics.

### Other proprietary UNIX (HP-UX, IRIX, etc.)

[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html)
Nmap has in the past supported many proprietary Unix flavors such as HP-UX and SGI IRIX. We depend heavily on the user community to maintain adequate support for these systems. If you have trouble, try sending a report with full details to the _nmap-dev_ mailing list[](https://nmap.org/book/inst-solaris.html), as described in [the section called “Bugs”](https://nmap.org/book/man-bugs.html "Bugs"). Also let us know if you develop a patch which improves support on your platform so we can incorporate it into Nmap.
