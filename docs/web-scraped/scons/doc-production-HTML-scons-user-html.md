Preface

Thank you for taking the time to read about SCons. SCons is a modern software construction tool - a software utility for building software (or other files) and keeping built software up-to-date whenever the underlying input files change.

The most distinctive thing about SCons is that its configuration files are actually scripts, written in the Python programming language. This is in contrast to most alternative build tools, which typically invent a new language to configure the build. SCons still has a learning curve, of course, because you have to know what functions to call to set up your build properly, but the underlying syntax used should be familiar to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

Paradoxically, using Python as the configuration file format makes SCons easier for non-programmers to learn than the cryptic languages of other build tools, which are usually invented by programmers for other programmers. This is in no small part due to the consistency and readability that are hallmarks of Python. It just so happens that making a real, live scripting language the basis for the configuration files makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers to do more complicated things with builds, as necessary.

1. SCons Principles

There are a few overriding principles the SCons team tries to follow in the design and implementation.

Correctness

First and foremost, by default, SCons guarantees a correct build even if it means sacrificing performance a little. We strive to guarantee the build is correct regardless of how the software being built is structured, how it may have been written, or how unusual the tools are that build it.

Performance

Given that the build is correct, we try to make SCons build software as quickly as possible. In particular, wherever we may have needed to slow down the default SCons behavior to guarantee a correct build, we also try to make it easy to speed up SCons through optimization options that let you trade off guaranteed correctness in all end cases for a speedier build in the usual cases.

Convenience

SCons tries to do as much for you out of the box as reasonable, including detecting the right tools on your system and using them correctly to build the software.

In a nutshell, we try hard to make SCons just "do the right thing" and build software correctly, with a minimum of hassles.

2. How to Use this Guide

This guide intends to coach you how to use SCons effectively and efficiently, by providing a range of examples and usage scenarios. As such it is not exactly a tutorial (as usually those build a single example topic from start to finish), but if you are just starting with SCons it is recommended you step through the first 10 chapters in sequence as this will give a solid grounding in the principles of working with SCons. If you follow that trail, you can feel free to initially skip sections on extending SCons, such as Writing your own Decider Function, and come back to those if the need arises.

The remaining chapters cover more advanced topics that not all build systems will need, and can be used in more of a single-topic way, to read if you find you need that particular information.

If you are viewing an html version of this Guide, there are many hyperlinks present that you can follow to get more details if you want them, as the User Guide intentionally does not attempt to provide every detail, to allow smoother study of the basics. It may also be useful to keep the SCons man page open in a separate browser tab or window to refer to as a complement to this Guide, which can avoid some jumping back and forth. The four important manpage sections describiing the of construction variables, builders, tools and environment methods are actually duplicated as appendices in the User Guide, to avoid inter-document links.

3. A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness

SCons is a volunteer-run open source project. As such, the SCons documentation isn't always completely up-to-date with all the available features - somehow it's almost harder to write high quality, easy to use documentation than it is to implement a feature in software. In other words, there may be a lot that SCons can do that isn't yet covered in this User's Guide.

Although this User's Guide may not be as complete as it could be, the development process does emphasize making sure that the SCons man page is kept up-to-date with new features. So if you're trying to figure out how to do something that SCons supports but can't find enough (or any) information here, it would be worth your while to look at the man page to see if the information is covered there. And if you do, maybe you'd even consider contributing a section to the User's Guide so the next person looking for that information won't have to go through the same thing...?

4. Acknowledgements

SCons would not exist without a lot of help from a lot of people, many of whom may not even be aware that they helped or served as inspiration. So in no particular order, and at the risk of leaving out someone:

First and foremost, SCons owes a tremendous debt to Bob Sidebotham, the original author of the classic Perl-based Cons tool which Bob first released to the world back around 1996. Bob's work on Cons classic provided the underlying architecture and model of specifying a build configuration using a real scripting language. My real-world experience working on Cons informed many of the design decisions in SCons, including the improved parallel build support, making Builder objects easily definable by users, and separating the build engine from the wrapping interface.

Greg Wilson was instrumental in getting SCons started as a real project when he initiated the Software Carpentry design competition in February 2000. Without that nudge, marrying the advantages of the Cons classic architecture with the readability of Python might have just stayed no more than a nice idea.

The entire SCons team have been absolutely wonderful to work with, and SCons would be nowhere near as useful a tool without the energy, enthusiasm and time people have contributed over the past few years. The "core team" of Chad Austin, Anthony Roach, Bill Deegan, Charles Crain, Steve Leblanc, Greg Noel, Gary Oberbrunner, Greg Spencer and Christoph Wiedemann have been great about reviewing my (and other) changes and catching problems before they get in the code base. Of particular technical note: Anthony's outstanding and innovative work on the tasking engine has given SCons a vastly superior parallel build model; Charles has been the master of the crucial Node infrastructure; Christoph's work on the Configure infrastructure has added crucial Autoconf-like functionality; and Greg has provided excellent support for Microsoft Visual Studio.

Special thanks to David Snopek for contributing his underlying "Autoscons" code that formed the basis of Christoph's work with the Configure functionality. David was extremely generous in making this code available to SCons, given that he initially released it under the GPL and SCons is released under a less-restrictive MIT-style license.

Thanks to Peter Miller for his splendid change management system, Aegis, which has provided the SCons project with a robust development methodology from day one, and which showed me how you could integrate incremental regression tests into a practical development cycle (years before eXtreme Programming arrived on the scene).

And last, thanks to Guido van Rossum for his elegant scripting language Python, which is the basis not only for the SCons implementation, but for the interface itself.

5. Contact

The best way to contact people involved with SCons, is through the SCons mailing lists.

If you want to ask general questions about how to use SCons send email to <scons-users@scons.org>.

If you want to contact the SCons development community directly, send email to <scons-dev@scons.org>.

For quicker, informal questions, discussion, etc. the project operated a Discord server at https://discord.gg/bXVpWAy and a Libera.chat IRC channel at https://web.libera.chat/#scons (the former channel at irc.freenode.net is now unused). Certain discussions may also be moved by administrators from mailing list or chat to GitHub Discussions for greater permanence and easier finding.

Chapter 1. Building and Installing SCons

This chapter will take you through the basic steps of installing SCons so you can use it for your projects. Before that, however, this chapter will also describe the basic steps involved in installing Python on your system, in case that is necessary. Fortunately, both SCons and Python are easy to install on almost any system, and Python already comes installed on many systems.

1.1. Installing Python

Because SCons is written in the Python programming language, you need to have a Python interpreter available on your system to use SCons. Before you try to install Python, check to see if Python is already available on your system by typing python -V (capital 'V') or python --version at your system's command-line prompt. For Linux/Unix/MacOS/BSD type systems this looks like:

$ python -V
Python 3.9.15

If you get a version like 2.7.x, you may need to try using the name python3 - current SCons no longer works with Python 2.

Note to Windows users: there are a number of different ways Python can be installed or invoked on Windows, it is beyond the scope of this guide to unravel all of them. Some have an additional program called the Python launcher (described, somewhat technically, in PEP 397): try using the command name py instead of python, if that is not available drop back to trying python

C:\>py -V
Python 3.9.15

If Python is not installed on your system, or is not findable in the current search path, you will see an error message stating something like "command not found" (on UNIX or Linux) or "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file" (on Windows cmd). In that case, you need to either install Python or fix the search path before you can install SCons.

The link for downloading Python installers (Windows and Mac) from the project's own website is: https://www.python.org/download. There are useful system-specific entries on setup and usage to be found at: https://docs.python.org/3/using

For Linux systems, Python is almost certainly available as a supported package, probably installed by default; this is often preferred over installing by other means as the system package will be built with carefully chosen optimizations, and will be kept up to date with bug fixes and security patches. In fact, the Python project itself does not build installers for Linux for this reason. Many such systems have separate packages for Python 2 and Python 3 - make sure the Python 3 package is installed, as the latest SCons requires it. Building from source may still be a useful option if you need a specific version that is not offered by the distribution you are using.

Recent versions of the Mac no longer come with Python pre-installed; older versions came with a rather out-of-date version (based on Python 2.7) which is insufficient to run current SCons. The python.org installer can be used on the Mac, but there are also other sources such as MacPorts and Homebrew. The Anaconda installation also comes with a bundled Python.

Windows has even more choices. The Python.org installer is a traditional .exe style; the same software is also released as a Windows application through the Microsoft Store. Several alternative builds also exist such as Chocolatey and ActiveState, and, again, a version of Python comes with Anaconda.

SCons will work with Python 3.7 or later. If you need to install Python and have a choice, we recommend using the most recent Python version available. Newer Python versions have significant improvements that help speed up the performance of SCons.

1.2. Installing SCons

The recommended way to install SCons is from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

% python -m pip install scons

If you prefer not to install to the Python system location, or do not have privileges to do so, you can add a flag to install to a location specific to your own account and Python version:

% python -m pip install --user scons

For those users using Anaconda or Miniconda, use the conda installer instead, so the scons install location will match the version of Python that system will be using. For example:

% conda install -c conda-forge scons

If you need a specific version of SCons that is different from the current version, pip has a version option (e.g. python -m pip install scons==3.1.2), or you can follow the instructions in the following sections.

SCons does comes pre-packaged for installation on many Linux systems. Check your package installation system to see if there is an up-to-date SCons package available. Many people prefer to install distribution-native packages if available, as they provide a central point for management and updating; however not all distributions update in a timely fashion. During the still-ongoing Python 2 to 3 transition, some distributions may still have two SCons packages available, one which uses Python 2 and one which uses Python 3. Since the latest scons only runs on Python 3, to get the current version you should choose the Python 3 package.

1.3. Using SCons Without Installing

You don't actually need to "install" SCons to use it. Nor do you need to "build" it, unless you are interested in producing the SCons documentation, which does use several tools to produce HTML, PDF and other output formats from files in the source tree. All you need to do is call the scons.py driver script in a location that contains an SCons tree, and it will figure out the rest. You can test that like this:

$ python /path/to/unpacked/scripts/scons.py --version

To make use of an uninstalled SCons, the first step is to download either the scons-4.10.1.tar.gz or scons-4.10.1.zip, which are available from the SCons download page at https://scons.org/pages/download.html. There is also a scons-local bundle you can make use of. It is arranged a little bit differently, with the idea that you can include it with your own project if you want people to be able to do builds without having to download or install SCons. Finally, you can also use a checkout of the git tree from GitHub at a location to point to.

Unpack the archive you downloaded, using a utility like tar on Linux or UNIX, or WinZip on Windows. This will create a directory called scons-4.10.1, usually in your local directory. The driver script will be in a subdirectory named scripts, unless you are using scons-local, in which case it will be in the top directory. Now you only need to call scons.py by giving a full or relative path to it in order to use that SCons version.

Note that instructions for older versions may have suggested running python setup.py install to "build and install" SCons. This is no longer recommended (in fact, it is not recommended by the wider Python packaging community for any end-user installations of Python software). There is a setup.py file, but it is only tested and used for the automated procedure which prepares an SCons bundle for making a release on PyPI, and even that is not guaranteed to work in the future.

1.4. Running Multiple Versions of SCons Side-by-Side

In some cases you may need several versions of SCons present on a system at the same time - perhaps you have an older project to build that has not yet been "ported" to a newer SCons version, or maybe you want to test a new SCons release side-by-side with a previous one before switching over. The use of an "uninstalled" package as described in the previous section can be of use for this purpose.

Another approach to multiple versions is to create Python virtualenvs, and install different SCons versions in each. A Python virtual environment is a directory with an isolated set of Python packages, where packages you install/upgrade/remove inside the environment do not affect anything outside it, and those you install/upgrade/remove outside of it do not affect anything inside it. In other words, anything you do with pip in the environment stays in that environment. The Python standard library provides a module called venv for creating these (https://docs.python.org/e/library/venv.html), although there are also other tools which provide more precise control of the setup.

Using a virtualenv can be useful even for a single version of SCons, to gain the advantages of having an isolated environment. It also gets around the problem of not having administrative privileges on a particular system to install a distribution package or use pip to install to a system location, as the virtualenv is completely under your control.

The following outline shows how this could be set up on a Linux/POSIX system (the syntax will be a bit different on Windows):

$ create virtualenv named scons3
$ create virtualenv named scons4
$ source scons3/bin/activate
$ pip install scons==3.1.2
$ deactivate
$ source scons4/bin/activate
$ pip install scons
$ deactivate
$ activate a virtualenv and run 'scons' to use that version

Chapter 2. Simple Builds

The single most important thing you do when writing a build system for your project is to describe the "what": what you want to build, and which files you want to build it from. And, in fact, simpler builds may need no more. In this chapter, you will see several examples of very simple build configurations using SCons, which will demonstrate how easy SCons makes it to build programs on different types of systems.

2.1. Building Simple C / C++ Programs

Here's the ubiquitous "Hello, World!" program in C:

# include <stdio.h>

int
main()
{
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

And here's how to build it using SCons. Save the code above into hello.c, and enter the following into a file named SConstruct:

Program('hello.c')

This minimal build file gives SCons three key pieces of information: what you want to build (a program); what you want to call that program (its base name will be hello), and the source file you want it built from (the hello.c file). Program is a Builder, an SCons function that you use to instruct SCons about the "what" of your build.

That's it. Now run the scons command to build the program. On a POSIX-compliant system like Linux or UNIX, you'll see something like:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

On a Windows system with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you'll see something like:

C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.

Notice that SCons deduced quite a bit here: it figured out the name of the program to build, including operating system specific suffixes (hello or hello.exe), based off the basename of the source file; it knows an intermediate object file should be built (hello.o or hello.obj); and it knows how to build those things using the compiler that is appropriate on the system you're using. It was not necessary to instruct SCons about any of those details. This is an example of how SCons makes it easy to write portable software builds.

For the programming languages SCons already knows about, it will mostly just figure it out. Here's the "Hello, World!" example in Fortran:

program hello
  print *, 'Hello, World!'
end program hello

Program('hello', 'hello.f90')

$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
gfortran -o hello.o -c hello.f90
gfortran -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

2.2. Building Object Files

The Program builder is only one of many builders (also called a builder method) that SCons provides to build different types of files. Another is the Object builder method, which tells SCons to build an object file from the specified source file:

Object('hello.c')

Now when you run the scons command to build the program, it will build just the hello.o object file on a POSIX system:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
scons: done building targets.

And just the hello.obj object file on a Windows system (with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler):

C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
scons: done building targets.

(Note that this guide will not continue to provide duplicate side-by-side POSIX and Windows output for all of the examples. Just keep in mind that, unless otherwise specified, any of the examples should work equally well on both types of systems.)

2.3. Simple Java Builds

SCons also makes building with Java extremely easy. Unlike the Program and Object builder methods, however, the Java builder method requires that you specify the name of a destination directory in which you want the class files placed, followed by the source directory in which the .java files live:

Java('classes', 'src')

If the src directory contains a single hello.java file, then the output from running the scons command would look something like this (on a POSIX system):

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/hello.java
scons: done building targets.

Java builds will be covered in much more detail, including building a Java archive (.jar) and other types of files, in Chapter 24, Java Builds.

2.4. Cleaning Up After a Build

For cleaning up your build tree, SCons provides a "clean" mode, selected by the -c or --clean option when you invoke SCons. SCons selects the same set of targets it would in build mode, but instead of building, removes them. That means you can control what is cleaned in exactly the same way as you control what gets built. If you build the C example above and then invoke scons -c afterwards, the output on POSIX looks like:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.
% scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
scons: done cleaning targets.

And the output on Windows looks like:

C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.
C:\>scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed hello.obj
Removed hello.exe
scons: done cleaning targets.

Notice that SCons changes its output to tell you that it is Cleaning targets ... and done cleaning targets.

2.5. The SConstruct File

If you're used to build systems like Make you've already figured out that the SConstruct file is the SCons equivalent of a Makefile. That is, the SConstruct file is the input file that SCons reads to control the build.

2.5.1. SConstruct Files Are Python Scripts

There is, however, an important difference between an SConstruct file and a Makefile: the SConstruct file is actually a Python script. If you're not already familiar with Python, don't worry. This User's Guide will introduce you step-by-step to the relatively small amount of Python you'll need to know to be able to use SCons effectively. And Python is very easy to learn.

One aspect of using Python as the scripting language is that you can put comments in your SConstruct file using Python's commenting convention: everything between a # character and the end of the line will be ignored (unless the character appears inside a string constant).

# Arrange to build the "hello" program

Program("hello.c")    # "hello.c" is the source file.
Program("#goodbye.c") # the # in "#goodbye" does not indicate a comment

You'll see throughout the remainder of this Guide that being able to use the power of a real scripting language can greatly simplify the solutions to complex requirements of real-world builds.

2.5.2. SCons Builders Are Order-Independent

One important way in which the SConstruct file is not exactly like a normal Python script, and is more like a Makefile, is that the order in which the SCons Builder functions are called in the SConstruct file does not affect the order in which SCons actually builds the programs and object files you want it to build. [1]. In other words, when you call the Program builder (or any other builder method), you're not telling SCons to build the program at that moment. Instead, you're telling SCons what you want accomplished, and it's up to SCons to figure out how to do that, and to take those steps if/when it's necessary. you'll learn more about how SCons decides when building or rebuilding a target is necessary in Chapter 6, Dependencies, below.

SCons reflects this distinction between calling a builder method like Program and actually building the program by printing the status messages that indicate when it's "just reading" the SConstruct file, and when it's actually building the target files. This is to make it clear when SCons is executing the Python statements that make up the SConstruct file, and when SCons is actually executing the commands or other actions to build the necessary files.

Let's clarify this with an example. Python has a print function that prints a string of characters to the screen. If you put print calls around the calls to the Program builder method:

print("Calling Program('hello.c')")
Program('hello.c')
print("Calling Program('goodbye.c')")
Program('goodbye.c')
print("Finished calling Program()")

Then, when you execute SCons, you will see the output from calling the print function in between the messages about reading the SConscript files, indicating that is when the Python statements are being executed:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Calling Program('hello.c')
Calling Program('goodbye.c')
Finished calling Program()
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

Notice that SCons built the goodbye program first, even though the "reading SConscript" output shows that Program('hello.c') was called first in the SConstruct file.

2.6. Making the SCons Output Less Verbose

You've already seen how SCons prints some messages about what it's doing, surrounding the actual commands used to build the software:

C:\>scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
scons: done building targets.

These messages emphasize the order in which SCons does its work: all of the configuration files (generically referred to as SConscript files) are read and executed first, and only then are the target files built. Among other benefits, these messages help to distinguish between errors that occur while the configuration files are read, and errors that occur while targets are being built.

One drawback, of course, is that these messages clutter the output. Fortunately, they're easily disabled by using the -Q option when invoking SCons:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

So this User's Guide can focus on what SCons is actually doing, the -Q option will be used to remove these messages from the output of all the remaining examples in this Guide.

[1] In programming parlance, the SConstruct file is declarative, meaning you tell SCons what you want done and let it figure out the order in which to do it, rather than strictly imperative, where you specify explicitly the order in which to do things.

Chapter 3. Less Simple Things to Do With Builds

Of course, most builds are more complicated than in the previous chapter. In this chapter, you will learn about builds that incorporate multiple source files, and then about building multiple targets that share some source files.

3.1. Specifying the Name of the Target (Output) File

You've seen that when you call the Program builder method, it builds the resulting program with the same base name as the source file. That is, the following call to build an executable program from the hello.c source file will build an executable program named hello on POSIX systems, and an executable program named hello.exe on Windows systems:

Program('hello.c')

If you want to build a program with a different base name than the base of the source file name (or even the same name), you simply put the target file name to the left of the source file name:

Program('new_hello', 'hello.c')

SCons requires the target file name first, followed by the source file name, so that the order mimics that of an assignment statement in most programming languages, including Python: "target = source files". For an alternative way to supply this information, see Section 3.6, “Keyword Arguments”.

Now SCons will build an executable program named new_hello when run on a POSIX system:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o new_hello hello.o

And SCons will build an executable program named new_hello.exe when run on a Windows system:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:new_hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

3.2. Compiling Multiple Source Files

You've just seen how to configure SCons to compile a program from a single source file. It's more common, of course, that you'll need to build a program from many input source files, not just one. To do this, you need to put the source files in a Python list (enclosed in square brackets), like so:

Program(['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

A build of the above example would look like:

% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o file1.o file2.o

Notice that SCons deduces the output program name from the first source file specified in the list--that is, because the first source file was prog.c, SCons will name the resulting program prog (or prog.exe on a Windows system). If you want to specify a different program name, then (as described in the previous section) you slide the list of source files over to the right to make room for the output program file name. Here is the updated example:

Program('program', ['prog.c', 'file1.c', 'file2.c'])

On Linux, a build of this example would look like:

% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o program prog.o file1.o file2.o

Or on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fofile1.obj /c file1.c /nologo
cl /Fofile2.obj /c file2.c /nologo
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:program.exe prog.obj file1.obj file2.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

3.3. Making a list of files with Glob

You can also use the Glob function to find all files matching a certain template, using the standard shell pattern matching characters * (to match everything), ? (to match a single character) and [abc] to match any of a, b or c. [!abc] is also supported, to match any character except a, b or c. This makes many multi-source-file builds quite easy:

Program('program', Glob('*.c'))

Glob has powerful capabilities - it matches even if the file does not currently exist, but SCons can determine that it would exist after a build. You will meet it again reading about variant directories (see Chapter 15, Separating Source and Build Trees: Variant Directories) and repositories (see Chapter 16, Building From Code Repositories).

3.4. Specifying Single Files Vs. Lists of Files

You've now seen two ways to specify the source for a program, one with a list of files:

Program('hello', ['file1.c', 'file2.c'])

And one with a single file:

Program('hello', 'hello.c')

You can actually put a single file name in a list, too, which you might prefer just for the sake of consistency:

Program('hello', ['hello.c'])

SCons functions will accept a single file name in either form. In fact, internally, SCons treats all input as lists of files, but allows you to omit the square brackets to cut down a little on the typing when there's only a single file name.

Important

Although SCons functions are forgiving about whether or not you use a string vs. a list for a single file name, Python itself is stricter about treating lists and strings differently. So where SCons allows either a string or list:

# The following two calls both work correctly

Program('program1', 'program1.c')
Program('program2', ['program2.c'])

Trying to do "Python things" that mix strings and lists will cause errors or lead to incorrect results:

common_sources = ['file1.c', 'file2.c']

# THE FOLLOWING IS INCORRECT AND GENERATES A PYTHON ERROR

# BECAUSE IT TRIES TO ADD A STRING TO A LIST

Program('program1', common_sources + 'program1.c')

# The following works correctly, because it's adding two

# lists together to make another list

Program('program2', common_sources + ['program2.c'])

3.5. Making Lists of Files Easier to Read

One drawback to the use of a Python list for source files is that each file name must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double quotes). This can get cumbersome and difficult to read when the list of file names is long. Fortunately, SCons and Python provide a number of ways to make sure that the SConstruct file stays easy to read.

To make long lists of file names easier to deal with, SCons provides a Split function that takes a quoted list of file names, with the names separated by spaces or other white-space characters, and turns it into a list of separate file names. Using the Split function turns the previous example into:

Program('program', Split('main.c file1.c file2.c'))

(If you're already familiar with Python, you'll have realized that this is similar to the split() method of Python string objects. Unlike the split() method, however, the Split function does not require a string as input and will wrap up a single non-string object in a list, or return its argument untouched if it's already a list. This comes in handy as a way to make sure arbitrary values can be passed to SCons functions without having to check the type of the variable by hand.)

Putting the call to the Split function inside the Program call can also be a little unwieldy. A more readable alternative is to assign the output from the Split call to a variable name, and then use the variable when calling the Program function:

src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program('program', src_files)

Lastly, the Split function doesn't care how much white space separates the file names in the quoted string. This allows you to create lists of file names that span multiple lines, which often makes for easier editing:

src_files = Split("""
    main.c
    file1.c
    file2.c
""")
Program('program', src_files)

(Note this example uses the Python "triple-quote" syntax, which allows a string to span multiple lines. The three quotes can be either single or double quotes as long as they match.)

3.6. Keyword Arguments

SCons also allows you to identify the output file and input source files using Python keyword arguments target and source. A keyword argument is an argument preceded by an identifier, of the form name=value, in a function call. The usage looks like this example:

src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program(target='program', source=src_files)

Because the keywords explicitly identify what each argument is, the order does not matter and you can reverse it if you prefer:

src_files = Split('main.c file1.c file2.c')
Program(source=src_files, target='program')

Whether or not you choose to use keyword arguments to identify the target and source files, and the order in which you specify them when using keywords, are purely personal choices; SCons functions the same regardless.

3.7. Compiling Multiple Programs

In order to compile multiple programs within the same SConstruct file, simply call the Program method multiple times, once for each program you need to build:

Program('foo.c')
Program('bar', ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

SCons would then build the programs as follows:

% scons -Q
cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

Notice that SCons does not necessarily build the programs in the same order in which you specify them in the SConstruct file. SCons does, however, recognize that the individual object files must be built before the resulting program can be built. (This will be covered in greater detail in Chapter 6, Dependencies, below.)

3.8. Sharing Source Files Between Multiple Programs

It's common to re-use code by sharing source files between multiple programs. One way to do this is to create a library from the common source files, which can then be linked into resulting programs. (Creating libraries is discussed in Chapter 4, Building and Linking with Libraries, below.)

A more straightforward, but perhaps less convenient, way to share source files between multiple programs is simply to include the common files in the lists of source files for each program:

Program(Split('foo.c common1.c common2.c'))
Program('bar', Split('bar1.c bar2.c common1.c common2.c'))

SCons recognizes that the object files for the common1.c and common2.c source files each need to be built only once, even though the resulting object files are each linked in to both of the resulting executable programs:

% scons -Q
cc -o bar1.o -c bar1.c
cc -o bar2.o -c bar2.c
cc -o common1.o -c common1.c
cc -o common2.o -c common2.c
cc -o bar bar1.o bar2.o common1.o common2.o
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o common1.o common2.o

If two or more programs share a lot of common source files, repeating the common files in the list for each program can be a maintenance problem when you need to change the list of common files. You can simplify this by creating a separate Python list to hold the common file names, and concatenating it with other lists using the Python + operator:

common = ['common1.c', 'common2.c']
foo_files = ['foo.c'] + common
bar_files = ['bar1.c', 'bar2.c'] + common
Program('foo', foo_files)
Program('bar', bar_files)

This is functionally equivalent to the previous example.

Chapter 4. Building and Linking with Libraries

It's often useful to organize large software projects by collecting parts of the software into one or more libraries. SCons makes it easy to create libraries and to use them in the programs.

4.1. Building Libraries

You build your own libraries by specifying Library instead of Program:

Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

SCons uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system. So on POSIX or Linux systems, the above example would build as follows (although ranlib may not be called on all systems):

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
ranlib libfoo.a

On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj

The rules for the target name of the library are similar to those for programs: if you don't explicitly specify a target library name, SCons will deduce one from the name of the first source file specified, and SCons will add an appropriate file prefix and suffix if you leave them off.

4.1.1. Building Libraries From Source Code or Object Files

The previous example shows building a library from a list of source files. You can, however, also give the Library call object files, and it will correctly realize they are object files. In fact, you can arbitrarily mix source code files and object files in the source list:

Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.o', 'f3.c', 'f4.o'])

And SCons realizes that only the source code files must be compiled into object files before creating the final library:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o
ranlib libfoo.a

Of course, in this example, the object files must already exist for the build to succeed. See Chapter 5, Node Objects, below, for information about how you can build object files explicitly and include the built files in a library.

4.1.2. Building Static Libraries Explicitly: the StaticLibrary Builder

The Library function builds a traditional static library. If you want to be explicit about the type of library being built, you can use the synonym StaticLibrary function instead of Library:

StaticLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

There is no functional difference between the StaticLibrary and Library functions.

4.1.3. Building Shared (DLL) Libraries: the SharedLibrary Builder

If you want to build a shared library (on POSIX systems) or a DLL file (on Windows systems), you use the SharedLibrary function:

SharedLibrary('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

The output on POSIX:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.os -c f1.c
cc -o f2.os -c f2.c
cc -o f3.os -c f3.c
cc -o libfoo.so -shared f1.os f2.os f3.os

And the output on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
link /nologo /dll /out:foo.dll /implib:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
RegServerFunc(target, source, env)
embedManifestDllCheck(target, source, env)

Notice again that SCons takes care of building the output file correctly, adding the -shared option for a POSIX compilation, and the /dll option on Windows.

4.2. Linking with Libraries

Usually, you build a library because you want to link it with one or more programs. You link libraries with a program by specifying the libraries in the $LIBS construction variable, and by specifying the directory in which the library will be found in the $LIBPATH construction variable:

Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'], LIBPATH='.')

Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library prefix (like lib) or suffix (like .a or .lib). SCons uses the correct prefix or suffix for the current system.

On a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look like:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
ranlib libfoo.a
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo -lbar

On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo
cl /Fof2.obj /c f2.c /nologo
cl /Fof3.obj /c f3.c /nologo
lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib bar.lib prog.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

As usual, notice that SCons has taken care of constructing the correct command lines to link with the specified library on each system.

Note also that, if you only have a single library to link with, you can specify the library name in single string, instead of a Python list, so that:

Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')

is equivalent to:

Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo'], LIBPATH='.')

This is similar to the way that SCons handles either a string or a list to specify a single source file.

4.3. Finding Libraries: the $LIBPATH Construction Variable

By default, the linker will only look in certain system-defined directories for libraries. SCons knows how to look for libraries in directories that you specify with the $LIBPATH construction variable. $LIBPATH consists of a list of directory names, like so:

Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                  LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])

Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable across systems. Alternatively, you could put all of the directory names in a single string, separated by the system-specific path separator character: a colon on POSIX systems:

LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'

or a semi-colon on Windows systems:

LIBPATH = 'C:\\lib;D:\\lib'

(Note that Python requires that the backslash separators in a Windows path name be escaped within strings.)

When the linker is executed, SCons will create appropriate flags so that the linker will look for libraries in the same directories as SCons. So on a POSIX or Linux system, a build of the above example would look like:

% scons -Q
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm

On a Windows system, a build of the above example would look like:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Foprog.obj /c prog.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m.lib prog.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

Note again that SCons has taken care of the system-specific details of creating the right command-line options.

Chapter 5. Node Objects

Internally, SCons represents all of the files and directories it knows about as Nodes. These internal objects (not object files) can be used in a variety of ways to make your SConscript files portable and easy to read.

5.1. Builder Methods Return Lists of Target Nodes

All builder methods return a list of Node objects that identify the target file or files that will be built. These returned Nodes can be passed as arguments to other builder methods.

For example, suppose that we want to build the two object files that make up a program with different options. This would mean calling the Object builder once for each object file, specifying the desired options:

Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')

One way to combine these object files into the resulting program would be to call the Program builder with the names of the object files listed as sources:

Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
Program(['hello.o', 'goodbye.o'])

The problem with specifying the names as strings is that our SConstruct file is no longer portable across operating systems. It won't, for example, work on Windows because the object files there would be named hello.obj and goodbye.obj, not hello.o and goodbye.o.

A better solution is to assign the lists of targets returned by the calls to the Object builder to variables, which we can then concatenate in our call to the Program builder:

hello_list = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-DHELLO')
goodbye_list = Object('goodbye.c', CCFLAGS='-DGOODBYE')
Program(hello_list + goodbye_list)

This makes our SConstruct file portable again, the build output on Linux looking like:

% scons -Q
cc -o goodbye.o -c -DGOODBYE goodbye.c
cc -o hello.o -c -DHELLO hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o goodbye.o

And on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q
cl /Fogoodbye.obj /c goodbye.c -DGOODBYE
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c -DHELLO
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj goodbye.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

We'll see examples of using the list of nodes returned by builder methods throughout the rest of this guide.

5.2. Explicitly Creating File and Directory Nodes

It's worth mentioning here that SCons maintains a clear distinction between Nodes that represent files and Nodes that represent directories. SCons supports File and Dir functions that, respectively, return a file or directory Node:

hello_c = File('hello.c')
Program(hello_c)

classes = Dir('classes')
Java(classes, 'src')

Normally, you don't need to call File or Dir directly, because calling a builder method automatically treats strings as the names of files or directories, and translates them into the Node objects for you. The File and Dir functions can come in handy in situations where you need to explicitly instruct SCons about the type of Node being passed to a builder or other function, or unambiguously refer to a specific file in a directory tree.

There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry in a file system without knowing in advance whether it's a file or a directory. For those situations, SCons also supports an Entry function, which returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.

xyzzy = Entry('xyzzy')

The returned xyzzy Node will be turned into a file or directory Node the first time it is used by a builder method or other function that requires one vs. the other.

5.3. Printing Node File Names

One of the most common things you can do with a Node is use it to print the file name that the node represents. Keep in mind, though, that because the object returned by a builder call is a list of Nodes, you must use Python subscripts to fetch individual Nodes from the list. For example, the following SConstruct file:

object_list = Object('hello.c')
program_list = Program(object_list)
print("The object file is: %s"%object_list[0])
print("The program file is: %s"%program_list[0])

Would print the following file names on a POSIX system:

% scons -Q
The object file is: hello.o
The program file is: hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

And the following file names on a Windows system:

C:\>scons -Q
The object file is: hello.obj
The program file is: hello.exe
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

Note that in the above example, the object_list[0] extracts an actual Node object from the list, and the Python print function converts the object to a string for printing.

5.4. Using a Node's File Name as a String

Printing a Node's name as described in the previous section works because the string representation of a Node object is the name of the file. If you want to do something other than print the name of the file, you can fetch it by using the built-in Python str function. For example, if you want to use the Python os.path.exists to figure out whether a file exists while the SConstruct file is being read and executed, you can fetch the string as follows:

import os.path
program_list = Program('hello.c')
program_name = str(program_list[0])
if not os.path.exists(program_name):
    print("%s does not exist!"%program_name)

Which executes as follows on a POSIX system:

% scons -Q
hello does not exist!
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

5.5. GetBuildPath: Getting the Path From a Node or String

env.GetBuildPath(file_or_list) returns the path of a Node or a string representing a path. It can also take a list of Nodes and/or strings, and returns the list of paths. If passed a single Node, the result is the same as calling str(node) (see above). The string(s) can have embedded construction variables, which are expanded as usual, using the calling environment's set of variables. The paths can be files or directories, and do not have to exist.

env=Environment(VAR="value")
n=File("foo.c")
print(env.GetBuildPath([n, "sub/dir/$VAR"]))

Would print the following file names:

% scons -Q
['foo.c', 'sub/dir/value']
scons: `.' is up to date.

There is also a function version of GetBuildPath which can be called without an Environment; that uses the default SCons Environment to do substitution on any string arguments.

Chapter 6. Dependencies

So far we've seen how SCons handles one-time builds. But one of the main functions of a build tool like SCons is to rebuild only what is necessary when source files change--or, put another way, SCons should not waste time rebuilding things that don't need to be rebuilt. You can see this at work simply by re-invoking SCons after building our simple hello example:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

The second time it is executed, SCons realizes that the hello program is up-to-date with respect to the current hello.c source file, and avoids rebuilding it. You can see this more clearly by naming the hello program explicitly on the command line:

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

Note that SCons reports "...is up to date" only for target files named explicitly on the command line, to avoid cluttering the output.

6.1. Deciding When an Input File Has Changed: the Decider Function

Another aspect of avoiding unnecessary rebuilds is the fundamental build tool behavior of rebuilding things when an input file changes, so that the built software is up to date. By default, SCons keeps track of this through a content signature, or hash, of the contents of each file, although you can easily configure SCons to use the modification times (or time stamps) instead. You can even write your own Python function for deciding if an input file should trigger a rebuild.

6.1.1. Using Content Signatures to Decide if a File Has Changed

By default, SCons uses a cryptographic hash of the file's contents, not the file's modification time, to decide whether a file has changed. This means that you may be surprised by the default SCons behavior if you are used to the Make convention of forcing a rebuild by updating the file's modification time (using the touch command, for example):

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

Even though the file's modification time has changed, SCons realizes that the contents of the hello.c file have not changed, and therefore that the hello program need not be rebuilt. This avoids unnecessary rebuilds when, for example, someone rewrites the contents of a file without making a change. But if the contents of the file really do change, then SCons detects the change and rebuilds the program as required:

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

Note that you can, if you wish, specify the default behavior of using content signatures explicitly, using the Decider function as follows:

Program('hello.c')
Decider('content')

You can also use the string 'MD5' as a synonym for 'content' when calling the Decider function - this older name is deprecated since SCons now supports a choice of hash functions, not just the MD5 function.

6.1.1.1. Ramifications of Using Content Signatures

Using content signatures to decide if an input file has changed has one surprising benefit: if a source file has been changed in such a way that the contents of the rebuilt target file(s) will be exactly the same as the last time the file was built, then any "downstream" target files that depend on the rebuilt-but-not-changed target file actually need not be rebuilt.

So if, for example, a user were to only change a comment in a hello.c file, then the rebuilt hello.o file would be exactly the same as the one previously built (assuming the compiler doesn't put any build-specific information in the object file). SCons would then realize that it would not need to rebuild the hello program as follows:

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%   [CHANGE A COMMENT IN hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
scons: `hello' is up to date.

In essence, SCons "short-circuits" any dependent builds when it realizes that a target file has been rebuilt to exactly the same file as the last build. This does take some extra processing time to read the contents of the target (hello.o) file, but often saves time when the rebuild that was avoided would have been time-consuming and expensive.

6.1.2. Using Time Stamps to Decide If a File Has Changed

If you prefer, you can configure SCons to use the modification time of a file, not the file contents, when deciding if a target needs to be rebuilt. SCons gives you two ways to use time stamps to decide if an input file has changed since the last time a target has been built.

The most familiar way to use time stamps is the way Make does: that is, have SCons decide that a target must be rebuilt if a source file's modification time is newer than the target file. To do this, call the Decider function as follows:

Object('hello.c')
Decider('timestamp-newer')

This makes SCons act like Make when a file's modification time is updated (using the touch command, for example):

% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

And, in fact, because this behavior is the same as the behavior of Make, you can also use the string 'make' as a synonym for 'timestamp-newer' when calling the Decider function:

Object('hello.c')
Decider('make')

One drawback to using times stamps exactly like Make is that if an input file's modification time suddenly becomes older than a target file, the target file will not be rebuilt. This can happen if an old copy of a source file is restored from a backup archive, for example. The contents of the restored file will likely be different than they were the last time a dependent target was built, but the target won't be rebuilt because the modification time of the source file is not newer than the target.

Because SCons actually stores information about the source files' time stamps whenever a target is built, it can handle this situation by checking for an exact match of the source file time stamp, instead of just whether or not the source file is newer than the target file. To do this, specify the argument 'timestamp-match' when calling the Decider function:

Object('hello.c')
Decider('timestamp-match')

When configured this way, SCons will rebuild a target whenever a source file's modification time has changed. So if we use the touch -t option to change the modification time of hello.c to an old date (January 1, 1989), SCons will still rebuild the target file:

% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
% touch -t 198901010000 hello.c
% scons -Q hello.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c

In general, the only reason to prefer timestamp-newer instead of timestamp-match, would be if you have some specific reason to require this Make-like behavior of not rebuilding a target when an otherwise-modified source file is older.

6.1.3. Deciding If a File Has Changed Using Both MD Signatures and Time Stamps

As a performance enhancement, SCons provides a way to use a file's content signature, but to read those contents only when the file's timestamp has changed. To do this, call the Decider function with 'content-timestamp' argument as follows:

Program('hello.c')
Decider('content-timestamp')

So configured, SCons will still behave like it does when using Decider('content'):

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% touch hello.c
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit hello.c
    [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

However, the second call to SCons in the above output, when the build is up-to-date, will have been performed by simply looking at the modification time of the hello.c file, not by opening it and performing a signature calculation on its contents. This can significantly speed up many up-to-date builds.

The only drawback to using Decider('content-timestamp') is that SCons will not rebuild a target file if a source file was modified within one second of the last time SCons built the file. While most developers are programming, this isn't a problem in practice, since it's unlikely that someone will have built and then thought quickly enough to make a substantive change to a source file within one second. Certain build scripts or continuous integration tools may, however, rely on the ability to apply changes to files automatically and then rebuild as quickly as possible, in which case use of Decider('content-timestamp') may not be appropriate.

6.1.4. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Custom Decider Function

The different string values that we've passed to the Decider function are essentially used by SCons to pick one of several specific internal functions that implement various ways of deciding if a dependency (usually a source file) has changed since a target file has been built. As it turns out, you can also supply your own function to decide if a dependency has changed.

For example, suppose we have an input file that contains a lot of data, in some specific regular format, that is used to rebuild a lot of different target files, but each target file really only depends on one particular section of the input file. We'd like to have each target file depend on only its section of the input file. However, since the input file may contain a lot of data, we want to open the input file only if its timestamp has changed. This could be done with a custom Decider function that might look something like this:

Program('hello.c')
def decide_if_changed(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    if dependency.get_timestamp() != prev_ni.timestamp:
        dep = str(dependency)
        tgt = str(target)
        if specific_part_of_file_has_changed(dep, tgt):
            return True
    return False
Decider(decide_if_changed)

Note that in the function definition, the dependency (input file) is the first argument, and then the target. Both of these are passed to the functions as SCons Node objects, which we convert to strings using the Python str().

The third argument, prev_ni, is an object that holds the content signature and/or timestamp information that was recorded about the dependency the last time the target was built. A prev_ni object can hold different information, depending on the type of thing that the dependency argument represents. For normal files, the prev_ni object has the following attributes:

csig

The content signature: a cryptographic hash, or checksum, of the file contents of the dependency file the last time the target was built.

size

The size in bytes of the dependency file the last time the target was built.

timestamp

The modification time of the dependency file the last time the target was built.

These attributes may not be present at the time of the first run. Without any prior build, no targets have been created and no .sconsign DB file exists yet. So you should always check whether the prev_ni attribute in question is available (use the Python hasattr method or a try-except block).

The fourth argument repo_node is the Node to use if it is not None when comparing BuildInfo. This is typically only set when the target node only exists in a Repository

Note that ignoring some of the arguments in your custom Decider function is a perfectly normal thing to do, if they don't impact the way you want to decide if the dependency file has changed.

We finally present a small example for a csig-based decider function. Note how the signature information for the dependency file has to get initialized via get_csig during each function call (this is mandatory!).

env = Environment()

def config_file_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    import os.path

    # We always have to init the .csig value...
    dep_csig = dependency.get_csig()
    # .csig may not exist, because no target was built yet...
    if not prev_ni.hasattr("csig"):
        return True
    # Target file may not exist yet
    if not os.path.exists(str(target.abspath)):
        return True
    if dep_csig != prev_ni.csig:
        # Some change on source file => update installed one
        return True
    return False

def update_file():
    with open("test.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write("some line\n")

update_file()

# Activate our own decider function

env.Decider(config_file_decider)

env.Install("install", "test.txt")

6.1.5. Mixing Different Ways of Deciding If a File Has Changed

The previous examples have all demonstrated calling the global Decider function to configure all dependency decisions that SCons makes. Sometimes, however, you want to be able to configure different decision-making for different targets. When that's necessary, you can use the env.Decider method to affect only the configuration decisions for targets built with a specific construction environment.

For example, if we arbitrarily want to build one program using content signatures and another using file modification times from the same source we might configure it this way:

env1 = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env2 = env1.Clone()
env2.Decider('timestamp-match')
env1.Program('prog-content', 'program1.c')
env2.Program('prog-timestamp', 'program2.c')

If both of the programs include the same inc.h file, then updating the modification time of inc.h (using the touch command) will cause only prog-timestamp to be rebuilt:

% scons -Q
cc -o program1.o -c -I. program1.c
cc -o prog-content program1.o
cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o
% touch inc.h
% scons -Q
cc -o program2.o -c -I. program2.c
cc -o prog-timestamp program2.o

6.2. Implicit Dependencies: The $CPPPATH Construction Variable

Now suppose that our "Hello, World!" program actually has an #include line to include the hello.h file in the compilation:

# include <hello.h>
int
main()
{
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", string);
}

And, for completeness, the hello.h file looks like this:

# define string    "world"

In this case, we want SCons to recognize that, if the contents of the hello.h file change, the hello program must be recompiled. To do this, we need to modify the SConstruct file like so:

Program('hello.c', CPPPATH='.')

The $CPPPATH value tells SCons to look in the current directory ('.') for any files included by C source files (.c or .h files). With this assignment in the SConstruct file:

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

First, notice that SCons constructed the -I. argument from the '.' in the $CPPPATH variable so that the compilation would find the hello.h file in the local directory.

Second, realize that SCons knows that the hello program must be rebuilt because it scans the contents of the hello.c file for the #include lines that indicate another file is being included in the compilation. SCons records these as implicit dependencies of the target file, Consequently, when the hello.h file changes, SCons realizes that the hello.c file includes it, and rebuilds the resulting hello program that depends on both the hello.c and hello.h files.

Like the $LIBPATH variable, the $CPPPATH variable may be a list of directories, or a string separated by the system-specific path separation character (':' on POSIX/Linux, ';' on Windows). Either way, SCons creates the right command-line options so that the following example:

Program('hello.c', CPPPATH = ['include', '/home/project/inc'])

Will look like this on POSIX or Linux:

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c -Iinclude -I/home/project/inc hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

And like this on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q hello.exe
cl /Fohello.obj /c hello.c /nologo /Iinclude /I\home\project\inc
link /nologo /OUT:hello.exe hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

6.3. Caching Implicit Dependencies

Scanning each file for #include lines does take some extra processing time. When you're doing a full build of a large system, the scanning time is usually a very small percentage of the overall time spent on the build. You're most likely to notice the scanning time, however, when you rebuild all or part of a large system: SCons will likely take some extra time to "think about" what must be built before it issues the first build command (or decides that everything is up to date and nothing must be rebuilt).

In practice, having SCons scan files saves time relative to the amount of potential time lost to tracking down subtle problems introduced by incorrect dependencies. Nevertheless, the "waiting time" while SCons scans files can annoy individual developers waiting for their builds to finish. Consequently, SCons lets you cache the implicit dependencies that its scanners find, for use by later builds. You can do this by specifying the --implicit-cache option on the command line:

% scons -Q --implicit-cache hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

If you don't want to specify --implicit-cache on the command line each time, you can make it the default behavior for your build by setting the implicit_cache option in an SConscript file:

SetOption('implicit_cache', 1)

SCons does not cache implicit dependencies like this by default because the --implicit-cache causes SCons to simply use the implicit dependencies stored during the last run, without any checking for whether or not those dependencies are still correct. Specifically, this means --implicit-cache instructs SCons to not rebuild "correctly" in the following cases:

When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will ignore any changes that may have been made to search paths (like $CPPPATH or $LIBPATH). This can lead to SCons not rebuilding a file if a change to $CPPPATH would normally cause a different, same-named file from a different directory to be used.

When --implicit-cache is used, SCons will not detect if a same-named file has been added to a directory that is earlier in the search path than the directory in which the file was found last time.

6.3.1. The --implicit-deps-changed Option

When using cached implicit dependencies, sometimes you want to "start fresh" and have SCons re-scan the files for which it previously cached the dependencies. For example, if you have recently installed a new version of external code that you use for compilation, the external header files will have changed and the previously-cached implicit dependencies will be out-of-date. You can update them by running SCons with the --implicit-deps-changed option:

% scons -Q --implicit-deps-changed hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

In this case, SCons will re-scan all of the implicit dependencies and cache updated copies of the information.

6.3.2. The --implicit-deps-unchanged Option

By default, when caching dependencies, SCons notices when a file has been modified and re-scans the file for any updated implicit dependency information. Sometimes, however, you may want to force SCons to use the cached implicit dependencies, even if the source files changed. This can speed up a build for example, when you have changed your source files but know that you haven't changed any #include lines. In this case, you can use the --implicit-deps-unchanged option:

% scons -Q --implicit-deps-unchanged hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.

In this case, SCons will assume that the cached implicit dependencies are correct and will not bother to re-scan changed files. For typical builds after small, incremental changes to source files, the savings may not be very big, but sometimes every bit of improved performance counts.

6.4. Explicit Dependencies: the Depends Function

Sometimes a file depends on another file that is not detected by an SCons scanner. For this situation, SCons allows you to specific explicitly that one file depends on another file, and must be rebuilt whenever that file changes. This is specified using the Depends method:

hello = Program('hello.c')
Depends(hello, 'other_file')

% scons -Q hello
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit other_file
    [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF other_file]
% scons -Q hello
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o

Note that the dependency (the second argument to Depends) may also be a list of Node objects (for example, as returned by a call to a Builder):

hello = Program('hello.c')
goodbye = Program('goodbye.c')
Depends(hello, goodbye)

in which case the dependency or dependencies will be built before the target(s):

% scons -Q hello
cc -c goodbye.c -o goodbye.o
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -c hello.c -o hello.o
cc -o hello hello.o

6.5. Dependencies From External Files: the ParseDepends Function

SCons has built-in scanners for a number of languages. Sometimes these scanners fail to extract certain implicit dependencies due to limitations of the scanner implementation.

The following example illustrates a case where the built-in C scanner is unable to extract the implicit dependency on a header file.

# define FOO_HEADER <foo.h>
# include FOO_HEADER

int main() {
    return FOO;
}

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%    [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

Apparently, the scanner does not know about the header dependency. Not being a full-fledged C preprocessor, the scanner does not expand the macro.

In these cases, you may also use the compiler to extract the implicit dependencies. ParseDepends can parse the contents of the compiler output in the style of Make, and explicitly establish all of the listed dependencies.

The following example uses ParseDepends to process a compiler generated dependency file which is generated as a side effect during compilation of the object file:

obj = Object('hello.c', CCFLAGS='-MD -MF hello.d', CPPPATH='.')
SideEffect('hello.d', obj)
ParseDepends('hello.d')
Program('hello', obj)

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
%    [CHANGE CONTENTS OF foo.h]
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c

Parsing dependencies from a compiler-generated .d file has a chicken-and-egg problem, that causes unnecessary rebuilds:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `hello.o' because`foo.h' is a new dependency
cc -o hello.o -c -MD -MF hello.d -I. hello.c
% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.

In the first pass, the dependency file is generated while the object file is compiled. At that time, SCons does not know about the dependency on foo.h. In the second pass, the object file is regenerated because foo.h is detected as a new dependency.

ParseDepends immediately reads the specified file at invocation time and just returns if the file does not exist. A dependency file generated during the build process is not automatically parsed again. Hence, the compiler-extracted dependencies are not stored in the signature database during the same build pass. This limitation of ParseDepends leads to unnecessary recompilations. Therefore, ParseDepends should only be used if scanners are not available for the employed language or not powerful enough for the specific task.

6.6. Ignoring Dependencies: the Ignore Function

Sometimes it makes sense to not rebuild a program, even if a dependency file changes. In this case, you would tell SCons specifically to ignore a dependency using the Ignore function as follows:

hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
hello = Program(hello_obj)
Ignore(hello_obj, 'hello.h')

% scons -Q hello
cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% edit hello.h
  [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q hello
scons:`hello' is up to date.

Now, the above example is a little contrived, because it's hard to imagine a real-world situation where you wouldn't want to rebuild hello if the hello.h file changed. A more realistic example might be if the hello program is being built in a directory that is shared between multiple systems that have different copies of the stdio.h include file. In that case, SCons would notice the differences between the different systems' copies of stdio.h and would rebuild hello each time you change systems. You could avoid these rebuilds as follows:

hello = Program('hello.c', CPPPATH=['/usr/include'])
Ignore(hello, '/usr/include/stdio.h')

Ignore can also be used to prevent a generated file from being built by default. This is due to the fact that directories depend on their contents. So to ignore a generated file from the default build, you specify that the directory should ignore the generated file. Note that the file will still be built if the user specifically requests the target on scons command line, or if the file is a dependency of another file which is requested and/or is built by default.

hello_obj=Object('hello.c')
hello = Program(hello_obj)
Ignore('.',[hello,hello_obj])

% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello
scons:`hello' is up to date.

6.7. Order-Only Dependencies: the Requires Function

Occasionally, it may be useful to specify that a certain file or directory must, if necessary, be built or created before some other target is built, but that changes to that file or directory do not require that the target itself be rebuilt. Such a relationship is called an order-only dependency because it only affects the order in which things must be built--the dependency before the target--but it is not a strict dependency relationship because the target should not change in response to changes in the dependent file.

For example, suppose that you want to create a file every time you run a build that identifies the time the build was performed, the version number, etc., and which is included in every program that you build. The version file's contents will change every build. If you specify a normal dependency relationship, then every program that depends on that file would be rebuilt every time you ran SCons. For example, we could use some Python code in a SConstruct file to create a new version.c file with a string containing the current date every time we run SCons, and then link a program with the resulting object file by listing version.c in the sources:

import time

version_c_text = """
char *date = "%s";
""" % time.ctime(time.time())
open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

hello = Program(['hello.c', 'version.c'])

If we list version.c as an actual source file, though, then the version.o file will get rebuilt every time we run SCons (because the SConstruct file itself changes the contents of version.c) and the hello executable will get re-linked every time (because the version.o file changes):

% scons -Q hello
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello hello.o version.o

(Note that for the above example to work, we sleep for one second in between each run, so that the SConstruct file will create a version.c file with a time string that's one second later than the previous run.)

One solution is to use the Requires function to specify that the version.o must be rebuilt before it is used by the link step, but that changes to version.o should not actually cause the hello executable to be re-linked:

import time

version_c_text = """
char *date = "%s";
""" % time.ctime(time.time())
open('version.c', 'w').write(version_c_text)

version_obj = Object('version.c')

hello = Program('hello.c',
                LINKFLAGS = str(version_obj[0]))

Requires(hello, version_obj)

Notice that because we can no longer list version.c as one of the sources for the hello program, we have to find some other way to get it into the link command line. For this example, we're cheating a bit and stuffing the object file name (extracted from version_obj list returned by the Object builder call) into the $LINKFLAGS variable, because $LINKFLAGS is already included in the $LINKCOM command line.

With these changes, we get the desired behavior of only re-linking the hello executable when the hello.c has changed, even though the version.o is rebuilt (because the SConstruct file still changes the version.c contents directly each run):

% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello version.o hello.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% sleep 1
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.c]
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello version.o hello.o
% sleep 1
% scons -Q hello
cc -o version.o -c version.c
scons:`hello' is up to date.

6.8. The AlwaysBuild Function

How SCons handles dependencies can also be affected by the AlwaysBuild method. When a file is passed to the AlwaysBuild method, like so:

hello = Program('hello.c')
AlwaysBuild(hello)

Then the specified target file (hello in our example) will always be considered out-of-date and rebuilt whenever that target file is evaluated while walking the dependency graph:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
cc -o hello hello.o

The AlwaysBuild function has a somewhat misleading name, because it does not actually mean the target file will be rebuilt every single time SCons is invoked. Instead, it means that the target will, in fact, be rebuilt whenever the target file is encountered while evaluating the targets specified on the command line (and their dependencies). So specifying some other target on the command line, a target that does not itself depend on the AlwaysBuild target, will still be rebuilt only if it's out-of-date with respect to its dependencies:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q hello.o
scons: `hello.o' is up to date.

Chapter 7. Environments

An environment is a collection of values that can affect how a program executes. SCons distinguishes between three different types of environments that can affect the behavior of SCons itself (subject to the configuration in the SConscript files), as well as the compilers and other tools it executes:

External Environment

The External Environment is the set of variables in the user's environment at the time the user runs SCons. These variables are not automatically part of an SCons build but are available to be examined if needed. See Section 7.1, “Using Values From the External Environment”, below.

Construction Environment

A Construction Environment is a distinct object created within a SConscript file and which contains values that affect how SCons decides what action to use to build a target, and even to define which targets should be built from which sources. One of the most powerful features of SCons is the ability to create multiple construction environments, including the ability to clone a new, customized construction environment from an existing construction environment. See Section 7.2, “Construction Environments”, below.

Execution Environment

An Execution Environment is the values that SCons sets when executing an external command (such as a compiler or linker) to build one or more targets. Note that this is not the same as the external environment (see above). See Section 7.3, “Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands”, below.

Unlike Make, SCons does not automatically copy or import values between different environments (with the exception of explicit clones of construction environments, which inherit the values from their parent). This is a deliberate design choice to make sure that builds are, by default, repeatable regardless of the values in the user's external environment. This avoids a whole class of problems with builds where a developer's local build works because a custom variable setting causes a different compiler or build option to be used, but the checked-in change breaks the official build because it uses different environment variable settings.

Note that the SConscript writer can easily arrange for variables to be copied or imported between environments, and this is often very useful (or even downright necessary) to make it easy for developers to customize the build in appropriate ways. The point is not that copying variables between different environments is evil and must always be avoided. Instead, it should be up to the implementer of the build system to make conscious choices about how and when to import a variable from one environment to another, making informed decisions about striking the right balance between making the build repeatable on the one hand and convenient to use on the other.

Sidebar: Python Dictionaries

If you're not familiar with the Python programming language, here is a short summary of the Python dictionary data type, or "dict". You may also see the terms mapping, associative array or key-value store used for this type of data structure, which appears in many programming languages.

A dictionary associates keys with values, so asking the dict about a key gives you back the associated value. Values can be retrieved using item access: the key name string in square brackets (mydict["keyname"]). If the key is not present, you get a KeyError exception. Dicts also provide a get() method which returns a default value if the key is not present, so it does not fail in that case. You can specity the default as a second argument to the get call, otherwise it defaults to None.

Assigning to a key creates the association - either a new key/value pair if the key was unknown, or replacing the previous value if the key was already in the dictionary. Initializing a dictionary uses curly braces ({}). Here are some simple examples inspired by those in the official Python tutorial, as you would see them if you typed these to the interactive Python interpreter (>>> is the interpreter prompt):

>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}
>>> tel['guido'] = 4127
>>> tel['jack']
4098
>>> del tel['sape']
>>> tel['irv'] = 4127
>>> print(tel)
{'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}
>>> 'guido' in tel
True
>>> print(tel['jack'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'jack'
>>> print(tel.get('jack'))
None

Construction environments are written to behave like a Python dictionary, and the $ENV construction variable in a construction environment is a Python dictionary. The os.environ value that Python uses to make available the external environment is also a dictionary. We will need these concepts in this chapter and throughout the rest of this guide.

7.1. Using Values From the External Environment

The external environment variable settings that the user has in force when executing SCons are available in the Python os.environ dictionary. That syntax means the environ attribute of the os module. In Python, to access the contents of a module you must first import it - so you would include the import os statement to any SConscript file in which you want to use values from the user's external environment.

import os

print("Shell is", os.environ['SHELL'])

More usefully, you can use the os.environ dictionary in your SConscript files to initialize construction environments with values from the user's external environment. Read on to the next section for information on how to do this.

7.2. Construction Environments

It is rare that all of the software in a large, complicated system needs to be built exactly the same way. For example, different source files may need different options enabled on the command line, or different executable programs need to be linked with different libraries. SCons accommodates these different build requirements by allowing you to create and configure multiple construction environments that control how the software is built. A construction environment is an object that has a number of associated construction variables, each with a name and a value, just like a dictionary. (A construction environment also has an attached set of Builder methods, which you'll learn more about later.)

7.2.1. Creating a Construction Environment: the Environment Function

A construction environment is created by the Environment function:

env = Environment()

SCons initializes every new construction environment with a set of construction variables based on the tools that it finds on your system, plus the default set of builder methods necessary for using those tools. The construction variables are initialized with values describing the C compiler, the Fortran compiler, the linker, etc., as well as the command lines to invoke them.

When you initialize a construction environment you can set the values of the environment's construction variables to control how a program is built. For example:

env = Environment(CC='gcc', CCFLAGS='-O2')
env.Program('foo.c')

The construction environment in this example is still initialized with the same default construction variable values, except that the user has explicitly specified use of the GNU C compiler gcc, and that the -O2 (optimization level two) flag should be used when compiling the object file. In other words, the explicit initialization of $CC and $CCFLAGS overrides the default values in the newly-created construction environment. So a run from this example would look like:

% scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
gcc -o foo foo.o

7.2.2. Fetching Values From a Construction Environment

You can fetch individual values, known as Construction Variables, using the same syntax used for accessing individual named items in a Python dictionary:

env = Environment()
print("CC is: %s" % env['CC'])
print("LATEX is: %s" % env.get('LATEX', None))

This example SConstruct file doesn't contain instructions for building any targets, but because it's still a valid SConstruct it will be evaluated and the Python print calls will output the values of $CC and $LATEX for us (remember from the sidebar that using the get() method for access means we get a default value back, rather than a failure, if the variable is not set):

% scons -Q
CC is: cc
LATEX is: None
scons: `.' is up to date.

A construction environment is actually an object with associated methods and attributes. If you want to have direct access to only the dictionary of construction variables you can fetch this using the env.Dictionary method (although it's rarely necessary to use this method):

env = Environment(FOO='foo', BAR='bar')
cvars = env.Dictionary()
for key in ['OBJSUFFIX', 'LIBSUFFIX', 'PROGSUFFIX']:
    print("key = %s, value = %s" % (key, cvars[key]))

This SConstruct file will print the specified dictionary items for us on POSIX systems as follows:

% scons -Q
key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .o
key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .a
key = PROGSUFFIX, value =
scons: `.' is up to date.

And on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q
key = OBJSUFFIX, value = .obj
key = LIBSUFFIX, value = .lib
key = PROGSUFFIX, value = .exe
scons: `.' is up to date.

If you want to loop and print the values of all of the construction variables in a construction environment, the Python code to do that in sorted order might look something like:

env = Environment()
for item in sorted(env.Dictionary().items()):
    print("construction variable = '%s', value = '%s'" % item)

It should be noted that for the previous example, there is actually a construction environment method that does the same thing more simply, and tries to format the output nicely as well:

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

7.2.3. Expanding Values From a Construction Environment: the subst Method

Another way to get information from a construction environment is to use the subst method on a string containing $ expansions of construction variable names. As a simple example, the example from the previous section that used env['CC'] to fetch the value of $CC could also be written as:

env = Environment()
print("CC is: %s" % env.subst('$CC'))

One advantage of using subst to expand strings is that construction variables in the result get re-expanded until there are no expansions left in the string. So a simple fetch of a value like $CCCOM:

env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DFOO')
print("CCCOM is:", env['CCCOM'])

Will print the unexpanded value of $CCCOM, showing us the construction variables that still need to be expanded:

% scons -Q
CCCOM is: $CC $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
scons: `.' is up to date.

Calling the subst method on $CCOM, however:

env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DFOO')
print("CCCOM is:", env.subst('$CCCOM'))

Will recursively expand all of the construction variables prefixed with $ (dollar signs), showing us the final output:

% scons -Q
CCCOM is: gcc -DFOO -c -o
scons: `.' is up to date.

Note that because we're not expanding this in the context of building something there are no target or source files for $TARGET and $SOURCES to expand.

7.2.4. Handling Problems With Value Expansion (advanced topic)

If a problem occurs when expanding a construction variable, by default it is expanded to an empty string, that is, "replaced with nothing" - scons will not fail for unknown variables.

env = Environment()
print("value is:", env.subst('->$MISSING<-'))

% scons -Q
value is: -><-
scons: `.' is up to date.

Sometimes this behavior leads to surprises while the build configuration is being developed, for example a typo in a variable name isn't reported, and the variable expression is just dropped (empty string). SCons provides a AllowSubstExceptions function to allow the behavior to be tuned. Internally, when a problem occurs with a variable expansion, it generates an exception, but before letting that exception kill the build, scons checks a list of exceptions to ignore - by default NameError and IndexError. You can call AllowSubstExceptions to set the list of ignored exceptions to anything you wish, including none at all. That way, when a variable fails to expand that you thought should be expanding to something, the build will stop and you'll get an error message that should help diagnose the problem. You give AllowSubstExceptions as many exception name arguments as you wish it to ignore, or call it with no arguments to have all expansion exceptions propagate and stop scons.

AllowSubstExceptions()
env = Environment()
print("value is:", env.subst('->$MISSING<-'))

% scons -Q

scons: *** NameError `name 'MISSING' is not defined' trying to evaluate`$MISSING'
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 3, in <module>

This can also be used to allow other exceptions that might occur, most usefully with the ${...} construction variable syntax. For example, this would allow zero-division to occur in a variable expansion in addition to the default exceptions allowed

AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)
env = Environment()
print("value is:",  env.subst('->${1 / 0}<-'))

% scons -Q
value is: -><-
scons: `.' is up to date.

If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call completely overwrites the previous list of allowed exceptions.

7.2.5. Controlling the Default Construction Environment: the DefaultEnvironment Function

All of the Builder functions that we've introduced so far, like Program and Library, use a construction environment that contains settings for the various compilers and other tools that SCons configures by default, or otherwise knows about and has discovered on your system. If not invoked as methods of a specific construction environment, they use the default construction environment The goal of the default construction environment is to make many configurations "just work" to build software using readily available tools with a minimum of configuration changes.

If needed, you can control the default construction environment by using the DefaultEnvironment function to initialize various settings by passing them as keyword arguments:

DefaultEnvironment(CC='/usr/local/bin/gcc')

When configured as above, all calls to the Program or Object Builder will build object files with the /usr/local/bin/gcc compiler.

The DefaultEnvironment function returns the initialized default construction environment object, which can then be manipulated like any other construction environment (note that the default environment works like a singleton - it can have only one instance - so the keyword arguments are processed only on the first call. On any subsequent call the existing object is returned). So the following would be equivalent to the previous example, setting the $CC variable to /usr/local/bin/gcc but as a separate step after the default construction environment has been initialized:

def_env = DefaultEnvironment()
def_env['CC'] = '/usr/local/bin/gcc'

One very common use of the DefaultEnvironment function is to speed up SCons initialization. As part of trying to make most default configurations "just work," SCons will actually search the local system for installed compilers and other utilities. This search can take time, especially on systems with slow or networked file systems. If you know which compiler(s) and/or other utilities you want to configure, you can control the search that SCons performs by specifying some specific tool modules with which to initialize the default construction environment:

def_env = DefaultEnvironment(tools=['gcc', 'gnulink'], CC='/usr/local/bin/gcc')

So the above example would tell SCons to explicitly configure the default environment to use its normal GNU Compiler and GNU Linker settings (without having to search for them, or any other utilities for that matter), and specifically to use the compiler found at /usr/local/bin/gcc.

7.2.6. Multiple Construction Environments

The real advantage of construction environments is that you can create as many different ones as you need, each tailored to a different way to build some piece of software or other file. If, for example, we need to build one program with the -O2 flag and another with the -g (debug) flag, we would do this like so:

opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

dbg.Program('bar', 'bar.c')

% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -g bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o
cc -o foo.o -c -O2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

We can even use multiple construction environments to build multiple versions of a single program. If you do this by simply trying to use the Program builder with both environments, though, like this:

opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

opt.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

dbg.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

Then SCons generates the following error:

% scons -Q

scons: *** Two environments with different actions were specified for the same target: foo.o
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 6, in <module>

This is because the two Program calls have each implicitly told SCons to generate an object file named foo.o, one with a $CCFLAGS value of -O2 and one with a $CCFLAGS value of -g. SCons can't just decide that one of them should take precedence over the other, so it generates the error. To avoid this problem, we must explicitly specify that each environment compile foo.c to a separately-named object file using the Object builder, like so:

opt = Environment(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')

o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
opt.Program(o)

d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
dbg.Program(d)

Notice that each call to the Object builder returns a value, an internal SCons object that represents the object file that will be built. We then use that object as input to the Program builder. This avoids having to specify explicitly the object file name in multiple places, and makes for a compact, readable SConstruct file. Our SCons output then looks like:

% scons -Q
cc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
cc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
cc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
cc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o

7.2.7. Making Copies of Construction Environments: the Clone Method

Sometimes you want more than one construction environment to share the same values for one or more variables. Rather than always having to repeat all of the common variables when you create each construction environment, you can use the env.Clone method to create a copy of a construction environment.

Like the Environment call that creates a construction environment, the Clone method takes construction variable assignments, which will override the values in the copied construction environment. For example, suppose we want to use gcc to create three versions of a program, one optimized, one debug, and one with neither. We could do this by creating a "base" construction environment that sets $CC to gcc, and then creating two copies, one which sets $CCFLAGS for optimization and the other which sets $CCFLAGS for debugging:

env = Environment(CC='gcc')
opt = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-O2')
dbg = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

o = opt.Object('foo-opt', 'foo.c')
opt.Program(o)

d = dbg.Object('foo-dbg', 'foo.c')
dbg.Program(d)

Then our output would look like:

% scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
gcc -o foo foo.o
gcc -o foo-dbg.o -c -g foo.c
gcc -o foo-dbg foo-dbg.o
gcc -o foo-opt.o -c -O2 foo.c
gcc -o foo-opt foo-opt.o

7.2.8. Replacing Values: the Replace Method

You can replace existing construction variable values using the env.Replace method:

env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE1')
env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE2')
env.Program('foo.c')

The new value (-DDEFINE2 in the above example) replaces the value in the construction environment - it's like a Python assignment statement for construction variables.

% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

You can safely call Replace for construction variables that don't exist in the construction environment

env = Environment()
env.Replace(NEW_VARIABLE='xyzzy')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s" % env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

In this case, the construction variable simply gets added to the construction environment.

% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = xyzzy
scons: `.' is up to date.

If you have a lot of variables to replace, it may be more convenient to put them in a dictionary and pass that to the Replace method. That might look like:

newvalues = {
    "F77PATH": ['foo', '$FOO/bar', blat],
    "INCPREFIX": 'foo ',
    "INCSUFFIX": 'bar',
    "FOO": 'baz',
}
env.Replace(**newvalues)

Because the variables aren't expanded until the construction environment is actually used to build the targets, and because SCons function and method calls are order-independent, the last replacement "wins" and is used to build all targets, regardless of the order in which the calls to Replace() are interspersed with calls to builder methods:

env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE1')
print("CCFLAGS = %s" % env['CCFLAGS'])
env.Program('foo.c')

env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-DDEFINE2')
print("CCFLAGS = %s" % env['CCFLAGS'])
env.Program('bar.c')

The timing of when the replacement actually occurs relative to when the targets get built becomes apparent if we run scons without the -Q option:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE1
CCFLAGS = -DDEFINE2
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o bar.o -c -DDEFINE2 bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DDEFINE2 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
scons: done building targets.

Because the replacement occurs while the SConscript files are being read, the $CCFLAGS variable has already been set to -DDEFINE2 by the time the foo.o target is built, even though the call to the Replace method does not occur until later in the SConscript file.

7.2.9. Setting Values Only If They're Not Already Defined: the SetDefault Method

Sometimes it's useful to be able to specify that a construction variable should be set to a value only if the construction environment does not already have that variable defined You can do this with the env.SetDefault method, which behaves similarly to the setdefault method of Python dictionary objects:

env.SetDefault(SPECIAL_FLAG='-extra-option')

This is especially useful when writing your own Tool modules to apply variables to construction environments.

7.2.10. Appending to the End of Values: the Append Method

You can append a value to an existing construction variable using the env.Append method:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['MY_VALUE'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=['LAST'])
env.Program('foo.c')

Note $CPPDEFINES is the preferred way to set preprocessor defines, as SCons will generate the command line arguments using the correct prefix/suffix for the platform, leaving the usage portable. If you use $CCFLAGS and $SHCCFLAGS, you need to include them in their final form, which is less portable.

% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DMY_VALUE -DLAST foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Append method will create it:

env = Environment()
env.Append(NEW_VARIABLE = 'added')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s"%env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

Which yields:

% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = added
scons: `.' is up to date.

Note that the Append function tries to be "smart" about how the new value is appended to the old value. If both are strings, the previous and new strings are simply concatenated. Similarly, if both are lists, the lists are concatenated. If, however, one is a string and the other is a list, the string is added as a new element to the list.

7.2.11. Appending Unique Values: the AppendUnique Method

Sometimes it's useful to add a new value only if the existing construction variable doesn't already contain the value. This can be done using the env.AppendUnique method:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS variable does not already contain a -g value.

7.2.12. Prepending to the Beginning of Values: the Prepend Method

You can prepend a value to the beginning of an existing construction variable using the env.Prepend method:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['MY_VALUE'])
env.Prepend(CPPDEFINES=['FIRST'])
env.Program('foo.c')

SCons then generates the preprocessor define arguments from CPPDEFINES values with the correct prefix/suffix. For example on Linux or POSIX, the following arguments would be generated: -DFIRST and -DMY_VALUE

% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c -DFIRST -DMY_VALUE foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

If the construction variable doesn't already exist, the Prepend method will create it:

env = Environment()
env.Prepend(NEW_VARIABLE='added')
print("NEW_VARIABLE = %s" % env['NEW_VARIABLE'])

Which yields:

% scons -Q
NEW_VARIABLE = added
scons: `.' is up to date.

Like the Append function, the Prepend function tries to be "smart" about how the new value is appended to the old value. If both are strings, the previous and new strings are simply concatenated. Similarly, if both are lists, the lists are concatenated. If, however, one is a string and the other is a list, the string is added as a new element to the list.

7.2.13. Prepending Unique Values: the PrependUnique Method

Sometimes it's useful to add a new value to the beginning of a construction variable only if the existing value doesn't already contain the to-be-added value. This can be done using the env.PrependUnique method:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS=['-g'])

In the above example, the -g would be added only if the $CCFLAGS variable does not already contain a -g value.

7.2.14. Overriding Construction Variable Settings

Rather than creating a cloned construction environment for specific tasks, you can override or add construction variables when calling a builder method by passing them as keyword arguments. The values of these overridden or added variables will only be in effect when building that target, and will not affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to add additional libraries for just one program:

env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:

env.SharedLibrary(
    target='word',
    source='word.cpp',
    SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
    LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
)

When overriding this way, the Python keyword arguments in the builder call mean "set to this value". If you want your override to augment an existing value, you have to take some extra steps. Inside the builder call, it is possible to substitute in the existing value by using a string containing the variable name prefaced by a dollar sign ($).

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
env.Object(target="foo1.o", source="foo.c")
env.Object(target="foo2.o", source="foo.c", CPPDEFINES="BAR")
env.Object(target="foo3.o", source="foo.c", CPPDEFINES=["BAR", "$CPPDEFINES"])

Which yields:

% scons -Q
cc -o foo1.o -c -DFOO foo.c
cc -o foo2.o -c -DBAR foo.c
cc -o foo3.o -c -DBAR -DFOO foo.c

It is also possible to use the parse_flags keyword argument in an override to merge command-line style arguments into the appropriate construction variables. This works like the env.MergeFlags method, which will be fully described in the next chapter.

This example adds 'include' to $CPPPATH, 'EBUG' to $CPPDEFINES, and 'm' to $LIBS:

env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

So when executed:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -DEBUG -Iinclude hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o -lm

Using temporary overrides this way is lighter weight than making a full construction environment, so it can help performance in large projects which have lots of special case values to set. However, keep in mind that this only works well when the targets are unique. Using builder overrides to try to build the same target with different sets of flags or other construction variables will lead to the scons: *** Two environments with different actions... error described in Section 7.2.6, “Multiple Construction Environments” above. In this case you will actually want to create separate environments.

7.3. Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands

When SCons builds a target file, it does not execute the commands with the external environment that you used to execute SCons. Instead, it builds an execution environment from the values stored in the $ENV construction variable and uses that for executing commands.

The most important ramification of this behavior is that the PATH environment variable, which controls where the operating system will look for commands and utilities, will almost certainly not be the same as in the external environment from which you called SCons. This means that SCons might not necessarily find all of the tools that you can successfully execute from the command line.

The default value of the PATH environment variable on a POSIX system is /usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/snap/bin. The default value of the PATH environment variable on a Windows system comes from the Windows registry value for the command interpreter. If you want to execute any commands--compilers, linkers, etc.--that are not in these default locations, you need to set the PATH value in the $ENV dictionary in your construction environment.

The simplest way to do this is to initialize explicitly the value when you create the construction environment; this is one way to do that:

path = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': path})

Assigning a dictionary to the $ENV construction variable in this way completely resets the execution environment, so that the only variable that will be set when external commands are executed will be the PATH value. If you want to use the rest of the values in $ENV and only set the value of PATH, you can assign a value only to that variable:

env['ENV']['PATH'] = ['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin']

Note that SCons does allow you to define the directories in the PATH in a string with paths separated by the pathname separator character for your system (':' on POSIX systems, ';' on Windows).

env['ENV']['PATH'] = '/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin'

But doing so makes your SConscript file less portable, since it will be correct only for the system type that matches the separator. You can use the Python os.pathsep for for greater portability - don't worry too much if this Python syntax doesn't make sense since there are other ways available:

import os
env['ENV']['PATH'] = os.pathsep.join(['/usr/local/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin'])

7.3.1. Propagating PATH From the External Environment

You may want to propagate the external environment PATH to the execution environment for commands. You do this by initializing the PATH variable with the PATH value from the os.environ dictionary, which is Python's way of letting you get at the external environment:

import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

Alternatively, you may find it easier to just propagate the entire external environment to the execution environment for commands. This is simpler to code than explicity selecting the PATH value:

import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

Either of these will guarantee that SCons will be able to execute any command that you can execute from the command line. The drawback is that the build can behave differently if it's run by people with different PATH values in their environment--for example, if both the /bin and /usr/local/bin directories have different cc commands, then which one will be used to compile programs will depend on which directory is listed first in the user's PATH variable.

7.3.2. Adding to PATH Values in the Execution Environment

One of the most common requirements for manipulating a variable in the execution environment is to add one or more custom directories to a path search variable like PATH on Linux or POSIX systems, or %PATH% on Windows, so that a locally-installed compiler or other utility can be found when SCons tries to execute it to update a target. SCons provides env.PrependENVPath and env.AppendENVPath functions to make adding things to execution variables convenient. You call these functions by specifying the variable to which you want the value added, and then value itself. So to add some /usr/local directories to the $PATH and $LIB variables, you might:

env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())
env.PrependENVPath('PATH', '/usr/local/bin')
env.AppendENVPath('LIB', '/usr/local/lib')

Note that the added values are strings, and if you want to add multiple directories to a variable like $PATH, you must include the path separator character in the string (: on Linux or POSIX, ; on Windows, or use os.pathsep for portability).

7.4. Using the toolpath for external Tools
7.4.1. The default tool search path

Normally when using a tool from the construction environment, several different search locations are checked by default. This includes the SCons/Tools/ directory that is part of the scons distribution and the directory site_scons/site_tools relative to the root SConstruct file.

# Built-in tool or tool located within site_tools

env = Environment(tools=['SomeTool'])
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# The search locations would include by default

SCons/Tool/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.2. Providing an external directory to toolpath

In some cases you may want to specify a different location to search for tools. The Environment function contains an option for this called toolpath This can be used to add additional search directories.

# Tool located within the toolpath directory option

env = Environment(
    tools=['SomeTool'],
    toolpath=['/opt/SomeToolPath', '/opt/SomeToolPath2']
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# The search locations in this example would include

/opt/SomeToolPath/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath/SomeTool/__init__.py
/opt/SomeToolPath2/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath2/SomeTool/__init__.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.3. Nested Tools within a toolpath (advanced topic)

Since SCons 3.0, a Builder may be located within a subdirectory / sub-package of the toolpath. This is similar to namespacing within Python. With nested or namespaced tools we can use the dot notation to specify a subdirectory that the tool is located under.

# namespaced target

env = Environment(
    tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=['/opt/SomeToolPath']
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

# With this example the search locations would include

/opt/SomeToolPath/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
/opt/SomeToolPath/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py
SCons/Tool/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
SCons/Tool/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool.py
./site_scons/site_tools/SubDir1/SubDir2/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.4. Using sys.path within the toolpath

If we want to access tools external to scons which are findable via sys.path (for example, tools installed via Python's pip package manager), it is possible to use sys.path with the toolpath. One thing to watch out for with this approach is that sys.path can sometimes contains paths to .egg files instead of directories. So we need to filter those out with this approach.

# namespaced target using sys.path within toolpath

searchpaths = []
for item in sys.path:
    if os.path.isdir(item):
        searchpaths.append(item)

env = Environment(
    tools=['someinstalledpackage.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=searchpaths
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

By using sys.path with the toolpath argument and by using the nested syntax we can have scons search packages installed via pip for Tools.

# For Windows based on the Python version and install directory, this may be something like

C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages\someinstalledpackage\SomeTool.py
C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages\someinstalledpackage\SomeTool\__init__.py

# For Linux this could be something like

/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/someinstalledpackage/SomeTool.py
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/someinstalledpackage/SomeTool/__init__.py

7.4.5. Using the PyPackageDir function to add to the toolpath

In some cases you may want to use a tool located within an installed external pip package. This is possible by the use of sys.path with the toolpath. However, in that situation you need to provide a prefix to the toolname to indicate where it is located within sys.path.

searchpaths = []
for item in sys.path:
    if os.path.isdir(item):
        searchpaths.append(item)
env = Environment(
    tools=['tools_example.subdir1.subdir2.SomeTool'],
    toolpath=searchpaths
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

To avoid the use of a prefix within the name of the tool or filtering sys.path for directories, we can use PyPackageDir function to locate the directory of the Python package. PyPackageDir returns a Dir object which represents the path of the directory for the Python package / module specified as a parameter.

# namespaced target using sys.path

env = Environment(
    tools=['SomeTool'],
    toolpath=[PyPackageDir('tools_example.subdir1.subdir2')]
)
env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

Chapter 8. Automatically Putting Command-line Options into their Construction Variables

This chapter describes the MergeFlags, ParseFlags, and ParseConfig methods of a construction environment, as well as the parse_flags keyword argument to methods that construct environments.

8.1. Merging Options into the Environment: the MergeFlags Function

SCons construction environments have a MergeFlags method that merges values from a passed-in argument into the construction environment. If the argument is a dictionary, MergeFlags treats each value in the dictionary as a list of options you would pass to a command (such as a compiler or linker). MergeFlags will not duplicate an option if it already exists in the construction variable. If the argument is a string, MergeFlags calls the ParseFlags method to burst it out into a dictionary first, then acts on the result.

MergeFlags tries to be intelligent about merging options, knowing that different construction variables may have different needs. When merging options to any variable whose name ends in PATH, MergeFlags keeps the leftmost occurrence of the option, because in typical lists of directory paths, the first occurrence "wins." When merging options to any other variable name, MergeFlags keeps the rightmost occurrence of the option, because in a list of typical command-line options, the last occurrence "wins."

env = Environment()
env.Append(CCFLAGS='-option -O3 -O1')
flags = {'CCFLAGS': '-whatever -O3'}
env.MergeFlags(flags)
print("CCFLAGS:", env['CCFLAGS'])

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS: ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
scons: `.' is up to date.

Note that the default value for $CCFLAGS is an internal SCons object which automatically converts the options you specify as a string into a list.

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPPATH=['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
flags = {'CPPPATH': ['/usr/opt/include', '/usr/local/include']}
env.MergeFlags(flags)
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

Note that the default value for $CPPPATH is a normal Python list, so you should give its values as a list in the dictionary you pass to the MergeFlags function.

If MergeFlags is passed anything other than a dictionary, it calls the ParseFlags method to convert it into a dictionary.

env = Environment()
env.Append(CCFLAGS='-option -O3 -O1')
env.Append(CPPPATH=['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include'])
env.MergeFlags('-whatever -I/usr/opt/include -O3 -I/usr/local/include')
print("CCFLAGS:", env['CCFLAGS'])
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS: ['-option', '-O1', '-whatever', '-O3']
CPPPATH: ['/include', '/usr/local/include', '/usr/include', '/usr/opt/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

In the combined example above, ParseFlags has sorted the options into their corresponding variables and returned a dictionary for MergeFlags to apply to the construction variables in the specified construction environment.

8.2. Merging Options While Creating Environment: the parse_flags Parameter

It is also possible to merge construction variable values from arguments given to the Environment call itself. If the parse_flags keyword argument is given, its value is distributed to construction variables in the new environment in the same way as described for the MergeFlags method. This also works when calling env.Clone, as well as in overrides to builder methods (see Section 7.2.14, “Overriding Construction Variable Settings”).

env = Environment(parse_flags="-I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo")
for k in ('CPPPATH', 'LIBPATH', 'LIBS'):
    print("%s:" % k, env.get(k))
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH: ['/opt/lib']
LIBS: ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

8.3. Separating Compile Arguments into their Variables: the ParseFlags Function

SCons has a bewildering array of construction variables for different types of options when building programs. Sometimes you may not know exactly which variable should be used for a particular option.

SCons construction environments have a ParseFlags method that takes a set of typical command-line options and distributes them into the appropriate construction variables Historically, it was created to support the ParseConfig method, so it focuses on options used by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for the C and C++ toolchains.

ParseFlags returns a dictionary containing the options distributed into their respective construction variables. Normally, this dictionary would then be passed to MergeFlags to merge the options into a construction environment, but the dictionary can be edited if desired to provide additional functionality. (Note that if the flags are not going to be edited, calling MergeFlags with the options directly will avoid an additional step.)

env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags("-I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lfoo")
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

Note that if the options are limited to generic types like those above, they will be correctly translated for other platform types:

C:\>scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cl /Fof1.obj /c f1.c /nologo /I\opt\include
link /nologo /OUT:f1.exe /LIBPATH:\opt\lib foo.lib f1.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

Since the assumption is that the flags are used for the GCC toolchain, unrecognized flags are placed in $CCFLAGS so they will be used for both C and C++ compiles:

env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags("-whatever")
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CCFLAGS -whatever
cc -o f1.o -c -whatever f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o

ParseFlags will also accept a (recursive) list of strings as input; the list is flattened before the strings are processed:

env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags(["-I/opt/include", ["-L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"]])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

If a string begins with an exclamation mark (!), the string is passed to the shell for execution. The output of the command is then parsed:

env = Environment()
d = env.ParseFlags(["!echo -I/opt/include", "!echo -L/opt/lib", "-lfoo"])
for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
    if v:
        print(k, v)
env.MergeFlags(d)
env.Program("f1.c")

% scons -Q
CPPPATH ['/opt/include']
LIBPATH ['/opt/lib']
LIBS ['foo']
cc -o f1.o -c -I/opt/include f1.c
cc -o f1 f1.o -L/opt/lib -lfoo

ParseFlags is regularly updated for new options; consult the man page for details about those currently recognized.

8.4. Finding Installed Library Information: the ParseConfig Function

Configuring the right options to build programs to work with libraries--especially shared libraries--that are available on POSIX systems can be complex. To help this situation, various utilities with names that end in config return the command-line options for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) that are needed to build and link against those libraries; for example, the command-line options to use a library named lib could be found by calling a utility named lib-config.

A more recent convention is that these options are available through the generic pkg-config program, providing a common framework, error handling, and the like, so that all the package creator has to do is provide the set of strings for his particular package.

SCons construction environments have a ParseConfig method that asks the host system to execute a command and then configures the appropriate construction variables based on the output of that command. This lets you run a program like pkg-config or a more specific utility to help set up your build.

env = Environment()
env['CPPPATH'] = ['/lib/compat']
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
print("CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

SCons will execute the specified command string, parse the resultant flags, and add the flags to the appropriate environment variables.

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/lib/compat', '/usr/X11/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

In the example above, SCons has added the include directory to $CPPPATH (depending on what other flags are emitted by the pkg-config command, other variables may have been extended as well.)

Note that the options are merged with existing options using the MergeFlags method, so that each option only occurs once in the construction variable.

env = Environment()
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
env.ParseConfig("pkg-config x11 --cflags --libs")
print("CPPPATH:", "CPPPATH:", env['CPPPATH'])

% scons -Q
CPPPATH: ['/usr/X11/include']
scons: `.' is up to date.

Chapter 9. Controlling Build Output

A key aspect of creating a usable build configuration is providing useful output from the build, so its users can readily understand what the build is doing and get information about how to control the build. SCons provides several ways of controlling output from the build configuration to help make the build more useful and understandable.

9.1. Providing Build Help: the Help Function

It's often very useful to be able to give users some help that describes the specific targets, build options, etc., that can be used for your build. SCons provides the Help function to allow you to specify this help text:

Help("""
Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.
""")

Optionally, you can specify the append flag:

Help("""
Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.
""", append=True)

(Note the above use of the Python triple-quote syntax, which comes in very handy for specifying multi-line strings like help text.)

When the SConstruct or SConscript files contain a call to the Help function, the specified help text will be displayed in response to the SCons -h option:

% scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program,
      'scons debug' to build the debug version.

Use scons -H for help about SCons built-in command-line options.

The SConscript files may contain multiple calls to the Help function, in which case the specified text(s) will be concatenated when displayed. This allows you to define fragments of help text together with the corresponding feature, even if spread across multiple SConscript files. In this situation, the order in which the SConscript files are called will determine the order in which the Help functions are called, which will determine the order in which the various bits of text will get concatenated.

Calling Help("text") overwrites the help text that otherwise would be collected from any command-line options defined in AddOption calls. To preserve the AddOption help text, add the append=True keyword argument when calling Help. This also preserves the option help for the scons command itself. To preserve only the AddOption help, also add the local_only=True keyword argument. (This only matters the first time you call Append, on any subsequent calls the text you passed is added to the existing help text).

Another use would be to make the help text conditional on some variable. For example, suppose you only want to display a line about building a Windows-only version of a program when actually run on Windows. The following SConstruct file:

env = Environment()

Help("\nType: 'scons program' to build the production program.\n")

if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32':
    Help("\nType: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.\n")

Will display the complete help text on Windows:

C:\>scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

Type: 'scons windebug' to build the Windows debug version.

Use scons -H for help about SCons built-in command-line options.

But only show the relevant option on a Linux or UNIX system:

% scons -h
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.

Type: 'scons program' to build the production program.

Use scons -H for help about SCons built-in command-line options.

If there is no Help text in the SConstruct or SConscript files, SCons will revert to displaying its standard list that describes the SCons command-line options. This list is also always displayed whenever the -H option is used.

9.2. Controlling How SCons Prints Build Commands: the $*COMSTR Variables

Sometimes the commands executed to compile object files or link programs (or build other targets) can get very long, long enough to make it difficult for users to distinguish error messages or other important build output from the commands themselves. All of the default $*COM variables that specify the command lines used to build various types of target files have a corresponding $*COMSTR variable that can be set to an alternative string that will be displayed when the target is built.

For example, suppose you want to have SCons display a "Compiling" message whenever it's compiling an object file, and a "Linking" when it's linking an executable. You could write a SConstruct file that looks like:

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling $TARGET",
                  LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")
env.Program('foo.c')

Which would then yield the output:

% scons -Q
Compiling foo.o
Linking foo

SCons performs complete variable substitution on $*COMSTR variables, so they have access to all of the standard variables like $TARGET $SOURCES, etc., as well as any construction variables that happen to be configured in the construction environment used to build a specific target.

Of course, sometimes it's still important to be able to see the exact command that SCons will execute to build a target. For example, you may simply need to verify that SCons is configured to supply the right options to the compiler, or a developer may want to cut-and-paste a compile command to add a few options for a custom test.

One common way to give users control over whether or not SCons should print the actual command line or a short, configured summary is to add support for a VERBOSE command-line variable to your SConstruct file. A simple configuration for this might look like:

env = Environment()
if ARGUMENTS.get('VERBOSE') != '1':
    env['CCCOMSTR'] = "Compiling $TARGET"
    env['LINKCOMSTR'] = "Linking $TARGET"
env.Program('foo.c')

By only setting the appropriate $*COMSTR variables if the user specifies VERBOSE=1 on the command line, the user has control over how SCons displays these particular command lines:

% scons -Q
Compiling foo.o
Linking foo
% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.o
Removed foo
% scons -Q VERBOSE=1
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o

A gentle reminder here: many of the commands for building come in pairs, depending on whether the intent is to build an object for use in a shared library or not. The command strings mirror this, so it may be necessary to set, for example, both CCCOMSTR and SHCCCOMSTR to get the desired results.

9.3. Providing Build Progress Output: the Progress Function

Another aspect of providing good build output is to give the user feedback about what SCons is doing even when nothing is being built at the moment. This can be especially true for large builds when most of the targets are already up-to-date. Because SCons can take a long time making absolutely sure that every target is, in fact, up-to-date with respect to a lot of dependency files, it can be easy for users to mistakenly conclude that SCons is hung or that there is some other problem with the build.

One way to deal with this perception is to configure SCons to print something to let the user know what it's "thinking about." The Progress function allows you to specify a string that will be printed for every file that SCons is "considering" while it is traversing the dependency graph to decide what targets are or are not up-to-date.

Progress('Evaluating $TARGET\n')
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

Note that the Progress function does not arrange for a newline to be printed automatically at the end of the string (as does the Python print function), and we must specify the \n that we want printed at the end of the configured string. This configuration, then, will have SCons print that it is Evaluating each file that it encounters in turn as it traverses the dependency graph:

% scons -Q
Evaluating SConstruct
Evaluating f1.c
Evaluating f1.o
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
Evaluating f1
cc -o f1 f1.o
Evaluating f2.c
Evaluating f2.o
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
Evaluating f2
cc -o f2 f2.o
Evaluating .

Of course, normally you don't want to add all of these additional lines to your build output, as that can make it difficult for the user to find errors or other important messages. A more useful way to display this progress might be to have the file names printed directly to the user's screen, not to the same standard output stream where build output is printed, and to use a carriage return character (\r) so that each file name gets re-printed on the same line. Such a configuration would look like:

Progress('$TARGET\r',
         file=open('/dev/tty', 'w'),
         overwrite=True)
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

Note that we also specified the overwrite=True argument to the Progress function, which causes SCons to "wipe out" the previous string with space characters before printing the next Progress string. Without the overwrite=True argument, a shorter file name would not overwrite all of the charactes in a longer file name that precedes it, making it difficult to tell what the actual file name is on the output. Also note that we opened up the /dev/tty file for direct access (on POSIX) to the user's screen. On Windows, the equivalent would be to open the con: file name.

Also, it's important to know that although you can use $TARGET to substitute the name of the node in the string, the Progress function does not perform general variable substitution (because there's not necessarily a construction environment involved in evaluating a node like a source file, for example).

You can also specify a list of strings to the Progress function, in which case SCons will display each string in turn. This can be used to implement a "spinner" by having SCons cycle through a sequence of strings:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)
Program('f1.c')
Program('f2.c')

Note that here we have also used the interval= keyword argument to have SCons only print a new "spinner" string once every five evaluated nodes. Using an interval= count, even with strings that use $TARGET like our examples above, can be a good way to lessen the work that SCons expends printing Progress strings, while still giving the user feedback that indicates SCons is still working on evaluating the build.

Lastly, you can have direct control over how to print each evaluated node by passing a Python function (or other Python callable) to the Progress function. Your function will be called for each evaluated node, allowing you to implement more sophisticated logic like adding a counter:

screen = open('/dev/tty', 'w')
count = 0
def progress_function(node)
    count += 1
    screen.write('Node %4d: %s\r' % (count, node))

Progress(progress_function)

Of course, if you choose, you could completely ignore the node argument to the function, and just print a count, or anything else you wish.

(Note that there's an obvious follow-on question here: how would you find the total number of nodes that will be evaluated so you can tell the user how close the build is to finishing? Unfortunately, in the general case, there isn't a good way to do that, short of having SCons evaluate its dependency graph twice, first to count the total and the second time to actually build the targets. This would be necessary because you can't know in advance which target(s) the user actually requested to be built. The entire build may consist of thousands of Nodes, for example, but maybe the user specifically requested that only a single object file be built.)

9.4. Printing Detailed Build Status: the GetBuildFailures Function

SCons, like most build tools, returns zero status to the shell on success and nonzero status on failure. Sometimes it's useful to give more information about the build status at the end of the run, for instance to print an informative message, send an email, or page the poor slob who broke the build.

SCons provides a GetBuildFailures method that you can use in a python atexit function to get a list of objects describing the actions that failed while attempting to build targets. There can be more than one if you're using -j. Here's a simple example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))
atexit.register(print_build_failures)

The atexit.register call registers print_build_failures as an atexit callback, to be called before SCons exits. When that function is called, it calls GetBuildFailures to fetch the list of failed objects. See the man page for the detailed contents of the returned objects; some of the more useful attributes are .node, .errstr, .filename, and .command. The filename is not necessarily the same file as the node; the node is the target that was being built when the error occurred, while the filenameis the file or dir that actually caused the error. Note: only call GetBuildFailures at the end of the build; calling it at any other time is undefined.

Here is a more complete example showing how to turn each element of GetBuildFailures into a string:

# Make the build fail if we pass fail=1 on the command line

if ARGUMENTS.get('fail', 0):
    Command('target', 'source', ['/bin/false'])

def bf_to_str(bf):
    """Convert an element of GetBuildFailures() to a string
    in a useful way."""
    import SCons.Errors
    if bf is None: # unknown targets product None in list
        return '(unknown tgt)'
    elif isinstance(bf, SCons.Errors.StopError):
        return str(bf)
    elif bf.node:
        return str(bf.node) + ': ' + bf.errstr
    elif bf.filename:
        return bf.filename + ': ' + bf.errstr
    return 'unknown failure: ' + bf.errstr
import atexit

def build_status():
    """Convert the build status to a 2-tuple, (status, msg)."""
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    bf = GetBuildFailures()
    if bf:
        # bf is normally a list of build failures; if an element is None,
        # it's because of a target that scons doesn't know anything about.
        status = 'failed'
        failures_message = "\n".join(["Failed building %s" % bf_to_str(x)
                           for x in bf if x is not None])
    else:
        # if bf is None, the build completed successfully.
        status = 'ok'
        failures_message = ''
    return (status, failures_message)

def display_build_status():
    """Display the build status.  Called by atexit.
    Here you could do all kinds of complicated things."""
    status, failures_message = build_status()
    if status == 'failed':
       print("FAILED!!!!")  # could display alert, ring bell, etc.
    elif status == 'ok':
       print("Build succeeded.")
    print(failures_message)

atexit.register(display_build_status)

When this runs, you'll see the appropriate output:

% scons -Q
scons: `.' is up to date.
Build succeeded.
% scons -Q fail=1
scons: *** [target] Source`source' not found, needed by target `target'.
FAILED!!!!
Failed building target: Source`source' not found, needed by target `target'.

Chapter 10. Controlling a Build From the Command Line

Software builds are rarely completely static, so SCons gives you a number of ways to help control build execution via instructions on the command line. The arguments that can be specified on the command line are broken down into three types:

Options

Command-line arguments that begin with a - (hyphen) characters are called options. SCons provides ways for you to examine and act on options and their values, as well as the ability to define custom options for your project. See Section 10.1, “Command-Line Options”, below.

Variables

Command-line arguments containing an = (equal sign) character are called build variables (or just variables). SCons provides direct access to all of the build variable settings from the command line, as well as a higher-level interface that lets you define known build variables, including defining types, default values, help text, and automatic validation, as well as applying those to a construction environment. See Section 10.2, “Command-Line variable=value Build Variables”, below.

Targets

Command-line arguments that are neither options nor build variables (that is, do not begin with a hyphen and do not contain an equal sign) are considered targets that you are telling SCons to build. SCons provides access to the list of specified targets, as well as ways to set the default list of targets from within the SConscript files. See Section 10.3, “Command-Line Targets”, below.

10.1. Command-Line Options

SCons has many command-line options that control its behavior. A command-line option always begins with one or two hyphen (-) characters. The SCons manual page contains the description of the current options (see https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-man.html).

10.1.1. How To Avoid Typing Command-Line Options Each Time: the SCONSFLAGS Environment Variable

You may find yourself using certain command-line options every time you run SCons. For example, you might find it saves time to specify -j 2 to have SCons run up to two build commands in parallel. To avoid having to type -j 2 by hand every time, you can set the external environment variable SCONSFLAGS to a string containing -j 2, as well as any other command-line options that you want SCons to always use. SCONSFLAGS is an exception to the usual rule that SCons itself avoids looking at environment variables from the shell you are running.

If, for example, you are using a POSIX shell such as bash or zsh and you always want SCons to use the -Q option, you can set the SCONSFLAGS environment as follows:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
    ... [build output] ...
scons: done building targets.
% export SCONSFLAGS="-Q"
% scons
    ... [build output] ...

For csh-style shells on POSIX systems you can set the SCONSFLAGS environment variable as follows:

$ setenv SCONSFLAGS "-Q"

For the Windows command shell (cmd) you can set the SCONSFLAGS environment variable as follows:

C:\Users\foo> set SCONSFLAGS="-Q"

To set SCONSFLAGS more permanently you can add the setting to the shell's startup file on POSIX systems, and on Windows you can use the System Properties control panel applet to select Environment Variables and set it there.

10.1.2. Getting Values Set by Command-Line Options: the GetOption Function

The GetOption function lets you query the values set by the various command-line options.

One use case for GetOption is to check the operation mode in order to bypass some steps, for example, checking whether the -h (or --help) option was given. Normally, SCons does not print its help text until after it has read all of the SConscript files, since any SConscript can make additions to the help text. Of course, reading all of the SConscript files takes extra time. If you know that your configuration does not define any additional help text in subsidiary SConscript files, you can speed up displaying the command-line help by using a GetOption query as a guard for whether to load the subsidiary SConscript files:

if not GetOption('help'):
    SConscript('src/SConscript', export='env')

The same technique can be used to special-case the clean (GetOption('clean')) and no-execute (GetOption('no_exec')) modes.

In general, the string that you pass to the GetOption function to fetch the value of a command-line option setting is the same as the "most common" long option name (beginning with two hyphen characters), although there are some exceptions. The list of SCons command-line options and the GetOption strings for fetching them, are available in the Section 10.1.4, “Strings for Getting or Setting Values of SCons Command-Line Options” section, below.

GetOption can be used to retrieve the values of options defined by calls to AddOption. A GetOption call must appear after the AddOption call for that option (unlike the defining of build targets, this is a case where "order matters" in SCons). If the AddOption call supplied a dest keyword argument, a string with that name is what to pass as the argument to GetOption, otherwise it is a (possibly modified) version of the first long option name - see AddOption.

10.1.3. Setting Values of Command-Line Options: the SetOption Function

You can also set the values of certain (but not all) SCons command-line options from within the SConscript files by using the SetOption function. The strings that you use to set the values of SCons command-line options are available in the Section 10.1.4, “Strings for Getting or Setting Values of SCons Command-Line Options” section, below.

One use of the SetOption function is to specify a value for the -j or --jobs option, so that you get the improved performance of a parallel build without having to specify the option by hand. A complicating factor is that a good value for the -j option is somewhat system-dependent. One rough guideline is that the more processors your system has, the higher you want to set the -j value, in order to take advantage of the number of CPUs.

For example, suppose the administrators of your development systems have standardized on setting a NUM_CPU environment variable to the number of processors on each system. A little bit of Python code to access the environment variable and the SetOption function provides the right level of flexibility:

import os

num_cpu = int(os.environ.get('NUM_CPU', 2))
SetOption('num_jobs', num_cpu)
print("running with -j %s" % GetOption('num_jobs'))

The above snippet of code sets the value of the --jobs option to the value specified in the NUM_CPU environment variable. (This is one of the exception cases where the string is spelled differently from the command-line option. The string for fetching or setting the --jobs value is num_jobs for historical reasons.) The code in this example prints the num_jobs value for illustrative purposes. It uses a default value of 2 to provide some minimal parallelism even on single-processor systems:

% scons -Q
running with -j 2
scons: `.' is up to date.

But if the NUM_CPU environment variable is set, then use that for the default number of jobs:

% export NUM_CPU="4"
% scons -Q
running with -j 4
scons: `.' is up to date.

But any explicit -j or --jobs value you specify on the command line is used first, whether the NUM_CPU environment variable is set or not:

% scons -Q -j 7
running with -j 7
scons: `.' is up to date.
% export NUM_CPU="4"
% scons -Q -j 3
running with -j 3
scons:`.' is up to date.

10.1.4. Strings for Getting or Setting Values of SCons Command-Line Options

The strings that you can pass to the GetOption and SetOption functions usually correspond to the first long-form option name (that is, name beginning with two hyphen characters: --), after replacing any remaining hyphen characters with underscores.

SetOption works for options added with AddOption, but only if they were created with settable=True in the call to AddOption (only available in SCons 4.8.0 and later).

The full list of strings and the variables they correspond to is as follows:

String for GetOption and SetOption Command-Line Option(s)
cache_debug --cache-debug
cache_disable --cache-disable
cache_force --cache-force
cache_show --cache-show
clean -c, --clean, --remove
config --config
directory -C, --directory
diskcheck --diskcheck
duplicate --duplicate
file -f, --file, --makefile , --sconstruct
help -h, --help
ignore_errors --ignore-errors
implicit_cache --implicit-cache
implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed
implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged
interactive --interact, --interactive
keep_going -k, --keep-going
max_drift --max-drift
no_exec -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
no_progress -Q
no_site_dir --no-site-dir
num_jobs -j, --jobs
profile_file --profile
question -q, --question
random --random
repository -Y, --repository, --srcdir
silent -s, --silent, --quiet
site_dir --site-dir
stack_size --stack-size
taskmastertrace_file --taskmastertrace
warn --warn --warning
10.1.5. Adding Custom Command-Line Options: the AddOption Function

You can also define your own command-line options for the project with the AddOption function. The AddOption function takes the same arguments as the add_option method from the Python standard library module optparse [2] (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html).

Once you add a custom command-line option with the AddOption function, the value of the option (if any) is immediately available using the GetOption function. The argument to GetOption must be the name of the variable which holds the option. If the dest keyword argument to AddOption is specified, the value is the variable name. given. If not given, it is the name (without the leading hyphens) of the first long option name given to AddOption after replacing any remaining hyphen characters with underscores, since hyphens are not legal in Python identifier names.

SetOption works for options added with AddOption, but only if they were created with settable=True in the call to AddOption (only available in SCons 4.8.0 and later).

One useful example of using this functionality is to provide a --prefix to help describe where to install files:

AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    type='string',
    nargs=1,
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)

env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

installed_foo = env.Install('$PREFIX/usr/bin', 'foo.in')
Default(installed_foo)

The above code uses the GetOption function to set the $PREFIX construction variable to a value you specify with a command-line option of --prefix. Because $PREFIX expands to a null string if it's not initialized, running SCons without the option of --prefix installs the file in the /usr/bin/ directory:

% scons -Q -n
Install file: "foo.in" as "/usr/bin/foo.in"

But specifying --prefix=/tmp/install on the command line causes the file to be installed in the /tmp/install/usr/bin/ directory:

% scons -Q -n --prefix=/tmp/install
Install file: "foo.in" as "/tmp/install/usr/bin/foo.in"

Note

The optparse parser which SCons uses allows option-arguments to follow their options after either an = or space separator, however the latter form does not work well in SCons for added options and should be avoided. SCons does not place an ordering constraint on the types of command-line arguments, so while --input=ARG is unambiguous, for --input ARG it is not possible to tell without instructions whether ARG is an argument belonging to the input option or a standalone word. SCons considers words on the command line which do not begin with hyphen as either command-line build variables or command-line targets, both of which are made available for use in an SConscript (see the immediately following sections for details). Thus, they must be collected before SConscript processing takes place. AddOption calls do provide the necessary instructions to resolve the ambiguity, but as they appear in SConscript files, SCons does not have the information early enough, and unexpected things may happen, such as option-arguments appearing in the list of targets, and processing exceptions due to missing option-arguments.

As a result, this usage style should be avoided when invoking scons. For single-argument options, tell your users to use the --input=ARG form on the command line. For multiple-argument options (nargs value greater than one), set nargs to one in the AddOption call and either: combine the option-arguments into one word with a separator, and parse the result in your own code (see the built-in --debug option, which allows specifying multiple arguments as a single comma-separated word, for an example of such usage); or allow the option to be specified multiple times by setting action='append'. Both methods can be supported at the same time.

10.2. Command-Line variable=value Build Variables

You may want to control various aspects of your build by allowing variable=value pairs to be specified on the command line. For example, suppose you want to be able to build a debug version of a program by running SCons as follows:

% scons -Q debug=1

SCons provides an ARGUMENTS dictionary that stores all of the variable=value assignments from the command line. This allows you to modify aspects of your build in response to specifications on the command line.

The following code sets the $CCFLAGS construction variable in response to the debug flag being set in the ARGUMENTS dictionary:

env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0)
if int(debug):
    env.Append(CCFLAGS='-g')
env.Program('prog.c')

This results in the -g compiler option being used when debug=1 is used on the command line:

% scons -Q debug=0
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o
% scons -Q debug=0
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q debug=1
cc -o prog.o -c -g prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o
% scons -Q debug=1
scons:`.' is up to date.

Note

Two usage notes (both shown in the example above):

No matter how you intend to use them, the values read from a command line (i.e., external to the program) are always strings. You may need to do type conversion.

When you retrieve from the ARGUMENTS dictionary, it is useful to use the Python dictionary get method, so you can supply a default value if the variable is not given on the command line. Otherwise, the build will fail with a KeyError if the variable is not set.

SCons keeps track of the precise build command used to build each object file, and as a result can determine that the object and executable files need rebuilding when the value of the debug argument has changed.

The ARGUMENTS dictionary has two minor drawbacks. First, because it is a dictionary, it can only map each keyword to one value, and thus only "remembers" the last setting for each keyword on the command line. This makes the ARGUMENTS dictionary less than ideal if you want to allow specifying multiple values on the command line for a given keyword. Second, it does not preserve the order in which the variable settings were specified, which is a problem if you want the configuration to behave differently in response to the order in which the build variable settings were specified on the command line (Python versions since 3.6 now maintain dictionaries in insertion order, so this problem is mitigated).

To accommodate these requirements, SCons also provides an ARGLIST variable that gives you direct access to build variable settings from the command line, in the exact order they were specified, and without removing any duplicate settings. Each element in the ARGLIST variable is itself a two-element list containing the keyword and the value of the setting, and you must loop through, or otherwise select from, the elements of ARGLIST to process the specific settings you want in whatever way is appropriate for your configuration. For example, the following code lets you add to the CPPDEFINES construction variable by specifying multiple define= settings on the command line:

cppdefines = []
for key, value in ARGLIST:
    if key == 'define':
        cppdefines.append(value)
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=cppdefines)
env.Object('prog.c')

Yields the following output:

% scons -Q define=FOO
cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO prog.c
% scons -Q define=FOO define=BAR
cc -o prog.o -c -DFOO -DBAR prog.c

Note that the ARGLIST and ARGUMENTS variables do not interfere with each other, but rather provide slightly different views into how you specified variable=value settings on the command line. You can use both variables in the same SCons configuration. In general, the ARGUMENTS dictionary is more convenient to use, (since you can just fetch variable settings through Python dictionary access), and the ARGLIST list is more flexible (since you can examine the specific order in which the command-line variable settings were given).

10.2.1. Controlling Command-Line Build Variables

Being able to use a command-line build variable like debug=1 is handy, but it can be a chore to write specific Python code to recognize each such variable, check for errors and provide appropriate messages, and apply the values to a construction variable. To help with this, SCons provides a Variables container class to hold definitions of such build variables, and a mechanism to apply the build variables to a construction environment. This allows you to control how the build variables affect construction environments.

For example, suppose that you want to set a RELEASE construction variable on the command line whenever the time comes to build a program for release, and that the value of this variable should be added to the build command with the appropriate define to pass the value to the C compiler. Here's how you might do that by setting the appropriate value in a dictionary for the $CPPDEFINES construction variable:

vars = Variables(None, ARGUMENTS)
vars.Add('RELEASE', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

This SConstruct snippet first creates a Variables object which uses the values from the command-line variables dictionary ARGUMENTS. It then uses the object's Add method to indicate that the RELEASE variable can be set on the command line, and that if not set the default value is 0. The newly created Variables object is passed to the Environment call used to create the construction environment using a variables keyword argument. This then allows you to set the RELEASE build variable on the command line and have the variable show up in the command line used to build each object from a C source file:

% scons -Q RELEASE=1
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

The Variables() call in this example looks a little awkward. The function takes two optional arguments: a script name and a dictionary. In order to specify the dictionary as the second argument, you must provide the script argument as the first; since there's actually no script, use None as a sentinel value. However, if you omit all the arguments, the default behavior is to read from the ARGUMENTS dictionary anyway, which is what we want. The example shows it this way because the arguments were introduced in this order, but you should feel free to just leave off the arguments if the default behavior is what you want.

Historical note: In old SCons (prior to 0.98.1 from 2008), these build variables were known as "command-line build options." At that time, the class was named Options and the predefined functions to construct options were named BoolOption, EnumOption, ListOption, PathOption, PackageOption and AddOptions (contrast with the current names in Section 10.2.4, “Pre-Defined Build Variable Functions”, below). Because the Internet has a very long memory, you may encounter these names in older SConscript files, wiki pages, blog entries, StackExchange articles, etc. These old names no longer work, but a mental substitution of “Variable” for “Option” allows the concepts to transfer to current usage models.

10.2.2. Providing Help for Command-Line Build Variables

To make command-line build variables more useful, you may want to provide some help text to describe the available variables when you ask for help (run scons -h). You can write this text by hand, but SCons provides some assistance. Variables objects provide a GenerateHelpText method to generate text that describes the various variables that have been added to it. The default text includes the help string itself plus other information such as allowed values. (The generated text can also be customized by replacing the FormatVariableHelpText method). You then pass the output from this method to the Help function:

vars = Variables()
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars)
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

scons now displays some useful text when the -h option is used:

% scons -Q -h

RELEASE: Set to 1 to build for release
    default: 0
    actual: 0

Use scons -H for help about SCons built-in command-line options.

You can see the help output shows the default value as well as the current actual value of the build variable.

10.2.3. Reading Build Variables From a File

Being able to specify the value of a build variable on the command line is useful, but can still become tedious if you have to specify the variable every time you run SCons. To make this easier, you can provide customized build variable settings in a Python script by providing a file name when the Variables object is created:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program(['foo.c', 'bar.c'])
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

This then allows you to control the RELEASE variable by setting it in the custom.py script:

RELEASE = 1

Note that this file is actually executed like a Python script. Now when you run SCons:

% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=1 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

And if you change the contents of custom.py to:

RELEASE = 0

The object files are rebuilt appropriately with the new variable:

% scons -Q
cc -o bar.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 bar.c
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=0 foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o bar.o

Finally, you can combine both methods with:

vars = Variables('custom.py', ARGUMENTS)

If both a variables script and a dictionary are supplied, the dictionary is evaluated last, so values from the command line "win" if there are any duplicate keys. This rule allows you to move some common settings to a variables script, but still be able to override those for a given build without changing the script.

10.2.4. Pre-Defined Build Variable Functions

SCons provides a number of convenience functions that provide behavior definitions for various types of command-line build variables. These functions all return a tuple which is ready to be passed to the Add or AddVariables method call. You are of course free to define your own behaviors as well.

10.2.4.1. True/False Values: the BoolVariable Build Variable Function

It is often handy to be able to specify a variable that controls a simple Boolean variable with a true or false value. It would be even more handy to accommodate different preferences for how to represent true or false values. The BoolVariable function makes it easy to accommodate these common representations of true or false.

The BoolVariable function takes three arguments: the name of the build variable, the default value of the build variable, and the help string for the variable. It then returns appropriate information for passing to the Add method of a Variables object, like so:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(BoolVariable('RELEASE', help='Set to build for release', default=False))
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
env.Program('foo.c')

With this build variable in place, the RELEASE variable can now be enabled by setting it to the value yes or t:

% scons -Q RELEASE=yes foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

% scons -Q RELEASE=t foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=True foo.c

Other values that equate to true include y, 1, on and all.

Conversely, RELEASE may now be given a false value by setting it to no or f:

% scons -Q RELEASE=no foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

% scons -Q RELEASE=f foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DRELEASE_BUILD=False foo.c

Other values that equate to false include n, 0, off and none.

Lastly, if you try to specify any other value, SCons supplies an appropriate error message:

% scons -Q RELEASE=bad_value foo.o

scons: *** Error converting option: 'RELEASE'
Invalid value for boolean variable: 'bad_value'
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 3, in <module>

10.2.4.2. Single Value From a Selection: the EnumVariable Build Variable Function

Suppose that you want to allow setting a COLOR variable that selects a background color to be displayed by an application, but that you want to restrict the choices to a specific set of allowed colors. You can set this up quite easily using the EnumVariable function, which takes a list of allowed_values in addition to the variable name, default value, and help text arguments:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')
Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

You can now explicitly set the COLOR build variable to any of the specified allowed values:

% scons -Q COLOR=red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=blue foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

But, importantly, an attempt to set COLOR to a value that's not in the list generates an error message:

% scons -Q COLOR=magenta foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for enum variable 'COLOR': 'magenta'. Valid values are: ('red', 'green', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>

This example can also serve to further illustrate help generation: the help message here picks up not only the help text, but augments it with information gathered from allowed_values and default:

% scons -Q -h

COLOR: Set background color (red|green|blue)
    default: red
    actual: red

Use scons -H for help about SCons built-in command-line options.

The EnumVariable function also provides a way to map alternate names to allowed values. Suppose, for example, you want to allow the word navy to be used as a synonym for blue. You do this by adding a map dictionary that maps its key values to the desired allowed value:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

Now you can supply navy on the command line, and SCons translates that into blue when it comes time to use the COLOR variable to build a target:

% scons -Q COLOR=navy foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c

By default, when using the EnumVariable function, the allowed values are case-sensitive:

% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for enum variable 'COLOR': 'Red'. Valid values are: ('red', 'green', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>
% scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for enum variable 'COLOR': 'BLUE'. Valid values are: ('red', 'green', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value for enum variable 'COLOR': 'nAvY'. Valid values are: ('red', 'green', 'blue')
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 10, in <module>

The EnumVariable function can take an additional ignorecase keyword argument that, when set to 1, tells SCons to allow case differences when the values are specified:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
        ignorecase=1,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

Which yields the output:

% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="Red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=BLUE foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="BLUE" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=green foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

Notice that an ignorecase value of 1 preserves the case-spelling supplied, only ignoring the case for matching. If you want SCons to translate the names into lower-case, regardless of the case used by the user, specify an ignorecase value of 2:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    EnumVariable(
        'COLOR',
        help='Set background color',
        default='red',
        allowed_values=('red', 'green', 'blue'),
        map={'navy': 'blue'},
        ignorecase=2,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLOR': '"${COLOR}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

Now SCons uses values of red, green or blue regardless of how those values are spelled on the command line:

% scons -Q COLOR=Red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="red" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=nAvY foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="blue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLOR=GREEN foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLOR="green" foo.c

10.2.4.3. Multiple Values From a List: the ListVariable Build Variable Function

Another way in which you might want to control a build variable is to specify a list of allowed values, of which one or more can be chosen (where EnumVariable allows exactly one value to be chosen). SCons provides this through the ListVariable function. If, for example, you want to be able to set a COLORS variable to one or more of the allowed values:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    ListVariable(
        'COLORS', help='List of colors', default=0, names=['red', 'green', 'blue']
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'COLORS': '"${COLORS}"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

You can now specify a comma-separated list of allowed values, which get translated into a space-separated list for passing to the build commands:

% scons -Q COLORS=red,blue foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red -Dblue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLORS=blue,green,red foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="blue -Dgreen -Dred" foo.c

In addition, the ListVariable function lets you specify explicit keywords of all or none to select all of the allowed values, or none of them, respectively:

% scons -Q COLORS=all foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="red -Dgreen -Dblue" foo.c
% scons -Q COLORS=none foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCOLORS="" foo.c

And, of course, an illegal value still generates an error message:

% scons -Q COLORS=magenta foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value(s) for variable 'COLORS': 'magenta'. Valid values are: blue,green,red,all,none
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

You can use this last characteristic as a way to enforce at least one of your valid options being chosen by specifying the valid values with the names parameter and then giving a value not in that list as the default parameter - that way if no value is given on the command line, the default is chosen, SCons errors out as this is invalid. The example is, in fact, set up that way by using 0 as the default:

% scons -Q foo.o

scons: *** Invalid value(s) for variable 'COLORS': '0'. Valid values are: blue,green,red,all,none
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

This technique works for EnumVariable as well.

10.2.4.4. Path Names: the PathVariable Build Variable Function

SCons provides a PathVariable function to make it easy to create a build variable to control an expected path name. If, for example, you need to define a preprocessor macro that controls the location of a configuration file:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'CONFIG', help='Path to configuration file', default='/etc/my_config'
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE': '"$CONFIG"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

This allows you to override the CONFIG build variable on the command line as necessary:

% scons -Q foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DCONFIG_FILE="/etc/my_config" foo.c
% scons -Q CONFIG=/usr/local/etc/other_config foo.o
scons: `foo.o' is up to date.

By default, PathVariable checks to make sure that the specified path exists and generates an error if it doesn't:

% scons -Q CONFIG=/does/not/exist foo.o

scons: *** Path for variable 'CONFIG' does not exist: /does/not/exist
File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7, in <module>

PathVariable provides a number of methods that you can use to change this behavior. If you want to ensure that any specified paths are, in fact, files and not directories, use the PathVariable.PathIsFile method as the validation function:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'CONFIG',
        help='Path to configuration file',
        default='/etc/my_config',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsFile,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'CONFIG_FILE': '"$CONFIG"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

Conversely, to ensure that any specified paths are directories and not files, use the PathVariable.PathIsDir method as the validation function:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'DBDIR',
        help='Path to database directory',
        default='/var/my_dbdir',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDir,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR': '"$DBDIR"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

If you want to make sure that any specified paths are directories, and you would like the directory created if it doesn't already exist, use the PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate method as the validation function:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'DBDIR',
        help='Path to database directory',
        default='/var/my_dbdir',
        validator=PathVariable.PathIsDirCreate,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'DBDIR': '"$DBDIR"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

Lastly, if you don't care whether the path exists, is a file, or a directory, use the PathVariable.PathAccept method to accept any path you supply:

vars = Variables('custom.py')
vars.Add(
    PathVariable(
        'OUTPUT',
        help='Path to output file or directory',
        default=None,
        validator=PathVariable.PathAccept,
    )
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'OUTPUT': '"$OUTPUT"'})
env.Program('foo.c')

10.2.4.5. Enabled/Disabled Path Names: the PackageVariable Build Variable Function

Sometimes you want to give even more control over a path name variable, allowing them to be explicitly enabled or disabled by using yes or no keywords, in addition to allowing supplying an explicit path name. SCons provides the PackageVariable function to support this:

vars = Variables("custom.py")
vars.Add(
    PackageVariable("PACKAGE", help="Location package", default="/opt/location")
)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={"PACKAGE": '"$PACKAGE"'})
env.Program("foo.c")

When the SConscript file uses the PackageVariable function, you can still use the default or supply an overriding path name, but you can now explicitly set the specified variable to a value that indicates the package should be enabled (in which case the default should be used) or disabled:

% scons -Q foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/opt/location" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=/usr/local/location foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/usr/local/location" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=yes foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="/opt/location" foo.c
% scons -Q PACKAGE=no foo.o
cc -o foo.o -c -DPACKAGE="False" foo.c

10.2.5. Adding Multiple Command-Line Build Variables at Once

Lastly, SCons provides a way to add multiple build variables to a Variables object at once. Instead of having to call the Add method multiple times, you can call the AddVariables method with the build variables to be added to the object. Each build variable is specified as either a tuple of arguments, or as a call to one of the pre-defined functions for pre-packaged command-line build variables, which returns such a tuple. Note that an individual tuple cannot take keyword arguments in the way that a call to Add or one of the build variable functions can. The order of variables given to AddVariables does not matter.

vars = Variables()
vars.AddVariables(
    ('RELEASE', 'Set to 1 to build for release', 0),
    ('CONFIG', 'Configuration file', '/etc/my_config'),
    BoolVariable('warnings', help='compilation with -Wall and similar', default=True),
    EnumVariable(
        'debug',
        help='debug output and symbols',
        default='no',
        allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
        map={},
        ignorecase=0,
    ),
    ListVariable(
        'shared',
        help='libraries to build as shared libraries',
        default='all',
        names=list_of_libs,
    ),
    PackageVariable(
        'x11', help='use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)', default='yes'
    ),
    PathVariable('qtdir', help='where the root of Qt is installed', default=qtdir),
)

10.2.6. Handling Unknown Command-Line Build Variables: the UnknownVariables Function

Humans, of course, occasionally misspell variable names in their command-line settings. SCons does not generate an error or warning for any unknown variables specified on the command line, because it can not reliably tell whether a given "misspelled" variable is really unknown and a potential problem or not. After all, you might be processing arguments directly using ARGUMENTS or ARGLIST with some Python code in your SConscript file.

If, however, you are using a Variables object to define a specific set of command-line build variables that you expect to be able to set, you may want to provide an error message or warning of your own if a variable setting is specified that is not among the defined list of variable names known to the Variables object. You can do this by calling the UnknownVariables method of the Variables object to get the settings Variables did not recognize:

vars = Variables(None)
vars.Add('RELEASE', help='Set to 1 to build for release', default=0)
env = Environment(variables=vars, CPPDEFINES={'RELEASE_BUILD': '${RELEASE}'})
unknown = vars.UnknownVariables()
if unknown:
    print("Unknown variables: %s" % " ".join(unknown.keys()))
    Exit(1)
env.Program('foo.c')

The UnknownVariables method returns a dictionary containing the keywords and values of any variables specified on the command line that are not among the variables known to the Variables object (from having been specified using the Variables object's Add method). The example above, checks whether the dictionary returned by UnknownVariables is non-empty, and if so prints the Python list containing the names of the unknown variables and then calls the Exit function to terminate SCons:

% scons -Q NOT_KNOWN=foo
Unknown variables: NOT_KNOWN

Of course, you can process the items in the dictionary returned by the UnknownVariables function in any way appropriate to your build configuration, including just printing a warning message but not exiting, logging an error somewhere, etc.

Note that you must delay the call of UnknownVariables until after you have applied the Variables object to a construction environment with the variables= keyword argument of an Environment call: the variables in the object are not fully processed until this has happened.

10.3. Command-Line Targets
10.3.1. Fetching Command-Line Targets: the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS Variable

SCons provides a COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable that lets you fetch the list of targets that were specified on the command line. You can use the targets to manipulate the build in any way you wish. As a simple example, suppose that you want to print a reminder whenever a specific program is built. You can do this by checking for the target in the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS list:

if 'bar' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print("Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!")
Default(Program('foo.c'))
Program('bar.c')

Now, running SCons with the default target works as usual, but explicitly specifying the bar target on the command line generates the warning message:

% scons -Q
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
% scons -Q bar
Don't forget to copy `bar' to the archive!
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
cc -o bar bar.o

Another practical use for the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable might be to speed up a build by only reading certain subsidiary SConscript files if a specific target is requested.

10.3.2. Controlling the Default Targets: the Default Function

You can control which targets SCons builds by default - that is, when there are no targets specified on the command line. As mentioned previously, SCons normally builds every target in or below the current directory unless you explicitly specify one or more targets on the command line. Sometimes, however, you may want to specify that only certain programs, or programs in certain directories, should be built by default. You do this with the Default function:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Program('goodbye.c')
Default(hello)

This SConstruct file knows how to build two programs, hello and goodbye, but only builds the hello program by default:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q
scons: `hello' is up to date.
% scons -Q goodbye
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o

Note that, even when you use the Default function in your SConstruct file, you can still explicitly specify the current directory (.) on the command line to tell SCons to build everything in (or below) the current directory:

% scons -Q .
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

You can also call the Default function more than once, in which case each call adds to the list of targets to be built by default:

env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
Default(prog3)

Or you can specify more than one target in a single call to the Default function:

env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
prog3 = env.Program('prog3.c')
Default(prog1, prog3)

Either of these last two examples build only the prog1 and prog3 programs by default:

% scons -Q
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog3.o -c prog3.c
cc -o prog3 prog3.o
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o

You can list a directory as an argument to Default:

env = Environment()
env.Program(['prog1/main.c', 'prog1/foo.c'])
env.Program(['prog2/main.c', 'prog2/bar.c'])
Default('prog1')

In which case only the target(s) in that directory are built by default:

% scons -Q
cc -o prog1/foo.o -c prog1/foo.c
cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
cc -o prog1/main prog1/main.o prog1/foo.o
% scons -Q
scons: `prog1' is up to date.
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog2/bar.o -c prog2/bar.c
cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
cc -o prog2/main prog2/main.o prog2/bar.o

Lastly, if for some reason you don't want any targets built by default, you can use the Python None variable:

env = Environment()
prog1 = env.Program('prog1.c')
prog2 = env.Program('prog2.c')
Default(None)

Which would produce build output like:

% scons -Q
scons: *** No targets specified and no Default() targets found.  Stop.
Found nothing to build
% scons -Q .
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o

10.3.2.1. Fetching the List of Default Targets: the DEFAULT_TARGETS Variable

SCons provides a DEFAULT_TARGETS variable that lets you get at the current list of default targets specified by calls to the Default function or method. The DEFAULT_TARGETS variable has two important differences from the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable. First, the DEFAULT_TARGETS variable is a list of internal SCons nodes, so you need to convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look for a specific target name. You can do this easily by calling the str on the elements in a list comprehension:

prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])

(Keep in mind that the manipulation of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list takes place during the first phase when SCons is reading up the SConscript files, which is obvious if you leave off the -Q flag when you run SCons:)

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
DEFAULT_TARGETS is ['prog1']
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
scons: done building targets.

Second, the contents of the DEFAULT_TARGETS list changes in response to calls to the Default function, as you can see from the following SConstruct file:

prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Default(prog1)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is now %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])
prog2 = Program('prog2.c')
Default(prog2)
print("DEFAULT_TARGETS is now %s" % [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])

Which yields the output:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1']
DEFAULT_TARGETS is now ['prog1', 'prog2']
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o
scons: done building targets.

In practice, this simply means that you need to pay attention to the order in which you call the Default function and refer to the DEFAULT_TARGETS list, to make sure that you don't examine the list before you have added the default targets you expect to find in it.

10.3.3. Fetching the List of Build Targets, Regardless of Origin: the BUILD_TARGETS Variable

You have already seen the COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified on the command line, and the DEFAULT_TARGETS variable, which contains a list of targets specified via calls to the Default method or function. Sometimes, however, you want a list of whatever targets SCons tries to build, regardless of whether the targets came from the command line or a Default call. You could code this up by hand, as follows:

if COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    targets = COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS
else:
    targets = DEFAULT_TARGETS

SCons, however, provides a convenient BUILD_TARGETS variable that eliminates the need for this by-hand manipulation. Essentially, the BUILD_TARGETS variable contains a list of the command-line targets, if any were specified, and if no command-line targets were specified, it contains a list of the targets specified via the Default method or function.

Because BUILD_TARGETS may contain a list of SCons nodes, you must convert the list elements to strings if you want to print them or look for a specific target name, just like the DEFAULT_TARGETS list:

prog1 = Program('prog1.c')
Program('prog2.c')
Default(prog1)
print("BUILD_TARGETS is %s" % [str(t) for t in BUILD_TARGETS])

Notice how the value of BUILD_TARGETS changes depending on whether a target is specified on the command line - BUILD_TARGETS takes from DEFAULT_TARGETS only if there are no COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:

% scons -Q
BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog1']
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o
% scons -Q prog2
BUILD_TARGETS is ['prog2']
cc -o prog2.o -c prog2.c
cc -o prog2 prog2.o
% scons -Q -c .
BUILD_TARGETS is ['.']
Removed prog1.o
Removed prog1
Removed prog2.o
Removed prog2

[2] The AddOption function is, in fact, implemented using a subclass of optparse.OptionParser.

Chapter 11. Installing Files in Other Directories: the Install Builder

Once a program is built, it is often appropriate to install it in another directory for public use. You use the Install method to arrange for a program, or any other file, to be copied into a destination directory:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)

Note, however, that installing a file is still considered a type of file "build." This is important when you remember that the default behavior of SCons is to build files in or below the current directory. If, as in the example above, you are installing files in a directory outside of the top-level SConstruct file's directory tree, you must specify that directory (or a higher directory, such as /) for it to install anything there:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q /usr/bin
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

It can, however, be cumbersome to remember (and type) the specific destination directory in which the program (or other file) should be installed. A call to Default can be used to add the directory to the list of default targets, removing the need to type it, but sometimes you don't want to install on every build. This is an area where the Alias function comes in handy, allowing you, for example, to create a pseudo-target named install that can expand to the specified destination directory:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

This then yields the more natural ability to install the program in its destination as a separate invocation, as follows:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q install
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

11.1. Installing Multiple Files in a Directory

You can install multiple files into a directory simply by calling the Install function multiple times:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Install('/usr/bin', goodbye)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

Or, more succinctly, listing the multiple input files in a list (just like you can do with any other builder):

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', [hello, goodbye])
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

Either of these two examples yields:

% scons -Q install
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye"
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

11.2. Installing a File Under a Different Name

The Install method preserves the name of the file when it is copied into the destination directory. If you need to change the name of the file when you copy it, use the InstallAs function:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.InstallAs('/usr/bin/hello-new', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

This installs the hello program with the name hello-new as follows:

% scons -Q install
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"

11.3. Installing Multiple Files Under Different Names

If you have multiple files that all need to be installed with different file names, you can either call the InstallAs function multiple times, or as a shorthand, you can supply same-length lists for both the target and source arguments:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
goodbye = env.Program('goodbye.c')
env.InstallAs(['/usr/bin/hello-new',
               '/usr/bin/goodbye-new'],
               [hello, goodbye])
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

In this case, the InstallAs function loops through both lists simultaneously, and copies each source file into its corresponding target file name:

% scons -Q install
cc -o goodbye.o -c goodbye.c
cc -o goodbye goodbye.o
Install file: "goodbye" as "/usr/bin/goodbye-new"
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello-new"

11.4. Installing a Shared Library

If a shared library is created with the $SHLIBVERSION variable set, scons will create symbolic links as needed based on that variable. To properly install such a library including the symbolic links, use the InstallVersionedLib function.

For example, on a Linux system, this instruction:

foo =  env.SharedLibrary(target="foo", source="foo.c", SHLIBVERSION="1.2.3")

Will produce a shared library libfoo.so.1.2.3 and symbolic links libfoo.so and libfoo.so.1 which point to libfoo.so.1.2.3. You can use the Node returned by the SharedLibrary builder in order to install the library and its symbolic links in one go without having to list them individually:

env.InstallVersionedLib(target="lib", source=foo)

On systems which expect a shared library to be installed both with a name that indicates the version, for run-time resolution, and as a plain name, for link-time resolution, the InstallVersionedLib function can be used. Symbolic links appropriate to the type of system will be generated based on symlinks of the source library.

Chapter 12. Platform-Independent File System Manipulation

SCons provides a number of platform-independent functions, called factories, that perform common file system manipulations like copying, moving or deleting files and directories, or making directories. These functions are factories because they don't perform the action at the time they're called, they each return an Action object that can be executed at the appropriate time.

12.1. Copying Files or Directories: The Copy Factory

Suppose you want to arrange to make a copy of a file, and don't have a suitable pre-existing builder. [3] One way would be to use the Copy action factory in conjunction with the Command builder:

Command("file.out", "file.in", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"))

Notice that the action returned by the Copy factory will expand the $TARGET and $SOURCE strings at the time file.out is built, and that the order of the arguments is the same as that of a builder itself--that is, target first, followed by source:

% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

You can, of course, name a file explicitly instead of using $TARGET or $SOURCE:

Command("file.out", [], Copy("$TARGET", "file.in"))

Which executes as:

% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

The usefulness of the Copy factory becomes more apparent when you use it in a list of actions passed to the Command builder. For example, suppose you needed to run a file through a utility that only modifies files in-place, and can't "pipe" input to output. One solution is to copy the source file to a temporary file name, run the utility, and then copy the modified temporary file to the target, which the Copy factory makes extremely easy:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

The output then looks like:

% scons -Q
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

The Copy factory has a third optional argument which controls how symlinks are copied.

# Symbolic link shallow copied as a new symbolic link

Command("LinkIn", "LinkOut", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE", symlinks=True))

# Symbolic link target copied as a file or directory

Command("LinkIn", "FileOrDirectoryOut", Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE", symlinks=False))

12.2. Deleting Files or Directories: The Delete Factory

If you need to delete a file, then the Delete factory can be used in much the same way as the Copy factory. For example, if we want to make sure that the temporary file in our last example doesn't exist before we copy to it, we could add Delete to the beginning of the command list:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("tempfile"),
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Copy("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

Which then executes as follows:

% scons -Q
Delete("tempfile")
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Copy("file.out", "tempfile")

Of course, like all of these Action factories, the Delete factory also expands $TARGET and $SOURCE variables appropriately. For example:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("$TARGET"),
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
    ],
)

Executes as:

% scons -Q
Delete("file.out")
Copy("file.out", "file.in")

Note, however, that you typically don't need to call the Delete factory explicitly in this way; by default, SCons deletes its target(s) for you before executing any action.

One word of caution about using the Delete factory: it has the same variable expansions available as any other factory, including the $SOURCE variable. Specifying Delete("$SOURCE") is not something you usually want to do!

12.3. Moving (Renaming) Files or Directories: The Move Factory

The Move factory allows you to rename a file or directory. For example, if we don't want to copy the temporary file, we could use:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("tempfile", "$SOURCE"),
        "modify tempfile",
        Move("$TARGET", "tempfile"),
    ],
)

Which would execute as:

% scons -Q
Copy("tempfile", "file.in")
modify tempfile
Move("file.out", "tempfile")

12.4. Updating the Modification Time of a File: The Touch Factory

If you just need to update the recorded modification time for a file, use the Touch factory:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
        Touch("$TARGET"),
    ]
)

Which executes as:

% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")
Touch("file.out")

12.5. Creating a Directory: The Mkdir Factory

If you need to create a directory, use the Mkdir factory. For example, if we need to process a file in a temporary directory in which the processing tool will create other files that we don't care about, you could use:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Delete("tempdir"),
        Mkdir("tempdir"),
        Copy("tempdir/${SOURCE.file}", "$SOURCE"),
        "process tempdir",
        Move("$TARGET", "tempdir/output_file"),
        Delete("tempdir"),
    ],
)

Which executes as:

% scons -Q
Delete("tempdir")
Mkdir("tempdir")
Copy("tempdir/file.in", "file.in")
process tempdir
Move("file.out", "tempdir/output_file")
scons: *** [file.out] tempdir/output_file: No such file or directory

12.6. Changing File or Directory Permissions: The Chmod Factory

To change permissions on a file or directory, use the Chmod factory. The permission argument uses POSIX-style permission bits and should typically be expressed as an octal, not decimal, number:

Command(
    "file.out",
    "file.in",
    action=[
        Copy("$TARGET", "$SOURCE"),
        Chmod("$TARGET", 0o755),
    ]
)

Which executes:

% scons -Q
Copy("file.out", "file.in")
Chmod("file.out", 0o755)

12.7. Executing an action immediately: the Execute Function

We've been showing you how to use Action factories in the Command function. You can also execute an Action returned by a factory (or actually, any Action) at the time the SConscript file is read by using the Execute function. For example, if we need to make sure that a directory exists before we build any targets,

Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory'))

Notice that this will create the directory while the SConscript file is being read:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Mkdir("/tmp/my_temp_directory")
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
scons: `.' is up to date.
scons: done building targets.

If you're familiar with Python, you may wonder why you would want to use this instead of just calling the native Python os.mkdir() function. The advantage here is that the Mkdir action will behave appropriately if the user specifies the SCons -n or -q options--that is, it will print the action but not actually make the directory when -n is specified, or make the directory but not print the action when -q is specified.

The Execute function returns the exit status or return value of the underlying action being executed. It will also print an error message if the action fails and returns a non-zero value. SCons will not, however, actually stop the build if the action fails. If you want the build to stop in response to a failure in an action called by Execute, you must do so by explicitly checking the return value and calling the Exit function (or a Python equivalent):

if Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/my_temp_directory')):
    # A problem occurred while making the temp directory.
    Exit(1)

[3] Unfortunately, in the early days of SCons design, we used the name Copy for the function that returns a copy of the environment, otherwise that would be the logical choice for a Builder that copies a file or directory tree to a target location.

Chapter 13. Controlling Removal of Targets

There are two occasions when SCons will, by default, remove target files. The first is when SCons determines that a target file needs to be rebuilt and removes the existing version of the target before executing The second is when SCons is invoked with the -c option to "clean" a tree of its built targets. These behaviors can be suppressed with the Precious and NoClean functions, respectively.

13.1. Preventing target removal during build: the Precious Function

By default, SCons removes targets before building them. Sometimes, however, this is not what you want. For example, you may want to update a library incrementally, not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from all of the constituent object files. In such cases, you can use the Precious method to prevent SCons from removing the target before it is built:

  env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
  lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
  env.Precious(lib)

Although the output doesn't look any different, SCons does not, in fact, delete the target library before rebuilding it:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o

SCons will, however, still delete files marked as Precious when the -c option is used.

13.2. Preventing target removal during clean: the NoClean Function

By default, SCons removes all built targets when invoked with the -c option to clean a source tree of built targets. Sometimes, however, this is not what you want. For example, you may want to remove only intermediate generated files (such as object files), but leave the final targets (the libraries) untouched. In such cases, you can use the NoClean method to prevent SCons from removing a target during a clean:

env = Environment(RANLIBCOM='')
lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
env.NoClean(lib)

Notice that the libfoo.a is not listed as a removed file:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
ar rc libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
% scons -c
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Cleaning targets ...
Removed f1.o
Removed f2.o
Removed f3.o
scons: done cleaning targets.

13.3. Removing additional files during clean: the Clean Function

There may be additional files that you want removed when the -c option is used, but which SCons doesn't know about because they're not normal target files. For example, perhaps a command you invoke creates a log file as part of building the target file you want. You would like the log file cleaned, but you don't want to have to teach SCons that the command "builds" two files.

You can use the Clean function to arrange for additional files to be removed when the -c option is used. Notice, however, that the Clean function takes two arguments, and the second argument is the name of the additional file you want cleaned (foo.log in this example):

t = Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', 'build -o $TARGET $SOURCE')
Clean(t, 'foo.log')

The first argument is the target with which you want the cleaning of this additional file associated. In the above example, we've used the return value from the Command function, which represents the foo.out target. Now whenever the foo.out target is cleaned by the -c option, the foo.log file will be removed as well:

% scons -Q
build -o foo.out foo.in
% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.out
Removed foo.log

Chapter 14. Hierarchical Builds

The source code for large software projects rarely stays in a single directory, but is nearly always divided into a hierarchy of directories. Organizing a large software build using SCons involves creating a hierarchy of build scripts which are connected together using the SConscript function.

14.1. SConscript Files

As we've already seen, the build script at the top of the tree is called SConstruct. The top-level SConstruct file can use the SConscript function to include other subsidiary scripts in the build. These subsidiary scripts can, in turn, use the SConscript function to include still other scripts in the build. By convention, these subsidiary scripts are usually named SConscript. For example, a top-level SConstruct file might arrange for four subsidiary scripts to be included in the build as follows:

SConscript(
    [
        'drivers/display/SConscript',
        'drivers/mouse/SConscript',
        'parser/SConscript',
        'utilities/SConscript',
    ]
)

In this case, the SConstruct file lists all of the SConscript files in the build explicitly. (Note, however, that not every directory in the tree necessarily has an SConscript file.) Alternatively, the drivers subdirectory might contain an intermediate SConscript file, in which case the SConscript call in the top-level SConstruct file would look like:

SConscript(['drivers/SConscript', 'parser/SConscript', 'utilities/SConscript'])

And the subsidiary SConscript file in the drivers subdirectory would look like:

SConscript(['display/SConscript', 'mouse/SConscript'])

Whether you list all of the SConscript files in the top-level SConstruct file, or place a subsidiary SConscript file in intervening directories, or use some mix of the two schemes, is up to you and the needs of your software.

14.2. Path Names Are Relative to the SConscript Directory

Subsidiary SConscript files make it easy to create a build hierarchy because all of the file and directory names in a subsidiary SConscript files are interpreted relative to the directory in which that SConscript file lives. Typically, this allows the SConscript file containing the instructions to build a target file to live in the same directory as the source files from which the target will be built, making it easy to update how the software is built whenever files are added or deleted (or other changes are made). It also tends to keep scripts more readable as they don't need to be filled with complex paths.

For example, suppose we want to build two programs prog1 and prog2 in two separate directories with the same names as the programs. One typical way to do this would be with a top-level SConstruct file like this:

SConscript(['prog1/SConscript', 'prog2/SConscript'])

And subsidiary SConscript files that look like this:

env = Environment()
env.Program('prog1', ['main.c', 'foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

And this:

env = Environment()
env.Program('prog2', ['main.c', 'bar1.c', 'bar2.c'])

Then, when we run SCons in the top-level directory, our build looks like:

% scons -Q
cc -o prog1/foo1.o -c prog1/foo1.c
cc -o prog1/foo2.o -c prog1/foo2.c
cc -o prog1/main.o -c prog1/main.c
cc -o prog1/prog1 prog1/main.o prog1/foo1.o prog1/foo2.o
cc -o prog2/bar1.o -c prog2/bar1.c
cc -o prog2/bar2.o -c prog2/bar2.c
cc -o prog2/main.o -c prog2/main.c
cc -o prog2/prog2 prog2/main.o prog2/bar1.o prog2/bar2.o

Notice the following: First, you can have files with the same names in multiple directories, like main.c in the above example. Second, when building, SCons stays in the top-level directory (where the SConstruct file lives) and issues commands that use the path names from the top-level directory to the target and source files within the hierarchy. This works because SCons reads all the SConscript files in one pass, interpreting each in its local context, building up a tree of information, before starting to execute the needed builds in a second pass. This is quite different from some other build tools which implement a hierarchical build by recursing.

14.3. Top-Relative Path Names in Subsidiary SConscript Files

If you need to use a file from another directory, it's sometimes more convenient to specify the path to a file in another directory from the top-level SConstruct directory, even when you're using that file in a subsidiary SConscript file in a subdirectory. You can tell SCons to interpret a path name as relative to the top-level SConstruct directory, not the local directory of the SConscript file, by prepending a # (hash mark) in front of the path name:

env = Environment()
env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '#lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

In this example, the lib directory is directly underneath the top-level SConstruct directory. If the above SConscript file is in a subdirectory named src/prog, the output would look like:

% scons -Q
cc -o lib/foo1.o -c lib/foo1.c
cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

(Notice that the lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its source file. See Chapter 15, Separating Source and Build Trees: Variant Directories, below, for information about how to build the object file in a different subdirectory.)

A couple of notes on top-relative paths:

SCons doesn't care whether you add a slash after the #. Some people consider '#/lib/foo1.c' more readable than '#lib/foo1.c', but they're functionally equivalent.

The top-relative syntax is only evaluated by SCons, the Python language itself does not understand about it. This becomes immediately obvious if you like to use print for debugging, or write a Python function that wants to evaluate a path. You can force SCons to evaluate a top-relative path and produce a string that can be used by Python code by creating a Node object from it:

path = "#/include"

print("path =", path)
print("force-interpreted path =", Entry(path))

Which shows:

% scons -Q
path = #/include
force-interpreted path = include
scons: `.' is up to date.

14.4. Absolute Path Names

Of course, you can always specify an absolute path name for a file--for example:

env = Environment()
env.Program('prog', ['main.c', '/usr/joe/lib/foo1.c', 'foo2.c'])

Which, when executed, would yield:

% scons -Q
cc -o src/prog/foo2.o -c src/prog/foo2.c
cc -o src/prog/main.o -c src/prog/main.c
cc -o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o -c /usr/joe/lib/foo1.c
cc -o src/prog/prog src/prog/main.o /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o src/prog/foo2.o

(As was the case with top-relative path names, notice that the /usr/joe/lib/foo1.o object file is built in the same directory as its source file. See Chapter 15, Separating Source and Build Trees: Variant Directories, below, for information about how to build the object file in a different subdirectory.)

14.5. Sharing Environments (and Other Variables) Between SConscript Files

In the previous example, each of the subsidiary SConscript files created its own construction environment by calling Environment separately. This obviously works fine, but if each program must be built with the same construction variables, it's cumbersome and error-prone to initialize separate construction environments in the same way over and over in each subsidiary SConscript file.

SCons supports the ability to export variables from an SConscript file so they can be imported by other SConscript files, thus allowing you to share common initialized values throughout your build hierarchy.

14.5.1. Exporting Variables

There are two ways to export a variable from an SConscript file. The first way is to call the Export function. Export is pretty flexible - in the simplest form, you pass it a string that represents the name of the variable, and Export stores that with its value:

env = Environment()
Export('env')

You may export more than one variable name at a time:

env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
Export('env', 'debug')

Because a Python identifier cannot contain spaces, Export assumes a string containing spaces is is a shortcut for multiple variable names to export and splits it up for you:

env = Environment()
debug = ARGUMENTS['debug']
Export('env debug')

You can also pass Export a dictionary of values. This form allows the opportunity to export a variable from the current scope under a different name - in this example, the value of foo is exported under the name "bar":

env = Environment()
foo = "FOO"
args = {"env": env, "bar": foo}
Export(args)

Export will also accept arguments in keyword style. This form adds the ability to create exported variables that have not actually been set locally in the SConscript file. When used this way, the key is the intended variable name, not a string representation as with the other forms:

Export(MODE="DEBUG", TARGET="arm")

The styles can be mixed, though Python function calling syntax requires all non-keyword arguments to precede any keyword arguments in the call.

The Export function adds the variables to a global location from which other SConscript files can import. Calls to Export are cumulative. When you call Export you are actually updating a Python dictionary, so it is fine to export a variable you have already exported, but when doing so, the previous value is lost.

The other way to export is you can specify a list of variables as a second argument to the SConscript function call:

SConscript('src/SConscript', 'env')

Or (preferably, for readability) using the exports keyword argument:

SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='env')

These calls export the specified variables to only the listed SConscript file(s). You may specify more than one SConscript file in a list:

SConscript(['src1/SConscript', 'src2/SConscript'], exports='env')

This is functionally equivalent to calling the SConscript function multiple times with the same exports argument, one per SConscript file.

14.5.2. Importing Variables

Once a variable has been exported from a calling SConscript file, it may be used in other SConscript files by calling the Import function:

Import('env')
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

The Import call makes the previously defined env variable available to the SConscript file. Assuming env is a construction environment, after import it can be used to build programs, libraries, etc. The use case of passing around a construction environment is extremely common in larger scons builds.

Like the Export function, the Import function can be called with multiple variable names:

Import('env', 'debug')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

In this example, we pull in the common construction environment env, and use the value of the debug variable to make a modified copy by passing that to a Clone call.

The Import function will (like Export) split a string containing white-space into separate variable names:

Import('env debug')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

Import prefers a local definition to a global one, so that if there is a global export of foo, and the calling SConscript has exported foo to this SConscript, the import will find the foo exported to this SConscript.

Lastly, as a special case, you may import all of the variables that have been exported by supplying an asterisk to the Import function:

Import('*')
env = env.Clone(DEBUG=debug)
env.Program('prog', ['prog.c'])

If you're dealing with a lot of SConscript files, this can be a lot simpler than keeping arbitrary lists of imported variables up to date in each file.

14.5.3. Returning Values From an SConscript File

Sometimes, you would like to be able to use information from a subsidiary SConscript file in some way. For example, suppose that you want to create one library from object files built by several subsidiary SConscript files. You can do this by using the Return function to return values from the subsidiary SConscript files to the calling file. Like Import and Export, Return takes a string representation of the variable name, not the variable name itself.

If, for example, we have two subdirectories foo and bar that should each contribute an object file to a library, what we'd like to be able to do is collect the object files from the subsidiary SConscript calls like this:

env = Environment()
Export('env')
objs = []
for subdir in ['foo', 'bar']:
    o = SConscript('%s/SConscript' % subdir)
    objs.append(o)
env.Library('prog', objs)

We can do this by using the Return function in the foo/SConscript file like this:

Import('env')
obj = env.Object('foo.c')
Return('obj')

(The corresponding bar/SConscript file should be pretty obvious.) Then, when we run SCons, the object files from the subsidiary subdirectories are all correctly archived in the desired library:

% scons -Q
cc -o bar/bar.o -c bar/bar.c
cc -o foo/foo.o -c foo/foo.c
ar rc libprog.a foo/foo.o bar/bar.o
ranlib libprog.a

Chapter 15. Separating Source and Build Trees: Variant Directories

It is often useful to keep built files completely separate from the source files. Two main benefits are the ability to have different configurations simultaneously without build conflicts, and being version-control friendly.

Consider if you have a project to build an embedded software system for a variety of different controller hardware. The system is able to share a lot of code, so it makes sense to use a common source tree, but certain build options in the source code and header files differ. For a regular in-place build, the build outputs go in the same place as the source code. If you build Controller A first, followed by Controller B, on the Controller B build everything that uses different build options has to be rebuilt since those objects will be different (the build lines, including preprocessor defines, are part of SCons's out-of-date calculation for this reason). If you go back and build for Controller A again, things have to be rebuilt again for the same reason. However, if you can separate the locations of the output files, so each controller has its own location for build outputs, this problem can be avoided.

Having a separated build tree also helps you keep your source tree clean - there is less chance of accidentally checking in build products to version control that were not intended to be checked in. You can add a separated build directory to your version control system's list of items not to track. You can even remove the whole build tree with a single command without risking removing any of the source code.

The key to making this separation work is the ability to do out-of-tree builds: building under a separate root than the sources being built. You set up out-of-tree builds by establishing what SCons calls a variant directory, a place where you can build a single variant of your software (of course you can define more than one of these if you need to). Since SCons tracks targets by their path, it is able to distinguish build products like build/A/network.obj of the Controller A build from build/B/network.obj of the Controller B build, thus avoiding conflicts.

SCons provides two ways to establish variant directories, one through the SConscript function that we have already seen, and the second through a more flexible VariantDir function.

The variant directory mechanism does support doing multiple builds in one invocation of SCons, but the remainder of this chapter will focus on setting up a single build. You can combine these techniques with ones from the previous chapter and elsewhere in this Guide to set up more complex scenarios.

Note

The VariantDir function used to be called BuildDir, a name which was changed because it turned out to be confusing: the SCons functionality differs from a familiar model of a "build directory" implemented by certain other build systems like GNU Autotools. You might still find references to the old name on the Internet in postings about SCons, but it no longer works.

15.1. Specifying a Variant Directory Tree as Part of an SConscript Call

The most straightforward way to establish a variant directory tree relies on the fact that the usual way to set up a build hierarchy is to have an SConscript file in the source directory. If you pass a variant_dir argument to the SConscript function call:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

SCons will then build all of the files in the build directory:

% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% ls build
SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

No files were built in src: the object file build/hello.o and the executable file build/hello were built in the build directory, as expected. But notice that even though our hello.c file actually lives in the src directory, SCons has compiled a build/hello.c file to create the object file, and that file is now seen in build.

You can ask SCons to show the dependency tree to illustrate a bit more:

% scons -Q --tree=prune
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
+-.
  +-SConstruct
  +-build
  | +-build/SConscript
  | +-build/hello
  | | +-build/hello.o
  | |   +-build/hello.c
  | +-build/hello.c
  | +-[build/hello.o]
  +-src
    +-src/SConscript
    +-src/hello.c

What's happened is that SCons has duplicated the hello.c file from the src directory to the build directory, and built the program from there (it also duplicated SConscript). The next section explains why SCons does this.

The nice thing about the SConscript approach is it is almost invisible to you: this build looks just like an ordinary in-place build except for the extra variant_dir argument in the SConscript call. SCons handles all the path adjustments for the out-of-tree build directory while it processes that SConscript file.

15.2. Why SCons Duplicates Source Files in a Variant Directory Tree

When you set up a variant directory, SCons conceptually behaves as if you requested a build in that directory. As noted in the previous chapter, all builds actually happen from the top level directory, but as an aid to understanding how SCons operates, think of it as build in place in the variant directory, not build in source but send build artifacts to the variant directory. It turns out in place builds are easier to get right than out-of-tree builds - so by default SCons simulates an in place build by making the variant directory look just like the source directory. The most straightforward way to do that is by making copies of the files needed for the build.

The most direct reason to duplicate source files in variant directories is simply that some tools (mostly older versions) are written to only build their output files in the same directory as the source files - such tools often don't have any option to specify the output file, and the tool just uses a predefined output file name, or uses a derived variant of the source file name, dropping the result in the same directory. In this case, the choices are either to build the output file in the source directory and move it to the variant directory, or to duplicate the source files in the variant directory.

Additionally, relative references between files can cause problems which are resolved by just duplicating the hierarchy of source files into the variant directory. You can see this at work in use of the C preprocessor #include mechanism with double quotes, not angle brackets:

# include "file.h"

The de facto standard behavior for most C compilers in this case is to first look in the same directory as the source file that contains the #include line, then to look in the directories in the preprocessor search path. Add to this that the SCons implementation of support for code repositories (described below) means not all of the files will be found in the same directory hierarchy, and the simplest way to make sure that the right include file is found is to duplicate the source files into the variant directory, which provides a correct build regardless of the original location(s) of the source files.

Although source-file duplication guarantees a correct build even in these edge cases, it can usually be safely disabled. The next section describes how you can disable the duplication of source files in the variant directory.

15.3. Telling SCons to Not Duplicate Source Files in the Variant Directory Tree

In most cases and with most tool sets, SCons can use sources directly from the source directory without duplicating them into the variant directory before building, and everything will work just fine. You can disable the default SCons duplication behavior by specifying duplicate=False when you call the SConscript function:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build', duplicate=False)

When this flag is specified, the results of a build look more like the mental model people may have from other build systems - that is, the output files end up in the variant directory while the source files do not.

% ls src
SConscript
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -c src/hello.c -o build/hello.o
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello
hello.o

If disabling duplication causes any problems, just return to the more cautious approach by letting SCons go back to duplicating files.

15.4. The VariantDir Function

You can also use the VariantDir function to establish that target files should be built in a separate directory tree from the source files:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')

When using this form, you have to tell SCons that sources and targets are in the variant directory, and those references will trigger the remapping, necessary file copying, etc. for an already established variant directory. Here is the same example in a more spelled out form to show this more clearly:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
env = Environment()
env.Program(target='build/hello', source=['build/hello.c'])

When using the VariantDir function directly, SCons still duplicates the source files in the variant directory by default:

% ls src
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello  hello.c  hello.o

You can specify the same duplicate=False argument that you can specify for an SConscript call:

VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=False)
env = Environment()
env.Program('build/hello.c')

In which case SCons will disable duplication of the source files:

% ls src
hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c src/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
hello  hello.o

15.5. Using VariantDir With an SConscript File

Even when using the VariantDir function, it is more natural to use it with a subsidiary SConscript file, because then you don't have to adjust your individual build instructions to use the variant directory path. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like this:

env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')

Then our SConstruct file could look like:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

Yielding the following output:

% ls src
SConscript  hello.c
% scons -Q
cc -o build/hello.o -c build/hello.c
cc -o build/hello build/hello.o
% ls build
SConscript  hello  hello.c  hello.o

This is completely equivalent to the use of SConscript with the variant_dir argument from earlier in this chapter, but did require calling the SConscript using the already established variant directory path to trigger that behavior. If you call SConscript('src/SConscript') you would get a normal in-place build in src.

15.6. Using Glob with VariantDir

The Glob file name pattern matching function works just as usual when using VariantDir. For example, if the src/SConscript looks like this:

env = Environment()
env.Program('hello', Glob('*.c'))

Then with the same SConstruct file as in the previous section, and source files f1.c and f2.c in src, we would see the following output:

% ls src
SConscript  f1.c  f2.c  f2.h
% scons -Q
cc -o build/f1.o -c build/f1.c
cc -o build/f2.o -c build/f2.c
cc -o build/hello build/f1.o build/f2.o
% ls build
SConscript  f1.c  f1.o  f2.c  f2.h  f2.o  hello

The Glob function returns Nodes in the build/ tree, as you'd expect.

15.7. Variant Build Examples

The variant_dir keyword argument of the SConscript function provides everything we need to show how easy it is to create variant builds using SCons. Suppose, for example, that we want to build a program for both Windows and Linux platforms, but that we want to build it in directory on a network share with separate side-by-side build directories for the Windows and Linux versions of the program. We have to do a little bit of work to construct paths, to make sure unwanted location dependencies don't creep in. The top-relative path reference can be useful here. To avoid writing conditional code based on platform, we can build the variant_dir path dynamically:

platform = ARGUMENTS.get('OS', Platform())

include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

env = Environment(
    PLATFORM=platform,
    BINDIR=bin,
    INCDIR=include,
    LIBDIR=lib,
    CPPPATH=[include],
    LIBPATH=[lib],
    LIBS='world',
)

Export('env')

env.SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

This SConstruct file, when run on a Linux system, yields:

% scons -Q OS=linux
Install file: "build/linux/world/world.h" as "export/linux/include/world.h"
cc -o build/linux/hello/hello.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/hello/hello.c
cc -o build/linux/world/world.o -c -Iexport/linux/include build/linux/world/world.c
ar rc build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
Install file: "build/linux/world/libworld.a" as "export/linux/lib/libworld.a"
cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/lib -lworld
Install file: "build/linux/hello/hello" as "export/linux/bin/hello"

The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:

C:\>scons -Q OS=windows
Install file: "build/windows/world/world.h" as "export/windows/include/world.h"
cl /Fobuild\windows\hello\hello.obj /c build\windows\hello\hello.c /nologo /Iexport\windows\include
cl /Fobuild\windows\world\world.obj /c build\windows\world\world.c /nologo /Iexport\windows\include
lib /nologo /OUT:build\windows\world\world.lib build\windows\world\world.obj
Install file: "build/windows/world/world.lib" as "export/windows/lib/world.lib"
link /nologo /OUT:build\windows\hello\hello.exe /LIBPATH:export\windows\lib world.lib build\windows\hello\hello.obj
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)
Install file: "build/windows/hello/hello.exe" as "export/windows/bin/hello.exe"

In order to build several variants at once when using the variant_dir argument to SConscript, you can call the function repeatedly - this example does so in a loop. Note that the SConscript trick of passing a list of script files, or a list of source directories, does not work with variant_dir, SCons allows only a single SConscript to be given if variant_dir is used.

env = Environment(OS=ARGUMENTS.get('OS'))
for os in ['newell', 'post']:
    SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/' + os)

Chapter 16. Building From Code Repositories

Often, a software project will have one or more central repositories, directory trees that contain source code, or derived files, or both. You can eliminate additional unnecessary rebuilds of files by having SCons use files from one or more code repositories to build files in your local build tree.

16.1. The Repository Method

It's often useful to allow multiple programmers working on a project to build software from source files and/or derived files that are stored in a centrally-accessible repository, a directory copy of the source code tree. (Note that this is not the sort of repository maintained by a source code management system like BitKeeper, CVS, or Subversion.) You use the Repository method to tell SCons to search one or more central code repositories (in order) for any source files and derived files that are not present in the local build tree:

env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/usr/repository1', '/usr/repository2')

Multiple calls to the Repository method will simply add repositories to the global list that SCons maintains, with the exception that SCons will automatically filter out the current directory and any non-existent directories from the list.

16.2. Finding source files in repositories

The above example specifies that SCons will first search for files under the /usr/repository1 tree and next under the /usr/repository2 tree. SCons expects that any files it searches for will be found in the same position relative to the top-level directory. In the above example, if the hello.c file is not found in the local build tree, SCons will search first for a /usr/repository1/hello.c file and then for a /usr/repository2/hello.c file to use in its place.

So given the SConstruct file above, if the hello.c file exists in the local build directory, SCons will rebuild the hello program as normal:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

If, however, there is no local hello.c file, but one exists in /usr/repository1, SCons will recompile the hello program from the source file it finds in the repository:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository1/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

And similarly, if there is no local hello.c file and no /usr/repository1/hello.c, but one exists in /usr/repository2:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c /usr/repository2/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

The Glob function understands about repositories, and will use the same matching algorithm as described for explicitly-listed sources.

16.3. Finding #include files in repositories

You've already seen that SCons will scan the contents of a source file for #include file names and realize that targets built from that source file also depend on the #include file(s). For each directory in the $CPPPATH list, SCons will actually search the corresponding directories in any repository trees and establish the correct dependencies on any #include files that it finds in repository directory.

Unless the C compiler also knows about these directories in the repository trees, though, it will be unable to find the #include files. If, for example, the hello.c file in our previous example includes the hello.h in its current directory, and the hello.h only exists in the repository:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
hello.c:1: hello.h: No such file or directory

In order to inform the C compiler about the repositories, SCons will add appropriate source file inclusion directives (-I or /I flags) to the compilation commands for each directory in the $CPPPATH list. So if you add the current directory to the construction environment $CPPPATH:

env = Environment(CPPPATH=['.'])
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/usr/repository1')

Then re-executing SCons yields:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

The order of the -I options replicates, for the C preprocessor, the same repository-directory search path that SCons uses for its own dependency analysis. If there are multiple repositories and multiple $CPPPATH directories, SCons will add the repository directories to the beginning of each $CPPPATH directory, rapidly multiplying the number of -I flags. If, for example, the $CPPPATH contains three directories (and shorter repository path names!):

env = Environment(CPPPATH=['dir1', 'dir2', 'dir3'])
env.Program('hello.c')
Repository('/r1', '/r2')

Then you'll end up with nine -I options on the command line, three (for each of the $CPPPATH directories) times three (for the local directory plus the two repositories):

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -Idir1 -I/r1/dir1 -I/r2/dir1 -Idir2 -I/r1/dir2 -I/r2/dir2 -Idir3 -I/r1/dir3 -I/r2/dir3 hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

16.3.1. Limitations on #include files in repositories

SCons relies on the C compiler's -I options to control the order in which the preprocessor will search the repository directories for #include files. This causes a problem, however, with how the C preprocessor handles #include lines with the file name included in double-quotes.

As you've seen, SCons will compile the hello.c file from the repository if it doesn't exist in the local directory. If, however, the hello.c file in the repository contains a #include line with the file name in double quotes:

# include "hello.h"
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf(HELLO_MESSAGE);
    return (0);
}

Then the C preprocessor will always use a hello.h file from the repository directory first, even if there is a hello.h file in the local directory, despite the fact that the command line specifies -I as the first option:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c -I. -I/usr/repository1 /usr/repository1/hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

This behavior of the C preprocessor--always search for a #include file in double-quotes first in the same directory as the source file, and only then search the -I--can not, in general, be changed. In other words, it's a limitation that must be lived with if you want to use code repositories in this way. There are three ways you can possibly work around this C preprocessor behavior:

Some modern versions of C compilers do have an option to disable or control this behavior. If so, add that option to $CFLAGS (or $CXXFLAGS, or both) in your construction environments. Make sure the option is used for all construction environment that use C preprocessing!

Change all occurrences of #include "file.h" to #include <file.h>. Use of #include with angle brackets does not have the same behavior--the -I directories are searched first for #include files--which gives SCons direct control over the list of directories the C preprocessor will search.

Require that everyone working with compilation from repositories check out and work on entire directories of files, not individual files. (If you use local wrapper scripts around your source code control system's command, you could add logic to enforce this restriction there.

16.4. Finding the SConstruct file in repositories

SCons will also search in repositories for the SConstruct file and any specified SConscript files. This poses a problem, though: how can SCons search a repository tree for an SConstruct file if the SConstruct file itself contains the information about the pathname of the repository? To solve this problem, SCons allows you to specify repository directories on the command line using the -Y option:

% scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1 -Y /usr/repository2

When looking for source or derived files, SCons will first search the repositories specified on the command line, and then search the repositories specified in the SConstruct or SConscript files.

Note that while other files are searched through the chain of repositories, SConstruct is special - it must be found either in the current directory or the first directory specified using the -Y (or the --repository or --srcdir synonyms) command line option, or the build will abort.

16.5. Finding derived files in repositories

If a repository contains not only source files, but also derived files (such as object files, libraries, or executables), SCons will perform its normal signature calculation to decide if a derived file in a repository is up-to-date, or if it needs to be rebuilt in the local build directory. For the SCons signature calculation to work correctly, a repository tree must contain the .sconsign files that SCons uses to keep track of signature information.

Usually, this would be done by a build integrator who would run SCons in the repository to create all of its derived files and .sconsign files, or who would run SCons in a separate build directory and copy the resulting tree to the desired repository:

% cd /usr/repository1
% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o file1.o file2.o

(Note that this is safe even if the SConstruct file lists /usr/repository1 as a repository, because SCons will remove the current build directory from its repository list for that invocation.)

Now, with the repository populated, you only need to create the one local source file you're interested in working with at the moment, and use the -Y option to tell SCons to fetch any other files it needs from the repository:

% cd $HOME/build
% edit hello.c
% scons -Q -Y /usr/repository1
cc -c -o hello.o hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o /usr/repository1/file1.o /usr/repository1/file2.o

Notice that SCons realizes that it does not need to rebuild local copies file1.o and file2.o files, but instead uses the already-compiled files from the repository.

16.6. Guaranteeing local copies of files

If the repository tree contains the complete results of a build, and you try to build from the repository without any files in our local tree, something moderately surprising happens:

% mkdir $HOME/build2
% cd $HOME/build2
% scons -Q -Y /usr/all/repository hello
scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

Why does SCons say that the hello program is up-to-date when there is no hello program in the local build directory? Because the repository contains the hello program, and SCons correctly determines that nothing needs to be done to rebuild that up-to-date copy of the file.

There are, however, times when you want to ensure that a local copy of a file always exists. For example, if you are packaging the result of the build, all the files used in the package need to be present locally, and the packaging tool is unlikely to know anything about SCons repositories. Similarly, if you build a unit test program, and then expect to run after the build, it doesn't help if the test program is somewhere else and wasn't rebuilt into the local directory. In these cases, you can tell SCons to make a copy of any up-to-date repository file in the local build directory, use the Local function:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
Local(hello)

Now, if you run the same command, SCons will make a local copy of the program from the repository copy, and tell you that it is doing so:

% scons -Y /usr/all/repository hello
Local copy of hello from /usr/all/repository/hello
scons: `hello' is up-to-date.

(Notice that, because the act of making the local copy is not considered a "build" of the hello file, SCons still reports that it is up-to-date.)

16.7. Using Repository to separate source and build.

If you want to just do a build where the build artifacts don't pollute the source directory, the repository mechanism can help with that. Here's an example: checkout or unpack your project in the directory src, and then build it in build:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ scons -Q -Y ../src
gcc -o foo.o -I. -I/path/to/src -c /path/to/src/foo.c
gcc -o foo foo.o
$ ls
foo  foo.o

It can become awkward to keep having to type -Y path-to-repo repeatedly. If so, the option can be placed in SCONSFLAGS.

Chapter 17. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Builders

Although SCons provides many useful methods for building common software products (programs, libraries, documents, etc.), you frequently want to be able to build some other type of file not supported directly by SCons. Fortunately, SCons makes it very easy to define your own Builder objects for any custom file types you want to build. (In fact, the SCons interfaces for creating Builder objects are flexible enough and easy enough to use that all of the SCons built-in Builder objects are created using the mechanisms described in this section.)

17.1. Writing Builders That Execute External Commands

The simplest Builder to create is one that executes an external command. For example, if we want to build an output file by running the contents of the input file through a command named foobuild, creating that Builder might look like:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')

All the above line does is create a free-standing Builder object. The next section will show how to actually use it.

17.2. Attaching a Builder to a Construction Environment

A Builder object isn't useful until it's attached to a construction environment so that we can call it to arrange for files to be built. This is done through the $BUILDERS construction variable in an environment. The $BUILDERS variable is a Python dictionary that maps the names by which you want to call various Builder objects to the objects themselves. For example, if we want to call the Builder we just defined by the name Foo, our SConstruct file might look like:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})

With the Builder attached to our construction environment with the name Foo, we can now actually call it like so:

env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')

Then, when we run SCons it looks like:

% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo

Note, however, that the default $BUILDERS variable in a construction environment comes with a default set of Builder objects already defined: Program, Library, etc. And when we explicitly set the $BUILDERS variable when we create the construction environment, the default Builders are no longer part of the environment:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q
AttributeError: Builder or other environment method 'Program' not found.
Check spelling, check external program exists in env['ENV']['PATH'],
and check that a suitable tool is being loaded:
  File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 7:
    env.Program('hello.c')
  File "SCons/Environment.py", line 1309:
    raise AttributeError(

To be able to use both our own defined Builder objects and the default Builder objects in the same construction environment, you can either add to the $BUILDERS variable using the Append function:

env = Environment()
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env.Append(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

Or you can explicitly set the appropriately-named key in the $BUILDERS dictionary:

env = Environment()
bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env['BUILDERS']['Foo'] = bld
env.Foo('file.foo', 'file.input')
env.Program('hello.c')

Either way, the same construction environment can then use both the newly-defined Foo Builder and the default Program Builder:

% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

17.3. Letting SCons Handle The File Suffixes

By supplying additional information when you create a Builder, you can let SCons add appropriate file suffixes to the target and/or the source file. For example, rather than having to specify explicitly that you want the Foo Builder to build the file.foo target file from the file.input source file, you can give the .foo and .input suffixes to the Builder, making for more compact and readable calls to the Foo Builder:

bld = Builder(
    action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file1')
env.Foo('file2')

% scons -Q
foobuild < file1.input > file1.foo
foobuild < file2.input > file2.foo

You can also supply a prefix keyword argument if it's appropriate to have SCons append a prefix to the beginning of target file names.

17.4. Builders That Execute Python Functions

In SCons, you don't have to call an external command to build a file. You can, instead, define a Python function that a Builder object can invoke to build your target file (or files). Such a builder function definition looks like:

def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

The arguments of a builder function are:

target

A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be built by this function. The file names of these target(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

source

A list of Node objects representing the sources to be used by this function to build the targets. The file names of these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

env

The construction environment used for building the target(s). The function may use any of the environment's construction variables in any way to affect how it builds the targets.

The function will be constructed as a SCons FunctionAction and must return a 0 or None value if the target(s) are built successfully. The function may raise an exception or return any non-zero value to indicate that the build is unsuccessful. For more information on Actions see the Action Objects section of the man page.

Once you've defined the Python function that will build your target file, defining a Builder object for it is as simple as specifying the name of the function, instead of an external command, as the Builder's action argument:

def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

bld = Builder(
    action=build_function,
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

And notice that the output changes slightly, reflecting the fact that a Python function, not an external command, is now called to build the target file:

% scons -Q
build_function(["file.foo"], ["file.input"])

17.5. Builders That Create Actions Using a Generator

SCons Builder objects can create an action "on the fly" by using a function called a Generator. (Note: this is not the same thing as a Python generator function described in PEP 255) This provides a great deal of flexibility to construct just the right list of commands to build your target. A generator looks like:

def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (target[0], source[0])

The arguments of a generator are:

source

A list of Node objects representing the sources to be built by the command or other action generated by this function. The file names of these source(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

target

A list of Node objects representing the target or targets to be built by the command or other action generated by this function. The file names of these target(s) may be extracted using the Python str function.

env

The construction environment used for building the target(s). The generator may use any of the environment's construction variables in any way to determine what command or other action to return.

for_signature

A flag that specifies whether the generator is being called to contribute to a build signature, as opposed to actually executing the command.

The generator must return a command string or other action that will be used to build the specified target(s) from the specified source(s).

Once you've defined a generator, you create a Builder to use it by specifying the generator keyword argument instead of action.

def generate_actions(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return 'foobuild < %s > %s' % (source[0], target[0])

bld = Builder(
    generator=generate_actions,
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

% scons -Q
foobuild < file.input > file.foo

Note that it's illegal to specify both an action and a generator for a Builder.

17.6. Builders That Modify the Target or Source Lists Using an Emitter

SCons supports the ability for a Builder to modify the lists of target(s) from the specified source(s). You do this by defining an emitter function that takes as its arguments the list of the targets passed to the builder, the list of the sources passed to the builder, and the construction environment. The emitter function should return the modified lists of targets that should be built and sources from which the targets will be built.

For example, suppose you want to define a Builder that always calls a foobuild program, and you want to automatically add a new target file named new_target and a new source file named new_source whenever it's called. The SConstruct file might look like this:

def modify_targets(target, source, env):
    target.append('new_target')
    source.append('new_source')
    return target, source

bld = Builder(
    action='foobuild $TARGETS - $SOURCES',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
    emitter=modify_targets,
)
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld})
env.Foo('file')

And would yield the following output:

% scons -Q
foobuild file.foo new_target - file.input new_source

One very flexible thing that you can do is use a construction variable to specify different emitter functions for different construction environments. To do this, specify a string containing a construction variable expansion as the emitter when you call the Builder function, and set that construction variable to the desired emitter function in different construction environments:

bld = Builder(
    action='./my_command $SOURCES > $TARGET',
    suffix='.foo',
    src_suffix='.input',
    emitter='$MY_EMITTER',
)

def modify1(target, source, env):
    return target, source + ['modify1.in']

def modify2(target, source, env):
    return target, source + ['modify2.in']

env1 = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld}, MY_EMITTER=modify1)
env2 = Environment(BUILDERS={'Foo': bld}, MY_EMITTER=modify2)
env1.Foo('file1')
env2.Foo('file2')

In this example, the modify1.in and modify2.in files get added to the source lists of the different commands:

% scons -Q
./my_command file1.input modify1.in > file1.foo
./my_command file2.input modify2.in > file2.foo

17.7. Modifying a Builder by adding an Emitter

Defining an emitter to work with a custom Builder is a powerful concept, but sometimes all you really want is to be able to use an existing builder but change its concept of what targets are created. In this case, trying to recreate the logic of an existing Builder to supply a special emitter can be a lot of work. The typical case for this is when you want to use a compiler flag that causes additional files to be generated. For example the GNU linker accepts an option -Map which outputs a link map to the file specified by the option's argument. If this option is just supplied to the build, SCons will not consider the link map file a tracked target, which has various undesirable effects.

To help with this, SCons provides construction variables which correspond to a few standard builders: $PROGEMITTER for Program; $LIBEMITTER for Library; $SHLIBEMITTER for SharedLibrary and $LDMODULEEMITTER for LoadableModule;. Adding an emitter to one of these will cause it to be invoked in addition to any existing emitter for the corresponding builder.

This example adds map creation as a linker flag, and modifies the standard Program emitter to know that map generation is a side-effect:

env = Environment()
map_filename = "${TARGET.name}.map"

def map_emitter(target, source, env):
    target.append(map_filename)
    return target, source

env.Append(LINKFLAGS="-Wl,-Map={},--cref".format(map_filename))
env.Append(PROGEMITTER=map_emitter)
env.Program('hello.c')

If you run this example, adding an option to tell SCons to dump some information about the dependencies it knows, it shows the map file option in use, and that SCons indeed knows about the map file, it's not just a silent side effect of the compiler:

% scons -Q --tree=prune
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello -Wl,-Map=hello.map,--cref hello.o
+-.
  +-SConstruct
  +-hello
  | +-hello.o
  |   +-hello.c
  +-hello.c
  +-hello.map
  | +-[hello.o]
  +-[hello.o]

17.8. Where To Put Your Custom Builders and Tools

The site_scons directories give you a place to put Python modules and packages that you can import into your SConscript files (at the top level), add-on tools that can integrate into SCons (in a site_tools subdirectory), and a site_scons/site_init.py file that gets read before any SConstruct or SConscript file, allowing you to change SCons's default behavior.

Each system type (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) searches a canonical set of directories for site_scons; see the man page for details. The top-level SConstruct's site_scons directory (that is, the one in the project) is always searched last, and its directory is placed first in the tool path so it overrides all others.

If you get a tool from somewhere (the SCons wiki or a third party, for instance) and you'd like to use it in your project, a site_scons directory is the simplest place to put it. Tools come in two flavors; either a Python function that operates on an Environment or a Python module or package containing two functions, exists() and generate().

A single-function Tool can just be included in your site_scons/site_init.py file where it will be parsed and made available for use. For instance, you could have a site_scons/site_init.py file like this:

def TOOL_ADD_HEADER(env):
    """A Tool to add a header from $HEADER to the source file"""
    add_header = Builder(
        action=['echo "$HEADER" > $TARGET', 'cat $SOURCE >> $TARGET']
    )
    env.Append(BUILDERS={'AddHeader': add_header})
    env['HEADER'] = ''  # set default value

and a SConstruct like this:

# Use TOOL_ADD_HEADER from site_scons/site_init.py

env=Environment(tools=['default', TOOL_ADD_HEADER], HEADER="=====")
env.AddHeader('tgt', 'src')

The TOOL_ADD_HEADER tool method will be called to add the AddHeader tool to the environment.

A more full-fledged tool with exists() and generate() methods can be installed either as a module in the file site_scons/site_tools/toolname.py or as a package in the directory site_scons/site_tools/toolname. In the case of using a package, the exists() and generate() are in the file site_scons/site_tools/toolname/__init__.py. (In all the above case toolname is replaced by the name of the tool.) Since site_scons/site_tools is automatically added to the head of the tool search path, any tool found there will be available to all environments. Furthermore, a tool found there will override a built-in tool of the same name, so if you need to change the behavior of a built-in tool, site_scons gives you the hook you need.

Many people have a collection of utility Python functions they'd like to include in their SConscript files: just put them in site_scons/my_utils.py or any valid Python module name of your choice. For instance, you can do something like this in site_scons/my_utils.py to add build_id and MakeWorkDir functions:

from SCons.Script import *  # for Execute and Mkdir

def build_id():
    """Return a build ID (stub version)"""
    return "100"

def MakeWorkDir(workdir):
    """Create the specified dir immediately"""
    Execute(Mkdir(workdir))

And then in your SConscript or any sub-SConscript anywhere in your build, you can import my_utils and use it:

import my_utils
print("build_id=" + my_utils.build_id())
my_utils.MakeWorkDir('/tmp/work')

You can put this collection in its own module in a site_scons and import it as in the example, or you can include it in site_scons/site_init.py, which is automatically imported (unless you disable site directories). Note that in order to refer to objects in the SCons namespace such as Environment or Mkdir or Execute in any file other than a SConstruct or SConscript you always need to do

from SCons.Script import *

This is true of modules in site_scons such as site_scons/site_init.py as well.

You can use any of the user- or machine-wide site directories such as ~/.scons/site_scons instead of ./site_scons, or use the --site-dir option to point to your own directory. site_init.py and site_tools will be located under that directory. To avoid using a site_scons directory at all, even if it exists, use the --no-site-dir option.

Chapter 18. Not Writing a Builder: the Command Builder

Creating a Builder and attaching it to a construction environment allows for a lot of flexibility when you want to re-use actions to build multiple files of the same type. This can, however, be cumbersome if you only need to execute one specific command to build a single file (or group of files). For these situations, SCons supports a Command builder that arranges for a specific action to be executed to build a specific file or files. This looks a lot like the other builders (like Program, Object, etc.), but takes as an additional argument the command to be executed to build the file:

env = Environment()
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', "sed 's/x/y/' < $SOURCE > $TARGET")

When executed, SCons runs the specified command, substituting $SOURCE and $TARGET as expected:

% scons -Q
sed 's/x/y/' < foo.in > foo.out

This is often more convenient than creating a Builder object and adding it to the $BUILDERS variable of a construction environment.

Note that the action you specify to the Command Builder can be any legal SCons Action, such as a Python function:

env = Environment()

def build(target, source, env):
    # Whatever it takes to build
    return None

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in', build)

Which executes as follows:

% scons -Q
build(["foo.out"], ["foo.in"])

$SOURCE and $TARGET are expanded in the source and target as well:

env.Command('${SOURCE.base}.out', File('foo.in'), build)
  
Which does the same thing as the previous example, but allows you to write a more generic rule for transforming the source filename to the target filename, since unlike regular Builders, Command does not have any built-in rules for that.

Sidebar: Node Special Attributes

The example uses a Node special attribute (.base, the file without its suffix), a concept which has not been introduced yet, but will appear in several subsequent examples (see details in the Reference Manual section Substitution: Special Attributes). Due to the quirks of SCons' deferred evaluation scheme, node special attribues do not currently work in source and target arguments if the replacement is a string (like 'foo.in'). They do work fine in strings describing actions. You can give SCons a little help by manually converting the filename string to a Node (see Section 5.2, “Explicitly Creating File and Directory Nodes”), which is the approach used in the example.

The method described in Section 9.2, “Controlling How SCons Prints Build Commands: the $*COMSTR Variables” for controlling build output works well when used with pre-defined builders which have pre-defined*COMSTR variables for that purpose, but that is not the case when calling Command, where SCons has no specific knowledge of the action ahead of time. If the action argument to Command is not already an Action object, it will construct one for you with suitable defaults, which include a message based on the type of action. However, you can also construct the Action object yourself to pass to Command, which gives you much more control. Using the action keyword can also help make such lines easier to read. Here's an evolution of the example from above showing this approach:

env = Environment()

def build(target, source, env):
    # Whatever it takes to build
    return None

act = Action(build, cmdstr="Building ${TARGET}")
env.Command('${SOURCE.base}.out', File('foo.in'), action=act)

Which executes as follows:

% scons -Q
Building foo.out

Chapter 19. Extending SCons: Pseudo-Builders and the AddMethod function

The AddMethod function is used to add a method to an environment. It is typically used to add a "pseudo-builder," a function that looks like a Builder but wraps up calls to multiple other Builders or otherwise processes its arguments before calling one or more Builders.

In the following example, we want to install the program into the standard /usr/bin directory hierarchy, but also copy it into a local install/bin directory from which a package might be built:

def install_in_bin_dirs(env, source):
    """Install source in both bin directories"""
    i1 = env.Install("$BIN", source)
    i2 = env.Install("$LOCALBIN", source)
    return [i1[0], i2[0]]  # Return a list, like a normal builder

env = Environment(BIN='/usr/bin', LOCALBIN='#install/bin')
env.AddMethod(install_in_bin_dirs, "InstallInBinDirs")
env.InstallInBinDirs(Program('hello.c'))  # installs hello in both bin directories

This produces the following:

% scons -Q /
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"
Install file: "hello" as "install/bin/hello"

A pseudo-builder is useful because it gives you more flexibility parsing arguments than you can get with a standard Builder. The next example shows a pseudo-builder with a named argument that modifies the filename, and a separate optional argument for a resource file (rather than having the builder figure it out by file extension). This example also demonstrates using the global AddMethod function to add a method to the global Environment class, so it will be available in all subsequently created environments.

def BuildTestProg(env, testfile, resourcefile="", testdir="tests"):
    """Build the test program.

    Prepends "test_" to src and target and puts the target into testdir.
    If the build is running on Windows, also make use of a resource file,
    if supplied.
    """
    srcfile = f"test_{testfile}.c"
    target = f"{testdir}/test_{testfile}"
    if env['PLATFORM'] == 'win32' and resourcefile:
        resfile = env.RES(resourcefile)
        p = env.Program(target, [srcfile, resfile])
    else:
        p = env.Program(target, srcfile)
    return p

AddMethod(Environment, BuildTestProg)

env = Environment()
env.BuildTestProg('stuff', resourcefile='res.rc')

This produces the following on Linux:

% scons -Q
cc -o test_stuff.o -c test_stuff.c
cc -o tests/test_stuff test_stuff.o

And the following on Windows:

C:\>scons -Q
rc /nologo /fores.res res.rc
cl /Fotest_stuff.obj /c test_stuff.c /nologo
link /nologo /OUT:tests\test_stuff.exe test_stuff.obj res.res
embedManifestExeCheck(target, source, env)

Using AddMethod is better than just adding an instance method to a construction environment because it gets called as a proper method, and because AddMethod provides for copying the method to any clones of the construction environment instance.

Chapter 20. Extending SCons: Writing Your Own Scanners

SCons has built-in Scanners that know how to look in C/C++, Fortran, D, IDL, LaTeX, Python and SWIG source files for information about other files that targets built from those files depend on. For example, if you have a file format which uses #include to specify files which should be included into the source file when it is processed, you can use an existing scanner already included in SCons. You can use the same mechanisms that SCons uses to create its built-in Scanners to write Scanners of your own for file types that SCons does not know how to scan "out of the box."

20.1. A Simple Scanner Example

Suppose, for example, that we want to create a simple Scanner for .k files. A .k file contains some text that will be processed, and can include other files on lines that begin with include followed by a file name:

include filename.k

Scanning a file will be handled by a Python function that you must supply. Here is a function that will use the Python re module to scan for the include lines in our example:

import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg=None):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    return env.File(include_re.findall(contents))

It is important to note that you have to return a list of File nodes from the scanner function, simple strings for the file names won't do. As in the examples we are showing here, you can use the File function of your current construction environment in order to create nodes on the fly from a sequence of file names with relative paths.

The scanner function must accept the four specified arguments and return a list of implicit dependencies. Presumably, these would be dependencies found from examining the contents of the file, although the function can perform any manipulation at all to generate the list of dependencies.

node

An SCons node object representing the file being scanned. The path name to the file can be used by converting the node to a string using the str function, or an internal SCons get_text_contents object method can be used to fetch the contents.

env

The construction environment in effect for this scan. The scanner function may choose to use construction variables from this environment to affect its behavior.

path

A list of directories that form the search path for included files for this Scanner. This is how SCons handles the $CPPPATH and $LIBPATH variables.

arg

An optional argument that can be passed to this scanner function when it is called from a scanner instance. The argument is only supplied if it was given when the scanner instance is created (see the manpage section "Scanner Objects"). This can be useful, for example, to distinguish which scanner type called us, if the function might be bound to several scanner objects. Since the argument is only supplied in the function call if it was defined for that scanner, the function needs to be prepared to possibly be called in different ways if multiple scanners are expected to use this function - giving the parameter a default value as shown above is a good way to do this. If the function to scanner relationship will be 1:1, just make sure they match.

A scanner object is created using the Scanner function, which typically takes an skeys argument to associate a file suffix with this Scanner. The scanner object must then be associated with the $SCANNERS construction variable in the current construction environment, typically by using the Append method:

kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'])
env.Append(SCANNERS=kscan)

Let's put this all together. Our new file type, with the .k suffix, will be processed by a command named kprocess, which lives in non-standard location /usr/local/bin, so we add that path to the execution environment so SCons can find it. Here's what it looks like:

import re

include_re = re.compile(r'^include\s+(\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_text_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return env.File(includes)

kscan = Scanner(function=kfile_scan, skeys=['.k'])
env = Environment()
env.AppendENVPath('PATH', '/usr/local/bin')
env.Append(SCANNERS=kscan)

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')

Assume a foo.k file like this:

some initial text
include other_file
some other text

Now if we run scons we can see that the scanner works - it identified the dependency other_file via the detected include line, although we get an error message because we forgot to create that file!

% scons -Q
scons: *** [foo] Implicit dependency `other_file' not found, needed by target`foo'.

20.2. Adding a search path to a Scanner: FindPathDirs

If the build tool in question will use a path variable to search for included files or other dependencies, then the Scanner will need to take that path variable into account as well - the same way $CPPPATH is used for files processed by the C Preprocessor (used for C, C++, Fortran and others). Path variables may be lists of nodes or semicolon-separated strings (SCons uses a semicolon here irrespective of the pathlist separator used by the native operating system), and may contain construction variables to be expanded. A Scanner can take a path_function to process such a path variable; the function produces a tuple of paths that is passed to the scanner function as its path parameter.

To make this easy, SCons provides the premade FindPathDirs function which returns a callable to expand a given path variable (given as an SCons construction variable name) to a tuple of paths at the time the Scanner is called. Deferring evaluation until that point allows, for instance, the path to contain $TARGET references which differ for each file scanned.

Using FindPathDirs is easy. Continuing the above example, using $KPATH as the construction variable to hold the paths (analogous to $CPPPATH), we just modify the call to the Scanner factory function to include a path_function keyword argument:

kscan = Scanner(
    function=kfile_scan,
    skeys=['.k'],
    path_function=FindPathDirs('KPATH'),
)

FindPathDirs is called when the Scanner is created, and the callable object it returns is stored as an attribute in the scanner. When the scanner is invoked, it calls that object, which processes the $KPATH from the current construction environment, doing necessary expansions and, if necessary, adds related repository and variant directories, producing a (possibly empty) tuple of paths that is passed on to the scanner function. The scanner function is then responsible for using that list of paths to locate the include files identified by the scan. The next section will show an example of that.

As a side note, the returned method stores the path in an efficient way so lookups are fast even when variable substitutions may be needed. This is important since many files get scanned in a typical build.

20.3. Using scanners with Builders

One approach for introducing a Scanner into the build is in conjunction with a Builder. There are two relevant optional parameters we can use when creating a Builder: source_scanner and target_scanner. source_scanner is used for scanning source files, and target_scanner is used for scanning the target once it is generated.

import os, re

include_re = re.compile(r"^include\s+(\S+)$", re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg=None):
    includes = include_re.findall(node.get_text_contents())
    print(f"DEBUG: scan of {str(node)!r} found {includes}")
    deps = []
    for inc in includes:
        for dir in path:
            file = str(dir) + os.sep + inc
            if os.path.exists(file):
                deps.append(file)
                break
    print(f"DEBUG: scanned dependencies found: {deps}")
    return env.File(deps)

kscan = Scanner(
    function=kfile_scan,
    skeys=[".k"],
    path_function=FindPathDirs("KPATH"),
)

def build_function(target, source, env):
    # Code to build "target" from "source"
    return None

bld = Builder(
    action=build_function,
    suffix=".k",
    source_scanner=kscan,
    src_suffix=".input",
)

env = Environment(BUILDERS={"KFile": bld}, KPATH="inc")
env.KFile("file")

Running this example would only show that the stub build_function is getting called, so some debug prints were added to the scanner function, just to show the scanner is being invoked.

% scons -Q
DEBUG: scan of 'file.input' found ['other_file']
DEBUG: scanned dependencies found: ['inc/other_file']
build_function(["file.k"], ["file.input"])

The path-search implementation in kfile_scan works, but is quite simple-minded - a production scanner will probably do something more sophisticated.

An emitter function can modify the list of sources or targets passed to the action function when the Builder is triggered.

A scanner function will not affect the list of sources or targets seen by the Builder during the build action. The scanner function will, however, affect if the Builder should rebuild (if any of the files sourced by the Scanner have changed for example).

Chapter 21. Multi-Platform Configuration (Autoconf Functionality)

SCons has integrated support for build configuration similar in style to GNU Autoconf, but designed to be transparently multi-platform. The configuration system can help figure out if external build requirements such as system libraries or header files are available on the build system. This section describes how to use this SCons feature. (See also the SCons man page for additional information).

21.1. Configure Contexts

The basic framework for multi-platform build configuration in SCons is to create a configure context inside a construction environment by calling the Configure function, perform the desired checks for libraries, functions, header files, etc., and then call the configure context's Finish method to finish off the configuration:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)

# Checks for libraries, header files, etc. go here

env = conf.Finish()

The Finish call is required; if a new context is created while a context is active, even in a different construction environment, scons will complain and exit.

SCons provides a number of pre-defined basic checks, as well as a mechanism for adding your own custom checks.

There are a few possible strategies for failing configure checks. Some checks may be for features without which you cannot proceed. The simple approach here is just to exit SCons at that point - a number of the examples in this chapter are coded that way. If there are multiple hard requirements, however, it may be friendlier to the user to set a flag in case of any fails of hard requirements and accumulate a record of them, so that on the completion of the configure context they can all be listed prior to failing the build - as it can be frustrating to have to iterate through the setup, fixing one new requirement each iteration. Other checks may be for features which you can do without, and here the strategy will usually be to set a construction variable which the rest of the build can examine for its absence/presence, or to set particular compiler flags, library lists, etc. as appropriate for the circumstances, so you can proceed with the build appropriately based on available features.

Note that SCons uses its own dependency mechanism to determine when a check needs to be run--that is, SCons does not run the checks every time it is invoked, but caches the values returned by previous checks and uses the cached values unless something has changed. This saves a tremendous amount of developer time while working on cross-platform build issues.

The next sections describe the basic checks that SCons supports, as well as how to add your own custom checks.

21.2. Checking for the Existence of Header Files

Testing the existence of a header file requires knowing what language the header file is. This information is supplied in the language keyword parameter to the CheckHeader method. Since scons grew up in a world of C/C++ code, a configure context also has a CheckCHeader method that specifically checks for the existence of a C header file:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCHeader('math.h'):
    print('Math.h must be installed!')
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckCHeader('foo.h'):
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES='HAS_FOO_H')
env = conf.Finish()

As shown in the example, depending on the circumstances you can choose to terminate the build if a given header file doesn't exist, or you can modify the construction environment based on the presence or absence of a header file (the same applies to any other check). If there are a many elements to check for, it may be friendlier for the user if you do not terminate on the first failure, but track the problems found until the end and report on all of them, that way the user does not have to iterate multiple times, each time finding one new dependency that needs to be installed.

If you need to check for the existence a C++ header file, use the CheckCXXHeader method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckCXXHeader('vector.h'):
    print('vector.h must be installed!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

21.3. Checking for the Availability of a Function

Check for the availability of a specific function using the CheckFunc method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckFunc('strcpy'):
    print('Did not find strcpy(), using local version')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('strcpy','my_local_strcpy'))
env = conf.Finish()

21.4. Checking for the Availability of a Library

Check for the availability of a library using the CheckLib method. You only specify the base part of the library name, you don't need to add a lib prefix or a .a or .lib suffix:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckLib('m'):
    print('Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

Because the ability to use a library successfully often depends on having access to a header file that describes the library's interface, you can check for a library and a header file at the same time by using the CheckLibWithHeader method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckLibWithHeader('m', 'math.h', language='c'):
    print('Did not find libm.a or m.lib, exiting!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

This is essentially shorthand for separate calls to the CheckHeader and CheckLib functions.

21.5. Checking for the Availability of a typedef

Check for the availability of a typedef by using the CheckType method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckType('off_t'):
    print('Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('off_t','int'))
env = conf.Finish()

You can also add a string that will be placed at the beginning of the test file that will be used to check for the typedef. This provides a way to specify files that must be included to find the typedef:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckType('off_t', '#include <sys/types.h>\n'):
    print('Did not find off_t typedef, assuming int')
    conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES=('off_t','int'))
env = conf.Finish()

21.6. Checking the size of a datatype

Check the size of a datatype by using the CheckTypeSize method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
int_size = conf.CheckTypeSize('unsigned int')
print('sizeof unsigned int is', int_size)
env = conf.Finish()

% scons -Q
sizeof unsigned int is 4
scons: `.' is up to date.

21.7. Checking for the Presence of a program

Check for the presence of a program by using the CheckProg method:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env)
if not conf.CheckProg('foobar'):
  print('Unable to find the program foobar on the system')
  Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

21.8. Extending SCons: Adding Your Own Custom Checks

A custom check is a Python function that checks for a certain condition to exist on the running system, usually using methods that SCons supplies to take care of the details of checking whether a compilation succeeds, a link succeeds, a program is runnable, etc. A simple custom check for the existence of a specific library might look as follows:

mylib_test_source_file = """
# include <mylib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
"""

def CheckMyLibrary(context):
    context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary...')
    result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
    context.Result(result)
    return result

The Message and Result methods should typically begin and end a custom check to let the user know what's going on: the Message call prints the specified message (with no trailing newline) and the Result call prints yes if the check succeeds and no if it doesn't. The TryLink method actually tests for whether the specified program text will successfully link.

(Note that a custom check can modify its check based on any arguments you choose to pass it, or by using or modifying the configure context environment in the context.env attribute.)

This custom check function is then attached to the configure context by passing a dictionary to the Configure call that maps a name of the check to the underlying function:

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})

You'll typically want to make the check and the function name the same, as we've done here, to avoid potential confusion.

We can then put these pieces together and actually call the CheckMyLibrary check as follows:

mylib_test_source_file = """
# include <mylib.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    MyLibrary mylib(argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
"""

def CheckMyLibrary(context):
    context.Message('Checking for MyLibrary... ')
    result = context.TryLink(mylib_test_source_file, '.c')
    context.Result(result)
    return result

env = Environment()
conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})
if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
    print('MyLibrary is not installed!')
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish()

# We would then add actual calls like Program() to build

# something using the "env" construction environment

If MyLibrary is not installed on the system, the output will look like:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript file ...
Checking for MyLibrary... no
MyLibrary is not installed!

If MyLibrary is installed, the output will look like:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript file ...
Checking for MyLibrary... yes
scons: done reading SConscript
scons: Building targets ...
    .
    .
    .

21.9. Not Configuring When Cleaning Targets

Using multi-platform configuration as described in the previous sections will run the configuration commands even when invoking scons -c to clean targets:

% scons -Q -c
Checking for MyLibrary... yes
Removed foo.o
Removed foo

Although running the platform checks when removing targets doesn't hurt anything, it's usually unnecessary. You can avoid this by using the GetOption method to check whether the -c (clean) option has been invoked on the command line:

env = Environment()
if not env.GetOption('clean'):
    conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckMyLibrary': CheckMyLibrary})
    if not conf.CheckMyLibrary():
        print('MyLibrary is not installed!')
        Exit(1)
    env = conf.Finish()

% scons -Q -c
Removed foo.o
Removed foo

Chapter 22. Caching Built Files

On multi-developer software projects, you can sometimes speed up every developer's builds a lot by allowing them to share a cache of the derived files that they build. After all, it is relatively rare that any in-progress change affects more than a few derived files, most will be unchanged. Using a cache can also help an individual developer: for example if you wish to start work on a new feature in a clean tree, those build artifacts which could be reused can be retrieved from the cache to populate the tree and save a lot of initial build time. SCons makes this easy and reliable.

22.1. Specifying the Derived-File Cache Directory

To enable caching of derived files, use the CacheDir function in any SConscript file:

CacheDir('/usr/local/build_cache')

The cache directory you specify must have read and write access for all developers who will be accessing the cached files (if --cache-readonly is used, only read access is required). It should also be in some central location that all builds will be able to access. In environments where developers are using separate systems (like individual workstations) for builds, this directory would typically be on a shared or NFS-mounted file system. While SCons will create the specified cache directory as needed, in this multiuser scenario it is usually best to create it ahead of time, so the access rights can be set up correctly.

Here's what happens: When a build has a CacheDir specified, every time a file is built, it is stored in that cache directory indexed by its build signature. On subsequent builds, before an action is invoked to build a file, the build signature is computed and SCons checks the derived-file cache directory to see if a file with the exact same build signature already exists. [4] If so, the derived file will not be built locally, but will be copied into the local build directory from the derived-file cache directory, like this:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
Retrieved`hello' from cache

Note that the CacheDir feature requires that the build signature be calculated, even if you configure SCons to use timestamps to decide if files are up to date (see the Chapter 6, Dependencies chapter for information about the Decider function), since the build signature is used to determine if a target file exists in the cache. Consequently, using CacheDir may reduce or negate any performance improvements from using timestamps for up-to-date decisions.

22.2. Keeping Build Output Consistent

One potential drawback to using a derived-file cache is that the output printed by SCons can be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, because any given file may be rebuilt one time and retrieved from the derived-file cache the next time. This can make analyzing build output more difficult, especially for automated scripts that expect consistent output each time.

If, however, you use the --cache-show option, SCons will print the command line that it would have executed to build the file, even when it is retrieving the file from the derived-file cache. This keeps the build output consistent across builds:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-show
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

The trade-off, of course, is that you no longer know whether or not SCons has retrieved a derived file from cache or has rebuilt it locally.

22.3. Not Using the Derived-File Cache for Specific Files

You may want to disable caching for certain specific files in your configuration. For example, if you only want to put executable files in a central cache, but not the intermediate object files, you can use the NoCache function to specify that the object files should not be cached:

env = Environment()
obj = env.Object('hello.c')
env.Program('hello.c')
CacheDir('cache')
NoCache('hello.o')

Then, when you run scons after cleaning the built targets, it will recompile the object file locally (since it doesn't exist in the derived-file cache directory), but still realize that the derived-file cache directory contains an up-to-date executable program that can be retrieved instead of re-linking:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
Retrieved `hello' from cache

22.4. Disabling the Derived-File Cache

Retrieving an already-built file from the derived-file cache is usually a significant time-savings over rebuilding the file, but how much of a savings (or even whether it saves time at all) can depend a great deal on your system or network configuration. For example, retrieving cached files from a busy server over a busy network might end up being slower than rebuilding the files locally.

In these cases, you can specify the --cache-disable command-line option to tell SCons to not retrieve already-built files from the derived-file cache directory:

% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q
Retrieved `hello.o' from cache
Retrieved`hello' from cache
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

22.5. Populating a Derived-File Cache With Already-Built Files

Sometimes, you may have one or more derived files already built in your local build tree that you wish to make available to other people doing builds. For example, you may find it more effective to perform integration builds with the cache disabled (per the previous section) and only populate the derived-file cache directory with the built files after the integration build has completed successfully. This way, the cache will only get filled up with derived files that are part of a complete, successful build not with files that might be later overwritten while you debug integration problems.

In this case, you can use the --cache-force option to tell SCons to put all derived files in the cache, even if the files already exist in your local tree from having been built by a previous invocation:

% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q -c
Removed hello.o
Removed hello
% scons -Q --cache-disable
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
% scons -Q --cache-force
scons: `.' is up to date.
% scons -Q
scons:`.' is up to date.

Notice how the above sample run demonstrates that the --cache-disable option avoids putting the built hello.o and hello files in the cache, but after using the --cache-force option, the files have been put in the cache for the next invocation to retrieve.

22.6. Minimizing Cache Contention: the --random Option

If you allow multiple builds to update the derived-file cache directory simultaneously, two builds that occur at the same time can sometimes start "racing" with one another to build the same files in the same order. If, for example, you are linking multiple files into an executable program:

Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

SCons will normally build the input object files on which the program depends in their normal, sorted order:

% scons -Q
cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

But if two such builds take place simultaneously, they may each look in the cache at nearly the same time and both decide that f1.o must be rebuilt and pushed into the derived-file cache directory, then both decide that f2.o must be rebuilt (and pushed into the derived-file cache directory), then both decide that f3.o must be rebuilt... This won't cause any actual build problems--both builds will succeed, generate correct output files, and populate the cache--but it does represent wasted effort.

To alleviate such contention for the cache, you can use the --random command-line option to tell SCons to build dependencies in a random order:

  % scons -Q --random
  cc -o f3.o -c f3.c
  cc -o f1.o -c f1.c
  cc -o f5.o -c f5.c
  cc -o f2.o -c f2.c
  cc -o f4.o -c f4.c
  cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o f4.o f5.o

Multiple builds using the --random option will usually build their dependencies in different, random orders, which minimizes the chances for a lot of contention for same-named files in the derived-file cache directory. Multiple simultaneous builds might still race to try to build the same target file on occasion, but long sequences of inefficient contention should be rare.

Note, of course, the --random option will cause the output that SCons prints to be inconsistent from invocation to invocation, which may be an issue when trying to compare output from different build runs.

If you want to make sure dependencies will be built in a random order without having to specify the --random on very command line, you can use the SetOption function to set the random option within any SConscript file:

SetOption('random', 1)
Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c', 'f4.c', 'f5.c'])

22.7. Using a Custom CacheDir Class

You can customize the behavior of derived-file caching to add your own features, for example to support compressed and/or encrypted cache files, modify cache file permissions to better support shared caches, gather additional statistics and data, etc.

To define custom cache behavior, subclass the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class, specializing those methods you want to change. You can pass this custom class as the custom_class parameter when calling CacheDir for global reach, or when calling env.CacheDir for a specific environment. You can also set the construction variable $CACHEDIR_CLASS to the custom class - this needs to happen before configuring the cache in that environment. SCons will internally invoke and use your custom class when performing cache operations. The below example shows a simple use case of overriding the copy_from_cache method to record the total number of bytes pulled from the cache.

import os
import SCons.CacheDir

class CustomCacheDir(SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir):
    total_retrieved = 0

    @classmethod
    def copy_from_cache(cls, env, src, dst):
        # record total bytes pulled from cache
        cls.total_retrieved += os.stat(src).st_size
        return super().copy_from_cache(env, src, dst)

env = Environment()
env.CacheDir('scons-cache', custom_class=CustomCacheDir)

# 

[4] A few inside details: SCons tracks two main kinds of cryptographic hashes: a content signature, which is a hash of the contents of a file participating in the build (dependencies as well as targets); and a build signature, which is a hash of the elements needed to build a target, such as the command line, the contents of the sources, and possibly information about tools used in the build. The hash function produces a unique signature from its inputs, no other set of inputs can produce that same signature. The build signature from building a target is used as the filename of the target file in the derived-file cache - that way lookups are efficient, just compute a build signature and see if a file exists with that as the name.

The use of the build signature provides protection from conflicts: if two developers have different setups, so they would produce built objects that are not identical, then because the difference in tools will show up in the build signature, which is used as the name of the cache entry, they will end up being stored as separate entries.

Chapter 23. Alias Targets

We've already seen how you can use the Alias function to create a target named install:

env = Environment()
hello = env.Program('hello.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', hello)
env.Alias('install', '/usr/bin')

You can then use this alias on the command line to tell SCons more naturally that you want to install files:

% scons -Q install
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "hello" as "/usr/bin/hello"

Like other Builder methods, though, the Alias method returns an object representing the alias being built. You can then use this object as input to anothother Builder. This is especially useful if you use such an object as input to another call to the Alias Builder, allowing you to create a hierarchy of nested aliases:

env = Environment()
p = env.Program('foo.c')
l = env.Library('bar.c')
env.Install('/usr/bin', p)
env.Install('/usr/lib', l)
ib = env.Alias('install-bin', '/usr/bin')
il = env.Alias('install-lib', '/usr/lib')
env.Alias('install', [ib, il])

This example defines separate install, install-bin, and install-lib aliases, allowing you finer control over what gets installed:

% scons -Q install-bin
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
% scons -Q install-lib
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
ar rc libbar.a bar.o
ranlib libbar.a
Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"
% scons -Q -c /
Removed foo.o
Removed foo
Removed /usr/bin/foo
Removed bar.o
Removed libbar.a
Removed /usr/lib/libbar.a
% scons -Q install
cc -o foo.o -c foo.c
cc -o foo foo.o
Install file: "foo" as "/usr/bin/foo"
cc -o bar.o -c bar.c
ar rc libbar.a bar.o
ranlib libbar.a
Install file: "libbar.a" as "/usr/lib/libbar.a"

Chapter 24. Java Builds

So far, we've been using examples of building C and C++ programs to demonstrate the features of SCons. SCons also supports building Java programs, but Java builds are handled slightly differently, which reflects the ways in which the Java compiler and tools build programs differently than other languages' tool chains.

24.1. Building Java Class Files: the Java Builder

The basic activity when programming in Java, of course, is to take one or more .java files containing Java source code and to call the Java compiler to turn them into one or more .class files. In SCons, you do this by giving the Java Builder a target directory in which to put the .class files, and a source directory that contains the .java files:

Java('classes', 'src')

If the src directory contains three .java source files, then running SCons might look like this:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example3.java

SCons will actually search the src directory tree for all of the .java files. The Java compiler will then create the necessary class files in the classes subdirectory, based on the class names found in the .java files.

24.2. How SCons Handles Java Dependencies

In addition to searching the source directory for .java files, SCons actually runs the .java files through a stripped-down Java parser that figures out what classes are defined. In other words, SCons knows, without you having to tell it, what .class files will be produced by the javac call. So our one-liner example from the preceding section:

Java('classes', 'src')

Will not only tell you reliably that the .class files in the classes subdirectory are up-to-date:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example3.java
% scons -Q classes
scons: `classes' is up to date.

But it will also remove all of the generated .class files, even for inner classes, without you having to specify them manually. For example, if our Example1.java and Example3.java files both define additional classes, and the class defined in Example2.java has an inner class, running scons -c will clean up all of those .class files as well:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example3.java
% scons -Q -c classes
Removed classes/Example1.class
Removed classes/AdditionalClass1.class
Removed classes/Example2$Inner2.class
Removed classes/Example2.class
Removed classes/Example3.class
Removed classes/AdditionalClass3.class

To ensure correct handling of .class dependencies in all cases, you need to tell SCons which Java version is being used. This is needed because Java 1.5 changed the .class file names for nested anonymous inner classes. Use the JAVAVERSION construction variable to specify the version in use. With Java 1.6, the one-liner example can then be defined like this:

Java('classes', 'src', JAVAVERSION='1.6')

See JAVAVERSION in the man page for more information.

24.3. Building Java Archive (.jar) Files: the Jar Builder

After building the class files, it's common to collect them into a Java archive (.jar) file, which you do by calling the Jar Builder. If you want to just collect all of the class files within a subdirectory, you can just specify that subdirectory as the Jar source:

Java(target='classes', source='src')
Jar(target='test.jar', source='classes')

SCons will then pass that directory to the jar command, which will collect all of the underlying .class files:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src src/Example1.java src/Example2.java src/Example3.java
jar cf test.jar classes

If you want to keep all of the .class files for multiple programs in one location, and only archive some of them in each .jar file, you can pass the Jar builder a list of files as its source. It's extremely simple to create multiple .jar files this way, using the lists of target class files created by calls to the Java builder as sources to the various Jar calls:

prog1_class_files = Java(target='classes', source='prog1')
prog2_class_files = Java(target='classes', source='prog2')
Jar(target='prog1.jar', source=prog1_class_files)
Jar(target='prog2.jar', source=prog2_class_files)

This will then create prog1.jar and prog2.jar next to the subdirectories that contain their .java files:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath prog1 prog1/Example1.java prog1/Example2.java
javac -d classes -sourcepath prog2 prog2/Example3.java prog2/Example4.java
jar cf prog1.jar -C classes Example1.class -C classes Example2.class
jar cf prog2.jar -C classes Example3.class -C classes Example4.class

24.4. Building C Header and Stub Files: the JavaH Builder

You can generate C header and source files for implementing native methods, by using the JavaH Builder. There are several ways of using the JavaH Builder. One typical invocation might look like:

classes = Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
JavaH(target='native', source=classes)

The source is a list of class files generated by the call to the Java Builder, and the target is the output directory in which we want the C header files placed. The target gets converted into the -d when SCons runs javah:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.Example3

In this case, the call to javah will generate the header files native/pkg_sub_Example1.h, native/pkg_sub_Example2.h and native/pkg_sub_Example3.h. Notice that SCons remembered that the class files were generated with a target directory of classes, and that it then specified that target directory as the -classpath option to the call to javah.

Although it's more convenient to use the list of class files returned by the Java Builder as the source of a call to the JavaH Builder, you can specify the list of class files by hand, if you prefer. If you do, you need to set the $JAVACLASSDIR construction variable when calling JavaH:

Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
class_file_list = [
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example1.class',
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example2.class',
    'classes/pkg/sub/Example3.class',
]
JavaH(target='native', source=class_file_list, JAVACLASSDIR='classes')

The $JAVACLASSDIR value then gets converted into the -classpath when SCons runs javah:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -d native -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.Example3

Lastly, if you don't want a separate header file generated for each source file, you can specify an explicit File Node as the target of the JavaH Builder:

classes = Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
JavaH(target=File('native.h'), source=classes)

Because SCons assumes by default that the target of the JavaH builder is a directory, you need to use the File function to make sure that SCons doesn't create a directory named native.h. When a file is used, though, SCons correctly converts the file name into the javah -o option:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/Example2.java src/pkg/sub/Example3.java
javah -o native.h -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2 pkg.sub.Example3

Note that the javah command was removed from the JDK as of JDK 10, and the approved method (available since JDK 8) is to use javac to generate native headers at the same time as the Java source code is compiled. As such the JavaH builder is of limited utility in later Java versions.

24.5. Building RMI Stub and Skeleton Class Files: the RMIC Builder

You can generate Remote Method Invocation stubs by using the RMIC Builder. The source is a list of directories, typically returned by a call to the Java Builder, and the target is an output directory where the _Stub.class and_Skel.class files will be placed:

classes = Java(target='classes', source='src/pkg/sub')
RMIC(target='outdir', source=classes)

As it did with the JavaH Builder, SCons remembers the class directory and passes it as the -classpath option to rmic:

% scons -Q
javac -d classes -sourcepath src/pkg/sub src/pkg/sub/Example1.java src/pkg/sub/Example2.java
rmic -d outdir -classpath classes pkg.sub.Example1 pkg.sub.Example2

This example would generate the files outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Skel.class, outdir/pkg/sub/Example1_Stub.class, outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Skel.class and outdir/pkg/sub/Example2_Stub.class.

Chapter 25. Internationalization and localization with gettext

The gettext toolset supports internationalization and localization of SCons-based projects. Builders provided by gettext automatize generation and updates of translation files. You can manage translations and translation templates similarly to how it's done with autotools.

25.1. Prerequisites

To follow examples provided in this chapter set up your operating system to support two or more languages. In following examples we use locales en_US, de_DE, and pl_PL.

Ensure, that you have GNU gettext utilities installed on your system.

To edit translation files you may wish to install poedit editor.

25.2. Simple project

Let's start with a very simple project, the "Hello world" program for example

/* hello.c _/
# include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char_ argv[])
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return 0;
}

Prepare a SConstruct to compile the program as usual.

# SConstruct

env = Environment()
hello = Program(["hello.c"])

Now we'll convert the project to a multilingual one. If you don't already have GNU gettext utilities installed, install them from your preferred package repository, or download from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/. For the purpose of this example, you should have following three locales installed on your system: en_US, de_DE and pl_PL. On Debian, for example, you may enable certain locales through dpkg-reconfigure locales.

First prepare the hello.c program for internationalization. Change the previous code so it reads as follows:

/* hello.c _/
# include <stdio.h>
# include <libintl.h>
# include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char_ argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  return 0;
}

Detailed recipes for such conversion can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Sources. The gettext("...") has two purposes. First, it marks messages for the xgettext(1) program, which we will use to extract from the sources the messages for localization. Second, it calls the gettext library internals to translate the message at runtime.

Now we shall instruct SCons how to generate and maintain translation files. For that, use the Translate builder and MOFiles builder. The first one takes source files, extracts internationalized messages from them, creates so-called POT file (translation template), and then creates PO translation files, one for each requested language. Later, during the development lifecycle, the builder keeps all these files up-to date. The MOFiles builder compiles the PO files to binary form. Then install the MO files under directory called locale.

The completed SConstruct is as follows:

# SConstruct

env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'gettext'] )
hello = env.Program(["hello.c"])
env['XGETTEXTFLAGS'] = [
  '--package-name=%s' % 'hello',
  '--package-version=%s' % '1.0',
]
po = env.Translate(["pl","en", "de"], ["hello.c"], POAUTOINIT = 1)
mo = env.MOFiles(po)
InstallAs(["locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["en.mo"])
InstallAs(["locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["pl.mo"])
InstallAs(["locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"], ["de.mo"])

Generate the translation files with scons po-update. You should see the output from SCons similar to this:

user@host:$ scons po-update
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Writting 'messages.pot' (new file)
msginit --no-translator -l pl -i messages.pot -o pl.po
Created pl.po.
msginit --no-translator -l en -i messages.pot -o en.po
Created en.po.
msginit --no-translator -l de -i messages.pot -o de.po
Created de.po.
scons: done building targets.

If everything is right, you should see following new files.

user@host:$ ls _.po_
de.po  en.po  messages.pot  pl.po

Open en.po in poedit and provide the English translation to message "Hello world\n". Do the same for de.po (deutsch) and pl.po (polish). Let the translations be, for example:

en: "Welcome to beautiful world!\n"

de: "Hallo Welt!\n"

pl: "Witaj swiecie!\n"

Now compile the project by executing scons. The output should be similar to this:

user@host:$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
msgfmt -c -o de.mo de.po
msgfmt -c -o en.mo en.po
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "de.mo" as "locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
Install file: "en.mo" as "locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

SCons automatically compiled the PO files to binary format MO, and the InstallAs lines installed these files under locale folder.

Your program should be now ready. You may try it as follows (Linux):

user@host:$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 ./hello
Welcome to beautiful world

user@host:$ LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 ./hello
Hallo Welt

user@host:$ LANG=pl_PL.UTF-8 ./hello
Witaj swiecie

To demonstrate the further life of translation files, let's change Polish translation (poedit pl.po) to "Witaj drogi swiecie\n". Run scons to see how scons reacts to this

user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

Now, open hello.c and add another one printf line with new message.

/* hello.c _/
# include <stdio.h>
# include <libintl.h>
# include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char_ argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  printf(gettext("and good bye\n"));
  return 0;
}

Compile project with scons. This time, the msgmerge(1) program is used by SCons to update PO file. The output from compilation is like:

user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Writting 'messages.pot' (messages in file were outdated)
msgmerge --update de.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o de.mo de.po
msgmerge --update en.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o en.mo en.po
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
Install file: "de.mo" as "locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
Install file: "en.mo" as "locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
msgmerge --update pl.po messages.pot
... done.
msgfmt -c -o pl.mo pl.po
Install file: "pl.mo" as "locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo"
scons: done building targets.

The next example demonstrates what happens if we change the source code in such way that the internationalized messages do not change. The answer is that none of translation files (POT, PO) are touched (i.e. no content changes, no creation/modification time changed and so on). Let's append another line to the program (after the last printf), so its code becomes:

/* hello.c _/
# include <stdio.h>
# include <libintl.h>
# include <locale.h>
int main(int argc, char_ argv[])
{
  bindtextdomain("hello", "locale");
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
  textdomain("hello");
  printf(gettext("Hello world\n"));
  printf(gettext("and good bye\n"));
  printf("----------------\n");
  return a;
}

Compile the project. You'll see on your screen

user@host:$scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Entering '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
xgettext --package-name=hello --package-version=1.0 -o - hello.c
Leaving '/home/ptomulik/projects/tmp'
Not writting 'messages.pot' (messages in file found to be up-to-date)
gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c
gcc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.

As you see, the internationalized messages didn't change, so the POT and the rest of translation files have not even been touched.

Chapter 26. Miscellaneous Functionality

SCons supports a lot of additional functionality that doesn't readily fit into the other chapters.

26.1. Verifying the Python Version: the EnsurePythonVersion Function

Although the SCons code itself will run on any 3.x Python version (check the release notes for the precise minimum supported release), you are free to make use of Python syntax and modules from later versions when writing your SConscript files or your own local modules. If you do this, it's usually helpful to configure SCons to exit gracefully with an error message if it's being run with a version of Python that simply won't work with your code. This is especially true if you're going to use SCons to build source code that you plan to distribute publicly, where you can't be sure of the Python version that an anonymous remote user might use to try to build your software.

SCons provides an EnsurePythonVersion function for this. You simply pass it the major and minor versions numbers of the version of Python you require:

EnsurePythonVersion(3, 8)

And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user runs it with an unsupported earlier version of Python:

% scons -Q
Python 3.7 or greater required, but you have Python 3.6.5

26.2. Verifying the SCons Version: the EnsureSConsVersion Function

You may, of course, write your SConscript files to use features that were only added in recent versions of SCons. When you publicly distribute software that is built using SCons, it's helpful to have SCons verify the version being used and exit gracefully with an error message if the user's version of SCons won't work with your SConscript files. SCons provides an EnsureSConsVersion function that verifies the version of SCons in the same the EnsurePythonVersion function verifies the version of Python, by passing in the major and minor versions numbers of the version of SCons you require:

EnsureSConsVersion(1, 0)

And then SCons will exit with the following error message when a user runs it with an unsupported earlier version of SCons:

% scons -Q
SCons 1.0 or greater required, but you have SCons 0.98.5

26.3. Accessing SCons Version: the GetSConsVersion Function

While EnsureSConsVersion is acceptable for most cases, there are times where the user will want to support multiple SCons versions simultaneously. In this scenario, it's beneficial to retrieve version information of the currently executing SCons directly. This was previously only possible by accessing SCons internals. From SCons4.8 onwards, it's now possible to instead call GetSConsVersion to recieve a tuple containing the major, minor, and revision values of the current version.

if GetSConsVersion() >= (4, 9):
    # Some function got a new argument in 4.9 that we want to take advantage of
    SomeFunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
else:
    # Can't use the extended syntax, but it doesn't warrant exiting prematurely
    SomeFunc(arg1, arg2)

26.4. Explicitly Terminating SCons While Reading SConscript Files: the Exit Function

SCons supports an Exit function which can be used to terminate SCons while reading the SConscript files, usually because you've detected a condition under which it doesn't make sense to proceed:

if ARGUMENTS.get('FUTURE'):
    print("The FUTURE option is not supported yet!")
    Exit(2)
env = Environment()
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q FUTURE=1
The FUTURE option is not supported yet!
% scons -Q
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

The Exit function takes as an argument the (numeric) exit status that you want SCons to exit with. If you don't specify a value, the default is to exit with 0, which indicates successful execution.

Note that the Exit function is equivalent to calling the Python sys.exit function (which it actually calls), but because Exit is a SCons function, you don't have to import the Python sys module to use it.

26.5. Searching for Files: the FindFile Function

The FindFile function searches for a file in a list of directories. If there is only one directory, it can be given as a simple string. The function returns a File node if a matching file exists, or None if no file is found. (See the documentation for the Glob function for an alternative way of searching for entries in a directory.)

# one directory

print("%s"%FindFile('missing', '.'))
t = FindFile('exists', '.')
print("%s %s"%(t.__class__, t))

% scons -Q
None
<class 'SCons.Node.FS.File'> exists
scons: `.' is up to date.

# several directories

includes = [ '.', 'include', 'src/include']
headers = [ 'nonesuch.h', 'config.h', 'private.h', 'dist.h']
for hdr in headers:
    print('%-12s: %s'%(hdr, FindFile(hdr, includes)))

% scons -Q
nonesuch.h  : None
config.h    : config.h
private.h   : src/include/private.h
dist.h      : include/dist.h
scons: `.' is up to date.

If the file exists in more than one directory, only the first occurrence is returned.

print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub1', 'sub2', 'sub3']))
print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub2', 'sub3', 'sub1']))
print(FindFile('multiple', ['sub3', 'sub1', 'sub2']))

% scons -Q
sub1/multiple
sub2/multiple
sub3/multiple
scons: `.' is up to date.

In addition to existing files, FindFile will also find derived files (that is, non-leaf files) that haven't been built yet. (Leaf files should already exist, or the build will fail!)

# Neither file exists, so build will fail

Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
print(FindFile('leaf', '.'))
print(FindFile('derived', '.'))

% scons -Q
leaf
derived
cat > derived leaf

# Only 'leaf' exists

Command('derived', 'leaf', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
print(FindFile('leaf', '.'))
print(FindFile('derived', '.'))

% scons -Q
leaf
derived
cat > derived leaf

If a source file exists, FindFile will correctly return the name in the build directory.

# Only 'src/leaf' exists

VariantDir('build', 'src')
print(FindFile('leaf', 'build'))

% scons -Q
build/leaf
scons: `.' is up to date.

26.6. Handling Nested Lists: the Flatten Function

SCons supports a Flatten function which takes an input Python sequence (list or tuple) and returns a flattened list containing just the individual elements of the sequence. This can be handy when trying to examine a list composed of the lists returned by calls to various Builders. For example, you might collect object files built in different ways into one call to the Program Builder by just enclosing them in a list, as follows:

objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

Because the Builder calls in SCons flatten their input lists, this works just fine to build the program:

% scons -Q
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o

But if you were debugging your build and wanted to print the absolute path of each object file in the objects list, you might try the following simple approach, trying to print each Node's abspath attribute:

objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

for object_file in objects:
    print(object_file.abspath)

This does not work as expected because each call to str is operating an embedded list returned by each Object call, not on the underlying Nodes within those lists:

% scons -Q
AttributeError: 'NodeList' object has no attribute 'abspath':
  File "/home/my/project/SConstruct", line 8:
    print(object_file.abspath)

The solution is to use the Flatten function so that you can pass each Node to the str separately:

objects = [
    Object('prog1.c'),
    Object('prog2.c', CCFLAGS='-DFOO'),
]
Program(objects)

for object_file in Flatten(objects):
    print(object_file.abspath)

% scons -Q
/home/me/project/prog1.o
/home/me/project/prog2.o
cc -o prog1.o -c prog1.c
cc -o prog2.o -c -DFOO prog2.c
cc -o prog1 prog1.o prog2.o

26.7. Finding the Invocation Directory: the GetLaunchDir Function

If you need to find the directory from which the user invoked the scons command, you can use the GetLaunchDir function:

env = Environment(
    LAUNCHDIR = GetLaunchDir(),
)
env.Command('directory_build_info',
            '$LAUNCHDIR/build_info'
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

Because SCons is usually invoked from the top-level directory in which the SConstruct file lives, the Python os.getcwd() is often equivalent. However, the SCons -u, -U and -D command-line options, when invoked from a subdirectory, will cause SCons to change to the directory in which the SConstruct file is found. When those options are used, GetLaunchDir will still return the path to the user's invoking subdirectory, allowing the SConscript configuration to still get at configuration (or other) files from the originating directory.

26.8. Declaring Additional Outputs: the SideEffect Function

Sometimes the way an action is defined causes effects on files that SCons does not recognize as targets. The SideEffect method can be used to informs SCons about such files. This can be used just to flag a dependency for use in subsequent build steps, although there is usually a better way to do that. The primary use for the SideEffect method is to prevent two build steps from simultaneously modifying or accessing the same file in a way that could impact each other.

In this example, the rule to build file1 will also put data into log, which is used as a source for the command to generate file2, but log is unknown to SCons on a clean build: it neither exists nor is it a target output by any builder. The SConscript uses SideEffect to inform SCons about the additional output file.

env = Environment()
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2',
    source='log',
    action=Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE')
)
f1 = env.Command(
    target='file1',
    source=[],
    action='echo >$TARGET data1; echo >log updated file1'
)
env.SideEffect('log', f1)

Without the SideEffect, this build would fail with a message Source `log' not found, needed by target`file2', but now it can proceed:

% scons -Q
echo > file1 data1; echo >log updated file1
Copy("file2", "log")

However, it is better to actually identify log as a target, since in this case that's what it is:

env = Environment()
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2',
    source='log',
    action=Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE')
)
f1 = env.Command(
    target=['file1', 'log'],
    source=[],
    action='echo >$TARGET data1; echo >log updated file1'
)

% scons -Q
echo > file1 data1; echo >log updated file1
Copy("file2", "log")

In general, SideEffect is not intended for the case when a command produces extra target files (that is, files which will be used as sources to other build steps). For example, the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is capable of performing incremental linking, for which it uses a status file - such that linking foo.exe also produces a foo.ilk, or uses it if it was already present, if the /INCREMENTAL option was supplied. Specifying foo.ilk as a side effect of foo.exe is not a recommended use of SideEffect since foo.ilk is used by the link. SCons handles side-effect files slightly differently in its analysis of the dependency graph. When a command produces multiple output files, they should be specified as multiple targets of the call to the relevant builder function. The SideEffect function itself should really only be used when it's important to ensure that commands are not executed in parallel, such as when a "peripheral" file (such as a log file) may actually be updated by more than one command invocation.

Unfortunately, the tool which sets up the Program builder for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler chain does not come prebuilt with an understanding of the details of the .ilk example - that the target list would need to change in the presence of that specific option flag. Unlike the trivial example above where we could simply tell the Command builder there were two targets of the action, modifying the chain of events for a builder like Program, though not inherently complex, is definitely an advanced SCons topic. It's okay to use SideEffect here to get started, as long as it comes with an understanding that it's "not quite right". Perhaps leave a comment in the file as a reminder, if it does turn out to cause problems later.

So if the main use is to prevent parallelism problems, here is an example to illustrate. Say a program that you need to call to build a target file will also update a log file describing what the program does while building the target. The following configuration would have SCons invoke a hypothetical script named build (in the local directory) with command-line arguments telling it to write log information to a common logfile.txt file:

env = Environment()
env.Command(
    target='file1.out',
    source='file1.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
env.Command(
    target='file2.out',
    source='file2.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)

This can cause problems when running the build in parallel if SCons decides to update both targets by running both program invocations at the same time. The multiple program invocations may interfere with each other writing to the common log file, leading at best to intermixed output in the log file, and at worst to an actual failed build (on a system like Windows, for example, where only one process at a time can open the log file for writing).

We can make sure that SCons does not run these build commands at the same time by using the SideEffect function to specify that updating the logfile.txt file is a side effect of building the specified file1 and file2 target files:

env = Environment()
f1 = env.Command(
    target='file1.out',
    source='file1.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
f2 = env.Command(
    target='file2.out',
    source='file2.in',
    action='./build --log logfile.txt $SOURCE $TARGET'
)
env.SideEffect('logfile.txt', f1 + f2)

This makes sure the two ./build steps are run sequentially, even with the --jobs=2 in the command line:

% scons -Q --jobs=2
./build --log logfile.txt file1.in file1.out
./build --log logfile.txt file2.in file2.out

The SideEffect function can be called multiple times for the same side-effect file. In fact, the name used as a SideEffect does not even need to actually exist as a file on disk - SCons will still make sure that the relevant targets will be executed sequentially, not in parallel. The side effect is actually a pseudo-target, and SCons mainly cares whether nodes are listed as depending on it, not about its contents.

env = Environment()
f1 = env.Command('file1.out', [], action='echo >$TARGET data1')
env.SideEffect('not_really_updated', f1)
f2 = env.Command('file2.out', [], action='echo >$TARGET data2')
env.SideEffect('not_really_updated', f2)

% scons -Q --jobs=2
echo > file1.out data1
echo > file2.out data2

26.9. Using Python Virtual Environments

Python supports lightweight "virtual environments" (usually abbreviated virtualenv) which allow encapsulation / isolation of package dependencies for a project. When a Python program is executed in the context of a virtualenv, the paths for package imports are amended so the modules in the virtualenv are preferred. Depending on how the virtualenv was configured, system paths may or may not be used as a fallback (the default is not).

SCons itself works as expected when executed within a virtualenv. However, there may be issues if the project needs to build using external commands written in Python which are installed in the virtualenv, or calls the Python interpreter to run a script. SCons launches command actions using a special restricted PATH setting which the new process uses to find executables. This path is part of the execution environment (see Section 7.3, “Controlling the Execution Environment for Issued Commands”), and by default, does not contain any information about the virtualenv. The result can be commands not found, or scripts executed with the system default copy of Python rather than the virtualenv one, possibly causing incorrect imports. If you encounter this problem, SCons provides a mechanism to more fully integrate with a virtualenv.

Use the --enable-virtualenv to import virtualenv-related environment variables to the execution environment ($ENV) and to modify the execution environment's PATH appropriately to prefer the virtualenv executables and Python interpreter.

To make this setting permanent, you can either:

Add it to the SCONSFLAGS environment variable , or

Set SCONS_ENABLE_VIRTUALENV=1 in your environment.

SCONSFLAGS is the preferred approach, as it's easier to manage a single variable controlling SCons behavior than multiples. If enabled by environment variable, the special virtualenv behavior can be disabled for the current run using the --ignore-virtualenv option.

You can query the state at runtime by calling the Virtualenv global function. It returns a path to the virtualenv's home directory, or an empty string if SCons is not running in a virtualenv.

Note

Virtualenv returns a path even if SCons is run from an unactivated virtualenv. A virtualenv does not have to be activated to be used, you only need to use the path to its Python interpreter, but only an activated virtualenv makes available the suitable PATH elements for SCons to copy in when --enable-virtualenv is used.

Chapter 27. Using SCons with other build tools

Sometimes a project needs to interact with other projects in various ways. For example, many open source projects make use of components from other open source projects, and want to use those in their released form, not rewrite their builds into SCons. As another example, sometimes the flexibility and power of SCons is useful for managing the overall project, but developers might like faster incremental builds when making small changes by using a different tool.

This chapter shows some techniques for interacting with other projects and tools effectively from within SCons.

27.1. Creating a Compilation Database

Tooling to perform analysis and modification of source code often needs to know not only the source code itself, but also how it will be compiled, as the compilation line affects the behavior of macros, includes, etc. SCons has a record of this information once it has run, in the form of Actions associated with the sources, and can emit this information so tools can use it.

The Clang project has defined a JSON Compilation Database. This database is in common use as input into Clang tools and many IDEs and editors as well. See JSON Compilation Database Format Specification for complete information. SCons can emit a compilation database in this format by enabling the compilation_db tool and calling the CompilationDatabase builder (available since scons 4.0).

The compilation database can be populated with source and output files either with paths relative to the top of the build, or using absolute paths. This is controlled by COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=(True|False) which defaults to False. The entries in this file can be filtered by using COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER='pattern' where the filter pattern is a string following the Python fnmatch syntax. This filtering can be used for outputting different build variants to different compilation database files.

The following example illustrates generating a compilation database containing absolute paths:

env = Environment(COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH=True)
env.Tool('compilation_db')
env.CompilationDatabase()
env.Program('hello.c')

% scons -Q
Building compilation database compile_commands.json
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o

compile_commands.json contains:

[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.c",
        "output": "/home/user/sandbox/hello.o"
    }
]

Notice that the generated database contains only an entry for the hello.c/hello.o pairing, and nothing for the generation of the final executable hello - the transformation of hello.o to hello does not have any information that affects interpretation of the source code, so it is not interesting to the compilation database.

Although it can be a little surprising at first glance, a compilation database target is, like any other target, subject to scons target selection rules. This means if you set a default target (that does not include the compilation database), or use command-line targets, it might not be selected for building. This can actually be an advantage, since you don't necessarily want to regenerate the compilation database every build. The following example shows selecting relative paths (the default) for output and source, and also giving a non-default name to the database. In order to be able to generate the database separately from building, an alias is set referring to the database, which can then be used as a target - here we are only building the compilation database target, not the code.

env = Environment()
env.Tool('compilation_db')
cdb = env.CompilationDatabase('compile_database.json')
Alias('cdb', cdb)
env.Program('test_main.c')

% scons -Q cdb
Building compilation database compile_database.json

compile_database.json contains:

[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "test_main.o"
    }
]

The following (incomplete) example shows using filtering to separate build variants. In the case of using variants, you want different compilation databases for each, since the build parameters differ, so the code analysis needs to see the correct build lines for the 32-bit build and 64-bit build hinted at here. For simplicity of presentation, the example omits the setup details of the variant directories:

env = Environment()
env.Tool("compilation_db")

env1 = env.Clone()
env1["COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER"] = "build/linux32/*"
env1.CompilationDatabase("compile_commands-linux32.json")

env2 = env.Clone()
env2["COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER"] = "build/linux64/*"
env2.CompilationDatabase('compile_commands-linux64.json')

compile_commands-linux32.json contains:

[
    {
        "command": "gcc -o hello.o -c hello.c",
        "directory": "/home/mats/github/scons/exp/compdb",
        "file": "hello.c",
        "output": "hello.o"
    }
]

compile_commands-linux64.json contains:

[
    {
        "command": "gcc -m64 -o build/linux64/test_main.o -c test_main.c",
        "directory": "/home/user/sandbox",
        "file": "test_main.c",
        "output": "build/linux64/test_main.o"
    }
]

27.2. Ninja Build Generator
Note

This is an experimental new feature. It is subject to change and/or removal without a depreciation cycle.

Loading the ninja tool into SCons will make significant changes in SCons' normal functioning.

SCons will no longer execute any commands directly and will only create the build.ninja and run ninja.

Any targets specified on the command line will be passed along to ninja

To enable this feature you'll need to use one of the following:

# On the command line --experimental=ninja

# Or in your SConstruct

SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

Ninja is a small build system that tries to be fast by not making decisions. SCons can at times be slow because it makes lots of decisions to carry out its goal of "correctness". The two tools can be paired to benefit some build scenarios: by using the ninja tool, SCons can generate the build file ninja uses (basically doing the decision-making ahead of time and recording that for ninja), and can invoke ninja to perform a build. For situations where relationships are not changing, such as edit/build/debug iterations, this works fine and should provide considerable speedups for more complex builds. The implication is if there are larger changes taking place, ninja is not as appropriate - but you can always use SCons to regenerate the build file. You are NOT advised to use this for production builds.

To use the ninja tool you'll need to first install the Python ninja package, as the tool depends on being able to do an import of the package. This can be done via:

# In a virtualenv, or "python" is the native executable

python -m pip install ninja

# Windows using Python launcher

py -m pip install ninja

# Anaconda

conda install -c conda-forge ninja

Reminder that like any non-default tool, you need to initialize it before use (e.g. env.Tool('ninja')).

It is not expected that the Ninja builder will work for all builds at this point. It is still under active development. If you find that your build doesn't work with ninja please bring this to the users mailing list or #scons-help channel on our Discord server.

Specifically if your build has many (or even any) Python function actions you may find that the ninja build will be slower as it will run ninja, which will then run SCons for each target created by a Python action. To alleviate some of these, especially those Python based actions built into SCons there is special logic to implement those actions via shell commands in the ninja build file.

When ninja runs the generated ninja build file, ninja will launch scons as a daemon and feed commands to that scons process which ninja is unable to build directly. This daemon will stay alive until explicitly killed, or it times out. The timeout is set by $NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE.

Chapter 28. Troubleshooting

The experience of configuring any software build tool to build a large code base usually, at some point, involves trying to figure out why the tool is behaving a certain way, and how to get it to behave the way you want. SCons is no different. This appendix contains a number of different ways in which you can get some additional insight into SCons' behavior.

Note that we're always interested in trying to improve how you can troubleshoot configuration problems. If you run into a problem that has you scratching your head, and which there just doesn't seem to be a good way to debug, odds are pretty good that someone else will run into the same problem, too. If so, please let the SCons development team know using the contact information at https://scons.org/contact.html so that we can use your feedback to try to come up with a better way to help you, and others, get the necessary insight into SCons behavior to help identify and fix configuration issues.

28.1. Why is That Target Being Rebuilt? the --debug=explain Option

Let's look at a simple example of a misconfigured build that causes a target to be rebuilt every time SCons is run:

# Intentionally misspell the output file name in the

# command used to create the file

Command('file.out', 'file.in', 'cp $SOURCE file.oout')

(Note to Windows users: The POSIX cp command copies the first file named on the command line to the second file. In our example, it copies the file.in file to the file.out file.)

Now if we run SCons multiple times on this example, we see that it re-runs the cp command every time:

% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout
% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout
% scons -Q
cp file.in file.oout

In this example, the underlying cause is obvious: we've intentionally misspelled the output file name in the cp command, so the command doesn't actually build the file.out file that we've told SCons to expect. But if the problem weren't obvious, it would be helpful to specify the --debug=explain option on the command line to have SCons tell us very specifically why it's decided to rebuild the target:

% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: building `file.out' because it doesn't exist
cp file.in file.oout

If this had been a more complicated example involving a lot of build output, having SCons tell us that it's trying to rebuild the target file because it doesn't exist would be an important clue that something was wrong with the command that we invoked to build it.

Note that you can also use --warn=target-not-built which checks whether or not expected targets exist after a build rule is executed.

% scons -Q --warn=target-not-built
cp file.in file.oout

scons: warning: Cannot find target file.out after building
File "/Users/bdbaddog/devel/scons/git/as_scons/scripts/scons.py", line 97, in <module>

The --debug=explain option also comes in handy to help figure out what input file changed. Given a simple configuration that builds a program from three source files, changing one of the source files and rebuilding with the --debug=explain option shows very specifically why SCons rebuilds the files that it does:

% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
cc -o file3.o -c file3.c
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF file2.c]
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `file2.o' because`file2.c' changed
cc -o file2.o -c file2.c
scons: rebuilding `prog' because`file2.o' changed
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

This becomes even more helpful in identifying when a file is rebuilt due to a change in an implicit dependency, such as an included .h file. If the file1.c and file3.c files in our example both included a hello.h file, then changing that included file and re-running SCons with the --debug=explain option will pinpoint that it's the change to the included file that starts the chain of rebuilds:

% scons -Q
cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
cc -o file2.o -c -I. file2.c
cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o
%     [CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF hello.h]
% scons -Q --debug=explain
scons: rebuilding `file1.o' because`hello.h' changed
cc -o file1.o -c -I. file1.c
scons: rebuilding `file3.o' because`hello.h' changed
cc -o file3.o -c -I. file3.c
scons: rebuilding `prog' because:
           `file1.o' changed
           `file3.o' changed
cc -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o

(Note that the --debug=explain option will only tell you why SCons decided to rebuild necessary targets. It does not tell you what files it examined when deciding not to rebuild a target file, which is often a more valuable question to answer.)

28.2. What's in That Construction Environment? the Dump Method

When you create a construction environment, SCons populates it with construction variables that are set up for various compilers, linkers and utilities that it finds on your system. Although this is usually helpful and what you want, it might be frustrating if SCons doesn't set certain variables that you expect to be set. In situations like this, it's sometimes helpful to use the construction environment Dump method to print all or some of the construction variables. Note that the Dump method returns the representation of the variables in the environment for you to print (or otherwise manipulate):

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

On a POSIX system with gcc installed, this might generate:

The construction environments in these examples have actually been restricted to just gcc and Microsoft Visual C++ respectively. In a real-life situation, the construction environments will likely contain a great many more variables. Also note that we've massaged the example output above to make the memory address of all objects a constant 0x700000. In reality, you would see a different hexadecimal number for each object.

To make it easier to see just what you're interested in, the Dump method allows you to specify a specific construction variable that you want to display. For example, it's not unusual to want to verify the external environment used to execute build commands, to make sure that the PATH and other environment variables are set up the way they should be. You can do this as follows:

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump('ENV'))

Which might display the following when executed on a POSIX system:

% scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
{'ENV': {'PATH': '/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/snap/bin'}}
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...

And the following when executed on a Windows system:

28.3. What Dependencies Does SCons Know About? the --tree Option

Sometimes the best way to try to figure out what SCons is doing is simply to take a look at the dependency graph that it constructs based on your SConscript files. The --tree option will display all or part of the SCons dependency graph in an "ASCII art" graphical format that shows the dependency hierarchy.

For example, given the following input SConstruct file:

env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program('prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])

Running SCons with the --tree=all option yields:

% scons -Q --tree=all
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
+-.
  +-SConstruct
  +-f1.c
  +-f1.o
  | +-f1.c
  | +-inc.h
  +-f2.c
  +-f2.o
  | +-f2.c
  | +-inc.h
  +-f3.c
  +-f3.o
  | +-f3.c
  | +-inc.h
  +-inc.h
  +-prog
    +-f1.o
    | +-f1.c
    | +-inc.h
    +-f2.o
    | +-f2.c
    | +-inc.h
    +-f3.o
      +-f3.c
      +-inc.h

The tree will also be printed when the -n (no execute) option is used, which allows you to examine the dependency graph for a configuration without actually rebuilding anything in the tree.

By default, SCons uses "ASCII art" to draw the tree. It is possible to use line-drawing characters (Unicode calls these Box Drawing) to make a nicer display. To do this, add the linedraw qualifier:

% scons -Q --tree=all,linedraw
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
└─┬.
  ├─SConstruct
  ├─f1.c
  ├─┬f1.o
  │ ├─f1.c
  │ └─inc.h
  ├─f2.c
  ├─┬f2.o
  │ ├─f2.c
  │ └─inc.h
  ├─f3.c
  ├─┬f3.o
  │ ├─f3.c
  │ └─inc.h
  ├─inc.h
  └─┬prog
    ├─┬f1.o
    │ ├─f1.c
    │ └─inc.h
    ├─┬f2.o
    │ ├─f2.c
    │ └─inc.h
    └─┬f3.o
      ├─f3.c
      └─inc.h

The --tree option only prints the dependency graph for the specified targets (or the default target(s) if none are specified on the command line). So if you specify a target like f2.o on the command line, the --tree option will only print the dependency graph for that file:

% scons -Q --tree=all f2.o
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
+-f2.o
  +-f2.c
  +-inc.h

This is, of course, useful for restricting the output from a very large build configuration to just a portion in which you're interested. Multiple targets are fine, in which case a tree will be printed for each specified target:

% scons -Q --tree=all f1.o f3.o
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
+-f1.o
  +-f1.c
  +-inc.h
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
+-f3.o
  +-f3.c
  +-inc.h

The status argument may be used to tell SCons to print status information about each file in the dependency graph:

% scons -Q --tree=status
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c

[E     C  ]      +-inc.h

Note that --tree=all,status is equivalent; the all is assumed if only status is present. As an alternative to all, you can specify --tree=derived to have SCons only print derived targets in the tree output, skipping source files (like .c and .h files):

% scons -Q --tree=derived
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c

+-.
  +-f1.o
  +-f2.o
  +-f3.o
  +-prog
    +-f1.o
    +-f2.o
    +-f3.o

You can use the status modifier with derived as well:

% scons -Q --tree=derived,status
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c
cc -o prog f1.o f2.o f3.o
 E         = exists
  R        = exists in repository only
   b       = implicit builder
   B       = explicit builder
    S      = side effect
     P     = precious
      A    = always build
       C   = current
        N  = no clean
         H = no cache

[E b      ]+-.

[E B   C  ]  +-f3.o
[E B   C  ]  +-prog
[E B   C  ]    +-f1.o
[E B   C  ]    +-f2.o
[E B   C  ]    +-f3.o

Note that the order of the --tree= arguments doesn't matter; --tree=status,derived is completely equivalent.

The default behavior of the --tree option is to repeat all of the dependencies each time the library dependency (or any other dependency file) is encountered in the tree. If certain target files share other target files, such as two programs that use the same library:

env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'],
                  LIBS = ['foo'],
                  LIBPATH = ['.'])
env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
env.Program('prog1.c')
env.Program('prog2.c')

Then there can be a lot of repetition in the --tree= output:

% scons -Q --tree=all

cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c

In a large configuration with many internal libraries and include files, this can very quickly lead to huge output trees. To help make this more manageable, a prune modifier may be added to the option list, in which case SCons will print the name of a target that has already been visited during the tree-printing in square brackets ([]) as an indication that the dependencies of the target file may be found by looking farther up the tree:

% scons -Q --tree=prune
cc -o f1.o -c -I. f1.c
cc -o f2.o -c -I. f2.c
cc -o f3.o -c -I. f3.c

Like the status keyword, the prune argument by itself is equivalent to --tree=all,prune.

28.4. How is SCons Constructing the Command Lines It Executes? the --debug=presub Option

Sometimes the command lines that SCons executes don't come out looking as you expect. In this case it may be useful to look at the strings before SCons performs substitution on them. This can be done with the --debug=presub option:

% scons -Q --debug=presub
Building prog.o with action:
  $CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCOMCOM $SOURCES
cc -o prog.o -c -I. prog.c
Building prog with action:
  $SMART_LINKCOM
cc -o prog prog.o

28.5. Where is SCons Searching for Libraries? the --debug=findlibs Option

To get some insight into what library names SCons is searching for, and in which directories it is searching, use the --debug=findlibs option. Given the following input SConstruct file:

env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['libs1', 'libs2'])
env.Program('prog.c', LIBS=['foo', 'bar'])

And the libraries libfoo.a and libbar.a in libs1 and libs2, respectively, use of the --debug=findlibs option yields:

% scons -Q --debug=findlibs
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: ... FOUND 'libfoo.a' in 'libs1'
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libfoo.so' in 'libs2' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.a' in 'libs2' ...
  findlibs: ... FOUND 'libbar.a' in 'libs2'
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs1' ...
  findlibs: looking for 'libbar.so' in 'libs2' ...
cc -o prog.o -c prog.c
cc -o prog prog.o -Llibs1 -Llibs2 -lfoo -lbar

28.6. Where is SCons Blowing Up? the --debug=stacktrace Option

In general, SCons tries to keep its error messages short and informative. That means we usually try to avoid showing the stack traces that are familiar to experienced Python programmers, since they usually contain much more information than is useful to most people.

For example, the following SConstruct file:

Program('prog.c')

Generates the following error if the prog.c file does not exist:

% scons -Q
scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target`prog.o'.

In this case, the error is pretty obvious. But if it weren't, and you wanted to try to get more information about the error, the --debug=stacktrace option would show you exactly where in the SCons source code the problem occurs:

% scons -Q --debug=stacktrace
scons: *** [prog.o] Source `prog.c' not found, needed by target`prog.o'.
scons: internal stack trace:
  File "SCons/Taskmaster/Job.py", line 670, in _work
    task.prepare()
  File "SCons/Script/Main.py", line 209, in prepare
    return SCons.Taskmaster.OutOfDateTask.prepare(self)
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "SCons/Taskmaster/__init__.py", line 195, in prepare
    executor.prepare()
  File "SCons/Executor.py", line 424, in prepare
    raise SCons.Errors.StopError(msg % (s, self.batches[0].targets[0]))

Of course, if you do need to dive into the SCons source code, we'd like to know if, or how, the error messages or troubleshooting options could have been improved to avoid that. Not everyone has the necessary time or Python skill to dive into the source code, and we'd like to improve SCons for those people as well...

28.7. How is SCons Making Its Decisions? the --taskmastertrace Option

The internal SCons subsystem that handles walking the dependency graph and controls the decision-making about what to rebuild is the Taskmaster. SCons supports a --taskmastertrace option that tells the Taskmaster to print information about the children (dependencies) of the various Nodes on its walk down the graph, which specific dependent Nodes are being evaluated, and in what order.

The --taskmastertrace option takes as an argument the name of a file in which to put the trace output, with - (a single hyphen) indicating that the trace messages should be printed to the standard output:

env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program('prog.c')

% scons -Q --taskmastertrace=- prog

The --taskmastertrace option doesn't provide information about the actual calculations involved in deciding if a file is up-to-date, but it does show all of the dependencies it knows about for each Node, and the order in which those dependencies are evaluated. This can be useful as an alternate way to determine whether or not your SCons configuration, or the implicit dependency scan, has actually identified all the correct dependencies you want it to.

28.8. Watch SCons prepare targets for building: the --debug=prepare Option

Sometimes SCons doesn't build the target you want, and it's difficult to figure out why. You can use the --debug=prepare option to see all the targets SCons is considering, and whether they are already up-to-date or not. The message is printed before SCons decides whether to build the target.

28.9. Why is a file disappearing? the --debug=duplicate Option

When using the Duplicate option to create variant directories, sometimes you may find files not getting linked or copied to where you expect (or not at all), or files mysteriously disappearing. These are usually because of a misconfiguration of some kind in the SConscript files, but they can be tricky to debug. The --debug=duplicate option shows each time a variant file is unlinked and relinked from its source (or copied, depending on settings), and also shows a message for removing "stale" variant-directory files that no longer have a corresponding source file. It also prints a line for each target that's removed just before building, since that can also be mistaken for the same thing.

28.10. Keep it simple

Over the years, many developers have chosen to dive in and make vastly complicated build systems out of SCons, which sometimes don't work quite as expected. As a general rule, make sure you need to reach for a complex solution before you do so. SCons is mature software and has evolved over time to meet a lot of feature requests, so there is often an easier way to do something if you can just find it. The SCons community can be helpful here - the discussion lists and chat channels can be a way to find out if something can be done an easier way before embarking on an implementation.

When something does misbehave, trying to isolate the problem to a simple test case can really help. The work to create a reproducer often helps you spot the issue yourself, and a simple example is much easier for others to look over and possibly spot logical flaws, misuse of the API, or other ways something could have been done. In addition, if it turns out there's actually a real SCons bug (we believe it's a high quality piece of software, but all software has some bugs), it's very likely the bug filing will result in a request for a simple reproducer anyway.

Appendix A. Construction Variables

This appendix contains descriptions of all of the construction variables that are potentially available "out of the box" in this version of SCons. Whether or not setting a construction variable in a construction environment will actually have an effect depends on whether any of the Tools and/or Builders that use the variable have been included in the construction environment.

In this appendix, we have appended the initial $ (dollar sign) to the beginning of each variable name when it appears in the text, but left off the dollar sign in the left-hand column where the name appears for each entry.

__LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS

This construction variable automatically introduces $_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS if $LDMODULEVERSION is set. Otherwise, it evaluates to an empty string.

__SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS

This construction variable automatically introduces $_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS if $SHLIBVERSION is set. Otherwise, it evaluates to an empty string.

APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION

On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag: -compatibility_version

The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and 65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from $SHLIBVERSION if not specified. The lowest digit will be dropped and replaced by a 0.

If the $APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION is set then no -compatibility_version will be output.

See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

_APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION

A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the linker flags to specify apple's linker's -compatibility_version flag. The default generator uses $APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and $APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and $SHLIBVERSION to determine the correct flag.

APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION

On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag: -current_version

The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and 65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and 255, Z can be omitted or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to $SHLIBVERSION if not specified.

If the $APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION is set then no -current_version will be output.

See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

_APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION

A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the linker flags to specify apple's linker's -current_version flag. The default generator uses $APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION and $APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION and $SHLIBVERSION to determine the correct flag.

APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION

Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable adding -compatibility_version flag when generating versioned shared libraries.

This overrides $APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION.

APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION

Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable adding -current_version flag when generating versioned shared libraries.

This overrides $APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION.

AR

The static library archiver.

ARCHITECTURE

Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being built. The default is the system architecture of the machine on which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the Architecture: field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch: field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming part of the name of a generated RPM package file.

See the Package builder.

ARCOM

The command line used to generate a static library from object files.

ARCOMSTR

The string displayed when a static library is generated from object files. If this is not set, then $ARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

ARFLAGS

General options passed to the static library archiver.

AS

The assembler.

ASCOM

The command line used to generate an object file from an assembly-language source file.

ASCOMSTR

The string displayed when an object file is generated from an assembly-language source file. If this is not set, then $ASCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

ASFLAGS

General options passed to the assembler.

ASPPCOM

The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source file into an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the $ASFLAGS and $CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line.

ASPPCOMSTR

The string displayed when an object file is generated from an assembly-language source file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then $ASPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

ASPPFLAGS

General options when an assembling an assembly-language source file into an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of $ASFLAGS.

BIBTEX

The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

BIBTEXCOM

The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

BIBTEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or LaTeX. If this is not set, then $BIBTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

BIBTEXFLAGS

General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

BUILDERS

A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through the construction environment to underlying Builder objects. Custom builders need to be added to this to make them available.

A platform-dependent default list of builders such as Program, Library etc. is used to populate this construction variable when the construction environment is initialized via the presence/absence of the tools those builders depend on. $BUILDERS can be examined to learn which builders will actually be available at run-time.

Note that if you initialize this construction variable through assignment when the construction environment is created, that value for $BUILDERS will override any defaults:

bld = Builder(action='foobuild < $SOURCE > $TARGET')
env = Environment(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

To instead use a new Builder object in addition to the default Builders, add your new Builder object like this:

env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

or this:

env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = bld

CACHEDIR_CLASS

The class type that SCons should use when instantiating a new CacheDir in this construction environment. Must be a subclass of the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

CC

The C compiler.

CCCOM

The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static) object file. Any options specified in the $CFLAGS, $CCFLAGS and $CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line. See also $SHCCCOM for compiling to shared objects.

CCCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a C source file is compiled to a (static) object file. If not set, then $CCCOM (the command line) is displayed. See also $SHCCCOMSTR for compiling to shared objects.

env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

CCDEPFLAGS

Options to pass to C or C++ compiler to generate list of dependency files.

This is set only by compilers which support this functionality. (gcc, clang, and msvc currently)

CCFLAGS

General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers. See also $SHCCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

CCPCHFLAGS

Options added to the compiler command line to support building with precompiled headers. The default value expands expands to the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when the $PCH construction variable is set.

CCPDBFLAGS

Options added to the compiler command line to support storing debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file. The default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when the $PDB construction variable is set.

The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library. Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work.

You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default $CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

An alternative would be to use the /Zi to put the debugging information in a separate .pdb file for each object file by overriding the $CCPDBFLAGS variable as follows:

env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

CCVERSION

The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be set, depending on the specific C compiler being used.

CFILESUFFIX

The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal CFile builder when generating C files from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y) input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case). On case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C files.

CFLAGS

General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not C++). See also $SHCFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

CHANGE_SPECFILE

A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build (the .spec for RPM, the control for Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If set, the function will be called after the SCons template for the file has been written.

See the Package builder.

CHANGED_SOURCES

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

CHANGED_TARGETS

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

CHANGELOG

The name of a file containing the change log text to be included in the package. This is included as the %changelog section of the RPM .spec file.

See the Package builder.

COMPILATIONDB_COMSTR

The string displayed when the CompilationDatabase builder's action is run.

COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER

A string which instructs CompilationDatabase to only include entries where the output member matches the pattern in the filter string using fnmatch, which uses glob style wildcards.

The default value is an empty string '', which disables filtering.

COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH

A boolean flag to instruct CompilationDatabase whether to write the file and output members in the compilation database using absolute or relative paths.

The default value is False (use relative paths)

_concat

A function used to produce variables like $_CPPINCFLAGS. It takes four mandatory arguments, and up to 4 additional optional arguments: 1) a prefix to concatenate onto each element, 2) a list of elements, 3) a suffix to concatenate onto each element, 4) an environment for variable interpolation, 5) an optional function that will be called to transform the list before concatenation, 6) an optionally specified target (Can use TARGET), 7) an optionally specified source (Can use SOURCE), 8) optional affect_signature flag which will wrap non-empty returned value with $( and $) to indicate the contents should not affect the signature of the generated command line.

        env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDirs, TARGET, SOURCE, affect_signature=False)}'
    
CONFIGUREDIR

The name of the directory in which Configure context test files are written. The default is .sconf_temp in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct file.

If variant directories are in use, and the configure check results should not be shared between variants, you can set $CONFIGUREDIR and $CONFIGURELOG so they are unique per variant directory.

CONFIGURELOG

The name of the Configure context log file. The default is config.log in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct file.

If variant directories are in use, and the configure check results should not be shared between variants, you can set $CONFIGUREDIR and $CONFIGURELOG so they are unique per variant directory.

_CPPDEFFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the C preprocessor command-line options to define values. The value of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX to each definition in $CPPDEFINES.

CPPDEFINES

A platform independent specification of C preprocessor macro definitions. The definitions are added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_CPPDEFFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed according to the contents of $CPPDEFINES:

If $CPPDEFINES is a string, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables are respectively prepended and appended to each definition in $CPPDEFINES, split on whitespace.

# Adds -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines

# and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

If $CPPDEFINES is a list, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables are respectively prepended and appended to each element in the list. If any element is a tuple (or list) then the first item of the tuple is the macro name and the second is the macro definition. If the definition is not omitted or None, the name and definition are combined into a single name=definition item before the prepending/appending.

# Adds -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines

# and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

If $CPPDEFINES is a dictionary, the values of the $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX construction variables are respectively prepended and appended to each key from the dictionary. If the value for a key is not None, then the key (macro name) and the value (macros definition) are combined into a single name=definition item before the prepending/appending.

# Adds -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines

# or /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

Depending on how contents are added to $CPPDEFINES, it may be transformed into a compound type, for example a list containing strings, tuples and/or dictionaries. SCons can correctly expand such a compound type.

Note that SCons may call the compiler via a shell. If a macro definition contains characters such as spaces that have meaning to the shell, or is intended to be a string value, you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to avoid interpretation by the shell before the preprocessor sees it. Function-like macros are not supported via this mechanism (and some compilers do not even implement that functionality via the command lines). When quoting, note that one set of quote characters are used to define a Python string, then quotes embedded inside that would be consumed by the shell unless escaped. These examples may help illustrate:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['USE_ALT_HEADER=\\"foo_alt.h\\"'])
env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('USE_ALT_HEADER', '\\"foo_alt.h\\"')])

:Changed in version 4.5: SCons no longer sorts $CPPDEFINES values entered in dictionary form. Python now preserves dictionary keys in the order they are entered, so it is no longer necessary to sort them to ensure a stable command line.

CPPDEFPREFIX

The prefix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the C compiler command line. This will be prepended to each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

CPPDEFSUFFIX

The suffix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the C compiler command line. This will be appended to each definition in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable when the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

CPPFLAGS

User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in any command that uses the C preprocessor, including not just compilation of C and C++ source files via the $CCCOM, $SHCCCOM, $CXXCOM and $SHCXXCOM command lines, but also the $FORTRANPPCOM, $SHFORTRANPPCOM, $F77PPCOM and $SHF77PPCOM command lines used to compile a Fortran source file, and the $ASPPCOM command line used to assemble an assembly language source file, after first running each file through the C preprocessor. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search path options that scons generates automatically from $CPPPATH. See $_CPPINCFLAGS, below, for the variable that expands to those options.

_CPPINCFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the C preprocessor command-line options for specifying directories to be searched for include files. The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to each directory in $CPPPATH.

CPPPATH

The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. In general, it's not advised to put include directory directives directly into $CCFLAGS or $CXXFLAGS as the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. $CPPPATH should be a list of path strings, or a single string, not a pathname list joined by Python's os.pathsep.

Note: directory names in $CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use the # prefix:

env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_CPPINCFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to each directory in $CPPPATH. Any command lines you define that need the $CPPPATH directory list should include $_CPPINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

CPPSUFFIXES

The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include lines). The default list is:

[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
 ".m", ".mm",
 ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

CXX

env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

CXXFILESUFFIX

The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal CXXFile builder when generating C++ files from Lex (.ll) or YACC (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats files with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files, and files with .mm suffixes as Objective-C++ files. On case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes), SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C++ files.

CXXFLAGS

General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default, this includes the value of $CCFLAGS, so that setting $CCFLAGS affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add C++-specific flags, you must set or override the value of $CXXFLAGS. See also $SHCXXFLAGS for compiling to shared objects.

CXXVERSION

ENV

The execution environment - a dictionary of environment variables used when SCons invokes external commands to build targets defined in this construction environment. When $ENV is passed to a command, all list values are assumed to be path lists and are joined using the search path separator. Any other non-string values are coerced to a string.

Note that by default SCons does not propagate the environment in effect when you execute scons (the "shell environment") to the execution environment. This is so that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the time scons is invoked. If you want to propagate a shell environment variable to the commands executed to build target files, you must do so explicitly. A common example is the system PATH environment variable, so that scons will find utilities the same way as the invoking shell (or other process):

import os
env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

Although it is usually not recommended, you can propagate the entire shell environment in one go:

import os
env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran 90 compiler command-line options for specifying directories to be searched for include files. The value of $_F90INCFLAGS is created by appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in $F90PATH.

F90PATH

The list of directories that the Fortran 90 compiler will search for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in $F90FLAGS because the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in $F90PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use #: You only need to set $F90PATH if you need to define a specific include path for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F90PATH='#/include')

The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir() function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F90PATH=include)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_F90INCFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end of each directory in $F90PATH. Any command lines you define that need the F90PATH directory list should include $_F90INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F90COM="my_compiler $_F90INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

F90PPCOM

The command line used to compile a Fortran 90 source file to an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the $F90FLAGS and $CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line. You only need to set $F90PPCOM if you need to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 90 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANPPCOM variable, which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all Fortran versions.

F90PPCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 90 source file is compiled after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If not set, then $F90PPCOM or $FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

F90PPFILESUFFIXES

The list of file extensions for which the compilation + preprocessor pass for F90 dialect will be used. By default, this is empty.

F95

The Fortran 95 compiler. You should normally set the $FORTRAN variable, which specifies the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set $F95 if you need to use a specific compiler or compiler version for Fortran 95 files.

F95COM

The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an object file. You only need to set $F95COM if you need to use a specific command line for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANCOM variable, which specifies the default command line for all Fortran versions.

F95COMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled to an object file. If not set, then $F95COM or $FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

F95FILESUFFIXES

The list of file extensions for which the F95 dialect will be used. By default, this is ['.f95']

F95FLAGS

General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 95 compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include search path options that scons generates automatically from $F95PATH. See $_F95INCFLAGS below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to set $F95FLAGS if you need to define specific user options for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANFLAGS variable, which specifies the user-specified options passed to the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

_F95INCFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran 95 compiler command-line options for specifying directories to be searched for include files. The value of $_F95INCFLAGS is created by appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in $F95PATH.

F95PATH

The list of directories that the Fortran 95 compiler will search for include directories. The implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in $F95FLAGS because the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in $F95PATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use #: You only need to set $F95PATH if you need to define a specific include path for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANPATH variable, which specifies the include path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

env = Environment(F95PATH='#/include')

The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir() function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F95PATH=include)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_F95INCFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by appending the values of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end of each directory in $F95PATH. Any command lines you define that need the F95PATH directory list should include $_F95INCFLAGS:

env = Environment(F95COM="my_compiler $_F95INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

F95PPCOM

The command line used to compile a Fortran 95 source file to an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the $F95FLAGS and $CPPFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line. You only need to set $F95PPCOM if you need to use a specific C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 95 files. You should normally set the $FORTRANPPCOM variable, which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line for all Fortran versions.

F95PPCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 95 source file is compiled to an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If not set, then $F95PPCOM or $FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

F95PPFILESUFFIXES

The list of file extensions for which the compilation + preprocessor pass for F95 dialect will be used. By default, this is empty.

File

A function that converts a string into a File instance relative to the target being built.

FILE_ENCODING

File encoding used for files written by Textfile and Substfile. Set to "utf-8" by default.

New in version 4.5.0.

FORTRAN

The default Fortran compiler for all versions of Fortran.

FORTRANCOM

The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an object file. By default, any options specified in the $FORTRANFLAGS, $_FORTRANMODFLAG, and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line.

FORTRANCOMMONFLAGS

General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran compiler. Similar to $FORTRANFLAGS, but this construction variable is applied to all dialects.

New in version 4.4.

FORTRANCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to an object file. If not set, then $FORTRANCOM (the command line) is displayed.

FORTRANFILESUFFIXES

The list of file extensions for which the FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default, this is ['.f', '.for', '.ftn']

FORTRANFLAGS

General user-specified options for the FORTRAN dialect that are passed to the Fortran compiler. Note that this variable does not contain -I (or similar) include or module search path options that scons generates automatically from $FORTRANPATH. See $_FORTRANINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANMODFLAG for the construction variables that expand those options.

_FORTRANINCFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran compiler command-line options for specifying directories to be searched for include files and module files. The value of $_FORTRANINCFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX to the beginning and end of each directory in $FORTRANPATH.

FORTRANMODDIR

Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any module files it generates. This variable is empty, by default. Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in the search path for module files, as well.

FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX

The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command line. This will be prepended to the beginning of the directory in the $FORTRANMODDIR construction variables when the $_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically generated.

FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX

The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command line. This will be appended to the end of the directory in the $FORTRANMODDIR construction variables when the $_FORTRANMODFLAG variables is automatically generated.

_FORTRANMODFLAG

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran compiler command-line option for specifying the directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any module files that happen to get generated during compilation. The value of $_FORTRANMODFLAG is created by respectively prepending and appending $FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX and $FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX to the beginning and end of the directory in $FORTRANMODDIR.

FORTRANMODPREFIX

The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a result, this variable is left empty, by default. For situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.

FORTRANMODSUFFIX

The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi-standard naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a result, this variable is set to ".mod", by default. For situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.

FORTRANPATH

The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search for include files and (for some compilers) module files. The Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files (but not module files since they are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use #:

env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

The directory look-up can also be forced using the Dir() function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end of each directory in $FORTRANPATH. Any command lines you define that need the FORTRANPATH directory list should include $_FORTRANINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

FORTRANPPCOM

The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the $FORTRANFLAGS, $CPPFLAGS, $_CPPDEFFLAGS, $_FORTRANMODFLAG, and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS construction variables are included on this command line.

FORTRANPPCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to an object file after first running the file through the C preprocessor. If not set, then $FORTRANPPCOM (the command line) is displayed.

FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES

The list of file extensions for which the compilation + preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be used. By default, this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

FORTRANSUFFIXES

The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines and USE statements). The default list is:

[".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

FRAMEWORKPATH

On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for frameworks. Used by the compiler to find framework-style includes like #include <Fmwk/Header.h>. Used by the linker to find user-specified frameworks when linking (see $FRAMEWORKS). For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

will add

... -Fmyframeworkdir

to the compiler and linker command lines.

_FRAMEWORKPATH

On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options corresponding to $FRAMEWORKPATH.

FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX

On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see $FRAMEWORKPATH). The default value is -F.

FRAMEWORKPREFIX

On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in frameworks (see $FRAMEWORKS). The default value is -framework.

FRAMEWORKS

On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked into a program or shared library or bundle. The default value is the empty list. For example:

env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

_FRAMEWORKS

On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options for linking with FRAMEWORKS.

FRAMEWORKSFLAGS

On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options to be added at the end of a command line building a loadable module. (This has been largely superseded by the $FRAMEWORKPATH, $FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX, $FRAMEWORKPREFIX and $FRAMEWORKS variables described above.)

GS

The Ghostscript program used to, for example, convert PostScript to PDF files.

GSCOM

The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion process. Its default value is “$GS $GSFLAGS -sOutputFile=$TARGET $SOURCES”.

GSCOMSTR

The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the conversion process. If this is not set (the default), then $GSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

GSFLAGS

General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when converting PostScript to PDF files for example. Its default value is “-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite”

HOST_ARCH

The name of the host hardware architecture used to create this construction environment. The platform code sets this when initializing (see $PLATFORM and the platform argument to Environment). Note the detected name of the architecture may not be identical to that returned by the Python platform.machine method.

On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is available, msvc tool setup is done using $HOST_ARCH and $TARGET_ARCH. Changing the values at any later time will not cause the tool to be reinitialized. Valid host arch values are x86 and arm for 32-bit hosts and amd64, arm64, and x86_64 for 64-bit hosts.

Should be considered immutable. $HOST_ARCH is not currently used by other platforms, but the option is reserved to do so in future

HOST_OS

The name of the host operating system for the platform used to create this construction environment. The platform code sets this when initializing (see $PLATFORM and the platform argument to Environment).

Should be considered immutable. $HOST_OS is not currently used by SCons, but the option is reserved to do so in future

IDLSUFFIXES

The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL implicit dependencies (#include or import lines). The default list is:

[".idl", ".IDL"]

IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

Used to override $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS when creating versioned import library for a shared library/loadable module. If not defined, then $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS/$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS is used to determine whether to disable symlink generation or not.

IMPLIBPREFIX

The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic libraries (cygfoo.dll). The cyglink linker sets $IMPLIBPREFIX to 'lib' and $SHLIBPREFIX to 'cyg'.

IMPLIBSUFFIX

The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in pair with dynamic libraries (cygfoo.dll). The cyglink linker sets $IMPLIBSUFFIX to '.dll.a' and $SHLIBSUFFIX to '.dll'.

IMPLIBVERSION

Used to override $SHLIBVERSION/$LDMODULEVERSION when generating versioned import library for a shared library/loadable module. If undefined, the $SHLIBVERSION/$LDMODULEVERSION is used to determine the version of versioned import library.

IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES

Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for the commands executed to build targets.

By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency on the command represented by the first argument of any command line it executes (which is typically the command itself). By setting such a dependency, SCons can determine that a target should be rebuilt if the command changes, such as when a compiler is upgraded to a new version. The specific file for the dependency is found by searching the PATH variable in the ENV dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the command. The default is the same as setting the construction variable $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES to a True-like value (“true”, “yes”, or “1” - but not a number greater than one, as that has a different meaning).

Action strings can be segmented by the use of an AND operator, &&. In a segmented string, each segment is a separate “command line”, these are run sequentially until one fails, or the entire sequence has been executed. If an action string is segmented, then the selected behavior of $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is applied to each segment.

If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to a False-like value (“none”, “false”, “no”, “0”, etc.), then the implicit dependency will not be added to the targets built with that construction environment.

If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to “2” or higher, then that number of arguments in the command line will be scanned for relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that construction environment. The first argument in the command line will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the command. The other arguments will only be found if they are absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

If $IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES is set to “all”, then all arguments in the command line will be scanned for relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that construction environment. The first argument in the command line will be searched for using the PATH variable in the ENV dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the command. The other arguments will only be found if they are absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES=False)

INCPREFIX

The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C compiler command line. This will be prepended to each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables are automatically generated.

INCSUFFIX

The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C compiler command line. This will be appended to each directory in the $CPPPATH and $FORTRANPATH construction variables when the $_CPPINCFLAGS and $_FORTRANINCFLAGS variables are automatically generated.

INSTALL

A function to be called to install a file into a destination file name. The default function copies the file into the destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission bits to match the source file's). The function takes the following arguments:

def install(dest, source, env):

dest is the path name of the destination file. source is the path name of the source file. env is the construction environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for this file installation.

INSTALLSTR

The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination file name. The default is:

Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION

Set by the intelc Tool to the major version number of the Intel C compiler selected for use.

JAR

The Java archive tool.

JARCHDIR

The directory to which the Java archive tool should change (using the -C option).

JARCOM

The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

JARCOMSTR

The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If this is not set, then $JARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JARCOMSTR="JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

JARFLAGS

General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default, this is set to cf to create the necessary jar file.

JARSUFFIX

The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

JAVABOOTCLASSPATH

Specifies the location of the bootstrap class files. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the -bootclasspath option, which requires a system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs the command line if $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH is provided in list form. If $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH is a single string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will not be modified; and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent manner, give $JAVABOOTCLASSPATH as a list of paths instead.

Note

Can only be used when compiling for releases prior to JDK 9.

JAVAC

The Java compiler.

JAVACCOM

The command line used to compile a directory tree containing Java source files to corresponding Java class files. Any options specified in the $JAVACFLAGS construction variable are included on this command line.

JAVACCOMSTR

The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java source files to corresponding Java class files. If this is not set, then $JAVACCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR="Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

JAVACFLAGS

General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

JAVACLASSDIR

The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is stripped from the beginning of any Java .class file names supplied to the JavaH builder.

JAVACLASSPATH

Specifies the class search path for the JDK tools. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or Node objects. Class path entries may be directory names to search for class files or packages, pathnames to archives (.jar or .zip) containing classes, or paths ending in a "base name wildcard" character (*), which matches files in that directory with a .jar suffix. See the Java documentation for more details.

The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the -classpath option, which requires a system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs the command line if $JAVACLASSPATH is provided in list form. If $JAVACLASSPATH is a single string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will be split on the separator into a list of individual paths for dependency scanning purposes. It will not be modified for JDK command-line usage, so such a string is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent manner, give $JAVACLASSPATH as a list of paths instead.

Note

SCons always supplies a -sourcepath when invoking the Java compiler javac, regardless of the setting of $JAVASOURCEPATH, as it passes the path(s) to the source(s) supplied in the call to the Java builder via -sourcepath . From the documentation of the standard Java toolkit for javac: “If not compiling code for modules, if the --source-path or -sourcepath option is not specified, then the user class path is also searched for source files.” Since -sourcepath is always supplied, javac will not use the contents of the value of $JAVACLASSPATH when searching for sources.

JAVACLASSSUFFIX

The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

JAVAH

The Java generator for C header and stub files.

JAVAHCOM

The command line used to generate C header and stub files from Java classes. Any options specified in the $JAVAHFLAGS construction variable are included on this command line.

JAVAHCOMSTR

The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated from Java classes. If this is not set, then $JAVAHCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR="Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

JAVAHFLAGS

General options passed to the C header and stub file generator for Java classes.

JAVAINCLUDES

Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h).

JAVAPROCESSORPATH

Specifies the location of the annotation processor class files. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the -processorpath option, which requires a system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs the command line if $JAVAPROCESSORPATH is provided in list form. If $JAVAPROCESSORPATH is a single string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will not be modified; and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent manner, give $JAVAPROCESSORPATH as a list of paths instead.

New in version 4.5.0

JAVASOURCEPATH

Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for input (source) .java files. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the -sourcepath option, which requires a system-specific search path separator, This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs the command line if $JAVASOURCEPATH is provided in list form. If $JAVASOURCEPATH is a single string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will not be modified, and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent manner, give $JAVASOURCEPATH as a list of paths instead.

Note that the specified directories are only added to the command line via the -sourcepath option. SCons does not currently search the $JAVASOURCEPATH directories for dependent .java files.

JAVASUFFIX

The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

JAVAVERSION

Specifies the Java version being used by the Java builder. Set this to specify the version of Java targeted by the javac compiler. This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file names that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which can cause a mismatch with the files that SCons expects will be generated by the javac compiler. Setting $JAVAVERSION to a version greater than 1.4 makes SCons realize that a build with such a compiler is actually up-to-date. The default is 1.4.

While this is not primarily intended for selecting one version of the Java compiler vs. another, it does have that effect on the Windows platform. A more precise approach is to set $JAVAC (and related construction variables for related utilities) to the path to the specific Java compiler you want, if that is not the default compiler. On non-Windows platforms, the alternatives system may provide a way to adjust the default Java compiler without having to specify explicit paths.

LATEX

The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

LATEXCOM

The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

LATEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then $LATEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

LATEXFLAGS

General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

LATEXRETRIES

The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the .log generated by the $LATEXCOM command indicates that there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve undefined references by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

LATEXSUFFIXES

The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX implicit dependencies (\include or \import files). The default list is:

[".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

LDMODULE

The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is the same as $SHLINK.

LDMODULECOM

The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X, this uses the $LDMODULE, $LDMODULEFLAGS and $FRAMEWORKSFLAGS variables. On other systems, this is the same as $SHLINK.

LDMODULECOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when building loadable modules. If not set, then $LDMODULECOM (the command line) is displayed.

LDMODULEEMITTER

Contains the emitter specification for the LoadableModule builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general information on specifying emitters.

LDMODULEFLAGS

General user options passed to the linker for building loadable modules.

LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS

Instructs the LoadableModule builder to not automatically create symlinks for versioned modules. Defaults to $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

LDMODULEPREFIX

The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X, this is null; on other systems, this is the same as $SHLIBPREFIX.

_LDMODULESONAME

A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by LoadableModule builder when the linker tool supports SONAME (e.g. gnulink).

LDMODULESUFFIX

The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X, this is null; on other systems, this is the same as $SHLIBSUFFIX.

LDMODULEVERSION

When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable module is created by LoadableModule builder. This activates the $_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the $LDMODULECOM as required, adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed. $LDMODULEVERSION versions should exist in the same format as $SHLIBVERSION.

_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS

This macro automatically introduces extra flags to $LDMODULECOM when building versioned LoadableModule (that is when $LDMODULEVERSION is set). _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds $SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and some extra dynamically generated options (such as -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain (unversioned) loadable modules.

LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS

Extra flags added to $LDMODULECOM when building versioned LoadableModule. These flags are only used when $LDMODULEVERSION is set.

LEX

The lexical analyzer generator.

LEX_HEADER_FILE

If supplied, generate a C header file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --header-file= command-line option. Use this in preference to including --header-file= in $LEXFLAGS directly.

LEX_TABLES_FILE

If supplied, write the lex tables to a file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --tables-file= command-line option. Use this in preference to including --tables-file= in $LEXFLAGS directly.

LEXCOM

The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to generate a source file.

LEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when generating a source file using the lexical analyzer generator. If this is not set, then $LEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR="Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

LEXFLAGS

General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator. In addition to passing the value on during invocation, the lex tool also examines this construction variable for options which cause additional output files to be generated, and adds those to the target list. Recognized for this purpose are GNU flex options --header-file= and --tables-file=; the output file is named by the option argument.

Note that files specified by --header-file= and --tables-file= may not be properly handled by SCons in all situations. Consider using $LEX_HEADER_FILE and $LEX_TABLES_FILE instead.

LEXUNISTD

Used only in Windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent 'unistd.h' from being included. The default value is '--nounistd'.

_LIBDIRFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options for specifying directories to be searched for library. The value of $_LIBDIRFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and appending $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX to each directory in $LIBPATH.

LIBDIRPREFIX

The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker command line. This will be prepended to each directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

LIBDIRSUFFIX

The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker command line. This will be appended to each directory in the $LIBPATH construction variable when the $_LIBDIRFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

LIBEMITTER

Contains the emitter specification for the StaticLibrary builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general information on specifying emitters.

_LIBFLAGS

An automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options for specifying libraries to be linked with the resulting target. The value of $_LIBFLAGS is created by respectively prepending and appending $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX to each filename in $LIBS.

LIBLINKPREFIX

The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker command line. This will be prepended to each library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

LIBLINKSUFFIX

The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker command line. This will be appended to each library in the $LIBS construction variable when the $_LIBFLAGS variable is automatically generated.

LIBLITERALPREFIX

If the linker supports command line syntax directing that the argument specifying a library should be searched for literally (without modification), $LIBLITERALPREFIX can be set to that indicator. For example, the GNU linker follows this rule: “ -l:foo searches the library path for a filename called foo, without converting it to libfoo.so or libfoo.a. ” If $LIBLITERALPREFIX is set, SCons will not transform a string-valued entry in $LIBS that starts with that string. The entry will still be surrounded with $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX on the command line. This is useful, for example, in directing that a static library be used when both a static and dynamic library are available and linker policy is to prefer dynamic libraries. Compared to the example in $LIBS,

env.Append(LIBS=":libmylib.a")

will let the linker select that specific (static) library name if found in the library search path. This differs from using a File object to specify the static library, as the latter bypasses the library search path entirely.

LIBPATH

The list of directories that will be searched for libraries specified by the $LIBS construction variable. $LIBPATH should be a list of path strings, or a single string, not a pathname list joined by Python's os.pathsep. Do not put library search directives directly into $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS as the result will be non-portable.

Note: directory names in $LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to the directory of the SConscript file when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use the # prefix:

env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir function:

libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_LIBDIRFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the $LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX construction variables to each directory in $LIBPATH. Any command lines you define that need the $LIBPATH directory list should include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

LIBPREFIX

The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they create.

LIBPREFIXES

A list of all legal prefixes for library file names on the current platform. When searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes from the $LIBSUFFIXES list.

LIBS

The list of libraries that will be added to the link line for linking with any executable program, shared library, or loadable module created by the construction environment or override.

For portability, a string-valued library name should include only the base library name, without prefixes such as lib or suffixes such as .so or .dll. SCons will attempt to strip prefixes from the $LIBPREFIXES list and suffixes from the $LIBSUFFIXES list, but depending on that behavior will make the build less portable: for example, on a POSIX system, no attempt will be made to strip a suffix like .dll. Library name strings in $LIBS should not include a path component: instead use $LIBPATH to direct the compiler to look for libraries in those paths, plus any default paths the linker searches in. If $LIBLITERALPREFIX is set to a non-empty string, then a string-valued $LIBS entry that starts with $LIBLITERALPREFIX will cause the rest of the entry to be searched for unmodified, but respecting normal library search paths (this is an exception to the guideline above about leaving off the prefix/suffix from the library name).

If a $LIBS entry is a Node object (either as returned by a previous Builder call, or as the result of an explicit call to File), the pathname from that Node will be added to $_LIBFLAGS, and thus to the link line, unmodified - without adding $LIBLINKPREFIX or $LIBLINKSUFFIX. Such entries are searched for literally (including any path component); the library search paths are not used. For example:

env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

For each Builder call that causes linking with libraries, SCons will add the libraries in the setting of $LIBS in effect at that moment to the dependency graph as dependencies of the target being generated.

The library list will be transformed to command-line arguments through the automatically-generated $_LIBFLAGS construction variable which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the $LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX construction variables to each library name.

Any command lines you define yourself that need the libraries from $LIBS should include $_LIBFLAGS (as well as $_LIBDIRFLAGS) rather than $LIBS. For example:

env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

LIBSUFFIX

The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value is set for each platform (posix, win32, os2, etc.), but the value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib, etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they create.

LIBSUFFIXES

A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. on the current platform. When searching for library dependencies, SCons will look for files with prefixes from the $LIBPREFIXES list, the base library name, and these suffixes.

LICENSE

The abbreviated name, preferably the SPDX code, of the license under which this project is released (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, BSD-2-Clause etc.). See http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical for a list of license names and SPDX codes.

See the Package builder.

LINESEPARATOR

The separator used by the Substfile and Textfile builders. This value is used between sources when constructing the target. It defaults to the current system line separator.

LINGUAS_FILE

The $LINGUAS_FILE defines file(s) containing list of additional linguas to be processed by POInit, POUpdate or MOFiles builders. It also affects Translate builder. If the variable contains a string, it defines the name of the list file. The $LINGUAS_FILE may be a list of file names as well. If $LINGUAS_FILE is set to a non-string truthy value, the list will be read from the file named LINGUAS.

LINK

The linker. See also $SHLINK for linking shared objects.

On POSIX systems (those using the link tool), you should normally not change this value as it defaults to a "smart" linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of source files in use. So for example, if you set $CXX to a specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources, the smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler for linking.

LINKCOM

The command line used to link object files into an executable. See also $SHLINKCOM for linking shared objects.

LINKCOMSTR

If set, the string displayed when object files are linked into an executable. If not set, then $LINKCOM (the command line) is displayed. See also $SHLINKCOMSTR. for linking shared objects.

env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

LINKFLAGS

General user options passed to the linker. Note that this variable should not contain -l (or similar) options for linking with the libraries listed in $LIBS, nor -L (or similar) library search path options that scons generates automatically from $LIBPATH. See $_LIBFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to library-link options, and $_LIBDIRFLAGS above, for the variable that expands to library search path options. See also $SHLINKFLAGS. for linking shared objects.

M4

The M4 macro preprocessor.

M4COM

The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro preprocessor.

M4COMSTR

The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro preprocessor. If this is not set, then $M4COM (the command line) is displayed.

M4FLAGS

General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

MAKEINDEX

The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

MAKEINDEXCOM

The command line used to call the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

MAKEINDEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when calling the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then $MAKEINDEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

MAKEINDEXFLAGS

General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

MAXLINELENGTH

The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command line. On Win32 systems, link lines longer than this many characters are linked via a temporary file name.

MIDL

The Microsoft IDL compiler.

MIDLCOM

The command line used to pass files to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

MIDLCOMSTR

The string displayed when the Microsoft IDL compiler is called. If this is not set, then $MIDLCOM (the command line) is displayed.

MIDLFLAGS

General options passed to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

MOSUFFIX

MSGFMTFLAGS

Additional flags to msgfmt(1). See msgfmt tool and MOFiles builder.

MSGINIT

Path to msginit(1) program (found via Detect). See msginit tool and POInit builder.

MSGINITCOM

Complete command line to run msginit(1) program. See msginit tool and POInit builder.

MSGINITFLAGS

List of additional flags to msginit(1) (default: []). See msginit tool and POInit builder.

_MSGINITLOCALE

Internal ``macro''. Computes locale (language) name based on target filename (default: '${TARGET.filebase}' ).

See msginit tool and POInit builder.

MSSDK_DIR

The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation.

MSSDK_VERSION

The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or Windows SDK) to be used for compilation. Supported versions include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

MSVC_BATCH

When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch compilation of object files when calling the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same source directory that generate target files in a same output directory and were configured in SCons using the same construction environment will be built in a single call to the compiler. Only source files that have changed since their object files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via the $CHANGED_SOURCES construction variable). Any compilations where the object (target) file base name (minus the .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled separately.

MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY

Specify the scons behavior when the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is not detected.

The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is not detected.

The valid values for $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY and the corresponding scons behavior are:

'Error' or 'Exception'

Raise an exception when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is not detected.

'Warning' or 'Warn'

Issue a warning and continue when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is not detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build failure(s).

'Ignore' or 'Suppress'

Take no action and continue when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is not detected. Depending on usage, this could result in build failure(s).

Note: in addition to the camel case values shown above, lower case and upper case values are accepted as well.

The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is applied when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified), and the default tools list contains one or more of the msvc tools.

$MSVC_VERSION is specified, the default tools list is explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']), and the default tools list contains one or more of the msvc tools.

A non-default tools list is specified that contains one or more of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['msvc', 'mslink']).

The $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is ignored when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is implicitly defined (i.e., the tools list is not specified).

$MSVC_VERSION is not specified and the default tools list is explicitly specified (e.g., tools=['default']).

A non-default tool list is specified that does not contain any of the msvc tools (e.g., tools=['mingw']).

Important usage details:

$MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

When $MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY is not specified, the default scons behavior is to issue a warning and continue subject to the conditions listed above. The default scons behavior may change in the future.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS

Pass user-defined arguments to the Microsoft Visual C++ batch file determined via autodetection.

$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is available for msvc batch file arguments that do not have first-class support via construction variables or when there is an issue with the appropriate construction variable validation. When available, it is recommended to use the appropriate construction variables (e.g., $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION) rather than $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS arguments.

The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are: None, a string, or a list of strings.

The $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS value is converted to a scalar string (i.e., "flattened"). The resulting scalar string, if not empty, is passed as an argument to the msvc batch file determined via autodetection subject to the validation conditions listed below.

$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is ignored when the value is None and when the result from argument conversion is an empty string. The validation conditions below do not apply.

An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS is specified for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.

Multiple SDK version arguments (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.

$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified and an SDK version argument (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple SDK version declarations via $MSVC_SDK_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

Multiple toolset version arguments (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29') are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.

$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified and a toolset version argument (e.g., '-vcvars_ver=14.29') is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple toolset version declarations via $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

Multiple spectre library arguments (e.g., '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.

$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and a spectre library argument (e.g., '-vcvars_spectre_libs=spectre') is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple spectre library declarations via $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

Multiple UWP arguments (e.g., uwp or store) are specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS.

$MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument (e.g., uwp or store) is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP declarations via $MSVC_UWP_APP and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SDK version and a toolset version specified with a string argument:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS='10.0.20348.0 -vcvars_ver=14.29.30133')

Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SDK version and a toolset version specified with a list argument:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['10.0.20348.0', '-vcvars_ver=14.29.30133'])

Important usage details:

$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

Other than checking for multiple declarations as described above, $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS arguments are not validated.

Erroneous, inconsistent, and/or version incompatible $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS arguments are likely to result in build failures for reasons that are not readily apparent and may be difficult to diagnose. The burden is on the user to ensure that the arguments provided to the msvc batch file are valid, consistent and compatible with the version of msvc selected.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY

Specify the scons behavior when Microsoft Visual C++ batch file errors are detected.

The $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY specifies the scons behavior when msvc batch file errors are detected. When $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY is not specified, the default scons behavior is to suppress msvc batch file error messages.

The root cause of msvc build failures may be difficult to diagnose. In these situations, setting the scons behavior to issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected may produce additional diagnostic information.

The valid values for $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY and the corresponding scons behavior are:

'Error' or 'Exception'

Raise an exception when msvc batch file errors are detected.

'Warning' or 'Warn'

Issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected.

'Ignore' or 'Suppress'

Suppress msvc batch file error messages.

New in version 4.4

Note: in addition to the camel case values shown above, lower case and upper case values are accepted as well.

Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with user-defined script arguments:

env = environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['8.1', 'store', '-vcvars_ver=14.1'])
env.Program('hello', ['hello.c'], CCFLAGS='/MD', LIBS=['kernel32', 'user32', 'runtimeobject'])

Example 1 - Output fragment:

...
link /nologo /OUT:_build001\hello.exe kernel32.lib user32.lib runtimeobject.lib_build001\hello.obj
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'MSVCRT.lib'
...

Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with user-defined script arguments and the script error policy set to issue a warning when msvc batch file errors are detected:

env = environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS=['8.1', 'store', '-vcvars_ver=14.1'], MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY='warn')
env.Program('hello', ['hello.c'], CCFLAGS='/MD', LIBS=['kernel32', 'user32', 'runtimeobject'])

Example 2 - Output fragment:

...
scons: warning: vc script errors detected:
[ERROR:vcvars.bat] The UWP Application Platform requires a Windows 10 SDK.
[ERROR:vcvars.bat] WindowsSdkDir = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\"
[ERROR:vcvars.bat] host/target architecture is not supported : { x64 , x64 }
...
link /nologo /OUT:_build001\hello.exe kernel32.lib user32.lib runtimeobject.lib_build001\hello.obj
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'MSVCRT.lib'

Important usage details:

$MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SCRIPTERROR_POLICY must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

Due to scons implementation details, not all Windows system environment variables are propagated to the environment in which the msvc batch file is executed. Depending on Visual Studio version and installation options, non-fatal msvc batch file error messages may be generated for ancillary tools which may not affect builds with the msvc compiler. For this reason, caution is recommended when setting the script error policy to raise an exception (e.g., 'Error').

New in version 4.4

MSVC_SDK_VERSION

Build with a specific version of the Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK).

The valid values for $MSVC_SDK_VERSION are: None or a string containing the requested SDK version (e.g., '10.0.20348.0').

$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is ignored when the value is None and when the value is an empty string. The validation conditions below do not apply.

An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.

$MSVC_SDK_VERSION is specified and an SDK version argument is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple SDK version declarations via $MSVC_SDK_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION specified does not match any of the supported formats:

'10.0.XXXXX.Y' [SDK 10.0]

'8.1' [SDK 8.1]

The system folder for the corresponding $MSVC_SDK_VERSION version is not found. The requested SDK version does not appear to be installed.

The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION version does not appear to support the requested platform type (i.e., UWP or Desktop). The requested SDK version platform type components do not appear to be installed.

The $MSVC_SDK_VERSION version is 8.1, the platform type is UWP, and the build tools selected are from Visual Studio 2017 and later (i.e., $MSVC_VERSION must be '14.0' or $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be '14.0').

Example 1 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a specific Windows SDK version:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SDK_VERSION='10.0.20348.0')

Example 2 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a specific SDK version for the Universal Windows Platform:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SDK_VERSION='10.0.20348.0', MSVC_UWP_APP=True)

Important usage details:

$MSVC_SDK_VERSION must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SDK_VERSION must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

Should a SDK 10.0 version be installed that does not follow the naming scheme above, the SDK version will need to be specified via $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS until the version number validation format can be extended.

Should an exception be raised indicating that the SDK version is not found, verify that the requested SDK version is installed with the necessary platform type components.

There is a known issue with the Microsoft libraries when the target architecture is ARM64 and a Windows 11 SDK (version '10.0.22000.0' and later) is used with the v141 build tools and older v142 toolsets (versions '14.28.29333' and earlier). Should build failures arise with these combinations of settings due to unresolved symbols in the Microsoft libraries, $MSVC_SDK_VERSION may be employed to specify a Windows 10 SDK (e.g., '10.0.20348.0') for the build.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS

Build with the spectre-mitigated Microsoft Visual C++ libraries.

The valid values for $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS are: True, False, or None.

When $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled (i.e., True), the Microsoft Visual C++ environment will include the paths to the spectre-mitigated implementations of the Microsoft Visual C++ libraries.

An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled for Visual Studio 2015 and earlier.

$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and a spectre library argument is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple spectre library declarations via $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled and the platform type is UWP. There are no spectre-mitigated libraries for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications or components.

Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build with spectre mitigated Microsoft Visual C++ libraries:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS=True)

Important usage details:

$MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

Additional compiler switches (e.g., /Qspectre) are necessary for including spectre mitigations when building user artifacts. Refer to the Visual Studio documentation for details.

The existence of the spectre libraries host architecture and target architecture folders are not verified when $MSVC_SPECTRE_LIBS is enabled which could result in build failures. The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite libraries with spectre mitigations are installed.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION

Build with a specific Microsoft Visual C++ toolset version.

Specifying $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION does not affect the autodetection and selection of msvc instances. The $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is applied after an msvc instance is selected. This could be the default version of msvc if $MSVC_VERSION is not specified.

The valid values for $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION are: None or a string containing the requested toolset version (e.g., '14.29').

$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is ignored when the value is None and when the value is an empty string. The validation conditions below do not apply.

An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified for Visual Studio 2015 and earlier.

$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified and a toolset version argument is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple toolset version declarations via $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

The $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified does not match any of the supported formats:

'XX.Y'

'XX.YY'

'XX.YY.ZZZZZ'

'XX.YY.Z' to 'XX.YY.ZZZZ' [scons extension not directly supported by the msvc batch files and may be removed in the future]

'XX.YY.ZZ.N' [SxS format]

'XX.YY.ZZ.NN' [SxS format]

The major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') of the $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified is for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier (e.g., '12.0').

The major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') of the $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION specified is greater than the msvc version selected (e.g., '99.0').

A system folder for the corresponding $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION version is not found. The requested toolset version does not appear to be installed.

Toolset selection details:

When $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is not an SxS version number or a full toolset version number: the first toolset version, ranked in descending order, that matches the $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION prefix is selected.

When $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified using the major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') and the major msvc version is that of the latest release of Visual Studio, the selected toolset version may not be the same as the default Microsoft Visual C++ toolset version.

In the latest release of Visual Studio, the default Microsoft Visual C++ toolset version is not necessarily the toolset with the largest version number.

Example 1 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.2')

Example 2 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29')

Example 3 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a full toolset version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.30133')

Example 4 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SxS toolset version specified:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.16.11')

Important usage details:

$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

The existence of the toolset host architecture and target architecture folders are not verified when $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION is specified which could result in build failures. The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite toolset target architecture build tools are installed.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_USE_SCRIPT

Use a batch script to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g. vcvars.bat), SCons will run that batch file instead of the auto-detected one, and extract the relevant variables from the result (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler version that SCons does not detect. $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS provides arguments passed to this script.

Setting $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None bypasses the Visual Studio autodetection entirely; use this if you are running SCons in a Visual Studio cmd window and importing the shell's environment variables - that is, if you are sure everything is set correctly already and you don't want SCons to change anything.

$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT ignores $MSVC_VERSION and $TARGET_ARCH.

Changed in version 4.4: new $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS provides a way to pass arguments.

MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS

Provides arguments passed to the script $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_USE_SETTINGS

Use a dictionary to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

$MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is ignored when $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT is defined and/or when $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS is set to None.

The dictionary is used to populate the environment with the relevant variables (typically %INCLUDE%, %LIB%, and %PATH%) for supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler environment that SCons does not configure correctly. This is an alternative to manually configuring the environment when bypassing Visual Studio autodetection entirely by setting $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT to None.

Here is an example of configuring a build environment using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler included in the Microsoft SDK on a 64-bit host and building for a 64-bit architecture:

# Microsoft SDK 6.0 (MSVC 8.0): 64-bit host and 64-bit target

msvc_use_settings = {
    "PATH": [
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\VC\\Bin\\x64",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Bin\\x64",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Bin",
        "C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727",
        "C:\\Windows\\system32",
        "C:\\Windows",
        "C:\\Windows\\System32\\Wbem",
        "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\"
    ],
    "INCLUDE": [
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\VC\\Include",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\VC\\Include\\Sys",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Include",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Include\\gl",
    ],
    "LIB": [
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\VC\\Lib\\x64",
        "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Lib\\x64",
    ],
    "LIBPATH": [],
    "VSCMD_ARG_app_plat": [],
    "VCINSTALLDIR": [],
    "VCToolsInstallDir": []
}

# Specifying MSVC_VERSION is recommended

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='8.0', MSVC_USE_SETTINGS=msvc_use_settings)

Important usage details:

$MSVC_USE_SETTINGS must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

The dictionary content requirements are based on the internal msvc implementation and therefore may change at any time. The burden is on the user to ensure the dictionary contents are minimally sufficient to ensure successful builds.

New in version 4.4

MSVC_UWP_APP

Build with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application Microsoft Visual C++ libraries.

The valid values for $MSVC_UWP_APP are: True, '1', False, '0', or None.

When $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled (i.e., True or '1'), the Microsoft Visual C++ environment will be set up to point to the Windows Store compatible libraries and Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes. In doing so, any libraries that are built will be able to be used in a UWP App and published to the Windows Store.

An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

$MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.

$MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled and a UWP argument is specified in $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS. Multiple UWP declarations via $MSVC_UWP_APP and $MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS are not allowed.

Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build for the Universal Windows Platform:

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_UWP_APP=True)

Important usage details:

$MSVC_UWP_APP must be passed as an argument to the Environment constructor when an msvc tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the Environment constructor. Otherwise, $MSVC_UWP_APP must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the environment.

The existence of the UWP libraries is not verified when $MSVC_UWP_APP is enabled which could result in build failures. The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite UWP libraries are installed.

MSVC_VERSION

A string to select the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C++. If the specified version is unavailable and/or unknown to SCons, a warning is issued showing the versions actually discovered, and the build will eventually fail indicating a missing compiler binary. If $MSVC_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++ installed on your system (excluding any preview versions).

Note

In order to take effect, $MSVC_VERSION must be set before the initial Microsoft Visual C++ compiler discovery takes place. Discovery happens, at the latest, during the first call to the Environment function, unless a tools list is specified which excludes the entire Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain - that is, omits "defaults" and any specific tool module that refers to parts of the toolchain (msvc, mslink, masm, midl and msvs). In this case, detection is deferred until any one of those tool modules is invoked manually. The following two examples illustrate this:

# MSVC_VERSION set as Environment is created

env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.2')

# Initialization deferred with empty tools, triggered manually

env = Environment(tools=[])
env['MSVC_VERSION'] = '14.2
env.Tool('msvc')
env.Tool('mslink')
env.Tool('msvs')
  
The valid values for $MSVC_VERSION represent major versions of the compiler, except that versions ending in Exp refer to "Express" or "Express for Desktop" Visual Studio editions. Values that do not look like a valid compiler version string are not supported.

The following table shows the correspondence of $MSVC_VERSION values to various version indicators ('x' is used as a placeholder for a single digit that can vary).

Note

It is not necessary to install a Visual Studio IDE to build with SCons (for example, you can install only Build Tools), but when a Visual Studio IDE is installed, additional builders such as MSVSSolution and MSVSProject become available and correspond to the specified versions.

Versions ending in Exp refer to historical "Express" or "Express for Desktop" Visual Studio editions, which had feature limitations compared to the full editions. It is only necessary to specify the Exp suffix to select the express edition when both express and non-express editions of the same product are installed simultaneously. The Exp suffix is unnecessary, but accepted, when only the express edition is installed.

The compilation environment can be further or more precisely specified through the use of several other construction variables: see the descriptions of $MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION, $MSVC_SDK_VERSION, $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT, $MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS, and $MSVC_USE_SETTINGS.

MSVS

When the Microsoft Visual Studio tools are initialized, they set up this dictionary with the following keys:

VERSION

the version of MSVS being used (can be set via $MSVC_VERSION)

VERSIONS

the available versions of MSVS installed

VCINSTALLDIR

installed directory of Microsoft Visual C++

VSINSTALLDIR

installed directory of Visual Studio

FRAMEWORKDIR

installed directory of the .NET framework

FRAMEWORKVERSIONS

list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted latest to oldest.

FRAMEWORKVERSION

latest installed version of the .NET framework

FRAMEWORKSDKDIR

installed location of the .NET SDK.

PLATFORMSDKDIR

installed location of the Platform SDK.

PLATFORMSDK_MODULES

dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the dictionary keys are keywords for the various modules, and the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release date, and the second is the version number.

If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry. Visual Studio 2017 and later do not use the registry for primary storage of this information, so typically for these versions only PROJECTSUFFIX and SOLUTIONSUFFIX will be set.

MSVS_ARCH

Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should build.

The default value is x86. amd64 is also supported by SCons for most Visual Studio versions. Since Visual Studio 2015 arm is supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported. Trying to set $MSVS_ARCH to an architecture that's not supported for a given Visual Studio version will generate an error.

MSVS_PROJECT_GUID

The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the ProjectGUID attribute. There is no default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH

The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the SccAuxPath attribute if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. There is no default value.

MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT

The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path under which all project and solution files will be generated. It is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the generated Microsoft Visual C++ project and solution files are computed. The relative project file path is placed as the value of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the values of the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. Similarly, the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. This is used only if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. The default value is the current working directory.

MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME

The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the SccProjectName attribute if the MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER construction variable is also set. In this case the string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER

The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the SccProvider attribute. The string is also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

MSVS_VERSION

Set the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

If $MSVS_VERSION is not set, SCons will (by default) select the latest version of Visual Studio installed on your system. So, if you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the $MSVS_VERSION variable when initializing the Environment, setting it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If the specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.

Deprecated since 1.3.0: $MSVS_VERSION is deprecated in favor of $MSVC_VERSION. As a transitional aid, if $MSVS_VERSION is set and $MSVC_VERSION is not, $MSVC_VERSION will be initialized to the value of $MSVS_VERSION. An error is raised if both are set and have different values.

MSVSBUILDCOM

The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke SCons with any specified build targets.

MSVSCLEANCOM

The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke SCons with the -c option to remove any specified targets.

MSVSENCODING

The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is encoding Windows-1252.

MSVSPROJECTCOM

The action used to generate Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX

The suffix used for Microsoft Visual C++ project (DSP) files. The default value is .vcxproj when using Visual Studio 2010 and later, .vcproj when using Visual Studio versions between 2002 and 2008, and .dsp when using Visual Studio 6.0.

MSVSREBUILDCOM

The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to have Visual Studio invoke SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

MSVSSCONS

The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files. The default is the version of SCons being used to generate the project file.

MSVSSCONSCOM

The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

MSVSSCONSCRIPT

The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file) that will be invoked by Microsoft Visual C++ project files (through the $MSVSSCONSCOM variable). The default is the same sconscript file that contains the call to MSVSProject to build the project file.

MSVSSCONSFLAGS

The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

MSVSSOLUTIONCOM

The action used to generate Microsoft Visual Studio solution files.

MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX

The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW) files. The default value is .sln when using Visual Studio version 7.x (.NET 2002) and later, and .dsw when using Visual Studio 6.0.

MT

The program used on Windows systems to embed manifests into DLLs and EXEs. See also $WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

MTEXECOM

The Windows command line used to embed manifests into executables. See also $MTSHLIBCOM.

MTFLAGS

Flags passed to the $MT manifest embedding program (Windows only).

MTSHLIBCOM

The Windows command line used to embed manifests into shared libraries (DLLs). See also $MTEXECOM.

MWCW_VERSION

The version number of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler to be used.

MWCW_VERSIONS

A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler on this system.

NAME

Specfies the name of the project to package.

See the Package builder.

NINJA_ALIAS_NAME

The name of the alias target which will cause SCons to create the ninja build file, and then (optionally) run ninja. The default value is generate-ninja.

NINJA_CMD_ARGS

A string which will pass arguments through SCons to the ninja command when scons executes ninja. Has no effect if $NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN is set.

This value can also be passed on the command line:

scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS=-v
or
scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS="-v -j 3"

NINJA_COMPDB_EXPAND

Boolean value to instruct ninja to expand the command line arguments normally put into response files. If true, prevents unexpanded lines in the compilation database like “gcc @rsp_file” and instead yields expanded lines like “gcc -c -o myfile.o myfile.c -Ia -DXYZ”.

Ninja's compdb tool added the -x flag in Ninja V1.9.0

NINJA_DEPFILE_PARSE_FORMAT

Determines the type of format ninja should expect when parsing header include depfiles. Can be msvc, gcc, or clang. The msvc option corresponds to /showIncludes format, and gcc or clang correspond to -MMD -MF.

NINJA_DIR

The builddir value. Propagates directly into the generated ninja build file. From Ninja's docs: “ A directory for some Ninja output files. ... (You can also store other build output in this directory.) ” The default value is .ninja.

NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN

Boolean. Default: False. If true, SCons will not run ninja automatically after creating the ninja build file.

If not explicitly set, this will be set to True if --disable_execute_ninja or SetOption('disable_execute_ninja', True) is seen.

NINJA_ENV_VAR_CACHE

A string that sets the environment for any environment variables that differ between the OS environment and the SCons execution environment.

It will be compatible with the default shell of the operating system.

If not explicitly set, SCons will generate this dynamically from the execution environment stored in the current construction environment (e.g. env['ENV']) where those values differ from the existing shell..

NINJA_FILE_NAME

The filename for the generated Ninja build file. The default is ninja.build.

NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD

If true, causes the build nodes to call back to scons instead of using ninja to build them. This is intended to be passed to the environment on the builder invocation. It is useful if you have a build node which does something which is not easily translated into ninja.

NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_ALIAS_NAME

A string matching the name of a user defined alias which represents a list of all generated sources. This will prevent the auto-detection of generated sources from $NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES. Then all other source files will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing the generated sources to be built first.

NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES

The list of source file suffixes which are generated by SCons build steps. All source files which match these suffixes will be added to the _generated_sources alias in the output ninja build file. Then all other source files will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing the generated sources to be built first.

NINJA_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX

The msvc_deps_prefix string. Propagates directly into the generated ninja build file. From Ninja's docs: “defines the string which should be stripped from msvc's /showIncludes output”

NINJA_POOL

Set the ninja_pool for this or all targets in scope for this env var.

NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS

A generator function used to create a ninja depfile which includes all the files which would require SCons to be invoked if they change. Or a list of said files.

_NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS_FUNC

Internal value used to specify the function to call with argument env to generate the list of files which, if changed, would require the ninja build file to be regenerated.

NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE

The number of seconds for the SCons daemon launched by ninja to stay alive. (Default: 180000)

NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_PORT

The TCP/IP port for the SCons daemon to listen on. NOTE: You cannot use a port already being listened to on your build machine. (Default: random number between 10000,60000)

NINJA_SYNTAX

The path to a custom ninja_syntax.py file which is used in generation. The tool currently assumes you have ninja installed as a Python module and grabs the syntax file from that installation if $NINJA_SYNTAX is not explicitly set.

no_import_lib

When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding Windows static import lib by the SharedLibrary builder when used with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using Microsoft Visual Studio.

OBJPREFIX

The prefix used for (static) object file names.

OBJSUFFIX

The suffix used for (static) object file names.

PACKAGEROOT

Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive will be placed if applicable. The default value is “$NAME-$VERSION”.

See the Package builder.

PACKAGETYPE

Selects the package type to build when using the Package builder. It may be a string or list of strings. See the documentation for the builder for the currently supported types.

$PACKAGETYPE may be overridden with the --package-type command line option.

See the Package builder.

PACKAGEVERSION

The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is currently only used by the rpm packager and should reflect changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code itself.

See the Package builder.

PCH

A node for the Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used when compiling object files. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined, SCons will add options to the compiler command line to cause it to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the dependencies for the PCH file. Examples:

env['PCH'] = File('StdAfx.pch')
env['PCH'] = env.PCH['pch.cc'](0)

PCHCOM

The command line used by the PCH builder to generated a precompiled header.

PCHCOMSTR

The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If not set, then $PCHCOM (the command line) is displayed.

PCHPDBFLAGS

A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the /yD flag to the command line only if the $PDB construction variable is set.

PCHSTOP

This variable specifies how much of a source file is precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being used. When this variable is defined, it must be a string that is the name of the header that is included at the end of the precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is being used:

env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

PDB

The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for object files, shared libraries, and programs. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined SCons will add options to the compiler and linker command line to cause them to generate external debugging information, and will also set up the dependencies for the PDB file. Example:

env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is /Z7. This works correctly with parallel (-j) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library. Using the /Zi instead may yield improved link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate PDB files with the /Zi switch by overriding the default $CCPDBFLAGS variable; see the entry for that variable for specific examples.

PDFLATEX

The pdflatex utility.

PDFLATEXCOM

The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

PDFLATEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this is not set, then $PDFLATEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

PDFLATEXFLAGS

General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

PDFPREFIX

The prefix used for PDF file names.

PDFSUFFIX

The suffix used for PDF file names.

PDFTEX

The pdftex utility.

PDFTEXCOM

The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

PDFTEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is not set, then $PDFTEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

PDFTEXFLAGS

General options passed to the pdftex utility.

PKGCHK

On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be used (along with $PKGINFO) to look for installed versions of the Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

PKGINFO

On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be used (along with $PKGCHK) to look for installed versions of the Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

PLATFORM

The name of the platform used to create this construction environment. SCons sets this when initializing the platform, which by default is auto-detected (see the platform argument to Environment).

env = Environment(tools=[])
if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
    Tool('mingw')(env)
else:
    Tool('msvc')(env)

POAUTOINIT

The $POAUTOINIT variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric value), let the msginit tool to automatically initialize missing PO files with msginit(1). This applies to both, POInit and POUpdate builders (and others that use any of them).

POCREATE_ALIAS

Common alias for all PO files created with POInit builder (default: 'po-create'). See msginit tool and POInit builder.

POSUFFIX

Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See msginit tool and POInit builder.

POTDOMAIN

The $POTDOMAIN defines default domain, used to generate POT filename as $POTDOMAIN.pot when no POT file name is provided by the user. This applies to POTUpdate, POInit and POUpdate builders (and builders, that use them, e.g. Translate). Normally (if $POTDOMAIN is not defined), the builders use messages.pot as default POT file name.

POTSUFFIX

Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

POTUPDATE_ALIAS

Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created with POUpdate (default: 'pot-update'). See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

POUPDATE_ALIAS

Common alias for all PO files being defined with POUpdate builder (default: 'po-update'). See msgmerge tool and POUpdate builder.

PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC

A Python function used to print the command lines as they are executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the -q or -s options or their equivalents). The function must accept four arguments: s, target, source and env. s is a string showing the command being executed, target, is the target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), source, is the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and env is the environment being used.

The function must do the printing itself. The default implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is to just print the string, as in:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

Here is an example of a more interesting function:

def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
    sys.stdout.write(
        "Building %s -> %s...\n"
        % (
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
            ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target]),
        )
    )

env = Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
env.Program('foo', ['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

This prints:

...
scons: Building targets ...
Building bar.c -> bar.o...
Building foo.c -> foo.o...
Building foo.o and bar.o -> foo...
scons: done building targets.

Another example could be a function that logs the actual commands to a file.

PROGEMITTER

Contains the emitter specification for the Program builder. The manpage section "Builder Objects" contains general information on specifying emitters.

PROGPREFIX

The prefix used for executable file names.

PROGSUFFIX

The suffix used for executable file names.

PSCOM

The command line used to convert TeX DVI files into a PostScript file.

PSCOMSTR

The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a PostScript file. If this is not set, then $PSCOM (the command line) is displayed.

PSPREFIX

The prefix used for PostScript file names.

PSSUFFIX

The prefix used for PostScript file names.

QT3_AUTOSCAN

Turn off scanning for mocable files. Use the Moc Builder to explicitly specify files to run moc on.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_AUTOSCAN.

QT3_BINPATH

The path where the Qt binaries are installed. The default value is '$QT3DIR/bin'.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_BINPATH.

QT3_CPPPATH

The path where the Qt header files are installed. The default value is '$QT3DIR/include'. Note: If you set this variable to None, the tool won't change the $CPPPATH construction variable.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_CPPPATH.

QT3_DEBUG

Prints lots of debugging information while scanning for moc files.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_DEBUG.

QT3_LIB

Default value is 'qt'. You may want to set this to 'qt-mt'. Note: If you set this variable to None, the tool won't change the $LIBS variable.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_LIB.

QT3_LIBPATH

The path where the Qt libraries are installed. The default value is '$QT3DIR/lib'. Note: If you set this variable to None, the tool won't change the $LIBPATH construction variable.

Changed in 4.5.0: renamed from QT_LIBPATH.

QT3_MOC

Default value is '$QT3_BINPATH/moc'.

QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX

Default value is ''. Prefix for moc output files when source is a C++ file.

A hook allowing the execution environment to be modified prior to the actual execution of a command line from an action via the spawner function defined by $SPAWN. Allows substitution based on targets and sources, as well as values from the construction environment, adding extra environment variables, etc.

The value must be a list (or other iterable) of functions which each generate or alter the execution environment dictionary. The first function will be passed a copy of the initial execution environment ($ENV in the current construction environment); the dictionary returned by that function is passed to the next, until the iterable is exhausted and the result returned for use by the command spawner. The original execution environment is not modified.

Each function provided in $SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS must accept four arguments and return a dictionary: env is the construction environment for this action; target is the list of targets associated with this action; source is the list of sources associated with this action; and shell_env is the current dictionary after iterating any previous $SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS functions (this can be compared to the original execution environment, which is available as env['ENV'], to detect any changes).

Example:

def custom_shell_env(env, target, source, shell_env):
    """customize shell_env if desired"""
    if str(target[0]) == 'special_target':
        shell_env['SPECIAL_VAR'] = env.subst('SOME_VAR', target=target, source=source)
    return shell_env

env["SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS"] = [custom_shell_env]

SHLIBSUFFIX

The suffix used for shared library file names.

SHLIBVERSION

When this construction variable is defined, a versioned shared library is created by the SharedLibrary builder. This activates the $_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS and thus modifies the $SHLINKCOM as required, adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed. $SHLIBVERSION versions should exist as alphanumeric, decimal-delimited values as defined by the regular expression "\w+[\.\w+]*". Example $SHLIBVERSION values include '1', '1.2.3', and '1.2.gitaa412c8b'.

env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SOVERSION='2')

The variable is used, for example, by gnulink linker tool.

In the example above SONAME would be libtest.so.2 which would be a symlink and point to libtest.so.0.1.2

SPAWN

A command interpreter function that will be called to execute command line strings. The function must accept five arguments:

def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

The list of directories that SWIG will search for included files. SCons' SWIG implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. The default value is an empty list.

Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in $SWIGFLAGS the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in $SWIGPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force scons to lookup a directory relative to the root of the source tree, use a top-relative path (#):

env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

The directory lookup can also be forced using the Dir() function:

include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated $_SWIGINCFLAGS construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of the $SWIGINCPREFIX and $SWIGINCSUFFIX construction variables to the beginning and end of each directory in $SWIGPATH. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH directory list should include $_SWIGINCFLAGS:

env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

SWIGVERSION

The detected version string of the SWIG tool.

TAR

The tar archiver.

TARCOM

The command line used to call the tar archiver.

TARCOMSTR

The string displayed when archiving files using the tar archiver. If this is not set, then $TARCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

TARFLAGS

General options passed to the tar archiver.

TARGET

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

TARGET_ARCH

The name of the hardware architecture that objects created using this construction environment should target. Can be set when creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in the Environment call.

On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is available, msvc tool setup is done using $HOST_ARCH and $TARGET_ARCH. If a value is not specified, will be set to the same value as $HOST_ARCH. Changing the value after the environment is initialized will not cause the tool to be reinitialized. Compiled objects will be in the target architecture if the compilation system supports generating for that target. The latest compiler which can fulfill the requirement will be selected, unless a different version is directed by the value of the $MSVC_VERSION construction variable.

On the win32/msvc combination, valid target arch values are x86, arm, i386 for 32-bit targets and amd64, arm64, x86_64 and ia64 (Itanium) for 64-bit targets. For example, if you want to compile 64-bit binaries, you would set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' when creating the construction environment. Note that not all target architectures are supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC versions. Check the relevant Microsoft documentation.

$TARGET_ARCH is not currently used by other compilation tools, but the option is reserved to do so in future

TARGET_OS

The name of the operating system that objects created using this construction environment should target. Can be set when creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in the Environment call;.

$TARGET_OS is not currently used by SCons but the option is reserved to do so in future

TARGETS

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

TARSUFFIX

The suffix used for tar file names.

TEMPFILE

Holds a callable object which will be invoked to transform long command lines (string or list) into an alternate form. Length limits on various operating systems may cause long command lines to fail when calling out to a shell to run the command. Most often affects linking, when there are many object files and/or libraries to be linked, but may also affect other compilation steps which have many arguments. $TEMPFILE is not called directly, but rather is typically embedded in another construction variable, to be expanded when used. Example:

env["TEMPFILE"] = TempFileMunge
env["LINKCOM"] = "${TEMPFILE('$LINK $TARGET $SOURCES', '$LINKCOMSTR')}"

The SCons default value for $TEMPFILE, TempFileMunge, performs command substitution on the passed command line, calculates whether modification is needed, then puts all but the first word (assumed to be the command name) of the resulting list into a temporary file (sometimes called a response file or command file), and returns a new command line consisting of the the command name and an appropriately formatted reference to the temporary file.

A replacement for the default tempfile object would need to do fundamentally the same thing, including taking into account the values of $MAXLINELENGTH, $TEMPFILEPREFIX, $TEMPFILESUFFIX, $TEMPFILEARGJOIN, $TEMPFILEDIR and $TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC. If a particular use case requires a different transformation than the default, it is recommended to copy the mechanism and define a new construction variable and rewrite the relevant *COM variable(s) to use it, to avoid possibly disrupting existing uses of $TEMPFILE.

TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC

The default argument escape function is SCons.Subst.quote_spaces. If you need to apply extra operations on a command argument (to fix Windows slashes, normalize paths, etc.) before writing to the temporary file, you can set the $TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC variable to a custom function. The function must accept a single string argument and and return a new string with any modifications applied. Example:

import sys
import re
from SCons.Subst import quote_spaces

WINPATHSEP_RE = re.compile(r"\\([^\"'\\]|$)")

def tempfile_arg_esc_func(arg):
    arg = quote_spaces(arg)
    if sys.platform != "win32":
        return arg
    # GCC requires double Windows slashes, let's use UNIX separator
    return WINPATHSEP_RE.sub(r"/\1", arg)

env["TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC"] = tempfile_arg_esc_func

TEMPFILEARGJOIN

The string to use to join the arguments passed to $TEMPFILE when the command line exceeds the limit set by $MAXLINELENGTH. The default value is a space. However for MSVC, MSLINK the default is a line separator as defined by os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded by the subst logic.

TEMPFILEDIR

The directory to create the long-lines temporary file in. If unset, the Python tempfile module chooses the directory based on the TMPDIR, TEMP or TMP environment variables. If the default path causes processing errors, set $TEMPFILEDIR to a safer alternative. For example, on Windows, the default temporary file path contains the username. If the username contains non-7-bit-ASCII characters, there may decoding errors opening the path to the temporary file. See also $TEMPFILEENCODING.

TEMPFILEENCODING

By default, the long-lines temporary file (aka "response file") created by the $TEMPFILE function will be encoded in the Python default encoding, UTF-8. If the external command which reads the response file encounters decoding errors (usually, if that command depends on Windows legacy code pages, and a pathname in the response file or the response file path itself cannot be represented in the 7-bit ASCII characer set), set this variable to the appropriate codec. See also $TEMPFILEDIR.

New in version 4.10.0

TEMPFILEPREFIX

The prefix for the name of the temporary file used to store command lines exceeding $MAXLINELENGTH. The prefix must include the compiler syntax to actually include and process the file. The default prefix is '@', which works for the Microsoft Visual C++ and GNU toolchains on Windows. Set this appropriately for other toolchains, for example '-@' for the diab compiler or '-via' for ARM toolchain.

TEMPFILESUFFIX

The suffix for the name of the temporary file used to store command lines exceeding $MAXLINELENGTH. The suffix should include the dot ('.') if one is needed as it will not be added automatically. The default is .lnk.

TEX

The TeX formatter and typesetter.

TEXCOM

The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

TEXCOMSTR

The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then $TEXCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

TEXFLAGS

General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

TEXINPUTS

List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for include directories. The LaTeX implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for \include and \import files.

TEXTFILEPREFIX

The prefix used for Textfile file names, an empty string by default.

TEXTFILESUFFIX

The suffix used for Textfile file names; .txt by default.

TOOLS

A list of the names of the Tool specification modules that were actually initialized in the current construction environment. This may be useful as a diagnostic aid to see if a tool did (or did not) run. The value is informative and is not guaranteed to be complete.

UNCHANGED_SOURCES

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

UNCHANGED_TARGETS

A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

VENDOR

The person or organization who supply the packaged software. This is used to fill in the Vendor: field in the controlling information for RPM packages, and the Manufacturer: field in the controlling information for MSI packages.

See the Package builder.

VERSION

The version of the project, specified as a string.

See the Package builder.

VSWHERE

Specify the location of vswhere.exe.

The vswhere.exe executable is distributed with Microsoft Visual Studio and Build Tools since the 2017 edition, but is also available as a standalone installation. It allows queries to obtain detailed information about installations of 2017 and later editions. SCons makes use of this information to determine the state of compiler support for those editions.

Setting the $VSWHERE variable to the path to a specific vswhere.exe binary causes SCons to use that binary. If not set, SCons will search for one, looking in the following locations in order, using the first found ($VSWHERE is updated with the location):

%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer
%ChocolateyInstall%\bin
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links
%USERPROFILE%\scoop\shims
%SCOOP%\shims
Note

In order to take effect, $VSWHERE must be set before the initial Microsoft Visual C++ compiler discovery takes place. Discovery happens, at the latest, during the first call to the Environment function, unless a tools list is specified which excludes the entire Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain - that is, omits "defaults" and any specific tool module that refers to parts of the toolchain (msvc, mslink, masm, midl and msvs). In this case, detection is deferred until any one of those tool modules is invoked manually. The following two examples illustrate this:

# VSWHERE set as Environment is created

env = Environment(VSWHERE='c:/my/path/to/vswhere')

# Initialization deferred with empty tools, triggered manually

env = Environment(tools=[])
env['VSWHERE'] = r'c:/my/vswhere/install/location/vswhere.exe'
env.Tool('msvc')
env.Tool('mslink')
env.Tool('msvs')
  
WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST

Set to True to embed the compiler-generated manifest (normally ${TARGET}.manifest) into all Windows executables and DLLs built with this environment, as a resource during their link step. This is done using $MT and $MTEXECOM and $MTSHLIBCOM. See also $WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST.

WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF

If set to true, a library build of a Windows shared library (.dll file) will include a reference to the corresponding module-definition file at the same time, if a module-definition file is not already listed as a build target. The name of the module-definition file will be constructed from the base name of the library and the construction variables $WINDOWSDEFSUFFIX and $WINDOWSDEFPREFIX. The default is to not add a module-definition file. The module-definition file is not created by this directive, and must be supplied by the developer.

WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST

If set to true, scons will add the manifest file generated by Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 and later to the target list so SCons will be aware they were generated. In the case of an executable, the manifest file name is constructed using $WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX and $WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTPREFIX. In the case of a shared library, the manifest file name is constructed using $WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX and $WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTPREFIX. See also $WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST.

WINDOWSDEFPREFIX

XGETTEXT

Path to xgettext(1) program (found via Detect()). See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

XGETTEXTCOM

Complete xgettext command line. See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

XGETTEXTCOMSTR

A string that is shown when xgettext(1) command is invoked (default: '', which means "print $XGETTEXTCOM"). See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

_XGETTEXTDOMAIN

Internal "macro". Generates xgettext domain name form source and target (default: '${TARGET.filebase}').

XGETTEXTFLAGS

Additional flags to xgettext(1). See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

XGETTEXTFROM

Name of file containing list of xgettext(1)'s source files. Autotools' users know this as POTFILES.in so they will in most cases set XGETTEXTFROM="POTFILES.in" here. The $XGETTEXTFROM files have same syntax and semantics as the well known GNU POTFILES.in. See xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

_XGETTEXTFROMFLAGS

Internal "macro". Generates list of -D<dir> flags from the $XGETTEXTPATH list.

XGETTEXTFROMPREFIX

This flag is used to add single $XGETTEXTFROM file to xgettext(1)'s command line (default: '-f').

XGETTEXTFROMSUFFIX

(default: '')

XGETTEXTPATH

List of directories, there xgettext(1) will look for source files (default: []).

Note

This variable works only together with $XGETTEXTFROM

See also xgettext tool and POTUpdate builder.

_XGETTEXTPATHFLAGS

Internal "macro". Generates list of -f<file> flags from $XGETTEXTFROM.

XGETTEXTPATHPREFIX

This flag is used to add single search path to xgettext(1)'s command line (default: '-D').

XGETTEXTPATHSUFFIX

(default: '')

YACC

The parser generator.

YACC_GRAPH_FILE

If supplied, write a graph of the automaton to a file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --graph= command-line option. Use this in preference to including --graph= in $YACCFLAGS directly.

New in version 4.4.0.

YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX

Previously specified by $YACCVCGFILESUFFIX.

The suffix of the file containing a graph of the grammar automaton when the -g option (or --graph= without an option-argument) is used in $YACCFLAGS. Note that setting this variable informs SCons how to construct the graph filename for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated filename. Various yacc tools have emitted various formats at different times. Set this to match what your parser generator produces.

New in version 4.6.0.

YACC_HEADER_FILE

If supplied, generate a header file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a --header= command-line option. Use this in preference to including --header= in $YACCFLAGS directly.

New in version 4.4.0.

YACCCOM

The command line used to call the parser generator to generate a source file.

YACCCOMSTR

The string displayed when generating a source file using the parser generator. If this is not set, then $YACCCOM (the command line) is displayed.

env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR="Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

YACCFLAGS

General options passed to the parser generator. In addition to passing the value on during invocation, the yacc tool also examines this construction variable for options which cause additional output files to be generated, and adds those to the target list.

If the -d option is present in $YACCFLAGS scons assumes that the call will also create a header file with the suffix defined by $YACCHFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .y suffix, or a file with the suffix defined by $YACCHXXFILESUFFIX if the yacc source file ends in a .yy suffix. The header will have the same base name as the requested target. This is only correct if the executable is bison (or win_bison). If using Berkeley yacc (byacc), y.tab.h is always written - avoid the -d in this case and use $YACC_HEADER_FILE instead.

If a -g option is present, scons assumes that the call will also create a graph file with the suffix defined by $YACCVCGFILESUFFIX.

If a -v option is present, scons assumes that the call will also create an output debug file with the suffix .output.

Also recognized are GNU bison options --header (and its deprecated synonym --defines), which is similar to -d but gives the option to explicitly name the output header file through an option argument; and --graph, which is similar to -g but gives the option to explicitly name the output graph file through an option argument. The file suffixes described for -d and -g above are not applied if these are used in the option=argument form.

Note that files specified by --header= and --graph= may not be properly handled by SCons in all situations, and using those in $YACCFLAGS should be considered legacy support only. Consider using $YACC_HEADER_FILE and $YACC_GRAPH_FILE instead if the files need to be explicitly named (new in version 4.4.0).

YACCHFILESUFFIX

The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser generator when the -d option (or --header without an option-argument) is used in $YACCFLAGS. Note that setting this variable informs SCons how to construct the header filename for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated filename. Set this to match what your parser generator produces. The default value is .h.

YACCHXXFILESUFFIX

The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser generator when the -d option (or --header without an option-argument) is used in $YACCFLAGS. Note that setting this variable informs SCons how to construct the header filename for tracking purposes, it does not affect the actual generated filename. Set this to match what your parser generator produces. The default value is .hpp.

YACCVCGFILESUFFIX

Obsoleted. Use $YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX instead. The value is used only if $YACC_GRAPH_FILE_SUFFIX is not set. The default value is .gv.

Changed in version 4.6.0: deprecated. The default value changed from .vcg (bison stopped generating .vcg output with version 2.4, in 2006).

ZIP

The zip compression and file packaging utility.

ZIP_OVERRIDE_TIMESTAMP

An optional timestamp which overrides the last modification time of the file when stored inside the Zip archive. This is a tuple of six values: Year (>= 1980) Month (one-based) Day of month (one-based) Hours (zero-based) Minutes (zero-based) Seconds (zero-based)

ZIPCOM

The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal Python function used to create a zip archive.

ZIPCOMPRESSION

The compression flag from the Python zipfile module used by the internal Python function to control whether the zip archive is compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED, which creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect if the zipfile module is unavailable.

ZIPCOMSTR

The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility. If this is not set, then $ZIPCOM (the command line or internal Python function) is displayed.

env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

ZIPFLAGS

General options passed to the zip utility.

ZIPROOT

An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames stored in the zip file will be relative to this directory, if given. Otherwise, the filenames are relative to the current directory of the command. For instance:

env = Environment()
env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name subdir2/file1 rather than subdir1/subdir2/file1.

ZIPSUFFIX

The suffix used for zip file names.

Appendix B. Builders

This appendix contains descriptions of all of the Builders that are potentially available "out of the box" in this version of SCons.

CFile()
env.CFile()

Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file. The suffix specified by the $CFILESUFFIX construction variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.c

env.CFile(target='foo.c', source='foo.l')

# builds bar.c

env.CFile(target='bar', source='bar.y')

Command()
env.Command()

There is actually no Builder named Command, rather the term "Command Builder" refers to a function which, on each call, creates and calls an anonymous Builder. This is useful for "one-off" builds where a full Builder is not needed. Since the anonymous Builder is never hooked into the standard Builder framework, an Action must always be specified. See the Command function description for the calling syntax and details.

CompilationDatabase()
env.CompilationDatabase()

CompilationDatabase is a special builder which adds a target to create a JSON formatted compilation database compatible with clang tooling (see the LLVM specification). This database is suitable for consumption by various tools and editors who can use it to obtain build and dependency information which otherwise would be internal to SCons. The builder does not require any source files to be specified, rather it arranges to emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler source/output pairs identified in the build that are not excluded by the optional filter $COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER. The target is subject to the usual SCons target selection rules.

If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of compile_commands.json.

If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce" the target name from that source argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this case the default target name will be used.

Note

You must load the compilation_db tool prior to specifying any part of your build or some source/output files will not show up in the compilation database.

Available since scons 4.0.

CXXFile()
env.CXXFile()

Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input file. The suffix specified by the $CXXFILESUFFIX construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to the target if it is not already present. Example:

# builds foo.cc

env.CXXFile(target='foo.cc', source='foo.ll')

# builds bar.cc

env.CXXFile(target='bar', source='bar.yy')

DocbookEpub()
env.DocbookEpub()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual.epub', 'manual.xml')

or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookEpub('manual')

DocbookHtml()
env.DocbookHtml()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')

DocbookHtmlChunked()
env.DocbookHtmlChunked()

A pseudo-Builder providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML output. It supports the base.dir parameter. The chunkfast.xsl file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic syntax:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

where manual.xml is the input file.

If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “scons -c”:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed only!

DocbookHtmlhelp()
env.DocbookHtmlhelp()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

where manual.xml is the input file.

If you use the root.filename parameter in your own stylesheets you have to specify the new target name. This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “scons -c”:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed only!

DocbookMan()
env.DocbookMan()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page output. Its basic syntax is:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookMan('manual')

where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a target name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the refname entries in your XML source.

DocbookPdf()
env.DocbookPdf()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

DocbookSlidesHtml()
env.DocbookSlidesHtml()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

If you use the titlefoil.html parameter in your own stylesheets you have to give the new target name. This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “scons -c”:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

Some basic support for the base.dir parameter is provided. You can add the base_dir keyword to your Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed only!

DocbookSlidesPdf()
env.DocbookSlidesPdf()

A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides output.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

or simply

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

DocbookXInclude()
env.DocbookXInclude()

A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate processing step.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

DocbookXslt()
env.DocbookXslt()

A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the input file.

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

Note, that this builder requires the xsl parameter to be set.

DVI()
env.DVI()

Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If the source file suffix is .tex, scons will examine the contents of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is built by invoking the $LATEXCOM command line; otherwise, the $TEXCOM command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX file, the DVI builder method will also examine the contents of the .aux file and invoke the $BIBTEX command line if the string bibdata is found, start $MAKEINDEX to generate an index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents .log file and re-run the $LATEXCOM command if the log file says it is necessary.

The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically added to the target if it is not already present. Examples:

# builds from aaa.tex

env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')

# builds bbb.dvi

env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')

# builds from ccc.latex

env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

Gs()
env.Gs()

A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on the underlying OS, the different names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c are tried.

env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
env.Gs(
    'cover.jpg',
    'scons-scons.pdf',
    GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q',
)

Install()
env.Install()

Installs one or more source files or directories in the specified target, which must be a directory. The names of the specified source files or directories remain the same within the destination directory. The sources may be given as a string or as a node returned by a builder.

env.Install(target='/usr/local/bin', source=['foo', 'bar'])

Note that if target paths chosen for the Install builder (and the related InstallAs and InstallVersionedLib builders) are outside the project tree, such as in the example above, they may not be selected for "building" by default, since in the absence of other instructions scons builds targets that are underneath the top directory (the directory that contains the SConstruct file, usually the current directory). Use command line targets or the Default function in this case.

If the --install-sandbox command line option is given, the target directory will be prefixed by the directory path specified. This is useful to test installation behavior without installing to a "live" location in the system.

See also FindInstalledFiles. For more thoughts on installation, see the User Guide (particularly the section on Command-Line Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on Alias Targets).

InstallAs()
env.InstallAs()

Installs one or more source files or directories to specific names, allowing changing a file or directory name as part of the installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments list different numbers of files or directories.

env.InstallAs(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
              source='foo_debug')
env.InstallAs(target=['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
              source=['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

See the note under Install.

InstallVersionedLib()
env.InstallVersionedLib()

Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to the architecture will be generated based on symlinks of the source library.

env.InstallVersionedLib(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                        source='libxyz.1.5.2.so')

See the note under Install.

Jar()
env.Jar()

Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of sources. Any directories in the source list will be searched for .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be compiled to .class files by calling the Java Builder.

If the $JARCHDIR value is set, the jar command will change to the specified directory using the -C option. If $JARCHDIR is not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory tree in which Java .class were built by the Java Builder.

If the contents any of the source files begin with the string Manifest-Version, the file is assumed to be a manifest and is passed to the jar command with the m option set.

env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
        source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

Java()
env.Java()

Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any combination of explicit .java files, or directory trees which will be scanned for .java files.

SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes (including inner classes) defined within that file, and from that figure out the target .class files that will be created. The class files will be placed underneath the specified target directory.

SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name, which it assumes can be found on a line beginning with the string package in the first column; the resulting .class files will be placed in a directory reflecting the specified package name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a single public Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate a corresponding sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

Examples:

env.Java(target='classes', source='src')
env.Java(target='classes', source=['src1', 'src2'])
env.Java(target='classes', source=['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying OS. Since SCons compiles in simple ASCII mode by default, the compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters, which may lead to errors as the file is processed further. In this case, the user must specify the LANG environment variable to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portability, it's best if the encoding is hard-coded, so that the compilation works when run on a system with a different encoding.

env = Environment()
env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

JavaH()
env.JavaH()

Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native methods. The target can be either a directory in which the header files will be written, or a header file name which will contain all of the definitions. The source can be the names of .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled into .class files by calling the Java builder method, or the objects returned from the Java builder method.

If the construction variable $JAVACLASSDIR is set, either in the environment or in the call to the JavaH builder method itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the beginning of any .class file names.

Examples:

# builds java_native.h

classes = env.Java(target="classdir", source="src")
env.JavaH(target="java_native.h", source=classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h

env.JavaH(target="include", source=["package/foo.class", "package/bar.class"])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h

env.JavaH(
    target="export",
    source=["classes/foo.class", "classes/bar.class"],
    JAVACLASSDIR="classes",
)

Note

Java versions starting with 10.0 no longer use the javah command for generating JNI headers/sources, and indeed have removed the command entirely (see Java Enhancement Proposal JEP 313), making this tool harder to use for that purpose. SCons may autodiscover a javah belonging to an older release if there are multiple Java versions on the system, which will lead to incorrect results. To use with a newer Java, override the default values of $JAVAH (to contain the path to the javac) and $JAVAHFLAGS (to contain at least a -h flag) and note that generating headers with javac requires supplying source .java files only, not .class files.

Library()
env.Library()

A synonym for the StaticLibrary builder method.

LoadableModule()
env.LoadableModule()

On most systems, this is the same as SharedLibrary. On Mac OS X (Darwin) platforms, this creates a loadable module bundle.

M4()
env.M4()

Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default $M4FLAGS value of -E, which considers all warnings to be fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version of m4. Example:

env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

Moc()
env.Moc()

Builds an output file from a moc input file. moc input files are either header files or C++ files. This builder is only available after using the tool qt3. See the $QT3DIR variable for more information. Example:

env.Moc('foo.h')  # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp')  # generates foo.moc

MOFiles()
env.MOFiles()

This builder is set up by the msgfmt tool. The builder compiles PO files to MO files. MOFiles is a single-source builder. The source parameter can also be omitted if $LINGUAS_FILE is set.

Example 1. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

Example 2. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE=True)

Example 3. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

Example 4. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file (another version):

env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env.MOFiles()

MSVSProject()
env.MSVSProject()

Build a Microsoft Visual C++ project file and solution file.

Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ project file based on the version of Visual Studio (or to be more precise, of MSBuild) that is configured: either the latest installed version, or the version specified by $MSVC_VERSION in the current construction environment. For Visual Studio 6.0 a .dsp file is generated. For Visual Studio versions 2002-2008, a .vcproj file is generated. For Visual Studio 2010 and later a .vcxproj file is generated. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft compilation environment - see the description of $MSVC_VERSION for equivalences. Note SCons does not know how to construct project files for other languages (e.g. .csproj for C#, .vbproj for Visual Basic or .pyproject for Python).

For the .vcxproj file, the underlying format is the MSBuild XML Schema, and the details conform to: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/vcxproj-file-structure. The generated solution file enables Visual Studio to understand the project structure, and allows building it using MSBuild to call back to SCons. The project file encodes a toolset version that has been selected by SCons as described above. Since recent Visual Studio versions support multiple concurrent toolsets, use $MSVC_VERSION to select the desired one if it does not match the SCons default. The project file also includes entries which describe how to call SCons to build the project from within Visual Studio (or from an MSBuild command line). In some situations SCons may generate this incorrectly - notably when using the scons-local distribution, which is not installed in a way that that matches the default invocation line. If so, the $SCONS_HOME construction variable can be used to describe the right way to locate the SCons code so that it can be imported.

By default, a matching solution file for the project is also generated. This behavior may be disabled by specifying auto_build_solution=0 to the MSVSProject builder. The solution file can also be independently generated by calling the MSVSSolution builder, such as in the case where a solution should describe multiple projects. See the MSVSSolution description for further information.

The MSVSProject builder accepts several keyword arguments describing lists of filenames to be placed into the project file. Currently, srcs, incs, localincs, resources, and misc are recognized. The names are intended to be self-explanatory, but note that the filenames need to be specified as strings, not as SCons File Nodes (for example if you generate files for inclusion by using the Glob function, the results should be converted to a list of strings before passing them to MSVSProject). This is because Visual Studio and MSBuild know nothing about SCons Node types. Each of the filename lists are individually optional, but at least one list must be specified for the resulting project file to be non-empty.

In addition to the above lists of values, the following values may be specified as keyword arguments:

target

The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the $MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX construction variable will be defined to the correct value (see example below).

variant

The name of this particular variant. Except for Visual Studio 6 projects, this can also be a list of variant names. These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a | (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox. The default target platform is Win32. Multiple calls to MSVSProject with different variants are allowed; all variants will be added to the project file with their appropriate build targets and sources.

cmdargs

Additional command line arguments for the different variants. The number of cmdargs entries must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to all variants.

cppdefines

Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The number of cppdefines entries must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to all variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use the invoking environment's $CPPDEFINES entry for all variants.

cppflags

Compiler flags for the different variants. If a /std:c++ flag is found then /Zc:__cplusplus is appended to the flags if not already found, this ensures that Intellisense uses the /std:c++ switch. The number of cppflags entries must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to all variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will combine the invoking environment's $CCFLAGS, $CXXFLAGS, $CPPFLAGS entries for all variants.

cpppaths

Compiler include paths for the different variants. The number of cpppaths entries must match the number of variant entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to all variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use the invoking environment's $CPPPATH entry for all variants.

buildtarget

An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one per build variant), to tell the Visual Studio debugger what output target to use in what build variant. The number of buildtarget entries must match the number of variant entries.

runfile

The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will run and debug. This appears as the value of the Output field in the resulting Microsoft Visual C++ project file. If this is not specified, the default is the same as the specified buildtarget value.

Note

SCons and Microsoft Visual Studio understand projects in different ways, and the mapping is sometimes imperfect:

Because SCons always executes its build commands from the directory in which the SConstruct file is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the directory of the SConstruct file, users will not be able to double-click on the file name in compilation error messages displayed in the Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by adding the Microsoft Visual C++ /FC compiler option to the $CCFLAGS variable so that the compiler will print the full path name of any files that cause compilation errors.

If the project file is only used to teach the Visual Studio project browser about the file layout there should be no issues, However, Visual Studio should not be used to make changes to the project structure, build options, etc. as these will (a) not feed back to the SCons description of the project and (b) be lost if SCons regenerates the project file. The SConscript files should remain the definitive description of the build.

If the project file is used to drive MSBuild (such as selecting "build" from the Visual Studio interface) you lose the direct control of target selection and command-line options you would have if launching the build directly from SCons, because these will be hard-coded in the project file to the values specified in the MSVSProject call. You can regain some of this control by defining multiple variants, using multiple MSVSProject calls to arrange different build targets, arguments, defines, flags and paths for different variants.

If the build is divided into a solution with multiple MSBuild projects the mapping is further strained. In this case, it is important not to set Visual Studio to do parallel builds, as it will then launch the separate project builds in parallel, and SCons does not work well if called that way. Instead, you can set up the SCons build for parallel building - see the SetOption function for how to do this with num_jobs.

Example usage:

barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
barincs = ['bar.h']
barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
barresources = ['bar.rc', 'resource.h']
barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll', source=barsrcs)
buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
env.MSVSProject(
    target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
    srcs=barsrcs,
    incs=barincs,
    localincs=barlocalincs,
    resources=barresources,
    misc=barmisc,
    buildtarget=buildtarget,
    variant='Release',
)

DebugSettings

A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file, depending on the version installed. As for cmdargs, you can specify a DebugSettings dictionary per variant. If you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants.

Changed in version 2.4: Added the optional DebugSettings parameter.

Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11 are implemented, for other versions no file is generated. To generate the user file, you just need to add a DebugSettings dictionary to the environment with the right parameters for your MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does not contain any good value, no file will be generated.

Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a project for variants and DebugSettings:

# Assuming you store your defaults in a file

vars = Variables('variables.py')
msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

# Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version

if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
    env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver + '.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
else:
    env = Environment()

AddOption(
    '--userfile',
    action='store_true',
    dest='userfile',
    default=False,
    help="Create Visual C++ project file",
)

#

# 1. Configure your Debug Setting dictionary with options you want in the list

# of allowed options, for instance if you want to create a user file to launch

    cmdargs=f'vc={msvcver}',
    DebugSettings=(dbgSettings, {}),
)

MSVSSolution()
env.MSVSSolution()

Build a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file.

Builds a Visual Studio solution file based on the version of Visual Studio that is configured: either the latest installed version, or the version specified by $MSVC_VERSION in the construction environment. For Visual Studio 6, a .dsw file is generated. For Visual Studio .NET 2002 and later, it will generate a .sln file. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft compilation environment - see the description of $MSVC_VERSION for equivalences.

The solution file is a container for one or more projects, and follows the format described at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file.

The following values must be specified:

target

The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the value $MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX will be defined to the correct value (see example below).

variant

The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant names (the latter is only supported for MSVS 7 solutions). These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox". Default platform is Win32.

projects

A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by calls to the MSVSProject Builder, to be placed into the solution file. Note that these filenames need to be specified as strings, NOT as SCons File Nodes. This is because the solution file will be interpreted by MSBuild and by Visual Studio, which know nothing about SCons Node types.

In addition to the mandatory arguments above, the following optional values may be specified as keyword arguments:

auto_filter_projects

Under certain circumstances, solution file names or solution file nodes may be present in the projects argument list. When solution file names or nodes are present in the projects argument list, the generated solution file may contain erroneous Project records resulting in VS IDE error messages when opening the generated solution file. By default, an exception is raised when a solution file name or solution file node is detected in the projects argument list.

The accepted values for auto_filter_projects are:

None

An exception is raised when a solution file name or solution file node is detected in the projects argument list.

None is the default value.

True or evaluates True

Automatically remove solution file names and solution file nodes from the projects argument list.

False or evaluates False

Leave the solution file names and solution file nodes in the projects argument list. An exception is not raised.

When opening the generated solution file with the VS IDE, the VS IDE will likely report that there are erroneous Project records that are not supported or that need to be modified.

Example Usage:

env.MSVSSolution(
    target="Bar" + env["MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX"],
    projects=["bar" + env["MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX"]],
    variant="Release",
)

Ninja()
env.Ninja()

A special builder which adds a target to create a Ninja build file. The builder does not require any source files to be specified.

Note

This is an experimental feature. To enable it you must use one of the following methods

# On the command line

--experimental=ninja

# Or in your SConstruct

SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

This functionality is subject to change and/or removal without deprecation cycle.

To use this tool you need to install the Python ninja package, as the tool by default depends on being able to do an import of the package This can be done via:

python -m pip install ninja

If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of ninja.build.

If called with a single positional argument, scons will "deduce" the target name from that source argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call the builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

If called with either the target= or source= keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as the target name. If called with both, the target= value is used and source= is ignored. If called with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the intent was; in this case the default target name will be used.

Available since scons 4.2.

Object()
env.Object()

A synonym for the StaticObject builder method.

Package()
env.Package()

Builds software distribution packages. A package is a container format which includes files to install along with metadata. Packaging is optional, and must be enabled by specifying the packaging tool. For example:

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])

SCons can build packages in a number of well known packaging formats. The target package type may be selected with the $PACKAGETYPE construction variable or the --package-type command line option. The package type may be a list, in which case SCons will attempt to build packages for each type in the list. Example:

env.Package(PACKAGETYPE=['src_zip', 'src_targz'], ...other args...)

The currently supported packagers are:

msi Microsoft Installer package
rpm RPM Package Manager package
ipkg Itsy Package Management package
tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file
targz gzip-compressed tar file
tarxz xz-compressed tar file
zip zip file
src_tarbz2 bzip2-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
src_targz gzip-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
src_tarxz xz-compressed tar file suitable as source to another packager
src_zip zip file suitable as source to another packager

The file list to include in the package may be specified with the source keyword argument. If omitted, the FindInstalledFiles function is called behind the scenes to select all files that have an Install, InstallAs or InstallVersionedLib Builder attached. If the target keyword argument is omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced from the package type(s).

The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be packaged, and partly from packaging tags. Tags can be passed as keyword arguments to the Package builder call, and may also be attached to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files) with the Tag function. Some package-level tags are mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted. The mandatory tags vary depending on the package type.

While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by the value of the $PACKAGEROOT variable - the package sources are copied there before packaging.

Packaging example:

env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
env.Install("/bin/", "my_program")
env.Package(
    NAME="foo",
    VERSION="1.2.3",
    PACKAGEVERSION=0,
    PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
    LICENSE="gpl",
    SUMMARY="balalalalal",
    DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
    X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
    SOURCE_URL="https://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz",
)

In this example, the target /bin/my_program created by the Install call would not be built by default since it is not under the project top directory. However, since no source is specified to the Package builder, it is selected for packaging by the default sources rule. Since packaging is done using $PACKAGEROOT, no write is actually done to the system's /bin directory, and the target will be selected since after rebasing to underneath $PACKAGEROOT it is now under the top directory of the project.

PCH()
env.PCH()

Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this builder returns a list of two target nodes: the PCH as the first element, and the object file as the second element. Normally the object file is ignored. The PCH builder is generally used in conjunction with the $PCH construction variable to force object files to use the precompiled header:

env['PCH'] = env.PCH['StdAfx.cpp'](0)

Note

This builder is specific to the PCH implementation in Microsoft Visual C++. Other compiler chains also implement precompiled header support, but PCH does not work with them at this time. As a result, the builder is only generated into the construction environment when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler.

The builder only works correctly in a C++ project. The Microsoft implementation distinguishes between precompiled headers from C and C++. Use of the builder will cause the PCH generation to happen with a flag that tells cl.exe all of the files are C++ files; if that PCH file is then supplied when compiling a C source file, cl.exe will fail the build with a compatibility violation.

If possible, arrange the project so that a C++ source file passed to the PCH builder is not also included in the list of sources to be otherwise compiled in the project. SCons will correctly track that file in the dependency tree as a result of the PCH call, and (for MSVC 11.0 and greater) automatically add the corresponding object file to the link line. If the source list is automatically generated, for example using the Glob function, it may be necessary to remove that file from the list.

PDF()
env.PDF()

Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the $PDFSUFFIX construction variable (.pdf by default) is added automatically to the target if it is not already present. PDF is a single-source builder. Example:

# builds from aaa.tex

env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')

# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi

env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

POInit()
env.POInit()

This builder is set up by the msginit tool. The builder initializes missing PO file(s) if $POAUTOINIT is set. If $POAUTOINIT is not set (the default), POInit prints instruction for the user (such as a translator), telling how the PO file should be initialized. In normal projects you should not use POInit and use POUpdate instead. POUpdate chooses intelligently between msgmerge(1) and msginit(1). POInit always uses msginit(1) and should be regarded as builder for special purposes or for temporary use (e.g. for quick, one time initialization of a bunch of PO files) or for tests. POInit is a single-source builder. The source parameter can also be omitted if $LINGUAS_FILE is set.

Target nodes defined through POInit are not built by default (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are added to special Alias ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be changed through the $POCREATE_ALIAS construction variable. All PO files defined through POInit may be easily initialized by scons po-create.

Example 1. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

Example 2. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

Example 3. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using the $POTDOMAIN construction variable:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

Example 4. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE=True)  # needs 'LINGUAS' file

Example 5. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

Example 6. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then initialize PO files:

env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
env.POInit()

which has same efect as:

env.POInit(POAUTOINIT=True, LINGUAS_FILE=True, POTDOMAIN='foo')

PostScript()
env.PostScript()

Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The suffix specified by the $PSSUFFIX construction variable (.ps by default) is added automatically to the target if it is not already present. PostScript is a single-source builder. Example:

# builds from aaa.tex

env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')

# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi

env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

POTUpdate()
env.POTUpdate()

The builder is set up by the xgettext tool, part of the gettext toolset. The builder updates the target POT file if exists or creates it if it doesn't. The target node is not selected for building by default (e.g. scons .), but only on demand (i.e. when the given POT file is required or when special alias is invoked). This builder adds its target node (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default, see $POTUPDATE_ALIAS) so you can update/create them easily with scons pot-update. The file is not written until there is no real change in internationalized messages (or in comments that enter POT file).

Note

You may see xgettext(1) being invoked by the xgettext tool even if there is no real change in internationalized messages (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time a source file has changed. In such case we invoke xgettext(1) and compare its output with the content of POT file to decide whether the file should be updated or not.

Example 1. Let's create po/ directory and place following SConstruct script there:

# SConstruct in 'po/' subdir

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

Then invoke scons few times:

$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

the results shall be as the comments above say.

Example 2. The target argument can be omitted, in which case the default target name messages.pot is used. The target may also be overridden by setting the $POTDOMAIN construction variable or providing it as an override to the POTUpdate builder:

# SConstruct script

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
env.POTUpdate(source=["a.cpp", "b.cpp"])  # Creates foo.pot ...
env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN="bar", source=["c.cpp", "d.cpp"])  # and bar.pot

Example 3. The source parameter may also be omitted, if it is specified in a separate file, for example POTFILES.in:

# POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory

../a.cpp
../b.cpp

# end of file

The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of sources is provided via $XGETTEXTFROM:

# SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in')

Example 4. You can use $XGETTEXTPATH to define the source search path. Assume, for example, that you have files a.cpp, b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related files could look like this:

# POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory

a.cpp
b.cpp

# end of file

# SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

Example 5. Multiple search directories may be defined as a list, i.e. XGETTEXTPATH=['dir1', 'dir2', ...]. The order in the list determines the search order of source files. The path to the first file found is used.

Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

# SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '../../'])

and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

# POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory

a.cpp

# end of file

Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

/*0/a.cpp*/
gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

/*0/1/a.cpp*/
gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you reverse order in $XGETTEXTFOM, i.e. when you write SConscript as

# SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory

env = Environment(tools=['default', 'xgettext'])
env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../../', '../'])

then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from ../a.cpp".

POUpdate()
env.POUpdate()

The builder is set up by the msgmerge tool. part of the gettext toolset. The builder updates PO files with msgmerge(1), or initializes missing PO files as described in the documentation of the msginit tool and the POInit builder (see also $POAUTOINIT). POUpdate is a single-source builder. The source parameter can also be omitted if $LINGUAS_FILE is set.

The target nodes are not selected for building by default (e.g. scons .). Instead, they are added automatically to special Alias ('po-update' by default). The alias name may be changed through the $POUPDATE_ALIAS construction variable. You can easily update PO files in your project by scons po-update. Note that POUpdate does not add its targets to the po-create alias as POInit does.

Example 1. Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template (see also $POTDOMAIN), assuming that the later one exists or there is rule to build it (see POTUpdate):

env.POUpdate(['en','pl'])  # messages.pot --> [en.po, pl.po]

Example 2. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo'])  # foo.pot -->  [en.po, pl.pl]

Example 3. Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another version):

env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo')  # foo.pot -- > [en.po, pl.pl]

Example 4. Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot template:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True)  # needs 'LINGUAS' file

Example 5. Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, source=['foo'])

Example 6. Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from messages.pot template:

# produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS'

env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE=True)

Example 7. Use $POAUTOINIT to automatically initialize PO file if it doesn't exist:

env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, POAUTOINIT=True)

Example 8. Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from foo.pot template. All necessary settings are pre-configured via environment.

env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = True
env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
env.POUpdate()

Program()
env.Program()

Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++, D, or Fortran source files. If any C, C++, D or Fortran source files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to object files using the Object builder method; see that builder method's description for a list of legal source file suffixes and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix, specified by the $PROGPREFIX construction variable (nothing by default), and suffix, specified by the $PROGSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .exe on Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.Program(target='foo', source=['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

ProgramAllAtOnce()
env.ProgramAllAtOnce()

Builds an executable from D sources without first creating individual objects for each file.

D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are, and D is integrated into the scons Object and Program builders for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For this it is imperative that all sources are compiled and linked in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that purpose.

    env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])
  
This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in a single compilation process without first creating object files for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create executable.o others will not.

RES()
env.RES()

Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source file is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file. Example:

env.RES('resource.rc')

RMIC()
env.RMIC()

Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from Java .class files. The target is a directory relative to which the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source can be the names of .class files, or the objects return from the Java builder method.

If the construction variable $JAVACLASSDIR is set, either in the environment or in the call to the RMIC builder method itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the beginning of any .class file names.

classes = env.Java(target='classdir', source='src')
env.RMIC(target='outdir1', source=classes)
env.RMIC(
    target='outdir2',
    source=['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'],
)
env.RMIC(
    target='outdir3',
    source=['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
    JAVACLASSDIR='classes',
)

RPCGenClient()
env.RPCGenClient()

Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c

env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

RPCGenHeader()
env.RPCGenHeader()

Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif.h

env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

RPCGenService()
env.RPCGenService()

Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_svc.c

env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

RPCGenXDR()
env.RPCGenXDR()

Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's directory by default.

# Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c

env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

SharedLibrary()
env.SharedLibrary()

Builds a shared library given one or more object files and/or C, C++, D or Fortran source files. Any source files listed in the source parameter will be automatically compiled to object files suitable for use in a shared library. Any object files listed in the source parameter must have been built for a shared library (that is, using the SharedObject builder method). scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

The target library file prefix, specified by the $SHLIBPREFIX construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the $SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .dll on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems), are automatically added (if not already present) to the target name to make up the library filename. On a POSIX system, if the $SHLIBVERSION construction variable is set, it is appended (following a period) to the resulting library name.

Example:

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

On Windows systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always build an import library (.lib) in addition to the shared library (.dll), adding a .lib library with the same basename if there is not already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

On Cygwin systems, the SharedLibrary builder method will always build an import library (.dll.a) in addition to the shared library (.dll), adding a .dll.a library with the same basename if there is not already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the targets.

On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared library (loaded automatically by the system to resolve external references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user action). For maximum portability, use the LoadableModule builder for the latter.

If $SHLIBVERSION is defined, a versioned shared library is created. This modifies $SHLINKFLAGS as required, adds the version number to the library name, and creates any symbolic links that are needed.

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')

On a POSIX system, supplying a simple version string (no dots) creates exactly one symbolic link: SHLIBVERSION="1" would create (for example) library libbar.so.1 and symbolic link libbar.so. Supplying a dotted version string will create two symbolic links (irrespective of the number of segments in the version): SHLIBVERSION="1.5.2" for the same library would create library libbar.so.1.5.2 and symbolic links libbar.so and libbar.so.1. A Darwin (OSX) system creates one symlink in either case, for the second example the library would be libbar.1.5.2.dylib and the link would be libbar.dylib.

On Windows systems, specifying the register=1 keyword argument will cause the .dll to be registered after it is built. The command that is run is determined by the $REGSVR construction variable (regsvr32 by default), and the flags passed are determined by $REGSVRFLAGS. By default, $REGSVRFLAGS includes the /s option, to prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user attention when it is run. If you change $REGSVRFLAGS, be sure to include the /s option. For example,

env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'], register=1)

will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking it.

SharedObject()
env.SharedObject()

Builds an object file intended for inclusion in a shared library. Source files must have one of the same set of extensions specified for the StaticObject builder method. The target object file prefix, specified by the $SHOBJPREFIX construction variable (by default, the same as $OBJPREFIX), and suffix, specified by the $SHOBJSUFFIX construction variable, are automatically added to the target if not already present. SharedObject is a single-source builder. Examples:

env.SharedObject(target='ddd', source='ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target='eee.o', source='eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target='fff.obj', source='fff.for')
env.SharedObject(source=Glob('*.c'))

On some platforms building a shared object requires additional compiler option(s) (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed to build a normal (static) object. If shared and static objects differ, SCons will allow only shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different suffix for shared objects to help indicate and track the difference.

Source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

StaticLibrary()
env.StaticLibrary()

Builds a static library given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given, then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The static library file prefix, specified by the $LIBPREFIX construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the $LIBSUFFIX construction variable (by default, .lib on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not already present. Example:

env.StaticLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

Any object files listed in the source must have been built for a static library (that is, using the StaticObject builder method). scons will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

StaticObject()
env.StaticObject()

Builds a static object file from one or more C, C++, D, or Fortran source files. The file extension mapping is shown in the table:

  .asm    assembly language file
  .ASM    assembly language file
  .c      C file
  .C      Windows:  C file
          POSIX:  C++ file

          POSIX:  assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .spp    assembly language file + C pre-processor
  .SPP    assembly language file + C pre-processor

The target object file prefix, specified by the $OBJPREFIX construction variable (empty string by default), and suffix, specified by the $OBJSUFFIX construction variable (.obj on Windows systems, .o on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not already present. StaticObject is a single-source builder. Examples:

env.StaticObject(target='aaa', source='aaa.c')
env.StaticObject(target='bbb.o', source='bbb.c++')
env.StaticObject(target='ccc.obj', source='ccc.f')
env.StaticObject(source=Glob('*.c'))

Source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner object. See the manpage section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

Substfile()
env.Substfile()

The Substfile builder creates a single text file from a template consisting of a file or set of files (or nodes), replacing text using the $SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set). If a set, they are concatenated into the target file using the value of the $LINESEPARATOR construction variable as a separator between contents; the separator is not emitted after the contents of the last file. Nested lists of source files are flattened. See also Textfile.

By default, the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be changed by $FILE_ENCODING Examples:

If a single source file name is specified and has a .in suffix, the suffix is stripped and the remainder of the name is used as the default target name.

The prefix and suffix specified by the $SUBSTFILEPREFIX and $SUBSTFILESUFFIX construction variables (an empty string by default in both cases) are automatically added to the target if they are not already present.

If a construction variable named $SUBST_DICT is present, it may be either a Python dictionary or a sequence of (key, value) tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list of tuples with unspecified order, so if one key is a prefix of another key or if one substitution could be further expanded by another substitution, it is unpredictable whether the expansion will occur.

Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the corresponding value, which may be a Python callable function or a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no arguments to get a string. Strings are subst-expanded and the result replaces the key.

env = Environment(tools=['default'])

env['prefix'] = '/usr/bin'
script_dict = {'@prefix@': '/bin', '@exec_prefix@': '$prefix'}
env.Substfile('script.in', SUBST_DICT=script_dict)

conf_dict = {'%VERSION%': '1.2.3', '%BASE%': 'MyProg'}
env.Substfile('config.h.in', conf_dict, SUBST_DICT=conf_dict)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one key is a prefix of another

bad_foo = {'$foo': '$foo', '$foobar': '$foobar'}
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_foo)

# PREDICTABLE - keys are applied longest first

good_foo = [('$foobar', '$foobar'), ('$foo', '$foo')]
env.Substfile('foo.in', SUBST_DICT=good_foo)

# UNPREDICTABLE - one substitution could be further expanded

bad_bar = {'@bar@': '@soap@', '@soap@': 'lye'}
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=bad_bar)

# PREDICTABLE - substitutions are expanded in order

good_bar = (('@bar@', '@soap@'), ('@soap@', 'lye'))
env.Substfile('bar.in', SUBST_DICT=good_bar)

# the SUBST_DICT may be in common (and not an override)

substutions = {}
subst = Environment(tools=['textfile'], SUBST_DICT=substitutions)
substitutions['@foo@'] = 'foo'
subst['SUBST_DICT']['@bar@'] = 'bar'
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm1.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm1.in"],
)
subst.Substfile(
    'pgm2.c',
    [Value('#include "@foo@.h"'), Value('#include "@bar@.h"'), "common.in", "pgm2.in"],
)

Tar()
env.Tar()

Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories. Unlike most builder methods, the Tar builder method may be called multiple times for a given target; each additional call adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive. Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file

env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])

# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file

env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive

env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz

env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                  TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
env.Tar('foo')

Textfile()
env.Textfile()

The Textfile builder generates a single text file from a template consisting of a list of strings, replacing text using the $SUBST_DICT construction variable (if set) - see Substfile for a description of replacement. The strings will be separated in the target file using the value of the $LINESEPARATOR construction variable; the line separator is not emitted after the last string. Nested lists of source strings are flattened. Source strings need not literally be Python strings: they can be Nodes or Python objects that convert cleanly to Value nodes.

The prefix and suffix specified by the $TEXTFILEPREFIX and $TEXTFILESUFFIX construction variables (by default an empty string and .txt, respectively) are automatically added to the target if they are not already present.

By default, the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be changed by $FILE_ENCODING Examples:

# builds/writes foo.txt

env.Textfile(target='foo.txt', source=['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

# builds/writes bar.txt

env.Textfile(target='bar', source=['lalala', 'tanteratei'], LINESEPARATOR='|*')

# nested lists are flattened automatically

env.Textfile(target='blob', source=['lalala', ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'], 'tanteratei'])

# files may be used as input by wrapping them in File()

env.Textfile(
    target='concat',  # concatenate files with a marker between
    source=[File('concat1'), File('concat2')],
    LINESEPARATOR='====================\n',
)

Results:

foo.txt

  Goethe
  42
  Schiller

bar.txt

  lalala|*tanteratei

blob.txt

  lalala
  Goethe
  42
  Schiller
  tanteratei

Translate()
env.Translate()

This pseudo-Builder is part of the gettext toolset. The builder extracts internationalized messages from source files, updates the POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO translations (if necessary). If $POAUTOINIT is set, missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without translator person intervention). The variables $LINGUAS_FILE and $POTDOMAIN are taken into account too. All other construction variables used by POTUpdate, and POUpdate work here too.

Example 1. The simplest way is to specify input files and output languages inline in a SCons script when invoking Translate:

# SConscript in 'po/' directory

env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env.Translate(['en', 'pl'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])

Example 2. If you wish, you may also stick to the conventional style known from autotools, i.e. using POTFILES.in and LINGUAS files to specify the targets and sources:

# LINGUAS

en pl

# end

# POTFILES.in

# SConscript

env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in')

The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows easily split internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under variant directories are responsible for compilation of PO to MO files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS file. Note, that the updated POT and PO files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source directory (and not in variant directories). Additionally, the file listing of po/ directory contains LINGUAS file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the project in their usual way.

Example 3. Let's prepare a development tree as below

 project/

+ SConstruct
+ build/
+ src/
  + po/
    + SConscript
    + SConscript.i18n
    + POTFILES.in
    + LINGUAS

with build being the variant directory. Write the top-level SConstruct script as follows

# SConstruct

env = Environment(tools=["default", "gettext"])
VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=False)
env['POAUTOINIT'] = True
SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports='env')
SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports='env')

the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

# src/po/SConscript.i18n

Import('env')
env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=True, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../'])

and the src/po/SConscript

# src/po/SConscript

Import('env')
env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE=True)

Such a setup produces POT and PO files under the source tree in src/po/ and binary MO files under the variant tree in build/po/. This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output files, which must not be committed back to source repositories (e.g. MO files).

Note

In the above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created automatically when you issue the command scons .. The files must be updated (created) by hand via scons po-update and then MO files can be compiled by running scons ..

TypeLibrary()
env.TypeLibrary()

Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file (.idl). In addition, it will build the associated interface stub and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name of the .idl file. For example,

env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c files.

Uic()
env.Uic()

Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from an ui file. and returns the corresponding nodes in the that order. This builder is only available after using the tool qt3. Note: you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the Program, Library and SharedLibrary builders without using this builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set them to ``). See the $QT3DIR variable for more information. Example:

env.Uic('foo.ui')  # -> ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(
    target=Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
    source='foo.ui'
)  # -> ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.cc']

Zip()
env.Zip()

Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories. Unlike most builder methods, the Zip builder method may be called multiple times for a given target; each additional call adds to the list of entries that will be built into the archive. Any source directories will be scanned for changes to any on-disk files, regardless of whether or not scons knows about them from other Builder or function calls.

env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file

env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])

# Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file

env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

default

Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules. Use default in the tools list to retain the original defaults, since the tools parameter is treated as a literal statement of the tools to be made available in that construction environment, not an addition.

The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is dependent both on the platform and on the software installed on the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying command is not found, and some tools are selected from a list of choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool list can be examined by inspecting the $TOOLS construction variable in the construction environment.

On all platforms, the tools from the following list are selected if their respective conditions are met: filesystem;, wix, lex, yacc, rpcgen, swig, jar, javac, javah, rmic, dvipdf, dvips, gs, tex, latex, pdflatex, pdftex, tar, zip, textfile.

On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found): a C compiler from gcc, intelc, icc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++, intelc, icc, cXX; an assembler from gas, nasm, masm; a linker from gnulink, ilink; a Fortran compiler from gfortran, g77, ifort, ifl, f95, f90, f77; and a static archiver ar. It also selects all found from the list m4 rpm.

On Windows systems, the default tools list selects (first-found): a C compiler from msvc, mingw, gcc, intelc, icl, icc, cc, bcc32; a C++ compiler from msvc, intelc, icc, g++, cXX, bcc32; an assembler from masm, nasm, gas, 386asm; a linker from mslink, gnulink, ilink, linkloc, ilink32; a Fortran compiler from gfortran, g77, ifl, cvf, f95, f90, fortran; and a static archiver from mslib, ar, tlib; It also selects all found from the list msvs, midl.

On MacOS systems, the default tools list selects (first-found): a C compiler from gcc, cc; a C++ compiler from g++, cXX; an assembler as; a linker from applelink, gnulink; a Fortran compiler from gfortran, f95, f90, g77; and a static archiver ar. It also selects all found from the list m4, rpm.

Default lists for other platforms can be found by examining the scons source code (see SCons/Tool/__init__.py).

dmd

Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

Sets: $DC, $DCOM, $DDEBUG, $DDEBUGPREFIX, $DDEBUGSUFFIX, $DFILESUFFIX, $DFLAGPREFIX, $DFLAGS, $DFLAGSUFFIX, $DINCPREFIX, $DINCSUFFIX, $DLIB, $DLIBCOM, $DLIBDIRPREFIX, $DLIBDIRSUFFIX, $DLIBFLAGPREFIX, $DLIBFLAGSUFFIX, $DLIBLINKPREFIX, $DLIBLINKSUFFIX, $DLINK, $DLINKCOM, $DLINKFLAGPREFIX, $DLINKFLAGS, $DLINKFLAGSUFFIX, $DPATH, $DRPATHPREFIX, $DRPATHSUFFIX, $DVERPREFIX, $DVERSIONS, $DVERSUFFIX, $SHDC, $SHDCOM, $SHDLIBVERSIONFLAGS, $SHDLINK, $SHDLINKCOM, $SHDLINKFLAGS.

docbook

This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little easier. It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default...which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for you.

Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML requirements. The additional stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose.

Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in your hands and you still have to know what you're doing when resolving names via a catalog.

For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

On its startup, the docbook tool tries to find a required xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer, e.g. fop. So make sure that these are added to your system's environment PATH and can be called directly without specifying their full path.

For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to have installed

the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or

a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc, saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications fop or xep installed.

Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and straightforward. Say

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml('manual')
env.DocbookPdf('manual')

and get the same result. Target and source lists are also supported:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml'])

or even

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

Important

Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.

The rules given above are valid for the Builders DocbookHtml, DocbookPdf, DocbookEpub, DocbookSlidesPdf and DocbookXInclude. For the DocbookMan transformation you can specify a target name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the refname entries in your XML source.

The Builders DocbookHtmlChunked, DocbookHtmlhelp and DocbookSlidesHtml are special, in that:

they create a large set of files, where the exact names and their number depend on the content of the source file, and

the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the stylesheets.

As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:

env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the additional xsl parameter to your Builder call as follows:

env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files, e.g. html.xsl for HTML and pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL name is provided. These are:

DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

and you can set them when constructing your environment:

env = Environment(
    tools=['docbook'],
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
    DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl',
)
env.DocbookHtml('manual')  # now uses html.xsl

Available since scons 4.0..

qt

Placeholder tool to alert anyone still using qt tools to switch to qt3 or newer tool.

qt3

Sets construction variables for building Qt3 applications.

Note

This tool is only suitable for building targeted to Qt3, which is obsolete (the tool is deprecated since 4.3, and was renamed to qt3 in 4.5.0. ). There are contributed tools for Qt4 and Qt5, see https://github.com/SCons/scons-contrib. Qt4 has also passed end of life for standard support (in Dec 2015).

Note paths for these construction variables are assembled using the os.path.join method so they will have the appropriate separator at runtime, but are listed here in the various entries only with the '/' separator for simplicity.

In addition, the construction variables $CPPPATH, $LIBPATH and $LIBS may be modified and the variables $PROGEMITTER, $SHLIBEMITTER and $LIBEMITTER are modified. Because the build-performance is affected when using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at Environment creation:

Environment(tools=['default','qt3'])

The qt3 tool supports the following operations:

Automatic moc file generation from header files. You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you. However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have the same basename as your implementation file and must stay in the same directory. It must have one of the suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting $QT3_AUTOSCAN to False. See also the corresponding Moc Builder.

Automatic moc file generation from C++ files. As described in the Qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the C++ file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated by the transformation ${QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default <basename>.mo. A warning is generated after building the moc file if you do not include the correct file. If you are using VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=True. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting $QT3_AUTOSCAN to False. See also the corresponding Moc Builder.

Automatic handling of .ui files. The implementation files generated from .ui files are handled much the same as yacc or lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library or SharedLibrary will generate three files: the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because there are also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=True in calls to VariantDir. See also the corresponding Uic Builder.

Sets: $QT3DIR, $QT3_AUTOSCAN, $QT3_BINPATH, $QT3_CPPPATH, $QT3_LIB, $QT3_LIBPATH, $QT3_MOC, $QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX, $QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX, $QT3_MOCFROMCXXCOM, $QT3_MOCFROMCXXFLAGS, $QT3_MOCFROMHCOM, $QT3_MOCFROMHFLAGS, $QT3_MOCHPREFIX, $QT3_MOCHSUFFIX, $QT3_UIC, $QT3_UICCOM, $QT3_UICDECLFLAGS, $QT3_UICDECLPREFIX, $QT3_UICDECLSUFFIX, $QT3_UICIMPLFLAGS, $QT3_UICIMPLPREFIX, $QT3_UICIMPLSUFFIX, $QT3_UISUFFIX.

Appendix D. Functions and Environment Methods

This appendix contains descriptions of all of the function and construction environment methods in this version of SCons

Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])
env.Action(action, [output, [var, ...]] [key=value, ...])

A factory function to create an Action object for the specified action. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

Note that the env.Action form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any argument strings, including the action argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the construction environment through which env.Action was called. The Action global function form delays all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used.

AddMethod(object, function, [name])
env.AddMethod(function, [name])

Adds function to an object as a method. function will be called with an instance object as the first argument as for other methods. If name is given, it is used as the name of the new method, else the name of function is used.

When the global function AddMethod is called, the object to add the method to must be passed as the first argument; typically this will be Environment, in order to create a method which applies to all construction environments subsequently constructed. When called using the env.AddMethod form, the method is added to the specified construction environment only. Added methods propagate through env.Clone calls.

More examples:

# Function to add must accept an instance argument

# The Python convention is to call this 'self'

def my_method(self, arg):
    print("my_method() got", arg)

# Use the global function to add a method to the Environment class

AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
env = Environment()
env.my_method('arg')

# Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method

env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
env.other_method_name('another arg')

AddOption(opt_str, ..., attr=value, ...)

Adds a local (project-specific) command-line option. One or more opt_str values are the strings representing how the option can be called, while the keyword arguments define attributes of the option. For the most part these are the same as for the OptionParser.add_option method in the standard Python library module optparse, but with a few additional capabilities noted below. See the optparse documentation for a thorough discussion of its option-processing capabilities. All options added through AddOption are placed in a special "Local Options" option group.

In addition to the arguments and values supported by the optparse add_option method, AddOption allows setting the nargs keyword value to a string '?' (question mark) to indicate that the option argument for that option string may be omitted. If the option string is present on the command line but has no matching option argument, the value of the const keyword argument is produced as the value of the option. If the option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the default keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no default keyword argument in the AddOption call, None is produced.

optparse recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long as they can be unambiguously resolved. For example, if add_option is called to define a --devicename option, it will recognize --device, --dev and so forth as long as there is no other option which could also match to the same abbreviation. Options added via AddOption do not support the automatic recognition of abbreviations. Instead, to allow specific abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the AddOption call itself.

Once a new command-line option has been added with AddOption, the option value may be accessed using GetOption or env.GetOption. If the settable=True argument was supplied in the AddOption call, the value may also be set later using SetOption or env.SetOption, if conditions in an SConscript file require overriding any default value. Note however that a value specified on the command line will always override a value set in an SConscript file.

Changed in 4.8.0: added the settable keyword argument to enable an added option to be settable via SetOption.

Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied in the help keyword argument to AddOption and information collected from the other keyword arguments. Such help is displayed if the -h command line option is used (but not with -H). Help for all local options is displayed under the separate heading Local Options. The options are unsorted - they will appear in the help text in the order in which the AddOption calls occur.

Example:

AddOption(
    '--prefix',
    dest='prefix',
    nargs=1,
    type='string',
    action='store',
    metavar='DIR',
    help='installation prefix',
)
env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

For that example, the following help text would be produced:

Local Options:
  --prefix=DIR                installation prefix

Help text for local options may be unavailable if the Help function has been called, see the Help documentation for details.

Note

As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of options added by AddOption which take option arguments is undefined if whitespace (rather than an = sign) is used as the separator on the command line. Users should avoid such usage; it is recommended to add a note to this effect to project documentation if the situation is likely to arise. In addition, if the nargs keyword is used to specify more than one following option argument (that is, with a value of 2 or greater), such arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering the issue. Developers should not use AddOption this way. Future versions of SCons will likely forbid such usage.

AddPostAction(target, action)
env.AddPostAction(target, action)

Arrange for the specified action to be performed after the specified target has been built. action may be an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action object. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called multiple times, once after each action that generates one or more targets in the list.

foo = Program('foo.c')

# remove execute permission from binary

AddPostAction(foo, Chmod('$TARGET', "a-x"))

If a target is an Alias, action is associated with the action of the alias, if specified.

AddPreAction(target, action)
env.AddPreAction(target, action)

Arrange for the specified action to be performed before the specified target is built. action may be an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action object. See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called multiple times, once before each action that generates one or more targets in the list.

Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the action will be invoked just before the action step that specifically generates the specified target(s). It may not always be obvious if the process is multi-step - for example, if you use the Program builder to construct an executable program from a .c source file, scons builds an intermediate object file first; the pre-action is invoked after this step and just before the link command to generate the executable program binary. Example:

foo = Program('foo.c')
AddPreAction(foo, 'echo "Running pre-action"')

$ scons -Q
gcc -o foo.o -c foo.c
echo "Running pre-action"
Running pre-action
gcc -o foo foo.o

If a target is an Alias, action is associated with the action of the alias, if specified.

Alias(alias, [source, [action]])
env.Alias(alias, [source, [action]])

Create an Alias node that can be used as a reference to zero or more other targets, specified by the optional source parameter. Aliases provide a way to give a shorter or more descriptive name to specific targets, and to group multiple targets under a single name. The alias name, or an Alias Node object, may be used as a dependency of any other target, including another alias.

alias and source may each be a string or Node object, or a list of strings or Node objects; if Nodes are used for alias they must be Alias nodes. If source is omitted, the alias is created but has no reference; if selected for building this will result in a “Nothing to be done.” message. An empty alias can be used to define the alias in a visible place in the project; it can later be appended to in a subsidiary SConscript file with the actual target(s) to refer to. The optional action parameter specifies an action or list of actions that will be executed whenever the any of the alias targets are out-of-date.

Alias can be called for an existing alias, which appends the alias and/or action arguments to the existing lists for that alias.

Returns a list of Alias Node objects representing the alias(es), which exist outside of any physical file system. The alias name space is separate from the name space for tangible targets; to avoid confusion do not reuse target names as alias names.

Examples:

Alias('install')
Alias('install', '/usr/bin')
Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '/usr/local/lib')

env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib'])
env.Alias('install', ['/usr/local/man'])

env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

AllowSubstExceptions([exception, ...])

Specifies the exceptions that will be ignored when expanding construction variables. By default, any construction variable expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception will expand to a '' (an empty string) and not cause scons to fail. All exceptions not in the specified list will generate an error message and terminate processing.

If AllowSubstExceptions is called multiple times, each call completely overwrites the previous list of ignored exceptions. Calling it with no arguments means no exceptions will be ignored.

Example:

# Requires that all construction variable names exist

# (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly

# that all construction variables must be defined before use.)

AllowSubstExceptions()

# Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion

# like '${1 / 0}' to evaluate to ''

AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

AlwaysBuild(target, ...)
env.AlwaysBuild(target, ...)

Marks each given target so that it is always assumed to be out-of-date, and will always be rebuilt if needed. Note, however, that AlwaysBuild does not add its target(s) to the default target list, so the targets will only be built if they are specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a target specified on the command line--but they will always be built if so specified. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to AlwaysBuild.

env.Append(key=val, [...])

Appends value(s) intelligently to construction variables in env. The construction variables and values to add to them are passed as key=val pairs (Python keyword arguments). env.Append is designed to allow adding values without having to think about the data type of an existing construction variable. Regular Python syntax can also be used to manipulate the construction variable, but for that you may need to know the types involved, for example pure Python lets you directly "add" two lists of strings, but adding a string to a list or a list to a string requires different syntax - things Append takes care of. Some pre-defined construction variables do have type expectations based on how SCons will use them: for example $CPPDEFINES is often a string or a list of strings, but can also be a list of tuples or a dictionary; while $LIBEMITTER is expected to be a callable or list of callables, and $BUILDERS is expected to be a dictionary. Consult the documentation for the various construction variables for more details.

The following descriptions apply to both the Append and Prepend methods, as well as their Unique variants, with the differences being the insertion point of the added values and whether duplication is allowed.

val can be almost any type. If env does not have a construction variable named key, then key is simply stored with a value of val. Otherwise, val is combined with the existing value, possibly converting into an appropriate type which can hold the expanded contents. There are a few special cases to be aware of. Normally, when two strings are combined, the result is a new string containing their concatenation (and you are responsible for supplying any needed separation); however, the contents of $CPPDEFINES will be post-processed by adding a prefix and/or suffix to each entry when the command line is produced, so SCons keeps them separate - appending a string will result in a separate string entry, not a combined string. For $CPPDEFINES. as well as $LIBS, and the various *PATH variables, SCons will amend the variable by supplying the compiler-specific syntax (e.g. prepending a -D or /D prefix for $CPPDEFINES), so you should omit this syntax when adding values to these variables. Examples (gcc syntax shown in the expansion of CPPDEFINES):

env = Environment(CXXFLAGS="-std=c11", CPPDEFINES="RELEASE")
print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")

# notice including a leading space in CXXFLAGS addition

env.Append(CXXFLAGS=" -O", CPPDEFINES="EXTRA")
print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CXXFLAGS = -std=c11, CPPDEFINES = RELEASE
CXXFLAGS = -std=c11 -O, CPPDEFINES = deque(['RELEASE', 'EXTRA'])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DRELEASE -DEXTRA
scons: `.' is up to date.

Because $CPPDEFINES is intended for command-line specification of C/C++ preprocessor macros, additional syntax is accepted when adding to it. The preprocessor accepts arguments to predefine a macro name by itself (-DFOO for most compilers, /DFOO for Microsoft C++), which gives it an implicit value of 1, or can be given with a replacement value (-DBAR=TEXT). SCons follows these rules when adding to $CPPDEFINES:

A string is split on spaces, giving an easy way to enter multiple macros in one addition. Use an = to specify a valued macro.

A tuple is treated as a valued macro. Use the value None if the macro should not have a value. It is an error to supply more than two elements in such a tuple.

A list is processed in order, adding each item without further interpretation. In this case, space-separated strings are not split.

A dictionary is processed in order, adding each key-value pair as a valued macro. Use the value None if the macro should not have a value.

Examples:

env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES="BAR=1")
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("OTHER", 2)])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES={"EXTRA": "arg"})
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = FOO
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1'])
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2)])
CPPDEFINES = deque(['FOO', 'BAR=1', ('OTHER', 2), ('EXTRA', 'arg')])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DFOO -DBAR=1 -DOTHER=2 -DEXTRA=arg
scons: `.' is up to date.

Examples of adding multiple macros:

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("ONE", 1), "TWO", ("THREE", )])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES={"FOUR": 4, "FIVE": None})
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = [('ONE', 1), 'TWO', ('THREE',)]
CPPDEFINES = deque([('ONE', 1), 'TWO', ('THREE',), ('FOUR', 4), ('FIVE', None)])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DONE=1 -DTWO -DTHREE -DFOUR=4 -DFIVE
scons: `.' is up to date.

Changed in version 4.5: clarified the use of tuples vs. other types, handling is now consistent across the four functions.

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=("MACRO1", "MACRO2"))
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("MACRO3", "MACRO4")])
print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

$ scons -Q
CPPDEFINES = ('MACRO1', 'MACRO2')
CPPDEFINES = deque(['MACRO1', 'MACRO2', ('MACRO3', 'MACRO4')])
CPPDEFINES will expand to -DMACRO1 -DMACRO2 -DMACRO3=MACRO4
scons: `.' is up to date.

See $CPPDEFINES for more details.

Appending a string val to a dictionary-typed construction variable enters val as the key in the dictionary, and None as its value. Using a tuple type to supply a key-value pair only works for the special case of $CPPDEFINES described above.

Although most combinations of types work without needing to know the details, some combinations do not make sense and Python raises an exception.

When using env.Append to modify construction variables which are path specifications (conventionally, the names of such end in PATH), it is recommended to add the values as a list of strings, even if you are only adding a single string. The same goes for adding library names to $LIBS.

env.Append(CPPPATH=["#/include"])

See also env.AppendUnique, env.Prepend and env.PrependUnique.

env.AppendENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=False])

Append directory paths from newpath to a search-path entry name in construction variable envname in the current enviromment (env). If envname is not given, the default is "ENV" (see $ENV). envname is expected to refer to a dictionary-like object; if it does not exist in env it will be created as an initially empty dict. newpath may be specified as a string, a directory node, or a list of strings. If a string, it may contain multiple paths separated by the system path separator (os.pathsep), or, if specified, by the value of sep. Top-relative path strings (starting with #) are recognized. The type of the existing value of name is preserved.

Paths will only appear once. Duplicate paths in newpath are removed, preserving the last occurrence to maintain path order. If delete_existing is true (the default), existing duplicates are removed before appending, otherwise, new duplicates are skipped. During comparisons, paths are normalized, to avoid issues with case differences (on case-insensitive filesystems) and with relative paths that may refer back to the same directory. The stored values are not modified by this process.

Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

Yields:

before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

See also env.PrependENVPath.

env.AppendUnique(key=val, [...], [delete_existing=False])

Append values to construction variables in the current construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like env.Append, except that values that would become duplicates are not added. If delete_existing is set to a true value, then for any duplicate, the existing instance of val is first removed, then val is appended, having the effect of moving it to the end.

Example:

env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

See also env.Append, env.Prepend and env.PrependUnique.

Builder(action, [arguments])
env.Builder(action, [arguments])

Creates a Builder object for the specified action. See the manpage section "Builder Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

Note that the env.Builder() form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any arguments strings, including the action argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the env construction environment through which env.Builder was called. The Builder form delays all variable expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)
env.CacheDir(cache_dir, custom_class=None)

Direct scons to maintain a derived-file cache in cache_dir. The derived files in the cache will be shared among all the builds specifying the same cache_dir. Specifying a cache_dir of None disables derived file caching.

Calling the environment method env.CacheDir limits the effect to targets built through the specified construction environment. Calling the global function CacheDir sets a global default that will be used by all targets built through construction environments that do not set up environment-specific caching by calling env.CacheDir.

Caching behavior can be configured by passing a specialized cache class as the optional custom_class parameter. This class must be a subclass of SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir. SCons will internally invoke the custom class for performing caching operations. If the parameter is omitted or set to None, SCons will use the default SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

When derived-file caching is being used and scons finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it will first look in the cache to see if a file with matching build signature exists (indicating the input file(s) and build action(s) were identical to those for the current target), and if so, will retrieve the file from the cache. scons will report Retrieved `file' from cache instead of the normal build message. If the derived file is not present in the cache, scons will build it and then place a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its build signature, for future use.

The Retrieved `file' from cache messages are useful for human consumption, but less useful when comparing log files between scons runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually significant. To disable, use the --cache-show option. With this option, scons changes printing to always show the action that would have been used to build the file without caching.

Derived-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of scons by giving the --cache-disable command line option; cache updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by giving the --cache-readonly option.

If the --cache-force option is used, scons will place a copy of all derived files into the cache, even if they already existed and were not built by this invocation. This is useful to populate a cache the first time a cache_dir is used for a build, or to bring a cache up to date after a build with cache updating disabled (--cache-disable or --cache-readonly) has been done.

The NoCache method can be used to disable caching of specific files. This can be useful if inputs and/or outputs of some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

Note that (at this time) SCons provides no facilities for managing the derived-file cache. It is up to the developer to arrange for cache pruning, expiry, access control, etc. if needed.

Clean(targets, files)
env.Clean(targets, files)

Set additional files for removal when any of targets are selected for cleaning (-c command line option). targets and files can each be a single filename or node, or a list of filenames or nodes. These can refer to files or directories. Calling this method repeatedly has an additive effect.

The related NoClean method has higher priority: any target specified to NoClean will not be cleaned even if also given as a files parameter to Clean.

Examples:

Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

SCons does not directly track directories as targets - they are created if needed and not normally removed in clean mode. In this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory for the documentation. The Clean call ensures that the subdirectory is removed if the project is uninstalled.

Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

env.Clone([key=val, ...])

Returns an independent copy of a construction environment. If there are any unrecognized keyword arguments specified, they are added as construction variables in the copy, overwriting any existing values for those keywords. See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

Example:

env2 = env.Clone()
env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

A list of tools and a toolpath may be specified, as in the Environment constructor:

def MyTool(env):
    env['FOO'] = 'bar'

env4 = env.Clone(tools=['msvc', MyTool])

The parse_flags keyword argument is also recognized, to allow merging command-line style arguments into the appropriate construction variables (see env.MergeFlags).

# create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets

wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

The variables keyword argument is also recognized, to allow (re)initializing construction variables from a Variables object.

Changed in version 4.8.0: the variables parameter was added.

Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])
env.Command(target, source, action, [key=val, ...])

Creates an anonymous builder and calls it, thus recording action to build target from source into the dependency tree. This can be more convenient for a single special-case build than having to define and add a new named Builder.

The Command function accepts the source_scanner and target_scanner keyword arguments which are used to specify custom scanners for the specified sources or targets. The value must be a Scanner object. For example, the global DirScanner object can be used if any of the sources will be directories that must be scanned on-disk for changes to files that aren't already specified in other Builder or function calls.

The Command function also accepts the source_factory and target_factory keyword arguments which are used to specify factory functions to create SCons Nodes from any sources or targets specified as strings. If any sources or targets are already Node objects, they are not further transformed even if a factory is specified for them. The default for each is the Entry factory.

These four arguments, if given, are used in the creation of the Builder. Other Builder-specific keyword arguments are not recognized as such. See the manpage section "Builder Objects" for more information about how these arguments work in a Builder.

Any remaining keyword arguments are passed on to the generated builder when it is called, and behave as described in the manpage section "Builder Methods", in short: recognized arguments have their specified meanings, while the rest are used to override any same-named existing construction variables from the construction environment.

action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a callable Python object; see the manpage section "Action Objects" for more complete information. Also note that a string specifying an external command may be preceded by an at-sign (@) to suppress printing the command in question, or by a hyphen (-) to ignore the exit status of the external command.

Examples:

env.Command(
    target='foo.out',
    source='foo.in',
    action="$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"
)

env.Command(
    target='bar.out',
    source='bar.in',
    action=["rm -f $TARGET", "$BAR_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET"],
    ENV={'PATH': '/usr/local/bin/'},
)

import os
def rename(env, target, source):
    os.rename('.tmp', target[0])

env.Command(
    target='baz.out',
    source='baz.in',
    action=["$BAZ_BUILD < $SOURCES > .tmp", rename],
)

Note that the Command function will usually assume, by default, that the specified targets and/or sources are Files, if no other part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they are. If necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or source nodes should be treated as directories by using the Dir or env.Dir functions.

Examples:

env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE > $TARGET')

env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any directory necessary to hold a target file, so you normally don't need to create directories by hand.

Configure(env, [custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])
env.Configure([custom_tests, conf_dir, log_file, config_h])

Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar to GNU autoconf. See the manpage section "Configure Contexts" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

DebugOptions([json])

Allows setting options for SCons debug options. Currently, the only supported value is json which sets the path to the JSON file created when --debug=json is set.

DebugOptions(json='#/build/output/scons_stats.json')

New in version 4.6.0.

Decider(function)
env.Decider(function)

Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built through this construction environment will be handled by function. function can be the name of a function or one of the following strings that specify a predefined decider function:

"content"

Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since the last time the target was built, as determined by performing a checksum on the dependency's contents using the selected hash function, and comparing it to the checksum recorded the last time the target was built. content is the default decider.

Changed in version 4.1: The decider was renamed to content since the hash function is now selectable. The former name, MD5, can still be used as a synonym, but is deprecated.

"content-timestamp"

Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date and rebuilt if the dependency's content has changed since the last time the target was built, except that dependencies with a timestamp that matches the last time the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date and not rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to the content behavior of always checksumming file contents, with an optimization of not checking the contents of files whose timestamps haven't changed. The drawback is that SCons will not detect if a file's content has changed but its timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated script that runs a build, updates a file, and runs the build again, all within a single second.

Changed in version 4.1: The decider was renamed to content-timestamp since the hash function is now selectable. The former name, MD5-timestamp, can still be used as a synonym, but is deprecated.

"timestamp-newer"

Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is newer than the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the classic Make utility, and make can be used a synonym for timestamp-newer.

"timestamp-match"

Specifies that a target shall be considered out-of-date and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp is different than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was built. This provides behavior very similar to the classic Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so that their contents can be checksummed) except that the target will also be rebuilt if a dependency file has been restored to a version with an earlier timestamp, such as can happen when restoring files from backup archives.

Examples:

# Use exact timestamp matches by default

Decider('timestamp-match')

# Use hash content signatures for any targets built

# with the attached construction environment

env.Decider('content')

In addition to the above already-available functions, the function argument may be a Python function you supply. Such a function must accept the following four arguments:

dependency

The Node (file) which should cause the target to be rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last time target was built.

target

The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is what should get rebuilt if the dependency has "changed."

prev_ni

Stored information about the state of the dependency the last time the target was built. This can be consulted to match various file characteristics such as the timestamp, size, or content signature.

repo_node

If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by dependency to determine if the dependency has changed. This argument is optional so should be written as a default argument (typically it would be written as repo_node=None). A caller will normally only set this if the target only exists in a Repository.

The function should return a value which evaluates True if the dependency has "changed" since the last time the target was built (indicating that the target should be rebuilt), and a value which evaluates False otherwise (indicating that the target should not be rebuilt). Note that the decision can be made using whatever criteria are appropriate. Ignoring some or all of the function arguments is perfectly normal.

Example:

def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
    return not os.path.exists(str(target))

env.Decider(my_decider)

Default(target[, ...])
env.Default(target[, ...])

Specify default targets to the SCons target selection mechanism. Any call to Default will cause SCons to use the defined default target list instead of its built-in algorithm for determining default targets (see the manpage section "Target Selection").

target may be one or more strings, a list of strings, a NodeList as returned by a Builder, or None. A string target may be the name of a file or directory, or a target previously defined by a call to Alias (defining the alias later will still create the alias, but it will not be recognized as a default). Calls to Default are additive. A target of None will clear any existing default target list; subsequent calls to Default will add to the (now empty) default target list like normal.

Both forms of this call affect the same global list of default targets; the construction environment method applies construction variable expansion to the targets.

The current list of targets added using Default is available in the DEFAULT_TARGETS list (see below).

Examples:

Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
env.Default(hello)

DefaultEnvironment([key=value, ...])

Instantiates and returns the global construction environment object. The Default Environment is used internally by SCons when executing a global function or the global form of a Builder method that requires access to a construction environment.

On the first call, arguments are interpreted as for the Environment function. The Default Environment is a singleton; subsequent calls to DefaultEnvironment return the already-constructed object, and any keyword arguments are silently ignored.

The Default Environment can be modified after instantiation, similar to other construction environments, although some construction environment methods may be unavailable. Modifying the Default Environment has no effect on any other construction environment, either existing or newly constructed.

It is not necessary to explicitly call DefaultEnvironment. SCons instantiates the default environment automatically when the build phase begins, if has not already been done. However, calling it explicitly provides the opportunity to affect and examine its contents. Instantiation occurs even if nothing in the build system appears to use it, due to internal uses.

If the project SConscript files do not use global functions or Builders, a small performance gain may be achieved by calling DefaultEnvironment with an empty tools list (DefaultEnvironment(tools=[])). This avoids the tool initialization cost for the Default Environment, which is mainly of interest in the test suite where scons is launched repeatedly in a short time period.

Depends(target, dependency)
env.Depends(target, dependency)

Specifies an explicit dependency; the target will be rebuilt whenever the dependency has changed. Both the specified target and dependency can be a string (usually the path name of a file or directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node objects (such as returned by a Builder call). This should only be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a Scanner for the file.

Example:

env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
bar = env.Program('bar.c')

# Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation

# directory before trying to build the "bar" program

# (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library

# dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS

# and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

env.Detect(progs)

Find an executable from one or more choices: progs may be a string or a list of strings. Returns the first value from progs that was found, or None. Executable is searched by checking the paths in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATH']). On Windows systems, additionally applies the filename suffixes found in the execution environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']) but will not include any such extension in the return value. env.Detect is a wrapper around env.WhereIs.

env.Dictionary([var, ...], [as_dict=])

Return an object containing construction variables from env. If var is omitted, all the construction variables with their values are returned in a dict. If var is specified, and as_dict is true, the specified construction variables are returned in a dict; otherwise (the default, for backwards compatibility), values only are returned, as a scalar if one var is given, or as a list if multiples.

Example:

cvars = env.Dictionary()
cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

Note

The object returned by env.Dictionary should be treated as a read-only view into the construction variables. Some construction variables require special internal handling, and modifying them through the env.Dictionary object can bypass that handling and cause data inconsistencies. The primary use of env.Dictionary is for diagnostic purposes - it is used widely by test cases specifically because it bypasses the special handling so that behavior can be verified.

Changed in 4.9.0: as_dict added.

Dir(name, [directory])
env.Dir(name, [directory])

Returns Directory Node(s). A Directory Node is an object that represents a directory. name can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such paths. directory is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes. Construction variables are expanded in name.

Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a directory name to a Builder method or function. Directory Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see manpage section "Filesystem Nodes" for more information.

env.Dump([var, ...], [format=TYPE])

Serialize construction variables from env to a string. If var is omitted, all the construction variables are serialized. If one or more var values are supplied, only those variables and their values are serialized.

The optional format string selects the serialization format:

pretty

Returns a pretty-printed representation of the construction variables - the result will look like a Python dict (this is the default).

json

Returns a JSON-formatted representation of the variables. The variables will be presented as a JSON object literal, the JSON equivalent of a Python dict..

Changed in 4.9.0: More than one key can be specified. The returned string always looks like a dict (or equivalent in other formats); previously a single key serialized only the value, not the key with the value.

Examples: this SConstruct

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))
print(env.Dump('CC', 'CCFLAGS', format='json'))

will print something like:

{'CCCOM': '$CC -o $TARGET -c $CFLAGS $CCFLAGS $_CCCOMCOM $SOURCES'}
{
    "CC": "gcc",
    "CCFLAGS": []
}

While this SConstruct:

env = Environment()
print(env.Dump())

will print something like:

{ 'AR': 'ar',
  'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
  'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
  'AS': 'as',
  'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
  'ASFLAGS': [],
  ...

EnsurePythonVersion(major, minor)

Ensure that the Python version is at least major.minor. This function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late enough.

Example:

EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

EnsureSConsVersion(major, minor, [revision])

Ensure that the SCons version is at least major.minor, or major.minor.revision. if revision is specified. This function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if the actual SCons version is not late enough.

Examples:

EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

Environment([key=value, ...])
env.Environment([key=value, ...])

Return a new construction environment initialized with the specified key=value pairs. The keyword arguments parse_flags, platform, toolpath, tools and variables are specially recognized and do not lead to construction variable creation. See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

Execute(action, [actionargs ...])
env.Execute(action, [actionargs ...])

Executes an Action. action may be an Action object or it may be a command-line string, list of commands, or executable Python function, each of which will first be converted into an Action object and then executed. Any additional arguments to Execute are passed on to the Action factory function which actually creates the Action object (see the manpage section Action Objects for a description). Example:

Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

Execute performs its action immediately, as part of the SConscript-reading phase. There are no sources or targets declared in an Execute call, so any objects it manipulates will not be tracked as part of the SCons dependency graph. In the example above, neither file.out nor file.in will be tracked objects.

Execute returns the exit value of the command or return value of the Python function. scons prints an error message if the executed action fails (exits with or returns a non-zero value), however it does not, automatically terminate the build for such a failure. If you want the build to stop in response to a failed Execute call, you must explicitly check for a non-zero return value:

if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
    # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
    Exit(1)

Exit([value])

This tells scons to exit immediately with the specified value. A default exit value of 0 (zero) is used if no value is specified.

Export([vars...], [key=value...])
env.Export([vars...], [key=value...])

Exports variables for sharing with other SConscript files. The variables are added to a global collection where they can be imported by other SConscript files. vars may be one or more strings, or a list of strings. If any string contains whitespace, it is split automatically into individual strings. Each string must match the name of a variable that is in scope during evaluation of the current SConscript file, or an exception is raised.

A vars argument may also be a dictionary or individual keyword arguments; in accordance with Python syntax rules, keyword arguments must come after any non-keyword arguments. The dictionary/keyword form can be used to map the local name of a variable to a different name to be used for imports. See the Examples for an illustration of the syntax.

Export calls are cumulative. Specifying a previously exported variable will replace the previous value in the collection. Both local variables and global variables can be exported.

To use an exported variable, an SConscript must call Import to bring it into its own scope. Importing creates an additional reference to the object that was originally exported, so if that object is mutable, changes made will be visible to other users of that object.

Examples:

env = Environment()

# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import()

Export("env")

package = 'my_name'

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files

Export("env", "package")

# Make env and package available for all SConscript files

Export(["env", "package"])

# Make env available using the name debug

Export(debug=env)

# Make env available using the name debug

Export({"debug": env})

Note that the SConscript function also supports an exports argument that allows exporting one or more variables to the SConscript files invoked by that call (only). See the description of that function for details.

File(name, [directory])
env.File(name, [directory])

Returns File Node(s). A File Node is an object that represents a file. name can be a relative or absolute path or a list of such paths. directory is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory. If no directory is specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

If name is a single pathname, the corresponding node is returned. If name is a list, SCons returns a list of nodes. Construction variables are expanded in name.

File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a file name to a Builder method or function. File Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see manpage section "Filesystem Nodes" for more information.

FindFile(file, dirs)
env.FindFile(file, dirs)

Search for file in the path specified by dirs. dirs may be a list of directory names or a single directory name. In addition to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this function also searches for derived files that have not yet been built.

Example:

foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

FindInstalledFiles()
env.FindInstalledFiles()

Returns the list of targets set up by the Install or InstallAs builders.

This function serves as a convenient method to select the contents of a binary package.

Example:

Install('/bin', ['executable_a', 'executable_b'])

# will return the file node list

# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b']

FindInstalledFiles()

Install('/lib', ['some_library'])

# will return the file node list

# ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library']

FindInstalledFiles()

FindPathDirs(variable)

Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended to be used as the path_function of a Scanner object. The returned object will look up the specified variable in a construction environment and treat the construction variable's value as a list of directory paths that should be searched (like $CPPPATH, $LIBPATH, etc.).

Note that use of FindPathDirs is generally preferable to writing your own path_function for the following reasons: 1) The returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in source trees (when VariantDir is used) or in code repositories (when Repository or the -Y option are used). 2) scons will identify expansions of variable that evaluate to the same list of directories as, in fact, the same list, and avoid re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

Example:

def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    # Code to scan file contents goes here...
    return include_files

scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                  function = my_scan,
                  path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

FindSourceFiles(node='"."')
env.FindSourceFiles(node='"."')

Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built files. It does so by inspecting the dependency tree starting at the optional argument node which defaults to the '"."'-node. It will then return all leaves of node. These are all children which have no further children.

This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a Source Package.

Example:

Program('src/main_a.c')
Program('src/main_b.c')
Program('main_c.c')

# returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']

FindSourceFiles()

# returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]

FindSourceFiles('src')

As you can see, build support files (SConstruct in the above example) will also be returned by this function.

Flatten(sequence)
env.Flatten(sequence)

Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may contain nested sequences and returns a flattened list containing all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be helpful for collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders; other Builders will automatically flatten lists specified as input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

Examples:

foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and`bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder

# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists

objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because

# the Builder will flatten the list automatically

Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to

# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists

for object in Flatten(objects):
    print(str(object))

GetBuildFailures()

Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while attempting to build targets. Each element in the returned list is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record various aspects of the build failure:

.node The node that was being built when the build failure occurred.

.status The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to build the specified Node.

.errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure. (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

.filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused the failure. This may be different from the .node attribute. For example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target fails because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target but the .filename attribute will be sub/dir.

.executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being built. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment used for the failed action.

.action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be one specific action out of the possible list of actions that would have been executed to build the target.

.command The actual expanded command that was executed and failed, after expansion of $TARGET, $SOURCE, and other construction variables.

Note that the GetBuildFailures function will always return an empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means that GetBuildFailures will always return an empty list while the SConscript files are being read. Its primary intended use is for functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing them to the standard Python atexit.register() function. Example:

import atexit

def print_build_failures():
    from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
    for bf in GetBuildFailures():
        print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

atexit.register(print_build_failures)

GetBuildPath(file, [...])
env.GetBuildPath(file, [...])

Returns the scons path name (or names) for the specified file (or files). The specified file or files may be scons Nodes or strings representing path names.

GetLaunchDir()

Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which scons was initially invoked. This can be useful when using the -u, -U or -D options, which internally change to the directory in which the SConstruct file is found.

GetOption(name)
env.GetOption(name)

Query the value of settable option name, which may have been set on the command line, via option defaults, or using the SetOption function. The value of the option is returned in a type matching how the option was declared - see the documentation of the corresponding command line option for information about each specific option.

name can be an entry from the following table, which shows the corresponding command line arguments that could affect the value. name can be also be the destination variable name from a project-specific option added using the AddOption function, as long as that addition has been processed prior to the GetOption call in the SConscript files.

GetSConsVersion()

Returns the current SCons version in the form of a Tuple[int, int, int], representing the major, minor, and revision values respectively. Added in 4.8.0.

Glob(pattern, [ondisk=True, source=False, strings=False, exclude=None])
env.Glob(pattern, [ondisk=True, source=False, strings=False, exclude=None])

Returns a possibly empty list of Nodes (or strings) that match pathname specification pattern. pattern can be absolute, top-relative, or (most commonly) relative to the directory of the current SConscript file. Glob matches both files stored on disk and Nodes which SCons already knows about, even if any corresponding file is not currently stored on disk. The environment method form (env.Glob) performs string substitution on pattern and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern. The results are sorted, unlike for the similar Python glob.glob function, to ensure build order will be stable.

pattern can contain POSIX-style shell metacharacters for matching:

Pattern Meaning
+ matches everything
? matches any single character
[seq] matches any character in seq (can be a list or a range).
[!seq] matches any character not in seq

For a literal match, wrap the metacharacter in brackets to escape the normal behavior. For example, '[?]' matches the character '?'.

Filenames starting with a dot are specially handled - they can only be matched by patterns that start with a dot (or have a dot immediately following a pathname separator character, or slash), they are not not matched by the metacharacters. Metacharacter matches also do not span directory separators.

Glob understands repositories (see the Repository function) and source directories (see the VariantDir function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) match in the local (SConscript) directory if a matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

If the optional ondisk argument evaluates false, the search for matches on disk is disabled, and only matches from already-configured File or Dir Nodes are returned. The default is to return Nodes for matches on disk as well.

If the optional source argument evaluates true, and the local directory is a variant directory, then Glob returns Nodes from the corresponding source directory, rather than the local directory.

If the optional strings argument evaluates true, Glob returns matches as strings, rather than Nodes. The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that while this may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, it loses the context SCons would have in the Node, so if the returned strings are passed to a different SConscript file, any Node translation there will be relative to that SConscript directory, not to the original SConscript directory.)

The optional exclude argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns describing files or directories to filter out of the match list. Elements matching a least one specified pattern will be excluded. These patterns use the same syntax as for pattern.

Examples:

Program("foo", Glob("_.c"))
Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob(".??_") + Glob("_"))
sources = Glob("_.cpp", exclude=["os_*_specific_*.cpp"]) \
    + Glob("os_%s_specific_*.cpp" % currentOS)

Help(text, append=False, local_only=False)
env.Help(text, append=False, local_only=False)

Adds text to the help message shown when scons is called with the -h or --help argument.

On the first call to Help, if append is False (the default), any existing help text is discarded. The default help text is the help for the scons command itself plus help collected from any project-local AddOption calls. This is the help printed if Help has never been called. If append is True, text is appended to the existing help text. If local_only is also True (the default is False), the project-local help from AddOption calls is preserved in the help message but the scons command help is not.

Subsequent calls to Help ignore the keyword arguments append and local_only and always append to the existing help text.

Changed in 4.6.0: added local_only.

Ignore(target, dependency)
env.Ignore(target, dependency)

Ignores dependency when deciding if target needs to be rebuilt. target and dependency can each be a single filename or Node or a list of filenames or Nodes.

Ignore can also be used to remove a target from the default build by specifying the directory the target will be built in as target and the file you want to skip selecting for building as dependency. Note that this only removes the target from the default target selection algorithm: if it is a dependency of another object being built SCons still builds it normally. See the third and forth examples below.

Examples:

env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
env.Ignore('.', 'foobar.obj')
env.Ignore('bar', 'bar/foobar.obj')

Import(vars...)
env.Import(vars...)

Imports variables into the scope of the current SConscript file. vars must be strings representing names of variables which have been previously exported either by the Export function or by the exports argument to the SConscript function. Variables exported by the SConscript call take precedence. Multiple variable names can be passed to Import as separate arguments, as a list of strings, or as words in a space-separated string. The wildcard "*" can be used to import all available variables.

If the imported variable is mutable, changes made locally will be reflected in the object the variable is bound to. This allows subsidiary SConscript files to contribute to building up, for example, a construction environment.

Examples:

Import("env")
Import("env", "variable")
Import(["env", "variable"])
Import("*")

Literal(string)
env.Literal(string)

The specified string will be preserved as-is and not have construction variables expanded.

Local(targets)
env.Local(targets)

The specified targets will have copies made in the local tree, even if an already up-to-date copy exists in a repository. Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

env.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])

Merges values from arg into construction variables in env. If arg is a dictionary, each key-value pair represents a construction variable name and the corresponding flags to merge. If arg is not a dictionary, MergeFlags attempts to convert it to one before the values are merged. env.ParseFlags is used for this, so values to be converted are subject to the same limitations: ParseFlags has knowledge of which construction variables certain flags should go to, but not all; and only for GCC and compatible compiler chains. arg must be a single object, so to pass multiple strings, enclose them in a list.

If unique is true (the default), duplicate values are not retained. In case of duplication, any construction variable names that end in PATH keep the left-most value so the path search order is not altered. All other construction variables keep the right-most value. If unique is false, values are appended even if they are duplicates.

Examples:

# Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS

env.MergeFlags({'CCFLAGS': '-O3'})

# Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization

# flag and merge the result into the construction variables

env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

# Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config

# for two distinct packages and merge into the construction variables

env.MergeFlags(
    [
        '-O3',
        '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
        '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs',
    ]
)

NoCache(target, ...)
env.NoCache(target, ...)

Specifies a list of files which should not be cached whenever the CacheDir method has been activated. The specified targets may be a list or an individual target.

Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments to the NoCache method, or as a list. NoCache will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment Builder methods.

Calling NoCache on directories and other non-File Node types has no effect because only File Nodes are cached.

Examples:

NoCache('foo.elf')
NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

NoClean(targets, ...)
env.NoClean(targets, ...)

Specifies files or directories which should not be removed whenever a specified target (or its dependencies) is selected and clean mode is active (-c command line option). targets may be one or more file or directory names or nodes, and/or lists of names or nodes. NoClean can be called multiple times.

Calling NoClean for a target overrides calling Clean for the same target, so any targets passed to both functions will not be removed in clean mode.

Examples:

NoClean('foo.elf')
NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

env.ParseConfig(command, [function, unique])

Updates the current construction environment with the values extracted from the output of running external command, by passing it to a helper function. command may be a string or a list of strings representing the command and its arguments. If function is omitted or None, env.MergeFlags is used. By default, duplicate values are not added to any construction variables; you can specify unique=False to allow duplicate values to be added.

command is executed using the SCons execution environment (that is, the construction variable $ENV in the current construction environment). If command needs additional information to operate properly, that needs to be set in the execution environment. For example, pkg-config may need a custom value set in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

env.MergeFlags needs to understand the output produced by command in order to distribute it to appropriate construction variables. env.MergeFlags uses a separate function to do that processing - see env.ParseFlags for the details, including a table of options and corresponding construction variables. To provide alternative processing of the output of command, you can supply a custom function, which must accept three arguments: the construction environment to modify, a string argument containing the output from running command, and the optional unique flag.

ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])
env.ParseDepends(filename, [must_exist, only_one])

Parses the contents of filename as a list of dependencies in the style of Make or mkdep, and explicitly establishes all of the listed dependencies.

By default, it is not an error if filename does not exist. The optional must_exist argument may be set to True to have SCons raise an exception if the file does not exist, or is otherwise inaccessible.

The optional only_one argument may be set to True to have SCons raise an exception if the file contains dependency information for more than one target. This can provide a small sanity check for files intended to be generated by, for example, the gcc -M flag, which should typically only write dependency information for one output file into a corresponding .d file.

filename and all of the files listed therein will be interpreted relative to the directory of the SConscript file which calls the ParseDepends function.

env.ParseFlags(flags, ...)

Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags for GCC-style tool chains and returns a dictionary with the flag values separated into the appropriate SCons construction variables. Intended as a companion to the env.MergeFlags method, but allows for the values in the returned dictionary to be modified, if necessary, before merging them into the construction environment. (Note that env.MergeFlags will call this method if its argument is not a dictionary, so it is usually not necessary to call env.ParseFlags directly unless you want to manipulate the values.)

If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!), the rest of the string is executed as a command, and the output from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags and added to the resulting dictionary. This can be used to call a *-config command typical of the POSIX programming environment (for example, pkg-config). Note that such a command is executed using the SCons execution environment; if the command needs additional information, that information needs to be explicitly provided. See ParseConfig for more details.

Flag values are translated according to the prefix found, and added to the following construction variables:

-arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-D                      CPPDEFINES
-framework              FRAMEWORKS
-frameworkdir=          FRAMEWORKPATH
-fmerge-all-constants   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fopenmp                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-fsanitize              CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-include                CCFLAGS
-imacros                CCFLAGS
-isysroot               CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-isystem                CCFLAGS
-iquote                 CCFLAGS
-idirafter              CCFLAGS
-I                      CPPPATH
-l                      LIBS
-L                      LIBPATH
-mno-cygwin             CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-mwindows               LINKFLAGS
-openmp                 CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-pthread                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
-std=                   CFLAGS
-stdlib=                CXXFLAGS
-Wa,                    ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
-Wl,-rpath=             RPATH
-Wl,-R,                 RPATH
-Wl,-R                  RPATH
-Wl,                    LINKFLAGS
-Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
+                       CCFLAGS

+                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be the names of libraries and added to the $LIBS construction variable.

Examples (all of which produce the same result):

dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

Platform(plat)
env.Platform(plat)

When called as a global function, returns a callable platform object selected by plat (defaults to the detected platform for the current system) that can be used to initialize a construction environment by passing it as the platform keyword argument to the Environment function.

Example:

env = Environment(platform=Platform('win32'))

When called as a method of an environment, calls the platform object indicated by plat to update that environment.

env.Platform('posix')

See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

Precious(target, ...)
env.Precious(target, ...)

Marks target as precious so it is not deleted before it is rebuilt. Normally SCons deletes a target before building it. Multiple targets can be passed in a single call, and may be strings and/or nodes. Returns a list of the affected target nodes.

env.Prepend(key=val, [...])

Prepend values to construction variables in the current construction environment, works like env.Append (see for details), except that values are added to the front, rather than the end, of any existing value of the construction variable

Example:

env.Prepend(CCFLAGS='-g ', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

See also env.Append, env.AppendUnique and env.PrependUnique.

env.PrependENVPath(name, newpath, [envname, sep, delete_existing=True])

Prepend directory paths from newpath to a search-path entry name in construction variable envname in the current enviromment (env). If envname is not given, the default is "ENV" (see $ENV). envname is expected to refer to a dictionary-like object; if it does not exist in env it will be created as an initially empty dict. newpath may be specified as a string, a directory node, or a list of strings. If a string, it may contain multiple paths separated by the system path separator (os.pathsep), or, if specified, by the value of sep. Top-relative path strings (starting with #) are recognized. The type of the existing value of name is preserved.

Paths will only appear once. Duplicate paths in newpath are removed, preserving the first occurrence to maintain path order. If delete_existing is true (the default), existing duplicates are removed before prepending, otherwise, new duplicates are skipped. During comparisons, paths are normalized, to avoid issues with case differences (on case-insensitive filesystems) and with relative paths that may refer back to the same directory. The stored values are not modified by this process.

Example:

print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

Yields:

before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

See also env.AppendENVPath.

env.PrependUnique(key=val, [...], [delete_existing=False])

Prepend values to construction variables in the current construction environment, maintaining uniqueness. Works like env.Append, except that values are added to the front, rather than the end, of the construction variable, and values that would become duplicates are not added. If delete_existing is set to a true value, then for any duplicate, the existing instance of val is first removed, then val is inserted, having the effect of moving it to the front.

Example:

env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

See also env.Append, env.AppendUnique and env.Prepend.

Progress(callable, [interval])
Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite])
Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])

Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes (e.g. files).

If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function or an object that has a __call__ method), the function will be called once every interval times a Node is evaluated (default 1). The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument. (For future compatibility, it's a good idea to also add *args and **kwargs as arguments to your function or method signatures. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons ever changes the interface to call the function with additional arguments in the future.)

An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:

def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
    print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that the string will overwrite itself on a display:

import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self.count += 100
        sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)

Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

If the first argument to Progress is a string or list of strings, it is taken as text to be displayed every interval evaluated Nodes. If the first argument is a list of strings, then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion every interval evaluated Nodes.

The default is to print the string on standard output. An alternate output stream may be specified with the file keyword argument, which the caller must pass already opened.

The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:

import sys
Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET;, it will be replaced with the Node. Note that, for performance reasons, this is not a regular SCons variable substitution, so you can not use other variables or use curly braces. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a carriage return) (\r) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the overwrite keyword argument (default False) to make sure the previously-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:

import sys
Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the user's screen as follows, changing every five evaluated Nodes:

Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

Pseudo(target, ...)
env.Pseudo(target, ...)

Marks target as a pseudo target, not representing the production of any physical target file. If any pseudo target does exist, SCons will abort the build with an error. Multiple targets can be passed in a single call, and may be strings and/or Nodes. Returns a list of the affected target nodes.

Pseudo may be useful in conjuction with a builder call (such as Command) which does not create a physical target, and the behavior if the target accidentally existed would be incorrect. This is similar in concept to the GNU make .PHONY target. SCons also provides a powerful target alias capability (see Alias) which may provide more flexibility in many situations when defining target names that are not directly built.

PyPackageDir(modulename)
env.PyPackageDir(modulename)

Finds the location of modulename, which can be a string or a sequence of strings, each representing the name of a Python module. Construction variables are expanded in modulename. Returns a Directory Node (see Dir), or a list of Directory Nodes if modulename is a sequence. None is returned for any module not found.

When a Tool module which is installed as a Python module is used, you need to specify a toolpath argument to Tool, Environment or Clone, as tools outside the standard project locations (site_scons/site_tools) will not be found otherwise. Using PyPackageDir allows this path to be discovered at runtime instead of hardcoding the path.

Example:

env = Environment(
    tools=["default", "ExampleTool"],
    toolpath=[PyPackageDir("example_tool")]
)

env.Replace(key=val, [...])

Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the specified keyword arguments.

Example:

env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO='foo.xxx')

Repository(directory)
env.Repository(directory)

Sets directory as a repository to be searched for files contributing to the build. Multiple calls to Repository are allowed, with repositories searched in the given order. Repositories specified via command-line option have higher priority.

In scons, a repository is partial or complete copy of the source tree, from the top-level directory down, containing source files that can be used to build targets in the current worktree. Repositories can also contain derived files. An example might be an official source tree maintained by an integrator. If a repository contains derived files, they should be the result of building with SCons, so a signature database (sconsign) is present in the repository, allowing better decisions on whether they are up-to-date or not.

Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a repository, scons will not make a copy in the local directory tree. If you need a local copy to be made, use the Local method.

Requires(target, prerequisite)
env.Requires(target, prerequisite)

Specifies an order-only relationship between target and prerequisite. The prerequisites will be (re)built, if necessary, before the target file(s), but the target file(s) do not actually depend on the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt simply because the prerequisite file(s) change. target and prerequisite may each be a string or Node, or a list of strings or Nodes. If there are multiple target values, the prerequisite(s) are added to each one. Returns a list of the affected target nodes.

Example:

env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

Return([vars..., stop=True])

Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the values of variables named in vars. Multiple strings containing variable names may be passed to Return. A string containing white space is split into individual variable names. Returns the value if one variable is specified, else returns a tuple of values. Returns an empty tuple if vars is omitted.

By default Return stops processing the current SConscript and returns immediately. The optional stop keyword argument may be set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the SConscript file after the Return call (this was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.98.) However, the values returned are still the values of the variables in the named vars at the point Return was called.

Examples:

# Returns no values (evaluates False)

Return()

# Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable

Return("foo")

# Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'

Return("foo", "bar")

# Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'

Return('val1 val2')

Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function, node_class, node_factory, scan_check, recursive])
env.Scanner(function, [name, argument, skeys, path_function, node_class, node_factory, scan_check, recursive])

Creates a Scanner object for the specified function. See manpage section "Scanner Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

SConscript(scriptnames, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
env.SConscript(scriptnames, [exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])
env.SConscript(dirs=subdirs, [name=scriptname, exports, variant_dir, duplicate, must_exist])

Executes subsidiary SConscript (build configuration) file(s). There are two ways to call the SConscript function.

The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file names as the first positional argument, which can be a string or a list of strings. If there is a second positional argument, it is treated as if the exports keyword argument had been given (see below). Examples:

SConscript('SConscript')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
SConscript(Split('src/SConscript doc/SConscript'))
config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

The second calling style is to omit the positional argument naming the script and instead specify directory names using the dirs keyword argument. The value can be a string or list of strings. In this case, scons will execute a subsidiary configuration file named SConscript (by default) in each of the specified directories. You may specify a name other than SConscript by supplying an optional name=scriptname keyword argument. The first three examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:

SConscript(dirs='.')  # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs='src')  # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

The optional exports keyword argument specifies variables to make available for use by the called SConscripts, which are evaluated in an isolated context and otherwise do not have access to local variables from the calling SConscript. The value may be a string or list of strings representing variable names, or a dictionary mapping local names to the names they can be imported by. For the first (scriptnames) calling style, a second positional argument will also be interpreted as exports; the second (directory) calling style accepts no positional arguments and must use the keyword form. These variables are locally exported only to the called SConscript file(s), and take precedence over any same-named variables in the global pool managed by the Export function. The subsidiary SConscript files must use the Import function to import the variables into their local scope. Examples:

foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

If the optional variant_dir argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the VariantDir function, but in effect only within the scope of the SConscript call. The variant_dir argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the calling SConscript file. The source directory is the directory in which the called SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is evaluated as if it were in the variant_dir directory. Thus:

SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', 'src')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

If the sources are in the same directory as the SConstruct,

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='build')

is equivalent to:

VariantDir('build', '.')
SConscript('build/SConscript')

The optional duplicate argument is interpreted as for VariantDir. If the variant_dir argument is omitted, the duplicate argument is ignored. See the description of VariantDir for additional details and restrictions.

If the optional must_exist is True (the default), an exception is raised if a requested SConscript file is not found. To allow missing scripts to be silently ignored (the default behavior prior to SCons version 3.1), pass must_exist=False in the SConscript call.

Changed in 4.6.0: must_exist now defaults to True.

Here are some composite examples:

# collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc

shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript

# can use Dir('.').path to determine variant

SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

# build debugging and production versions.  SConscript

# is passed flags to use

opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

# build common documentation and compile for different architectures

SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

SConscript returns the values of any variables named by the executed SConscript file(s) in arguments to the Return function. If a single SConscript call causes multiple scripts to be executed, the return value is a tuple containing the returns of each of the scripts. If an executed script does not explicitly call Return, it returns None.

SConscriptChdir(value)

By default, scons changes its working directory to the directory in which each subsidiary SConscript file lives while reading and processing that script. This behavior may be disabled by specifying an argument which evaluates false, in which case scons will stay in the top-level directory while reading all SConscript files. (This may be necessary when building from repositories, when all the directories in which SConscript files may be found don't necessarily exist locally.) You may enable and disable this ability by calling SConscriptChdir multiple times.

Example:

SConscriptChdir(False)
SConscript('foo/SConscript') # will not chdir to foo
SConscriptChdir(True)
SConscript('bar/SConscript') # will chdir to bar

SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])
env.SConsignFile([name, dbm_module])

Specify where to store the SCons file signature database, and which database format to use. This may be useful to specify alternate database files and/or file locations for different types of builds.

The optional name argument is the base name of the database file(s). If not an absolute path name, these are placed relative to the directory containing the top-level SConstruct file. The default is .sconsign. The actual database file(s) stored on disk may have an appropriate suffix appended by the chosen dbm_module

The optional dbm_module argument specifies which Python database module to use for reading/writing the file. The module must be imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the argument. The default is a custom SCons.dblite module that uses pickled Python data structures, which works on all Python versions. See documentation of the Python dbm module for other available types.

If called with no arguments, the database will default to .sconsign.dblite in the top directory of the project, which is also the default if if SConsignFile is not called.

The setting is global, so the only difference between the global function and the environment method form is variable expansion on name. There should only be one active call to this function/method in a given build setup.

If name is set to None, scons will store file signatures in a separate .sconsign file in each directory, not in a single combined database file. This is a backwards-compatibility measure to support what was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.97 (i.e. before 2008). Use of this mode is discouraged and may be deprecated in a future SCons release.

Examples:

# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"

# in the top-level SConstruct directory (the default behavior)

SConsignFile()

# Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"

# relative to the top-level SConstruct directory

# SCons will add a database suffix to this name

SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

# Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name

# SCons will add a database suffix to this name

SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

# Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file

# in each directory

SConsignFile(None)

# Stores signatures in a GNU dbm format .sconsign file

import dbm.gnu
SConsignFile(dbm_module=dbm.gnu)

env.SetDefault(key=val, [...])

Sets construction variables to default values specified with the keyword arguments if (and only if) the variables are not already set. The following statements are equivalent:

env.SetDefault(FOO='foo')
if 'FOO' not in env:
    env['FOO'] = 'foo'

SetOption(name, value)
env.SetOption(name, value)

Set option variable name to value. Settable options have corresponding command-line arguments, which can be used for one-time overrides, as a value set via command-line option will take precedence over one set with SetOption. The table shows the correspondence between the option name and the command-line argument(s). SetOption calls can also be placed in a site_init.py file.

The behavior of the options is described in the manpage entry for the command-line version. The value parameter is mandatory; for option values which are boolean in nature (that is, the command line option does not take an argument) use a value which evaluates to true (e.g. True, 1) or false (e.g. False, 0).

Options which affect the reading and processing of SConscript files are not settable using SetOption since those files must be read in order to find the SetOption call in the first place.

For project-specific options (sometimes called local options) added via an AddOption call, SetOption is available only after the AddOption call has completed successfully, and only if that call included the settable=True keyword argument.

The settable variables with their associated command-line options are:

Settable name Command-line argument Notes
clean -c, --clean, --remove  
diskcheck --diskcheck  
duplicate --duplicate  
experimental --experimental Since 4.2.
hash_chunksize --hash-chunksize Replaces md5_chunksize. Since 4.2
hash_format --hash-format Since 4.2
help -h, --help  
implicit_cache --implicit-cache  
implicit_deps_changed --implicit-deps-changed Also sets implicit_cache. Settable since 4.2
implicit_deps_unchanged --implicit-deps-unchanged Also sets implicit_cache. Settable since 4.2
max_drift --max-drift  
md5_chunksize --hash-chunksize Synonym for hash_chunksize. Deprecated since 4.2
no_exec -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon  
no_progress -Q See [a]
num_jobs -j, --jobs  
random --random  
silent -s, --silent, --quiet  
stack_size --stack-size  
warn --warn  

[a] If no_progress is set via SetOption in an SConscript file (but not if set in a site_init.py file) there will still be an initial status message about reading SConscript files since SCons has to start reading them before it can see the SetOption.

Example:

SetOption('max_drift', 0)

SideEffect(side_effect, target)
env.SideEffect(side_effect, target)

Declares side_effect as a side effect of building target. Both side_effect and target can be a list, a file name, or a node. A side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a side effect of building other targets. For example, a Windows PDB file is created as a side effect of building the .obj files for a static library, and various log files are created updated as side effects of various TeX commands. If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands, scons will ensure that only one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you only need to use this method for side-effect targets that are built as a result of multiple build commands.

Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect file, by default the side_effect target is not automatically removed when the target is removed by the -c option. (Note, however, that the side_effect might be removed as part of cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to make sure the side_effect is cleaned whenever a specific target is cleaned, you must specify this explicitly with the Clean or env.Clean function.

This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that were successfully added. If the list of side effects contained any side effects that had already been added, they are not added and included in the returned list.

Split(arg)
env.Split(arg)

If arg is a string, splits on whitespace and returns a list of strings without whitespace. This mode is the most common case, and can be used to split a list of filenames (for example) rather than having to type them as a list of individually quoted words. If arg is a list or tuple returns the list or tuple unchanged. If arg is any other type of object, returns a list containing just the object. These non-string cases do not actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be passed to Split without having to first check its type.

Example:

files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
files = Split("""
    f7.c
    f8.c
    f9.c
""")

env.subst(input, [raw, target, source, conv])

Performs construction variable interpolation (substitution) on input, which can be a string or a sequence. Substitutable elements take the form ${expression}, although if there is no ambiguity in recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted. A literal $ can be entered by using $$.

By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from the result, and all sequences of white space will be compressed to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $) character sequences will be stripped from the returned string, The optional raw argument may be set to 1 if you want to preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The raw argument may be set to 2 if you want to additionally discard all characters between any $( and $) pairs (as is done for signature calculation).

If input is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements of the sequence will be expanded, and the results will be returned as a list.

The optional target and source keyword arguments must be set to lists of target and source nodes, respectively, if you want the $TARGET, $TARGETS, $SOURCE and $SOURCES to be available for expansion. This is usually necessary if you are calling env.subst from within a Python function used as an SCons action.

Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default. The optional conv argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in place of the default. For example, if you want Python objects (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python objects, you can use a Python lambda expression to pass in an unnamed function that simply returns its unconverted argument.

Example:

print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

def compile(target, source, env):
    sourceDir = env.subst(
        "${SOURCE.srcdir}",
        target=target,
        source=source
    )

source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST', conv=lambda x: x)

Tag(node, tags)

Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the Package Builder should package those files or directories. All Node-level tags are optional.

Examples:

# makes sure the built library will be installed with 644 file access mode

Tag(Library('lib.c'), UNIX_ATTR="0o644")

# marks file2.txt to be a documentation file

Tag('file2.txt', DOC)

Tool(name, [toolpath, key=value, ...])
env.Tool(name, [toolpath, key=value, ...])

Locates the tool specification module name and returns a callable tool object for that tool. When the environment method (env.Tool) form is used, the tool object is automatically called before the method returns to update env, and name is appended to the $TOOLS construction variable in that environment. When the global function Tool form is used, the tool object is constructed but not called, as it lacks the context of an environment to update, and the returned object needs to be used to arrange for the call.

The tool module is searched for in the tool search paths (see the Tools section in the manual page for details) and in any paths specified by the optional toolpath parameter, which must be a list of strings. If toolpath is omitted, the toolpath supplied when the environment was created, if any, is used.

Any remaining keyword arguments are saved in the tool object, and will be passed to the tool module's generate function when the tool object is actually called. The generate function can update the construction environment with construction variables and arrange any other initialization needed to use the mechanisms that tool describes, and can use these extra arguments to help guide its actions.

Changed in version 4.2: env.Tool now returns the tool object, previously it did not return (i.e. returned None).

Examples:

env.Tool('gcc')
env.Tool('opengl', toolpath=['build/tools'])

The returned tool object can be passed to an Environment or Clone call as part of the tools keyword argument, in which case the tool is applied to the environment being constructed, or it can be called directly, in which case a construction environment to update must be passed as the argument. Either approach will also update the $TOOLS construction variable.

Examples:

env = Environment(tools=[Tool('msvc')])

env = Environment()
msvctool = Tool('msvc')
msvctool(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
gltool = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
gltool(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

ValidateOptions([throw_exception=False])

Check that all the options specified on the command line are either SCons built-in options or defined via calls to AddOption. SCons will eventually fail on unknown options anyway, but calling this function allows the build to "fail fast" before executing expensive logic later in the build.

This function should only be called after the last AddOption call in your SConscript logic. Be aware that some tools call AddOption, if you are getting error messages for arguments that they add, you will need to ensure that those tools are loaded before calling ValidateOptions.

If there are any unknown command line options, ValidateOptions prints an error message and exits with an error exit status. If the optional throw_exception argument is True (default is False), a SConsBadOptionError is raised, giving an opportunity for the SConscript logic to catch that exception and handle invalid options appropriately. Note that this exception name needs to be imported (see the example below).

A common build problem is typos (or thinkos) - a user enters an option that is just a little off the expected value, or perhaps a different word with a similar meaning. It may be useful to abort the build before going too far down the wrong path. For example:

$ scons --compilers=mingw  # the correct flag is --compiler

Here SCons could go off and run a bunch of configure steps with the default value of --compiler, since the incorrect command line did not actually supply a value to it, costing developer time to track down why the configure logic made the "wrong" choices. This example shows catching this:

from SCons.Script.SConsOptions import SConsBadOptionError

AddOption(
    '--compiler',
    dest='compiler',
    action='store',
    default='gcc',
    type='string',
)

# ... other SConscript logic

try:
    ValidateOptions(throw_exception=True)
except SConsBadOptionError as e:
    print(f"ValidateOptions detects a fail: ", e.opt_str)
    Exit(3)

New in version 4.5.0

Value(value, [built_value], [name])
env.Value(value, [built_value], [name])

Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value. Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets. If the string representation of the Value Node changes between SCons runs, it is considered out-of-date and any targets depending on it will be rebuilt. Since Value Nodes have no filesystem representation, timestamps are not used; the timestamp deciders perform the same content-based up to date check.

The optional built_value argument can be specified when the Value Node is created to indicate the Node should already be considered "built."

The optional name parameter can be provided as an alternative name for the resulting Value node; this is advised if the value parameter cannot be converted to a string.

Value Nodes have a write method that can be used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value. The corresponding read method returns the built value of the Node.

Changed in version 4.0: the name parameter was added.

Examples:

env = Environment()

def create(target, source, env):
    """Action function to create a file from a Value.

    Writes 'prefix=$SOURCE' into the file name given as $TARGET.
    """
    with open(target[0], 'wb') as f:
        f.write(b'prefix=' + source[0].get_contents() + b'\n')

# Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command line

# Use /usr/local as the default

prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '/usr/local')

# Attach builder named Config to the construction environment

# using the 'create' action function above

env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action=create)
env.Config(target='package-config', source=Value(prefix))

def build_value(target, source, env):
    """Action function to "build" a Value.

    Writes contents of $SOURCE into $TARGET, thus updating if it existed.
    """
    target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

output = env.Value('before')
input = env.Value('after')

# Attach a builder named UpdateValue to the construction environment

# using the 'build_value' action function above

env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action=build_value)
env.UpdateValue(target=Value(output), source=Value(input))

VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
env.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])

Sets up a mapping to define a variant build directory in variant_dir. src_dir must not be underneath variant_dir. A VariantDir mapping is global, even if called using the env.VariantDir form. VariantDir can be called multiple times with the same src_dir to set up multiple variant builds with different options.

Note if variant_dir is not under the project top directory, target selection rules will not pick targets in the variant directory unless they are explicitly specified.

When files in variant_dir are referenced, SCons backfills as needed with files from src_dir to create a complete build directory. By default, SCons physically duplicates the source files, SConscript files, and directory structure as needed into the variant directory. Thus, a build performed in the variant directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source directory even if intermediate source files are generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other scanners search for included files using paths relative to the source file, or if individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files. Only the files SCons calculates are needed for the build are duplicated into variant_dir. If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying. This behavior is affected by the --duplicate command-line option.

Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the duplicate argument to False. This will cause SCons to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in src_dir and the path names of derived files within variant_dir. This is more efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most builds; revert to duplicate=True if it causes problems.

VariantDir works most naturally when used with a subsidiary SConscript file. The subsidiary SConscript file must be called as if it were in variant_dir, regardless of the value of duplicate. When calling an SConscript file, you can use the exports keyword argument to pass parameters (individually or as an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick up the right settings for that variant build. The SConscript must Import these to use them. Example:

env1 = Environment(...settings for variant1...)
env2 = Environment(...settings for variant2...)

# run src/SConscript in two variant directories

VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript', exports={"env": env1})
VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript', exports={"env": env2})

See also the SConscript function for another way to specify a variant directory in conjunction with calling a subsidiary SConscript file.

More examples:

# use names in the build directory, not the source directory

VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

# this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree

VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

# same as previous example, but only uses SConscript

SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

Virtualenv()

If the SCons process is running inside a Python virtual environment, return the path to the directory where that environment is stored, else an empty string. The result can be treated as a boolean value if the path is unneeded.

WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])
env.WhereIs(program, [path, pathext, reject])

Searches for the specified executable program, returning the full path to the program or None.

When called as a construction environment method, searches the paths in the path keyword argument, or if None (the default) the paths listed in the construction environment (env['ENV']['PATH']). The external environment's path list (os.environ['PATH']) is used as a fallback if the key env['ENV']['PATH'] does not exist.

On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of the file extensions listed in the pathext keyword argument, or if None (the default) the pathname extensions listed in the construction environment (env['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The external environment's pathname extensions list (os.environ['PATHEXT']) is used as a fallback if the key env['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not exist.

When called as a global function, uses the external environment's path os.environ['PATH'] and path extensions os.environ['PATHEXT'], respectively, if path and pathext are None.

Will not select any path name or names in the optional reject list.

Appendix E. Handling Common Tasks

There is a common set of simple tasks that many build configurations rely on as they become more complex. Most build tools have special purpose constructs for performing these tasks, but since SConscript files are Python scripts, you can use more flexible built-in Python services to perform these tasks. This appendix lists a number of these tasks and how to implement them in Python and SCons.

Example E.1. Wildcard globbing to create a list of filenames

files = Glob(wildcard)

Example E.2. Filename extension substitution

import os.path
filename = os.path.splitext[filename](0)+extension

Example E.3. Appending a path prefix to a list of filenames

import os.path
filenames = [os.path.join(prefix, x) for x in filenames]

Example E.4. Substituting a path prefix with another one

if filename.find(old_prefix) == 0:
    filename = filename.replace(old_prefix, new_prefix)

Example E.5. Filtering a filename list to exclude/retain only a specific set of extensions

import os.path
filenames = [x for x in filenames if os.path.splitext[x](1) in extensions]

Example E.6. The "backtick function": run a shell command and capture the output

import subprocess
output = subprocess.check_output(command)

Example E.7. Generating source code: how code can be generated and used by SCons

The Copy builders here could be any arbitrary shell or python function that produces one or more files. This example shows how to create those files and use them in SCons.

#### SConstruct

env = Environment()
env.Append(CPPPATH = "#")

## Header example

env.Append(BUILDERS =
   {'Copy1' : Builder(action = 'cat < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                      suffix='.h', src_suffix='.bar')})
env.Copy1('test.bar') # produces test.h from test.bar.
env.Program('app','main.cpp') # indirectly depends on test.bar

## Source file example

env.Append(BUILDERS =
  {'Copy2' : Builder(action = 'cat < $SOURCE > $TARGET',
                     suffix='.cpp', src_suffix='.bar2')})
foo = env.Copy2('foo.bar2') # produces foo.cpp from foo.bar2.
env.Program('app2',['main2.cpp'] + foo) # compiles main2.cpp and foo.cpp into app2.

Where main.cpp looks like this:

# include "test.h"

produces this:

% scons -Q
cat < test.bar > test.h
cc -o app main.cpp
cat < foo.bar2 > foo.cpp
cc -o app2 main2.cpp foo.cpp
