Usage[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#usage "Link to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#installation "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package requires Python (>=3.10).

To install the latest stable version, use:

pip install neo4j-graphrag

Note

It is always recommended to install python packages for user space in a virtual environment.

Optional Dependencies[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#optional-dependencies "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra dependencies can be installed with:

pip install "neo4j-graphrag[openai]"

List of extra dependencies:

*   LLM providers (at least one is required for RAG and KG Builder Pipeline):
    *   **ollama**: LLMs from Ollama

    *   **openai**: LLMs from OpenAI (including AzureOpenAI)

    *   **google**: LLMs from Vertex AI

    *   **cohere**: LLMs from Cohere

    *   **anthropic**: LLMs from Anthropic

    *   **mistralai**: LLMs from MistralAI

*   **sentence-transformers** : to use embeddings from the sentence-transformers Python package

*   Vector database (to use [External Retrievers](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/api.html#external-retrievers)):
    *   **weaviate**: store vectors in Weaviate

    *   **pinecone**: store vectors in Pinecone

    *   **qdrant**: store vectors in Qdrant

*   **experimental**: experimental features mainly from the Knowledge Graph creation pipelines.

*   **nlp**: installs spaCy for nlp pipelines, used by SpaCySemanticMatchResolver component from the Knowledge Graph creation pipelines.

*   **fuzzy-matching**: installs **rapidfuzz** to fuzzy matching using string similarity, used by FuzzyMatchResolver component from the Knowledge Graph creation pipelines.

Note

The **`nlp`** extra (spaCy) is currently **not supported on Python 3.14** due to an upstream spaCy import-time issue (see [spaCy #13895](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/13895)). Use Python **3.13 or earlier** for spaCy-based features until that is resolved upstream.

### Creating a vector index[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#creating-a-vector-index "Link to this heading")

When creating a vector index, make sure you match the number of dimensions in the index with the number of dimensions the embeddings have.

See [the API documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/api.html#create-vector-index) for more details.

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import create_vector_index

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Creating the index
create_vector_index(
    driver,
    INDEX_NAME,
    label="Document",
    embedding_property="vectorProperty",
    dimensions=1536,
    similarity_fn="euclidean",
)

Note

Assumed Neo4j is running

### Populating the Neo4j Vector Index[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#populating-the-neo4j-vector-index "Link to this heading")

Note that the below example is not the only way you can upsert data into your Neo4j database. For example, you could also leverage [the Neo4j Python driver](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver).

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.indexes import upsert_vectors
from neo4j_graphrag.types import EntityType

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Upsert the vector
vector = ...
upsert_vectors(
    driver,
    ids=["1234"],
    embedding_property="vectorProperty",
    embeddings=[vector],
    entity_type=EntityType.NODE,
)

Note

Assumed Neo4j is running with a defined vector index

### Performing a similarity search[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#performing-a-similarity-search "Link to this heading")

While the library has more retrievers than shown here, the following examples should be able to get you started.

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from neo4j_graphrag.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorRetriever

URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")

INDEX_NAME = "vector-index-name"

# Connect to Neo4j database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)

# Create Embedder object
# Note: An OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required here
embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

# Initialize the retriever
retriever = VectorRetriever(driver, INDEX_NAME, embedder)

# Run the similarity search
query_text = "How do I do similarity search in Neo4j?"
response = retriever.search(query_text=query_text, top_k=5)

Note

Assumed Neo4j is running with populated vector index in place.

Limitations[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#limitations "Link to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The query over the vector index is an _approximate_ nearest neighbor search and may not give exact results. [See this reference for more details](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/semantic-indexes/vector-indexes/#limitations-and-issues).

### Make changes[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#make-changes "Link to this heading")

1.   Fork the repository.

2.   Install Python and uv.

3.   Create a working branch from main and start with your changes!

### Pull request[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#pull-request "Link to this heading")

When you’re finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

*   Ensure that you have [signed the CLA](https://neo4j.com/developer/contributing-code/#sign-cla).

*   Ensure that the base of your PR is set to main.

*   Don’t forget to [link your PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.

*   Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so that maintainers can make any necessary tweaks and update your branch for merge.

*   Reviewers may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or normal pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI, and any other changes can be made in your fork and committed to the PR branch.

*   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

Run tests[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#run-tests "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the tests using uv.

uv run pytest

### Unit tests[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#unit-tests "Link to this heading")

This should run out of the box once the dependencies are installed.

uv run pytest tests/unit

### E2E tests[¶](https://neo4j.com/docs/neo4j-graphrag-python/current/#e2e-tests "Link to this heading")

To run e2e tests you’d need to have some services running locally:

*   neo4j

*   weaviate

*   weaviate-text2vec-transformers

The easiest way to get it up and running is via Docker compose:

docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml up

Note

If you suspect something in the databases are cached, run docker compose -f tests/e2e/docker-compose.yml down to remove them completely

Once the services are running, execute the following command to run the e2e tests.

uv run pytest tests/e2e
