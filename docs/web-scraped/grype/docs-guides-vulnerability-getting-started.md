# Getting Started
Use Grype to scan your container images, directories, or archives for known vulnerabilities.Tags:- grype
- vulnerabilities
## What is Vulnerability Scanning?
- 
**Vulnerability scanning** is the process of **identifying known security vulnerabilities** in software packages and dependencies.**For developers**, it helps catch security issues early in development, before they reach production.
- **For organizations**, it&rsquo;s essential for maintaining security posture and meeting compliance requirements.
**Grype** is a CLI tool for scanning container images, filesystems, and SBOMs for known vulnerabilities.## Installation
- 
Grype is provided as a single compiled executable and requires no external dependencies to run.
Run the command for your platform to download the latest release.
Platform:
- 
Linux (and macOS)
- 
macOS
- 
Windows
```
``
```
```
`curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin`
```
```
`brew install grype`
```
```
`nuget install Anchore.Grype`
```
Check out installation guide for full list of official and community-maintained packaging options.## Scan a container image for vulnerabilities
- 
Run `grype` against a small container image. Grype will download the latest vulnerability database
and output simple human-readable table of packages that are vulnerable:```
`grype alpine:latest
`
```
```
` ✔ Loaded image alpine:latest
 ✔ Parsed image sha256:8d591b0b7dea080ea3be9e12ae563eebf9…
 ✔ Cataloged contents 058c92d86112aa6f641b01ed238a07a3885…
   ├── ✔ Packages                        [15 packages]
   ├── ✔ File metadata                   [82 locations]
   ├── ✔ File digests                    [82 files]
   └── ✔ Executables                     [17 executables]
 ✔ Scanned for vulnerabilities     [6 vulnerability matches]
   ├── by severity: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 6 low, 0 negligible
   └── by status:   0 fixed, 6 not-fixed, 0 ignored

```
#### Learn more
Grype supports more than just containers. Learn more about Supported Scan Targets## Scan an existing SBOM for vulnerabilities

Grype can scan container images directly, but it can also scan an existing SBOM document.#### Note
This presumes you already created `alpine_latest-spdx.json` using Syft, or some other tool. If not, go to SBOM Generation Getting Started and create it now.```
`grype alpine_latest-spdx.json
`
```
## Create a vulnerability report in JSON format

The JSON-formatted output from Grype can be processed or visualized by other tools.Create the vulnerability report using the `--output` flag:```
`grype alpine:latest --output json | jq . &gt; vuln_report.json
`
```
While the JSON is piped to the file, you&rsquo;ll see progress on stderr:```
` ✔ Pulled image
 ✔ Loaded image alpine:latest
 ✔ Parsed image sha256:8d591b0b7dea080ea3be9e12ae563eebf9869168ffced1cb25b2470a3d9fe15e

## FAQ

**Does Grype need internet access?**Only for downloading container images and the vulnerability database. After the initial database download, scanning works offline until you update the database.**What about private container registries?**Grype supports authentication for private registries. See Private Registries.**Can I use Grype in CI/CD pipelines?**Absolutely! Grype is designed for automation. Scan images or SBOMs during builds and fail pipelines based on severity thresholds.**What data does Grype send externally?**Nothing. Grype runs entirely locally and doesn&rsquo;t send any data to external services.## Next steps
