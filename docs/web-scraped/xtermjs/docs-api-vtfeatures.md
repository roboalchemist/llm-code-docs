## General notes

This document lists xterm.js' support of terminal sequences. The sequences are grouped by their sequence type:

-   C0: single byte command (7bit control codes, byte range `\x00` .. `\x1F`, `\x7F`)
-   C1: single byte command (8bit control codes, byte range `\x80` .. `\x9F`)
-   ESC: sequence starting with `ESC` (`\x1B`)
-   CSI - Control Sequence Introducer: sequence starting with `ESC [` (7bit) or CSI (`\x9B`, 8bit)
-   DCS - Device Control String: sequence starting with `ESC P` (7bit) or DCS (`\x90`, 8bit)
-   OSC - Operating System Command: sequence starting with `ESC ]` (7bit) or OSC (`\x9D`, 8bit)

Application Program Command (APC), Privacy Message (PM) and Start of String (SOS) are recognized but not supported, any sequence of these types will be silently ignored. They are also not hookable by the API.

Note that the list only marks sequences implemented in xterm.js' core codebase as supported. Missing sequences are either not supported or unstable/experimental. Furthermore addons or integrations can provide additional custom sequences (denoted as "External" where known).

To denote the sequences the tables use the same abbreviations as xterm does:

-   `Ps`: A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of one or more decimal digits.
-   `Pm`: Multiple numeric parameters composed of any number of single numeric parameters, separated by ; character(s), e.g. \` Ps ; Ps ; ... \`.
-   `Pt`: A text parameter composed of printable characters. Note that for most commands with `Pt` only ASCII printables are specified to work. Additionally the parser will let pass any codepoint greater than C1 as printable.

### Bell

The behavior of the bell is further customizable with `ITerminalOptions.bellStyle` and `ITerminalOptions.bellSound`.

### Backspace

By default it is not possible to move the cursor past the leftmost position. If `reverse wrap-around` (`CSI ? 45 h`) is set, a previous soft line wrap (DECAWM) can be undone with BS within the scroll margins. In that case the cursor will wrap back to the end of the previous row. Note that it is not possible to peek back into the scrollbuffer with the cursor, thus at the home position (top-leftmost cell) this has no effect.

### Line Feed

Scrolling is restricted to scroll margins and will only happen on the bottom line.

### Insert Characters

The ICH sequence inserts `Ps` blank characters. The cursor remains at the beginning of the blank characters. Text between the cursor and right margin moves to the right. Characters moved past the right margin are lost.

### Scroll Left

SL moves the content of all lines within the scroll margins `Ps` times to the left. SL has no effect outside of the scroll margins.

### Cursor Up

If the cursor would pass the top scroll margin, it will stop there.

### Scroll Right

SL moves the content of all lines within the scroll margins `Ps` times to the right. Content at the right margin is lost. SL has no effect outside of the scroll margins.

### Cursor Down

If the cursor would pass the bottom scroll margin, it will stop there.

### Cursor Next Line

Same as CUD, additionally places the cursor at the first column.

### Cursor Backward

Same as CUU, additionally places the cursor at the first column.

### Cursor Position

If ORIGIN mode is set, places the cursor to the absolute position within the scroll margins. If ORIGIN mode is not set, places the cursor to the absolute position within the viewport. Note that the coordinates are 1-based, thus the top left position starts at `1 ; 1`.

### Erase In Display

Supported param values:

  Ps   Effect
  ---- --------------------------------------------------------------
  0    Erase from the cursor through the end of the viewport.
  1    Erase from the beginning of the viewport through the cursor.
  2    Erase complete viewport.
  3    Erase scrollback.

### Erase In Line

Supported param values:

  Ps   Effect
  ---- ----------------------------------------------------------
  0    Erase from the cursor through the end of the row.
  1    Erase from the beginning of the line through the cursor.
  2    Erase complete line.

### Insert Line

For every inserted line at the scroll top one line at the scroll bottom gets removed. The cursor is set to the first column. IL has no effect if the cursor is outside the scroll margins.

### Delete Line

For every deleted line at the scroll top one blank line at the scroll bottom gets appended. The cursor is set to the first column. DL has no effect if the cursor is outside the scroll margins.

### Delete Character

As characters are deleted, the remaining characters between the cursor and right margin move to the left. Character attributes move with the characters. The terminal adds blank characters at the right margin.

### Erase Character

ED erases `Ps` characters from current cursor position to the right. ED works inside or outside the scrolling margins.

### Repeat Preceding Character

REP repeats the previous character `Ps` times advancing the cursor, also wrapping if DECAWM is set. REP has no effect if the sequence does not follow a printable ASCII character (NOOP for any other sequence in between or NON ASCII characters).

### Tab Clear

Clearing tabstops off the active row (Ps = 2, VT100) is currently not supported.

### Select Graphic Rendition

SGR selects one or more character attributes at the same time. Multiple params (up to 32) are applied in order from left to right. The changed attributes are applied to all new characters received. If you move characters in the viewport by scrolling or any other means, then the attributes move with the characters.

### Request Mode

Returns a report as `CSI Ps; Pm $ y` (DECRPM), where `Ps` is the mode number as in SM/RM or DECSET/DECRST, and `Pm` is the mode value:

-   0: not recognized
-   1: set
-   2: reset
-   3: permanently set
-   4: permanently reset

For modes not understood xterm.js always returns `notRecognized`. In general this means, that a certain operation mode is not implemented and cannot be used.

Modes changing the active terminal buffer (47, 1047, 1049) are not subqueried and only report, whether the alternate buffer is set.

Mouse encodings and mouse protocols are handled mutual exclusive, thus only one of each of those can be set at a given time.

There is a chance, that some mode reports are not fully in line with xterm.js' behavior, e.g. if the default implementation already exposes a certain behavior. If you find discrepancies in the mode reports, please file a bug.

### Soft Terminal Reset

There are two terminal reset sequences - RIS and DECSTR. While RIS performs almost a full terminal bootstrap, DECSTR only resets certain attributes. For most needs DECSTR should be sufficient.

The following terminal attributes are reset to default values:

-   IRM is reset (dafault = false)
-   scroll margins are reset (default = viewport size)
-   erase attributes are reset to default
-   charsets are reset
-   DECSC data is reset to initial values
-   DECOM is reset to absolute mode

### Set Cursor Style

Supported cursor styles:

-   empty, 0 or 1: steady block
-   2: blink block
-   3: steady underline
-   4: blink underline
-   5: steady bar
-   6: blink bar

### Insert Columns

DECIC inserts `Ps` times blank columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins, moving content to the right. Content at the right margin is lost. DECIC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.

### Delete Columns

DECDC deletes `Ps` times columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins, moving content to the left. Blank columns are added at the right margin. DECDC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.

### Set Windows Title and Icon Name

Icon name is not supported. For Window Title see below.

### Set Windows Title

xterm.js does not manipulate the title directly, instead exposes changes via the event `Terminal.onTitleChange`.

### Set ANSI color

`c` is the color index between 0 and 255. The color format of `spec` is derived from `XParseColor` (see OSC 10 for supported formats). There may be multipe `c ; spec` pairs present in the same instruction. If `spec` contains `?` the terminal returns a sequence with the currently set color.

### Create hyperlink

`uri` is a hyperlink starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `file://` or `mailto://`. `params` is an optional list of key=value assignments, separated by the : character. Example: `id=xyz123:foo=bar:baz=quux`. Currently only the id key is defined. Cells that share the same ID and URI share hover feedback. Use `OSC 8 ; ; BEL` to finish the current hyperlink.

### Set or query default foreground color

To set the color, the following color specification formats are supported:

-   `rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>` for `<red>, <green>, <blue>` in `h | hh | hhh | hhhh`, where `h` is a single hexadecimal digit (case insignificant). The different widths scale from 4 bit (`h`) to 16 bit (`hhhh`) and get converted to 8 bit (`hh`).
-   `#RGB` - 4 bits per channel, expanded to `#R0G0B0`
-   `#RRGGBB` - 8 bits per channel
-   `#RRRGGGBBB` - 12 bits per channel, truncated to `#RRGGBB`
-   `#RRRRGGGGBBBB` - 16 bits per channel, truncated to `#RRGGBB`

**Note:** X11 named colors are currently unsupported.

If `Pt` contains `?` instead of a color specification, the terminal returns a sequence with the current default foreground color (use that sequence to restore the color after changes).

**Note:** Other than xterm, xterm.js does not support OSC 12 - 19. Therefore stacking multiple `Pt` separated by `;` only works for the first two entries.

### Reset ANSI color

`c` is the color index between 0 and 255. This function restores the default color for `c` as specified by the loaded theme. Any number of `c` parameters may be given. If no parameters are given, the entire indexed color table will be reset.
