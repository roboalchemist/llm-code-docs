Title: Testing (Symfony Docs)

URL Source: https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html

Markdown Content:
Whenever you write a new line of code, you also potentially add new bugs. To build better and more reliable applications, you should test your code using both functional and unit tests.

Symfony integrates with an independent library called [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to give you a rich testing framework. This article covers the PHPUnit basics you'll need to write Symfony tests. To learn everything about PHPUnit and its features, read the [official PHPUnit documentation](https://docs.phpunit.de/).

[Types of Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#types-of-tests "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many types of automated tests and precise definitions often differ from project to project. In Symfony, the following definitions are used. If you have learned something different, that is not necessarily wrong, merely different from what the Symfony documentation is using.

[Unit Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#unit-tests) These tests ensure that _individual_ units of source code (e.g. a single class) behave as intended. [Integration Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#integration-tests) These tests test a combination of classes and commonly interact with Symfony's service container. These tests do not yet cover the fully working application, those are called _Application tests_. [Application Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#application-tests) Application tests (also known as functional tests) test the behavior of a complete application. They make HTTP requests (both real and simulated ones) and test that the response is as expected.

[Installation](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#installation "Permalink to this headline")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before creating your first test, install `symfony/test-pack`, which installs some other packages needed for testing (such as `phpunit/phpunit`):

After the library is installed, try running PHPUnit:

This command automatically runs your application tests. Each test is a PHP class ending with "Test" (e.g. `BlogControllerTest`) that lives in the `tests/` directory of your application.

PHPUnit is configured by the `phpunit.dist.xml` file in the root of your application (in PHPUnit versions older than 10, the file is named `phpunit.xml.dist`). The default configuration provided by Symfony Flex will be enough in most cases. Read the [PHPUnit documentation](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/10.5/configuration.html) to discover all possible configuration options (e.g. to enable code coverage or to split your test into multiple "test suites").

Note

[Symfony Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html#symfony-flex) automatically creates `phpunit.dist.xml` and `tests/bootstrap.php`. If these files are missing, you can try running the recipe again using `composer recipes:install phpunit/phpunit --force -v`.

[Unit Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#unit-tests "Permalink to this headline")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A [unit test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) ensures that individual units of source code (e.g. a single class or some specific method in some class) meet their design and behave as intended. Writing unit tests in a Symfony application is no different from writing standard PHPUnit unit tests. You can learn about it in the PHPUnit documentation: [Writing Tests for PHPUnit](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/10.5/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html).

By convention, the `tests/` directory should replicate the directory of your application for unit tests. So, if you're testing a class in the `src/Form/` directory, put the test in the `tests/Form/` directory. Autoloading is automatically enabled via the `vendor/autoload.php` file (as configured by default in the `phpunit.dist.xml` file).

You can run tests using the `bin/phpunit` command:

Tip

In large test suites, it can make sense to create subdirectories for each type of test (`tests/Unit/`, `tests/Integration/`, `tests/Application/`, etc.).

[Integration Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#integration-tests "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An integration test will test a larger part of your application compared to a unit test (e.g. a combination of services). Integration tests might want to use the Symfony Kernel to fetch a service from the dependency injection container.

Symfony provides a [KernelTestCase](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Test/KernelTestCase.php "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\KernelTestCase") class to help you create and boot the kernel in your tests using `bootKernel()`:

The `KernelTestCase` also makes sure your kernel is rebooted for each test. This assures that each test is run independently from each other.

To run your application tests, the `KernelTestCase` class needs to find the application kernel to initialize. The kernel class is usually defined in the `KERNEL_CLASS` environment variable (included in the default `.env.test` file provided by Symfony Flex):

Note

If your use case is more complex, you can also override the `getKernelClass()` or `createKernel()` methods of your functional test, which takes precedence over the `KERNEL_CLASS` env var.

### [Set-up your Test Environment](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#set-up-your-test-environment "Permalink to this headline")

The tests create a kernel that runs in the `test`[environment](https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration.html#configuration-environments). This allows you to have special settings for your tests inside `config/packages/test/` or using the `when@test` key.

If you have Symfony Flex installed, some packages already installed some useful test configuration. For example, by default, the Twig bundle is configured to be especially strict to catch errors before deploying your code to production:

You can also use a different environment entirely, or override the default debug mode (`true`) by passing each as options to the `bootKernel()` method:

Tip

It is recommended to run your test with `debug` set to `false` on your CI server, as it significantly improves test performance. This disables clearing the cache. If your tests don't run in a clean environment each time, you have to manually clear it using for instance this code in `tests/bootstrap.php`:

### [Customizing Environment Variables](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#customizing-environment-variables "Permalink to this headline")

If you need to customize some environment variables for your tests (e.g. the `DATABASE_URL` used by Doctrine), you can do that by overriding anything you need in your `.env.test` file:

In the test environment, these env files are read (if vars are duplicated in them, files lower in the list override previous items):

1. `.env`: containing env vars with application defaults;
2. `.env.test`: overriding/setting specific test values or vars;
3. `.env.test.local`: overriding settings specific for this machine.

Warning

The `.env.local` file is **not** used in the test environment, to make each test set-up as consistent as possible.

### [Retrieving Services in the Test](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#retrieving-services-in-the-test "Permalink to this headline")

In your integration tests, you often need to fetch the service from the service container to call a specific method. After booting the kernel, the container is returned by `static::getContainer()`:

The container from `static::getContainer()` is actually a special test container. It gives you access to both the public services and the non-removed [private services](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html#container-public).

Note

If you need to test private services that have been removed (those who are not used by any other services), you need to declare those private services as public in the `config/services_test.yaml` file.

[Mocking Dependencies](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#mocking-dependencies "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it can be useful to mock a dependency of a tested service. From the example in the previous section, let's assume the `NewsletterGenerator` has a dependency to a private alias `NewsRepositoryInterface` pointing to a private `NewsRepository` service and you'd like to use a mocked `NewsRepositoryInterface` instead of the concrete one:

No further configuration is required, as the test service container is a special one that allows you to interact with private services and aliases.

### [Configuring a Database for Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#configuring-a-database-for-tests "Permalink to this headline")

Tests that interact with the database should use their own separate database to not mess with the databases used in the other [configuration environments](https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration.html#configuration-environments).

To do that, edit or create the `.env.test.local` file at the root directory of your project and define the new value for the `DATABASE_URL` env var:

This assumes that each developer/machine uses a different database for the tests. If the test set-up is the same on each machine, use the `.env.test` file instead and commit it to the shared repository. Learn more about [using multiple .env files in Symfony applications](https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration.html#configuration-multiple-env-files).

After that, you can create the test database and all tables using:

Tip

A common practice is to append the `_test` suffix to the original database names in tests. If the database name in production is called `project_acme` the name of the testing database could be `project_acme_test`.

#### [Resetting the Database Automatically Before each Test](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#resetting-the-database-automatically-before-each-test "Permalink to this headline")

Tests should be independent from each other to avoid side effects. For example, if some test modifies the database (by adding or removing an entity) it could change the results of other tests.

The [DAMADoctrineTestBundle](https://github.com/dmaicher/doctrine-test-bundle) uses Doctrine transactions to let each test interact with an unmodified database. Install it using:

Now, enable it as a PHPUnit extension:

That's it! This bundle uses a clever trick: it begins a database transaction before every test and rolls it back automatically after the test finishes to undo all changes. Read more in the documentation of the [DAMADoctrineTestBundle](https://github.com/dmaicher/doctrine-test-bundle).

#### [Load Test Data Fixtures](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#load-test-data-fixtures "Permalink to this headline")

Instead of using the real data from the production database, it's common to use fake or test data in the test database. This is usually called _"fixtures data"_ and Doctrine provides a library to create and load them. Install it with:

Then, use the `make:fixtures` command of the [SymfonyMakerBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/SymfonyMakerBundle/index.html) to generate an empty fixture class:

Then you modify and use this class to load new entities in the database. For instance, to load `Product` objects into Doctrine, use:

Empty the database and reload _all_ the fixture classes with:

For more information, read the [DoctrineFixturesBundle documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html).

[Application Tests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#application-tests "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application tests check the integration of all the different layers of the application (from the routing to the views). They are no different from unit tests or integration tests as far as PHPUnit is concerned, but they have a very specific workflow:

1. [Make a request](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#testing-applications-arrange);
2. [Interact with the page](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#testing-applications-act) (e.g. click on a link or submit a form);
3. [Test the response](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#testing-application-assertions);
4. Rinse and repeat.

Note

The tools used in this section can be installed via the `symfony/test-pack`, use `composer require symfony/test-pack` if you haven't done so already.

### [Write Your First Application Test](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#write-your-first-application-test "Permalink to this headline")

Application tests are PHP files that typically live in the `tests/Controller/` directory of your application. They often extend [WebTestCase](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Test/WebTestCase.php "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase"). This class adds special logic on top of the `KernelTestCase`. You can read more about that in the above [section on integration tests](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html#integration-tests).

If you want to test the pages handled by your `PostController` class, start by creating a new `PostControllerTest` using the `make:test` command of the [SymfonyMakerBundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/SymfonyMakerBundle/index.html):

This creates the following test class:

In the above example, the test validates that the HTTP response was successful and the request body contains a `<h1>` tag with `"Hello world"`.

The `request()` method also returns a crawler, which you can use to create more complex assertions in your tests (e.g. to count the number of page elements that match a given CSS selector):

You can learn more about the crawler in [The DOM Crawler](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing/dom_crawler.html).

### [Making Requests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#making-requests "Permalink to this headline")

The test client simulates an HTTP client like a browser and makes requests into your Symfony application:

The [request()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/BrowserKit/AbstractBrowser.php#:~:text=function%20request "Symfony\Component\BrowserKit\AbstractBrowser::request()") method takes the HTTP method and a URL as arguments and returns a `Crawler` instance.

Tip

Hardcoding the request URLs is a best practice for application tests. If the test generates URLs using the Symfony router, it won't detect any change made to the application URLs which may impact the end users.

The full signature of the `request()` method is:

This allows you to create all types of requests you can think of:

Tip

The test client is available as the `test.client` service in the container in the `test` environment (or wherever the [framework.test](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#reference-framework-test) option is enabled). This means you can override the service entirely if you need to.

#### [Multiple Requests in One Test](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#multiple-requests-in-one-test "Permalink to this headline")

After making a request, subsequent requests will make the client reboot the kernel. This recreates the container from scratch to ensures that requests are isolated and use new service objects each time. This behavior can have some unexpected consequences: for example, the security token will be cleared, Doctrine entities will be detached, etc.

First, you can call the client's [disableReboot()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/KernelBrowser.php#:~:text=function%20disableReboot "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\KernelBrowser::disableReboot()") method to reset the kernel instead of rebooting it. In practice, Symfony will call the `reset()` method of every service tagged with `kernel.reset`. However, this will **also** clear the security token, detach Doctrine entities, etc.

In order to solve this issue, create a [compiler pass](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/compiler_passes.html) to remove the `kernel.reset` tag from some services in your test environment:

#### [Browsing the Site](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#browsing-the-site "Permalink to this headline")

The Client supports many operations that can be done in a real browser:

Note

The `back()` and `forward()` methods skip the redirects that may have occurred when requesting a URL, as normal browsers do.

#### [Redirecting](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#redirecting "Permalink to this headline")

When a request returns a redirect response, the client does not follow it automatically. You can examine the response and force a redirection afterwards with the `followRedirect()` method:

If you want the client to automatically follow all redirects, you can force them by calling the `followRedirects()` method before performing the request:

If you pass `false` to the `followRedirects()` method, the redirects will no longer be followed:

#### [Logging in Users (Authentication)](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#logging-in-users-authentication "Permalink to this headline")

When you want to add application tests for protected pages, you have to first "login" as a user. Reproducing the actual steps - such as submitting a login form - makes a test very slow. For this reason, Symfony provides a `loginUser()` method to simulate logging in your functional tests.

Instead of logging in with real users, it's recommended to create a user only for tests. You can do that with [Doctrine data fixtures](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html) to load the testing users only in the test database.

After loading users in your database, use your user repository to fetch this user and use [$client->loginUser()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/KernelBrowser.php#:~:text=function%20loginUser "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\KernelBrowser::loginUser()") to simulate a login request:

You can pass any [UserInterface](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/User/UserInterface.php "Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface") instance to `loginUser()`. This method creates a special [TestBrowserToken](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Test/TestBrowserToken.php "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\TestBrowserToken") object and stores in the session of the test client. If you need to define custom attributes in this token, you can use the `tokenAttributes` argument of the [loginUser()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/KernelBrowser.php#:~:text=function%20loginUser "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\KernelBrowser::loginUser()") method.

You can also use an [in-memory user](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/user_providers.html#security-memory-user-provider) in your tests by instantiating [InMemoryUser](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/User/InMemoryUser.php "Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\InMemoryUser") directly:

Before doing this, you must define the in-memory user in your test environment configuration to ensure it exists and can be authenticated:

To set a specific firewall (`main` is set by default):

Note

By design, the `loginUser()` method doesn't work when using stateless firewalls. Instead, add the appropriate token/header in each `request()` call.

#### [Setup the session](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#setup-the-session "Permalink to this headline")

The client provides a `getSession()` method, which allows you to set up the session before performing the request:

#### [Making AJAX Requests](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#making-ajax-requests "Permalink to this headline")

The client provides an [xmlHttpRequest()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/BrowserKit/AbstractBrowser.php#:~:text=function%20xmlHttpRequest "Symfony\Component\BrowserKit\AbstractBrowser::xmlHttpRequest()") method, which has the same arguments as the `request()` method and is a shortcut to make AJAX requests:

If your application behaves according to some HTTP headers, pass them as the second argument of `createClient()`:

You can also override HTTP headers on a per request basis:

Warning

The name of your custom headers must follow the syntax defined in the [section 4.1.18 of RFC 3875](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875#section-4.1.18): replace `-` by `_`, transform it into uppercase and prefix the result with `HTTP_`. For example, if your header name is `X-Session-Token`, pass `HTTP_X_SESSION_TOKEN`.

#### [Reporting Exceptions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#reporting-exceptions "Permalink to this headline")

Debugging exceptions in application tests may be difficult because by default they are caught and you need to look at the logs to see which exception was thrown. Disabling catching of exceptions in the test client allows the exception to be reported by PHPUnit:

#### [Accessing Internal Objects](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#accessing-internal-objects "Permalink to this headline")

If you use the client to test your application, you might want to access the client's internal objects:

You can also get the objects related to the latest request:

#### [Accessing the Profiler Data](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#accessing-the-profiler-data "Permalink to this headline")

On each request, you can enable the Symfony profiler to collect data about the internal handling of that request. For example, the profiler could be used to verify that a given page runs less than a certain number of database queries when loading.

To get the profiler for the last request, do the following:

For specific details on using the profiler inside a test, see the [How to Use the Profiler in a Functional Test](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing/profiling.html) article.

### [Interacting with the Response](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#interacting-with-the-response "Permalink to this headline")

Like a real browser, the Client and Crawler objects can be used to interact with the page you're served:

#### [Clicking on Links](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#clicking-on-links "Permalink to this headline")

Use the `clickLink()` method to click on the first link that contains the given text (or the first clickable image with that `alt` attribute):

If you need access to the [Link](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Link.php "Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Link") object that provides helpful methods specific to links (such as `getMethod()` and `getUri()`), use the `Crawler::selectLink()` method instead:

#### [Submitting Forms](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#submitting-forms "Permalink to this headline")

Use the `submitForm()` method to submit the form that contains the given button:

The first argument of `submitForm()` is the text content, `id` or `name` of any `<button>` or `<input type="submit">` included in the form. The second optional argument is used to override the default form field values.

Note

Notice that you select form buttons and not forms, as a form can have several buttons. If you use the traversing API, remember that you must look for a button.

If you need access to the [Form](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Form.php "Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Form") object that provides helpful methods specific to forms (such as `getUri()`, `getValues()` and `getFiles()`) use the `Crawler::selectButton()` method instead:

Based on the form type, you can use different methods to fill in the input:

Tip

Instead of hardcoding the form name as part of the field names (e.g. `my_form[...]` in previous examples), you can use the [getName()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Form.php#:~:text=function%20getName "Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Form::getName()") method to get the form name.

Tip

You can get the values that will be submitted by calling the `getValues()` method on the `Form` object. The uploaded files are available in a separate array returned by `getFiles()`. The `getPhpValues()` and `getPhpFiles()` methods also return the submitted values, but in the PHP format (it converts the keys with square brackets notation - e.g. `my_form[subject]` - to PHP arrays).

Tip

The `submit()` and `submitForm()` methods define optional arguments to add custom server parameters and HTTP headers when submitting the form:

### [Testing the Response (Assertions)](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#testing-the-response-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

Now that the tests have visited a page and interacted with it (e.g. filled in a form), it is time to verify that the expected output is shown.

As all tests are based on PHPUnit, you can use any [PHPUnit Assertion](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/10.3/assertions.html) in your tests. Combined with test Client and the Crawler, this allows you to check anything you want.

However, Symfony provides useful shortcut methods for the most common cases:

#### [Response Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#response-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

`assertResponseIsSuccessful(string $message = '', ?bool $verbose = null)` Asserts that the response was successful (HTTP status is 2xx). `assertResponseStatusCodeSame(int $expectedCode, string $message = '', ?bool $verbose = null)` Asserts a specific HTTP status code. `assertResponseRedirects(?string $expectedLocation = null, ?int $expectedCode = null, string $message = '', ?bool $verbose = null)` Asserts the response is a redirect response (optionally, you can check the target location and status code). The excepted location can be either an absolute or a relative path. `assertResponseHasHeader(string $headerName, string $message = '')`/`assertResponseNotHasHeader(string $headerName, string $message = '')` Asserts the given header is (not) available on the response, e.g. `assertResponseHasHeader('content-type');`. `assertResponseHeaderSame(string $headerName, string $expectedValue, string $message = '')`/`assertResponseHeaderNotSame(string $headerName, string $expectedValue, string $message = '')` Asserts the given header does (not) contain the expected value on the response, e.g. `assertResponseHeaderSame('content-type', 'application/octet-stream');`. `assertResponseHasCookie(string $name, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')`/`assertResponseNotHasCookie(string $name, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')` Asserts the given cookie is present in the response (optionally checking for a specific cookie path or domain). `assertResponseCookieValueSame(string $name, string $expectedValue, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')` Asserts the given cookie is present and set to the expected value. `assertResponseFormatSame(?string $expectedFormat, string $message = '')` Asserts the response format returned by the [getFormat()](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.php#:~:text=function%20getFormat "Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response::getFormat()") method is the same as the expected value. `assertResponseIsUnprocessable(string $message = '', bool ?$verbose = null)` Asserts the response is unprocessable (HTTP status is 422)
By default, these assert methods provide detailed error messages when they fail. You can control the verbosity level using the optional `verbose` argument in each assert method. To set this verbosity level globally, use the `setBrowserKitAssertionsAsVerbose()` method from the [BrowserKitAssertionsTrait](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/8.0/src/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Test/BrowserKitAssertionsTrait.php "Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\BrowserKitAssertionsTrait"):

#### [Request Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#request-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

`assertRequestAttributeValueSame(string $name, string $expectedValue, string $message = '')` Asserts the given [request attribute](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation.html#component-foundation-attributes) is set to the expected value. `assertRouteSame($expectedRoute, array $parameters = [], string $message = '')` Asserts the request matches the given route and optionally route parameters.

#### [Browser Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#browser-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

`assertBrowserHasCookie(string $name, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')`/`assertBrowserNotHasCookie(string $name, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')` Asserts that the test Client does (not) have the given cookie set (meaning, the cookie was set by any response in the test). `assertBrowserCookieValueSame(string $name, string $expectedValue, string $path = '/', ?string $domain = null, string $message = '')` Asserts the given cookie in the test Client is set to the expected value. `assertBrowserHistoryIsOnFirstPage(string $message = '')`/`assertBrowserHistoryIsNotOnFirstPage(string $message = '')` Asserts that the browser history is (not) on the first page. `assertBrowserHistoryIsOnLastPage(string $message = '')`/`assertBrowserHistoryIsNotOnLastPage(string $message = '')` Asserts that the browser history is (not) on the last page. `assertThatForClient(Constraint $constraint, string $message = '')`
Asserts the given Constraint in the Client. Useful for using your custom asserts in the same way as built-in asserts (i.e. without passing the Client as argument):

#### [Crawler Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#crawler-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

#### [Mailer Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#mailer-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

#### [Notifier Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#notifier-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

`assertNotificationCount(int $count, ?string $transportName = null, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given number of notifications has been created (in total or for the given transport). `assertQueuedNotificationCount(int $count, ?string $transportName = null, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given number of notifications are queued (in total or for the given transport). `assertNotificationIsQueued(MessageEvent $event, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given notification is queued. `assertNotificationIsNotQueued(MessageEvent $event, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given notification is not queued. `assertNotificationSubjectContains(MessageInterface $notification, string $text, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given text is included in the subject of the given notification. `assertNotificationSubjectNotContains(MessageInterface $notification, string $text, string $message = '')` Asserts that the given text is not included in the subject of the given notification. `assertNotificationTransportIsEqual(MessageInterface $notification, string $transportName, string $message = '')` Asserts that the name of the transport for the given notification is the same as the given text. `assertNotificationTransportIsNotEqual(MessageInterface $notification, string $transportName, string $message = '')` Asserts that the name of the transport for the given notification is not the same as the given text.

#### [HttpClient Assertions](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#httpclient-assertions "Permalink to this headline")

Tip

For all the following assertions, `$client->enableProfiler()` must be called before the code that will trigger HTTP request(s).

`assertHttpClientRequest(string $expectedUrl, string $expectedMethod = 'GET', string|array|null $expectedBody = null, array $expectedHeaders = [], string $httpClientId = 'http_client')` Asserts that the given URL has been called using, if specified, the given method body and headers. By default it will check on the HttpClient, but you can also pass a specific HttpClient ID. (It will succeed if the request has been called multiple times.) `assertNotHttpClientRequest(string $unexpectedUrl, string $expectedMethod = 'GET', string $httpClientId = 'http_client')` Asserts that the given URL has not been called using GET or the specified method. By default it will check on the HttpClient, but a HttpClient id can be specified. `assertHttpClientRequestCount(int $count, string $httpClientId = 'http_client')` Asserts that the given number of requests has been made on the HttpClient. By default it will check on the HttpClient, but you can also pass a specific HttpClient ID.

### [End to End Tests (E2E)](https://symfony.com/doc/8.0/testing.html#end-to-end-tests-e2e "Permalink to this headline")

If you need to test the application as a whole, including the JavaScript code, you can use a real browser instead of the test client. This is called an end-to-end test and it's a great way to test the application.

This can be achieved thanks to the Panther component. You can learn more about it in [the dedicated page](https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing/end_to_end.html).
