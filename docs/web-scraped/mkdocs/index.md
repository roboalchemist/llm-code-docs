# MkDocs[](#mkdocs "Permanent link")

Project documentation with Markdown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site generator that\'s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Start by reading the [introductory tutorial](getting-started/), then check the [User Guide](user-guide/) for more information.

## Features 

### Great themes available 

There\'s a stack of good looking [themes](user-guide/choosing-your-theme) available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: [mkdocs](user-guide/choosing-your-theme/#mkdocs) and [readthedocs](user-guide/choosing-your-theme/#readthedocs), select one of the third-party themes (on the [MkDocs Themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes) wiki page as well as the [MkDocs Catalog](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog#-theming)), or [build your own](dev-guide/themes/).

### Easy to customize 

Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by [customizing your theme](user-guide/customizing-your-theme/) and/or installing some [plugins](user-guide/configuration/#plugins). Modify Markdown\'s behavior with [Markdown extensions](user-guide/configuration/#markdown_extensions). Many [configuration options](user-guide/configuration/) are available.

### Preview your site as you work 

The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you\'re writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.

### Host anywhere 

MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or [anywhere](user-guide/deploying-your-docs/) else you choose.
