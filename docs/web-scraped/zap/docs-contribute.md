ZAP is a community project and we want more people to get involved.

Here are some of the ways you can contribute to ZAP:

**[Request Changes](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/issues/)** - report issues, vulnerabilities and raise feature requests

**[Translate ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/translate/)** - so that people can use ZAP in their native language

**[Test ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/testing/)** - e.g. against deliberately vulnerable applications

**[Coding](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/coding/)** - because writing code is key to all tools

**[Scan Rules](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/scan-rules/)** - a great way to learn more about security without having to understand too much of the ZAP code base

**[Run a Hackathon](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/run-a-zap-hackathon/)** - if you run a technical group then why not get everyone involved?

**[Core Team](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/core-team/)** - here's what the ZAP Core Team is about and how you can join us
