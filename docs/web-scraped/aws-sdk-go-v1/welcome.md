More InfoMaintenance and support for SDK major versions

AWS SDK for Go V1 has reached end-of-support. We recommend that you migrate to [AWS SDK for Go V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/). For additional details and information on how to migrate, please refer to this [announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs//developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-go-v1-on-july-31-2025/).

# What is the AWS SDK for Go

The AWS SDK for Go provides APIs and utilities that developers can use to build Go applications that use AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

###### Note

This document is for version 1 of the AWS SDK for Go. If you're looking for version 2 of the SDK, see the [version 2 developer guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/) and the [version 2 SDK API reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).

The SDK removes the complexity of coding directly against a web service interface. It hides a lot of the lower-level plumbing, such as authentication, request retries, and error handling.

The SDK also includes helpful utilities. For example, the Amazon S3 download and upload manager can automatically break up large objects into multiple parts and transfer them in parallel.

Use the AWS SDK for Go Developer Guide to help you install, configure, and use the SDK. The guide provides configuration information, sample code, and an introduction to the SDK utilities.
