# AWS Lambda Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go

AWS Lambda (Lambda) is a zero-administration compute platform for backend web developers that runs your code for you in the AWS Cloud, and provides you with a fine-grained pricing structure. You can use the following examples to access AWS Lambda (Lambda) using the AWS SDK for Go. For more information about Lambda, see the [Lambda documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/lambda/).

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/lambda) repository on GitHub.
