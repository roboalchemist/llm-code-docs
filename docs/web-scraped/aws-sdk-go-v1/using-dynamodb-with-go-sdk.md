AWS SDK for Go V1 has reached end-of-support. We recommend that you migrate to [AWS SDK for Go V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v2/developer-guide/). For additional details and information on how to migrate, please refer to this [announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs//developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-go-v1-on-july-31-2025/).

# Amazon DynamoDB Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate Amazon DynamoDB into your Go applications. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK (that is, you have imported all required packages and set your credentials and region). For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](./setting-up.html) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](./configuring-sdk.html).

The topic also provides a link to a downloadable version of DynamoDB, which includes an interactive web interface so you can experiment with DynamoDB offline.

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/dynamodb) repository on GitHub.
