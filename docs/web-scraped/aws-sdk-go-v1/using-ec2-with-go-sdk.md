# Amazon EC2 Examples Using the AWS SDK for Go

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity—literally servers in Amazon’s data centers—that you use to build and host your software systems. The AWS SDK for Go examples can integrate Amazon EC2 into your Go applications. The examples assume you have already set up and configured the SDK (that is, you have imported all required packages and set your credentials and region). For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for Go](./setting-up.html) and [Configuring the AWS SDK for Go](./configuring-sdk.html).

You can download complete versions of these example files from the [aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/go/example_code/s3) repository on GitHub.
