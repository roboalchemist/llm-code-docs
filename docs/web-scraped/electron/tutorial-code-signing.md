# Code Signing

Code signing is a security technology to certify that an app was created by you. You should sign your application so it does not trigger any operating system security warnings.

Both Windows and macOS prevent users from running unsigned applications. It is possible to distribute applications without codesigning them - but in order to run them, users need to go through multiple advanced and manual steps.

If you are building an Electron app that you intend to package and distribute, it should be code signed. The Electron ecosystem tooling makes codesigning your apps straightforward - this documentation explains how sign your apps on both Windows and macOS.

## Signing & notarizing macOS builds[â€‹](#signing--notarizing-macos-builds "Direct link to Signing & notarizing macOS builds") 

Preparing macOS applications for release requires two steps: First, the app needs to be code signed. Then, the app needs to be uploaded to Apple for a process called **notarization**, where automated systems will further verify that your app isn\'t doing anything to endanger its users.

To start the process, ensure that you fulfill the requirements for signing and notarizing your app:

1.  Enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) (requires an annual fee)
2.  Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) - this requires a computer running macOS
3.  Generate, download, and install [signing certificates](https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/)

Electron\'s ecosystem favors configuration and freedom, so there are multiple ways to get your application signed and notarized.

### Using Electron Forge[â€‹](#using-electron-forge "Direct link to Using Electron Forge") 

If you\'re using Electron\'s favorite build tool, getting your application signed and notarized requires a few additions to your configuration. [Forge](https://electronforge.io) is a collection of the official Electron tools, using [`@electron/packager`](https://github.com/electron/packager), [`@electron/osx-sign`](https://github.com/electron/osx-sign), and [`@electron/notarize`](https://github.com/electron/notarize) under the hood.

Detailed instructions on how to configure your application can be found in the [Signing macOS Apps](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-macos) guide in the Electron Forge docs.

### Using Electron Packager[â€‹](#using-electron-packager "Direct link to Using Electron Packager") 

If you\'re not using an integrated build pipeline like Forge, you are likely using [`@electron/packager`](https://github.com/electron/packager), which includes [`@electron/osx-sign`](https://github.com/electron/osx-sign) and [`@electron/notarize`](https://github.com/electron/notarize).

If you\'re using Packager\'s API, you can pass [in configuration that both signs and notarizes your application](https://electron.github.io/packager/main/modules.html). If the example below does not meet your needs, please see [`@electron/osx-sign`](https://github.com/electron/osx-sign) and [`@electron/notarize`](https://github.com/electron/notarize) for the many possible configuration options.

``` 
const packager = require('@electron/packager')

packager(,
  osxNotarize: 
})
```

### Signing Mac App Store applications[â€‹](#signing-mac-app-store-applications "Direct link to Signing Mac App Store applications") 

See the [Mac App Store Guide](/docs/latest/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide).

## Signing Windows builds[â€‹](#signing-windows-builds "Direct link to Signing Windows builds") 

### Using traditional certificates[â€‹](#using-traditional-certificates "Direct link to Using traditional certificates") 

Before you can code sign your application, you need to acquire a code signing certificate. Unlike Apple, Microsoft allows developers to purchase those certificates on the open market. They are usually sold by the same companies also offering HTTPS certificates. Prices vary, so it may be worth your time to shop around. Popular resellers include:

- [Certum EV code signing certificate](https://shop.certum.eu/data-safety/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)
- [DigiCert EV code signing certificate](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates)
- [Entrust EV code signing certificate](https://www.entrustdatacard.com/products/digital-signing-certificates/code-signing-certificates)
- [GlobalSign EV code signing certificate](https://www.globalsign.com/en/code-signing-certificate/ev-code-signing-certificates)
- [IdenTrust EV code signing certificate](https://www.identrust.com/digital-certificates/trustid-ev-code-signing)
- [Sectigo (formerly Comodo) EV code signing certificate](https://sectigo.com/ssl-certificates-tls/code-signing)
- [SSL.com EV code signing certificate](https://www.ssl.com/certificates/ev-code-signing/)

It is important to call out that since June 2023, Microsoft requires software to be signed with an \"extended validation\" certificate, also called an \"EV code signing certificate\". In the past, developers could sign software with a simpler and cheaper certificate called \"authenticode code signing certificate\" or \"software-based OV certificate\". These simpler certificates no longer provide benefits: Windows will treat your app as completely unsigned and display the equivalent warning dialogs.

The new EV certificates are required to be stored on a hardware storage module compliant with FIPS 140 Level 2, Common Criteria EAL 4+ or equivalent. In other words, the certificate cannot be simply downloaded onto a CI infrastructure. In practice, those storage modules look like fancy USB thumb drives.

Many certificate providers now offer \"cloud-based signing\" - the entire signing hardware is in their data center and you can use it to remotely sign code. This approach is popular with Electron maintainers since it makes signing your applications in CI (like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc) relatively easy.

At the time of writing, Electron\'s own apps use [DigiCert KeyLocker](https://docs.digicert.com/en/digicert-keylocker.html), but any provider that provides a command line tool for signing files will be compatible with Electron\'s tooling.

All tools in the Electron ecosystem use [`@electron/windows-sign`](https://github.com/electron/windows-sign) and typically expose configuration options through a `windowsSign` property. You can either use it to sign files directly - or use the same `windowsSign` configuration across Electron Forge, [`@electron/packager`](https://github.com/electron/packager), [`electron-winstaller`](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer), and [`electron-wix-msi`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-wix-msi).

#### Using Electron Forge[â€‹](#using-electron-forge-1 "Direct link to Using Electron Forge") 

Electron Forge is the recommended way to sign your app as well as your `Squirrel.Windows` and `WiX MSI` installers. Detailed instructions on how to configure your application can be found in the [Electron Forge Code Signing Tutorial](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-windows).

#### Using Electron Packager[â€‹](#using-electron-packager-1 "Direct link to Using Electron Packager") 

If you\'re not using an integrated build pipeline like Forge, you are likely using [`@electron/packager`](https://github.com/electron/packager), which includes [`@electron/windows-sign`](https://github.com/electron/windows-sign).

If you\'re using Packager\'s API, you can pass [in configuration that signs your application](https://electron.github.io/packager/main/modules.html). If the example below does not meet your needs, please see [`@electron/windows-sign`](https://github.com/electron/windows-sign) for the many possible configuration options.

``` 
const packager = require('@electron/packager')

packager(
})
```

#### Using electron-winstaller (Squirrel.Windows)[â€‹](#using-electron-winstaller-squirrelwindows "Direct link to Using electron-winstaller (Squirrel.Windows)") 

[`electron-winstaller`](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer) is a package that can generate Squirrel.Windows installers for your Electron app. This is the tool used under the hood by Electron Forge\'s [Squirrel.Windows Maker](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/squirrel.windows). Just like `@electron/packager`, it uses [`@electron/windows-sign`](https://github.com/electron/windows-sign) under the hood and supports the same `windowsSign` options.

``` 
const electronInstaller = require('electron-winstaller')
// NB: Use this syntax within an async function, Node does not have support for
//     top-level await as of Node 12.
try 
  })
  console.log('It worked!')
} catch (e) `)
}
```

For full configuration options, check out the [`electron-winstaller`](https://github.com/electron/windows-installer) repository!

#### Using electron-wix-msi (WiX MSI)[â€‹](#using-electron-wix-msi-wix-msi "Direct link to Using electron-wix-msi (WiX MSI)") 

[`electron-wix-msi`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-wix-msi) is a package that can generate MSI installers for your Electron app. This is the tool used under the hood by Electron Forge\'s [MSI Maker](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers/wix-msi). Just like `@electron/packager`, it uses [`@electron/windows-sign`](https://github.com/electron/windows-sign) under the hood and supports the same `windowsSign` options.

``` 
import  from 'electron-wix-msi'

// Step 1: Instantiate the MSICreator
const msiCreator = new MSICreator(
})

// Step 2: Create a .wxs template file
const supportBinaries = await msiCreator.create()

// ð Step 2a: optionally sign support binaries if you
// sign you binaries as part of of your packaging script
for (const binary of supportBinaries) 

// Step 3: Compile the template to a .msi file
await msiCreator.compile()
```

For full configuration options, check out the [`electron-wix-msi`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-wix-msi) repository!

#### Using Electron Builder[â€‹](#using-electron-builder "Direct link to Using Electron Builder") 

Electron Builder comes with a custom solution for signing your application. You can find [its documentation here](https://www.electron.build/code-signing).

### Using Azure Trusted Signing[â€‹](#using-azure-trusted-signing "Direct link to Using Azure Trusted Signing") 

[Azure Trusted Signing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/trusted-signing) is Microsoft\'s modern cloud-based alternative to EV certificates. It is the cheapest option for code signing on Windows, and it gets rid of SmartScreen warnings.

As of October 2025, Azure Trusted Signing is available to US and Canada-based organizations with 3+ years of verifiable business history and to individual developers in the US and Canada. Microsoft is looking to make the program more widely available. If you\'re reading this at a later point, it could make sense to check if the eligibility criteria have changed.

#### Using Electron Forge[â€‹](#using-electron-forge-2 "Direct link to Using Electron Forge") 

Electron Forge is the recommended way to sign your app as well as your `Squirrel.Windows` and `WiX MSI` installers. Instructions for Azure Trusted Signing can be found [here](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-windows#using-azure-trusted-signing).
