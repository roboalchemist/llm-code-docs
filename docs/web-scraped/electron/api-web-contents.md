> Render and control web pages.

Process: [Main](/docs/latest/glossary#main-process)

`webContents` is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter). It is responsible for rendering and controlling a web page and is a property of the [`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window) object. An example of accessing the `webContents` object:

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.loadURL('https://github.com')

const contents = win.webContents
console.log(contents)
```

## Navigation Events[â€‹](#navigation-events "Direct link to Navigation Events") 

Several events can be used to monitor navigations as they occur within a `webContents`.

### Document Navigations[â€‹](#document-navigations "Direct link to Document Navigations") 

When a `webContents` navigates to another page (as opposed to an [in-page navigation](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#in-page-navigation)), the following events will be fired.

- [`did-start-navigation`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-start-navigation)
- [`will-frame-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-frame-navigate)
- [`will-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-navigate) (only fired when main frame navigates)
- [`will-redirect`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-redirect) (only fired when a redirect happens during navigation)
- [`did-redirect-navigation`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-redirect-navigation) (only fired when a redirect happens during navigation)
- [`did-frame-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-frame-navigate)
- [`did-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-navigate) (only fired when main frame navigates)

Subsequent events will not fire if `event.preventDefault()` is called on any of the cancellable events.

### In-page Navigation[â€‹](#in-page-navigation "Direct link to In-page Navigation") 

In-page navigations don\'t cause the page to reload, but instead navigate to a location within the current page. These events are not cancellable. For an in-page navigations, the following events will fire in this order:

- [`did-start-navigation`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-start-navigation)
- [`did-navigate-in-page`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-navigate-in-page)

### Frame Navigation[â€‹](#frame-navigation "Direct link to Frame Navigation") 

The [`will-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-navigate) and [`did-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-navigate) events only fire when the [mainFrame](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentsmainframe-readonly) navigates. If you want to also observe navigations in `<iframe>`s, use [`will-frame-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-frame-navigate) and [`did-frame-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-did-frame-navigate) events.

## Methods[â€‹](#methods "Direct link to Methods") 

These methods can be accessed from the `webContents` module:

``` 
const  = require('electron')

console.log(webContents)
```

### `webContents.getAllWebContents()`[â€‹](#webcontentsgetallwebcontents "Direct link to webcontentsgetallwebcontents") 

Returns `WebContents[]` - An array of all `WebContents` instances. This will contain web contents for all windows, webviews, opened devtools, and devtools extension background pages.

### `webContents.getFocusedWebContents()`[â€‹](#webcontentsgetfocusedwebcontents "Direct link to webcontentsgetfocusedwebcontents") 

Returns `WebContents | null` - The web contents that is focused in this application, otherwise returns `null`.

### `webContents.fromId(id)`[â€‹](#webcontentsfromidid "Direct link to webcontentsfromidid") 

- `id` Integer

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given ID, or `undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given ID.

### `webContents.fromFrame(frame)`[â€‹](#webcontentsfromframeframe "Direct link to webcontentsfromframeframe") 

- `frame` WebFrameMain

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given WebFrameMain, or `undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given WebFrameMain.

### `webContents.fromDevToolsTargetId(targetId)`[â€‹](#webcontentsfromdevtoolstargetidtargetid "Direct link to webcontentsfromdevtoolstargetidtargetid") 

- `targetId` string - The Chrome DevTools Protocol [TargetID](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Target/#type-TargetID) associated with the WebContents instance.

Returns `WebContents | undefined` - A WebContents instance with the given TargetID, or `undefined` if there is no WebContents associated with the given TargetID.

When communicating with the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/), it can be useful to lookup a WebContents instance based on its assigned TargetID.

``` 
async function lookupTargetId (browserWindow)  = await wc.debugger.sendCommand('Target.getTargetInfo')
  const  = targetInfo
  const targetWebContents = await wc.fromDevToolsTargetId(targetId)
}
```

This event will not emit when the navigation is started programmatically with APIs like `webContents.loadURL` and `webContents.back`.

It is also not emitted for in-page navigations, such as clicking anchor links or updating the `window.location.hash`. Use `did-navigate-in-page` event for this purpose.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the navigation.

Returns:

- `details` Event\<\>
  - `url` string - The URL the frame is navigating to.

  - `initiator` WebFrameMain \| null (optional) - The frame which initiated the navigation, which can be a parent frame (e.g. via `window.open` with a frame\'s name), or null if the navigation was not initiated by a frame. This can also be null if the initiating frame was deleted before the event was emitted.

Emitted when a user or the page wants to start navigation in any frame. It can happen when the `window.location` object is changed or a user clicks a link in the page.

Unlike `will-navigate`, `will-frame-navigate` is fired when the main frame or any of its subframes attempts to navigate. When the navigation event comes from the main frame, `isMainFrame` will be `true`.

This event will not emit when the navigation is started programmatically with APIs like `webContents.loadURL` and `webContents.back`.

It is also not emitted for in-page navigations, such as clicking anchor links or updating the `window.location.hash`. Use `did-navigate-in-page` event for this purpose.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the navigation.

#### Event: \'did-start-navigation\'[â€‹](#event-did-start-navigation "Direct link to Event: 'did-start-navigation'") 

Returns:

- `details` Event\<\>

#### Event: \'will-prevent-unload\'[â€‹](#event-will-prevent-unload "Direct link to Event: 'will-prevent-unload'") 

Returns:

- `event` Event

Emitted when a `beforeunload` event handler is attempting to cancel a page unload.

Calling `event.preventDefault()` will ignore the `beforeunload` event handler and allow the page to be unloaded.

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.webContents.on('will-prevent-unload', (event) => )
  const leave = (choice === 0)
  if (leave)

Emitted when the `WebContents` loses focus.

#### Event: \'focus\'[â€‹](#event-focus "Direct link to Event: 'focus'") 

Emitted when the `WebContents` gains focus.

Note that on macOS, having focus means the `WebContents` is the first responder of window, so switching focus between windows would not trigger the `focus` and `blur` events of `WebContents`, as the first responder of each window is not changed.

The `focus` and `blur` events of `WebContents` should only be used to detect focus change between different `WebContents` and `BrowserView` in the same window.

Emitted when a bluetooth device needs to be selected when a call to `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` is made. `callback` should be called with the `deviceId` of the device to be selected. Passing an empty string to `callback` will cancel the request.

If no event listener is added for this event, all bluetooth requests will be cancelled.

If `event.preventDefault` is not called when handling this event, the first available device will be automatically selected.

Due to the nature of bluetooth, scanning for devices when `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice` is called may take time and will cause `select-bluetooth-device` to fire multiple times until `callback` is called with either a device id or an empty string to cancel the request.

main.js

``` 
const  = require('electron')

let win = null

app.whenReady().then(() => )
  win.webContents.on('select-bluetooth-device', (event, deviceList, callback) => )
    if (!result)  else 
  })
})
```

#### Event: \'paint\'[â€‹](#event-paint "Direct link to Event: 'paint'") 

Returns:

- `details` Event\<\>
  - `texture` [OffscreenSharedTexture](/docs/latest/api/structures/offscreen-shared-texture) (optional) *Experimental* - The GPU shared texture of the frame, when `webPreferences.offscreen.useSharedTexture` is `true`.
- `dirtyRect` [Rectangle](/docs/latest/api/structures/rectangle)
- `image` [NativeImage](/docs/latest/api/native-image) - The image data of the whole frame.

Emitted when a new frame is generated. Only the dirty area is passed in the buffer.

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow( })
win.webContents.on('paint', (event, dirty, image) => )
win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

When using shared texture (set `webPreferences.offscreen.useSharedTexture` to `true`) feature, you can pass the texture handle to external rendering pipeline without the overhead of copying data between CPU and GPU memory, with Chromium\'s hardware acceleration support. This feature is helpful for high-performance rendering scenarios.

Only a limited number of textures can exist at the same time, so it\'s important that you call `texture.release()` as soon as you\'re done with the texture. By managing the texture lifecycle by yourself, you can safely pass the `texture.textureInfo` to other processes through IPC.

More details can be found in the [offscreen rendering tutorial](/docs/latest/tutorial/offscreen-rendering). To learn about how to handle the texture in native code, refer to [offscreen rendering\'s code documentation.](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/shell/browser/osr/README.md).

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow( } })
win.webContents.on('paint', async (e, dirty, image) => 
})
win.loadURL('https://github.com')
```

Returns `boolean` - Whether the renderer process has crashed.

#### `contents.forcefullyCrashRenderer()`[â€‹](#contentsforcefullycrashrenderer "Direct link to contentsforcefullycrashrenderer") 

Forcefully terminates the renderer process that is currently hosting this `webContents`. This will cause the `render-process-gone` event to be emitted with the `reason=killed || reason=crashed`. Please note that some webContents share renderer processes and therefore calling this method may also crash the host process for other webContents as well.

Calling `reload()` immediately after calling this method will force the reload to occur in a new process. This should be used when this process is unstable or unusable, for instance in order to recover from the `unresponsive` event.

  - `cssOrigin` string (optional) - Can be \'user\' or \'author\'. Sets the [cascade origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascade-origin) of the inserted stylesheet. Default is \'author\'.

Returns `Promise<string>` - A promise that resolves with a key for the inserted CSS that can later be used to remove the CSS via `contents.removeInsertedCSS(key)`.

Injects CSS into the current web page and returns a unique key for the inserted stylesheet.

``` 
const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.webContents.on('did-finish-load', () => ')
})
```

#### `contents.removeInsertedCSS(key)`[â€‹](#contentsremoveinsertedcsskey "Direct link to contentsremoveinsertedcsskey") 

- `key` string

Returns `Promise<void>` - Resolves if the removal was successful.

Removes the inserted CSS from the current web page. The stylesheet is identified by its key, which is returned from `contents.insertCSS(css)`.

``` 
const win = new BrowserWindow()

win.webContents.on('did-finish-load', async () => ')
  win.webContents.removeInsertedCSS(key)
})
```

#### `contents.executeJavaScript(code[, userGesture])`[â€‹](#contentsexecutejavascriptcode-usergesture "Direct link to contentsexecutejavascriptcode-usergesture") 

- `code` string
- `userGesture` boolean (optional) - Default is `false`.

Returns `Promise<any>` - A promise that resolves with the result of the executed code or is rejected if the result of the code is a rejected promise.

Evaluates `code` in page.

In the browser window some HTML APIs like `requestFullScreen` can only be invoked by a gesture from the user. Setting `userGesture` to `true` will remove this limitation.

Code execution will be suspended until web page stop loading.

``` 
const win = new BrowserWindow()

win.webContents.executeJavaScript('fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1").then(resp => resp.json())', true)
  .then((result) => )
```

#### `contents.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld(worldId, scripts[, userGesture])`[â€‹](#contentsexecutejavascriptinisolatedworldworldid-scripts-usergesture "Direct link to contentsexecutejavascriptinisolatedworldworldid-scripts-usergesture") 

- `worldId` Integer - The ID of the world to run the javascript in, `0` is the default world, `999` is the world used by Electron\'s `contextIsolation` feature. You can provide any integer here.
- `scripts` [WebSource\[\]](/docs/latest/api/structures/web-source)
- `userGesture` boolean (optional) - Default is `false`.

Returns `Promise<any>` - A promise that resolves with the result of the executed code or is rejected if the result of the code is a rejected promise.

Works like `executeJavaScript` but evaluates `scripts` in an isolated context.

#### `contents.setIgnoreMenuShortcuts(ignore)`[â€‹](#contentssetignoremenushortcutsignore "Direct link to contentssetignoremenushortcutsignore") 

- `ignore` boolean

Ignore application menu shortcuts while this web contents is focused.

#### `contents.setWindowOpenHandler(handler)`[â€‹](#contentssetwindowopenhandlerhandler "Direct link to contentssetwindowopenhandlerhandler") 

- `handler` Function\<[WindowOpenHandlerResponse](/docs/latest/api/structures/window-open-handler-response)\>

  - `details` Object
    - `url` string - The *resolved* version of the URL passed to `window.open()`. e.g. opening a window with `window.open('foo')` will yield something like `https://the-origin/the/current/path/foo`.
    - `frameName` string - Name of the window provided in `window.open()`
    - `features` string - Comma separated list of window features provided to `window.open()`.
    - `disposition` string - Can be `default`, `foreground-tab`, `background-tab`, `new-window` or `other`.
    - `referrer` [Referrer](/docs/latest/api/structures/referrer) - The referrer that will be passed to the new window. May or may not result in the `Referer` header being sent, depending on the referrer policy.
    - `postBody` [PostBody](/docs/latest/api/structures/post-body) (optional) - The post data that will be sent to the new window, along with the appropriate headers that will be set. If no post data is to be sent, the value will be `null`. Only defined when the window is being created by a form that set `target=_blank`.

  Returns `WindowOpenHandlerResponse` - When set to `` cancels the creation of the new window. `` will allow the new window to be created. Returning an unrecognized value such as a null, undefined, or an object without a recognized \'action\' value will result in a console error and have the same effect as returning ``.

Called before creating a window a new window is requested by the renderer, e.g. by `window.open()`, a link with `target="_blank"`, shift+clicking on a link, or submitting a form with `<form target="_blank">`. See [`window.open()`](/docs/latest/api/window-open) for more details and how to use this in conjunction with `did-create-window`.

An example showing how to customize the process of new `BrowserWindow` creation to be `BrowserView` attached to main window instead:

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()

mainWindow.webContents.setWindowOpenHandler((details) => )
      return browserView.webContents
    }
  }
})

The zoom policy at the Chromium level is same-origin, meaning that the zoom level for a specific domain propagates across all instances of windows with the same domain. Differentiating the window URLs will make zoom work per-window.

#### `contents.getZoomLevel()`[â€‹](#contentsgetzoomlevel "Direct link to contentsgetzoomlevel") 

Returns `number` - the current zoom level.

#### `contents.setVisualZoomLevelLimits(minimumLevel, maximumLevel)`[â€‹](#contentssetvisualzoomlevellimitsminimumlevel-maximumlevel "Direct link to contentssetvisualzoomlevellimitsminimumlevel-maximumlevel")

- \"Print job canceled\"
- \"Print job failed\"

Use `page-break-before: always;` CSS style to force to print to a new page.

#### `contents.addWorkSpace(path)`[â€‹](#contentsaddworkspacepath "Direct link to contentsaddworkspacepath") 

- `path` string

Adds the specified path to DevTools workspace. Must be used after DevTools creation:

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow()
win.webContents.on('devtools-opened', () => )
```

#### `contents.removeWorkSpace(path)`[â€‹](#contentsremoveworkspacepath "Direct link to contentsremoveworkspacepath") 

- `path` string

Removes the specified path from DevTools workspace.

#### `contents.setDevToolsWebContents(devToolsWebContents)`[â€‹](#contentssetdevtoolswebcontentsdevtoolswebcontents "Direct link to contentssetdevtoolswebcontentsdevtoolswebcontents") 

- `devToolsWebContents` WebContents

Uses the `devToolsWebContents` as the target `WebContents` to show devtools.

The `devToolsWebContents` must not have done any navigation, and it should not be used for other purposes after the call.

By default Electron manages the devtools by creating an internal `WebContents` with native view, which developers have very limited control of. With the `setDevToolsWebContents` method, developers can use any `WebContents` to show the devtools in it, including `BrowserWindow`, `BrowserView` and `<webview>` tag.

Note that closing the devtools does not destroy the `devToolsWebContents`, it is caller\'s responsibility to destroy `devToolsWebContents`.

An example of showing devtools in a `<webview>` tag:

``` 
<html>
<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    * 
    #browser 
    #devtools 
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <webview id="browser" src="https://github.com"></webview>
  <webview id="devtools" src="about:blank"></webview>
  <script>
    const  = require('electron')
    const emittedOnce = (element, eventName) => new Promise(resolve => )
    })
    const browserView = document.getElementById('browser')
    const devtoolsView = document.getElementById('devtools')
    const browserReady = emittedOnce(browserView, 'dom-ready')
    const devtoolsReady = emittedOnce(devtoolsView, 'dom-ready')
    Promise.all([browserReady, devtoolsReady]).then(() => )
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

``` 
// Main process
const  = require('electron')

ipcMain.on('open-devtools', (event, targetContentsId, devtoolsContentsId) => )
```

An example of showing devtools in a `BrowserWindow`:

main.js

``` 
const  = require('electron')

let win = null
let devtools = null

app.whenReady().then(() => )
})
```

#### `contents.openDevTools([options])`[â€‹](#contentsopendevtoolsoptions "Direct link to contentsopendevtoolsoptions")

  - `activate` boolean (optional) - Whether to bring the opened devtools window to the foreground. The default is `true`.
  - `title` string (optional) - A title for the DevTools window (only in `undocked` or `detach` mode).

Opens the devtools.

When `contents` is a `<webview>` tag, the `mode` would be `detach` by default, explicitly passing an empty `mode` can force using last used dock state.

On Windows, if Windows Control Overlay is enabled, Devtools will be opened with `mode: 'detach'`.

#### `contents.sendToFrame(frameId, channel, ...args)`[â€‹](#contentssendtoframeframeid-channel-args "Direct link to contentssendtoframeframeid-channel-args") 

- `frameId` Integer \| \[number, number\] - the ID of the frame to send to, or a pair of `[processId, frameId]` if the frame is in a different process to the main frame.
- `channel` string
- `...args` any\[\]

Send an asynchronous message to a specific frame in a renderer process via `channel`, along with arguments. Arguments will be serialized with the [Structured Clone Algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm), just like [`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage), so prototype chains will not be included. Sending Functions, Promises, Symbols, WeakMaps, or WeakSets will throw an exception.

> **NOTE:** Sending non-standard JavaScript types such as DOM objects or special Electron objects will throw an exception.

The renderer process can handle the message by listening to `channel` with the [`ipcRenderer`](/docs/latest/api/ipc-renderer) module.

If you want to get the `frameId` of a given renderer context you should use the `webFrame.routingId` value. E.g.

``` 
// In a renderer process
console.log('My frameId is:', require('electron').webFrame.routingId)
```

You can also read `frameId` from all incoming IPC messages in the main process.

``` 
// In the main process
ipcMain.on('ping', (event) => )
```

#### `contents.postMessage(channel, message, [transfer])`[â€‹](#contentspostmessagechannel-message-transfer "Direct link to contentspostmessagechannel-message-transfer")

- `message` any
- `transfer` MessagePortMain\[\] (optional)

Send a message to the renderer process, optionally transferring ownership of zero or more [`MessagePortMain`](/docs/latest/api/message-port-main) objects.

The transferred `MessagePortMain` objects will be available in the renderer process by accessing the `ports` property of the emitted event. When they arrive in the renderer, they will be native DOM `MessagePort` objects.

For example:

``` 
// Main process
const win = new BrowserWindow()
const  = new MessageChannelMain()
win.webContents.postMessage('port', , [port1])

// Renderer process
ipcRenderer.on('port', (e, msg) => )
```

This is a known limitation in Chromium, you can force image animation to be recalculated with `img.src = img.src` which will result in no network traffic but will update the animation policy.

This corresponds to the [animationPolicy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/accessibilityFeatures/#property-animationPolicy) accessibility feature in Chromium.

### Instance Properties[â€‹](#instance-properties "Direct link to Instance Properties") 

#### `contents.ipc` *Readonly*[â€‹](#contentsipc-readonly "Direct link to contentsipc-readonly") 

An [`IpcMain`](/docs/latest/api/ipc-main) scoped to just IPC messages sent from this WebContents.

IPC messages sent with `ipcRenderer.send`, `ipcRenderer.sendSync` or `ipcRenderer.postMessage` will be delivered in the following order:

1.  `contents.on('ipc-message')`
2.  `contents.mainFrame.on(channel)`
3.  `contents.ipc.on(channel)`
4.  `ipcMain.on(channel)`

Handlers registered with `invoke` will be checked in the following order. The first one that is defined will be called, the rest will be ignored.

1.  `contents.mainFrame.handle(channel)`
2.  `contents.handle(channel)`
3.  `ipcMain.handle(channel)`

A handler or event listener registered on the WebContents will receive IPC messages sent from any frame, including child frames. In most cases, only the main frame can send IPC messages. However, if the `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option is enabled, it is possible for child frames to send IPC messages also. In that case, handlers should check the `senderFrame` property of the IPC event to ensure that the message is coming from the expected frame. Alternatively, register handlers on the appropriate frame directly using the [`WebFrameMain.ipc`](/docs/latest/api/web-frame-main#frameipc-readonly) interface.
