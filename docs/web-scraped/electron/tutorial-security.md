For information on how to properly disclose an Electron vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

For upstream Chromium vulnerabilities: Electron keeps up to date with alternating Chromium releases. For more information, see the [Electron Release Timelines](/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines) document.

## Preface[â€‹](#preface "Direct link to Preface") 

As web developers, we usually enjoy the strong security net of the browser â€" the risks associated with the code we write are relatively small. Our websites are granted limited powers in a sandbox, and we trust that our users enjoy a browser built by a large team of engineers that is able to quickly respond to newly discovered security threats.

When working with Electron, it is important to understand that Electron is not a web browser. It allows you to build feature-rich desktop applications with familiar web technologies, but your code wields much greater power. JavaScript can access the filesystem, user shell, and more. This allows you to build high quality native applications, but the inherent security risks scale with the additional powers granted to your code.

With that in mind, be aware that displaying arbitrary content from untrusted sources poses a severe security risk that Electron is not intended to handle. In fact, the most popular Electron apps (Atom, Slack, Visual Studio Code, etc) display primarily local content (or trusted, secure remote content without Node integration) â€" if your application executes code from an online source, it is your responsibility to ensure that the code is not malicious.

## General guidelines[â€‹](#general-guidelines "Direct link to General guidelines") 

### Security is everyone\'s responsibility[â€‹](#security-is-everyones-responsibility "Direct link to Security is everyone's responsibility") 

It is important to remember that the security of your Electron application is the result of the overall security of the framework foundation (*Chromium*, *Node.js*), Electron itself, all NPM dependencies and your code. As such, it is your responsibility to follow a few important best practices:

- **Keep your application up-to-date with the latest Electron framework release.** When releasing your product, youâ€™re also shipping a bundle composed of Electron, Chromium shared library and Node.js. Vulnerabilities affecting these components may impact the security of your application. By updating Electron to the latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities (such as *nodeIntegration bypasses*) are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application. For more information, see \"[Use a current version of Electron](#16-use-a-current-version-of-electron)\".

- **Evaluate your dependencies.** While NPM provides half a million reusable packages, it is your responsibility to choose trusted 3rd-party libraries. If you use outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities or rely on poorly maintained code, your application security could be in jeopardy.

- **Adopt secure coding practices.** The first line of defense for your application is your own code. Common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), have a higher security impact on Electron applications hence it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.

### Isolation for untrusted content[â€‹](#isolation-for-untrusted-content "Direct link to Isolation for untrusted content") 

A security issue exists whenever you receive code from an untrusted source (e.g. a remote server) and execute it locally. As an example, consider a remote website being displayed inside a default [`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window). If an attacker somehow manages to change said content (either by attacking the source directly, or by sitting between your app and the actual destination), they will be able to execute native code on the user\'s machine.

Under no circumstances should you load and execute remote code with Node.js integration enabled. Instead, use only local files (packaged together with your application) to execute Node.js code. To display remote content, use the [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) tag or a [`WebContentsView`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents-view) and make sure to disable the `nodeIntegration` and enable `contextIsolation`.

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]Electron security warnings

Security warnings and recommendations are printed to the developer console. They only show up when the binary\'s name is Electron, indicating that a developer is currently looking at the console.

You can force-enable or force-disable these warnings by setting `ELECTRON_ENABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS` or `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS` on either `process.env` or the `window` object.

### 1. Only load secure content[â€‹](#1-only-load-secure-content "Direct link to 1. Only load secure content") 

Any resources not included with your application should be loaded using a secure protocol like `HTTPS`. In other words, do not use insecure protocols like `HTTP`. Similarly, we recommend the use of `WSS` over `WS`, `FTPS` over `FTP`, and so on.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why "Direct link to Why?") 

`HTTPS` has two main benefits:

1.  It ensures data integrity, asserting that the data was not modified while in transit between your application and the host.
2.  It encrypts the traffic between your user and the destination host, making it more difficult to eavesdrop on the information sent between your app and the host.

#### How?[â€‹](#how "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Bad
browserWindow.loadURL('http://example.com')

// Good
browserWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

index.html (Renderer Process)

<!-- Good -->

```

### 2. Do not enable Node.js integration for remote content[â€‹](#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content "Direct link to 2. Do not enable Node.js integration for remote content") 

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

This recommendation is the default behavior in Electron since 5.0.0.

It is paramount that you do not enable Node.js integration in any renderer ([`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window), [`WebContentsView`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents-view), or [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag)) that loads remote content. The goal is to limit the powers you grant to remote content, thus making it dramatically more difficult for an attacker to harm your users should they gain the ability to execute JavaScript on your website.

After this, you can grant additional permissions for specific hosts. For example, if you are opening a BrowserWindow pointed at `https://example.com/`, you can give that website exactly the abilities it needs, but no more.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-1 "Direct link to Why?") 

A cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack is more dangerous if an attacker can jump out of the renderer process and execute code on the user\'s computer. Cross-site-scripting attacks are fairly common - and while an issue, their power is usually limited to messing with the website that they are executed on. Disabling Node.js integration helps prevent an XSS from being escalated into a so-called \"Remote Code Execution\" (RCE) attack.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-1 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Bad
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(
})

mainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Good
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(
})

mainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

index.html (Renderer Process)

``` 
<!-- Bad -->
<webview nodeIntegration src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- Good -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

When disabling Node.js integration, you can still expose APIs to your website that do consume Node.js modules or features. Preload scripts continue to have access to `require` and other Node.js features, allowing developers to expose a custom API to remotely loaded content via the [contextBridge API](/docs/latest/api/context-bridge).

### 3. Enable Context Isolation[â€‹](#3-enable-context-isolation "Direct link to 3. Enable Context Isolation") 

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

Context Isolation is the default behavior in Electron since 12.0.0.

Context isolation is an Electron feature that allows developers to run code in preload scripts and in Electron APIs in a dedicated JavaScript context. In practice, that means that global objects like `Array.prototype.push` or `JSON.parse` cannot be modified by scripts running in the renderer process.

Electron uses the same technology as Chromium\'s [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment) to enable this behavior.

Even when `nodeIntegration: false` is used, to truly enforce strong isolation and prevent the use of Node primitives `contextIsolation` **must** also be used.

Beware that *disabling context isolation* for a renderer process by setting `nodeIntegration: true` *also disables process sandboxing* for that process. See section below.

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

For more information on what `contextIsolation` is and how to enable it please see our dedicated [Context Isolation](/docs/latest/tutorial/context-isolation) document.

### 4. Enable process sandboxing[â€‹](#4-enable-process-sandboxing "Direct link to 4. Enable process sandboxing") 

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

This recommendation is the default behavior in Electron since 20.0.0.

Additionally, process sandboxing can be enforced for all renderer processes application wide: [Enabling the sandbox globally](/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox#enabling-the-sandbox-globally)

*Disabling context isolation* (see above) *also disables process sandboxing*, regardless of the default, `sandbox: false` or globally enabled sandboxing!

[Sandboxing](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/design/sandbox.md) is a Chromium feature that uses the operating system to significantly limit what renderer processes have access to. You should enable the sandbox in all renderers. Loading, reading or processing any untrusted content in an unsandboxed process, including the main process, is not advised.

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

For more information on what Process Sandboxing is and how to enable it please see our dedicated [Process Sandboxing](/docs/latest/tutorial/sandbox) document.

### 5. Handle session permission requests from remote content[â€‹](#5-handle-session-permission-requests-from-remote-content "Direct link to 5. Handle session permission requests from remote content") 

You may have seen permission requests while using Chrome: they pop up whenever the website attempts to use a feature that the user has to manually approve ( like notifications).

The API is based on the [Chromium permissions API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permissions) and implements the same types of permissions.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-2 "Direct link to Why?") 

By default, Electron will automatically approve all permission requests unless the developer has manually configured a custom handler. While a solid default, security-conscious developers might want to assume the very opposite.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-2 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const  = require('node:url')

session
  .fromPartition('some-partition')
  .setPermissionRequestHandler((webContents, permission, callback) => 

    // Verify URL
    if (parsedUrl.protocol !== 'https:' || parsedUrl.host !== 'example.com') 
  })
```

### 6. Do not disable `webSecurity`[â€‹](#6-do-not-disable-websecurity "Direct link to 6-do-not-disable-websecurity") 

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

This recommendation is Electron\'s default.

You may have already guessed that disabling the `webSecurity` property on a renderer process ([`BrowserWindow`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window), [`WebContentsView`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents-view), or [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag)) disables crucial security features.

Do not disable `webSecurity` in production applications.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-3 "Direct link to Why?") 

Disabling `webSecurity` will disable the same-origin policy and set `allowRunningInsecureContent` property to `true`. In other words, it allows the execution of insecure code from different domains.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-3 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Bad
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(
})
```

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Good
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()
```

index.html (Renderer Process)

``` 
<!-- Bad -->
<webview disablewebsecurity src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- Good -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

### 7. Define a Content Security Policy[â€‹](#7-define-a-content-security-policy "Direct link to 7. Define a Content Security Policy") 

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an additional layer of protection against cross-site-scripting attacks and data injection attacks. We recommend that they be enabled by any website you load inside Electron.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-4 "Direct link to Why?") 

CSP allows the server serving content to restrict and control the resources Electron can load for that given web page. `https://example.com` should be allowed to load scripts from the origins you defined while scripts from `https://evil.attacker.com` should not be allowed to run. Defining a CSP is an easy way to improve your application\'s security.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-4 "Direct link to How?") 

The following CSP will allow Electron to execute scripts from the current website and from `apis.example.com`.

``` 
// Bad
Content-Security-Policy: '*'

// Good
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
```

#### CSP HTTP headers[â€‹](#csp-http-headers "Direct link to CSP HTTP headers") 

Electron respects the [`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) which can be set using Electron\'s [`webRequest.onHeadersReceived`](/docs/latest/api/web-request#webrequestonheadersreceivedfilter-listener) handler:

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
const  = require('electron')

session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => 
  })
})
```

#### CSP meta tag[â€‹](#csp-meta-tag "Direct link to CSP meta tag") 

CSP\'s preferred delivery mechanism is an HTTP header. However, it is not possible to use this method when loading a resource using the `file://` protocol. It can be useful in some cases to set a policy on a page directly in the markup using a `<meta>` tag:

index.html (Renderer Process)

``` 
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'">
```

### 8. Do not enable `allowRunningInsecureContent`[â€‹](#8-do-not-enable-allowrunninginsecurecontent "Direct link to 8-do-not-enable-allowrunninginsecurecontent") 

[![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Ym94PSIwIDAgMTQgMTYiPjxwYXRoIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0iZXZlbm9kZCIgZD0iTTcgMi4zYzMuMTQgMCA1LjcgMi41NiA1LjcgNS43cy0yLjU2IDUuNy01LjcgNS43QTUuNzEgNS43MSAwIDAgMSAxLjMgOGMwLTMuMTQgMi41Ni01LjcgNS43LTUuN3pNNyAxQzMuMTQgMSAwIDQuMTQgMCA4czMuMTQgNyA3IDcgNy0zLjE0IDctNy0zLjE0LTctNy03em0xIDNINnY1aDJWNHptMCA2SDZ2Mmgydi0yeiIgLz48L3N2Zz4=)]info

This recommendation is Electron\'s default.

By default, Electron will not allow websites loaded over `HTTPS` to load and execute scripts, CSS, or plugins from insecure sources (`HTTP`). Setting the property `allowRunningInsecureContent` to `true` disables that protection.

Loading the initial HTML of a website over `HTTPS` and attempting to load subsequent resources via `HTTP` is also known as \"mixed content\".

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-5 "Direct link to Why?") 

Loading content over `HTTPS` assures the authenticity and integrity of the loaded resources while encrypting the traffic itself. See the section on [only displaying secure content](#1-only-load-secure-content) for more details.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-5 "Direct link to How?")

This recommendation is Electron\'s default.

Advanced users of Electron can enable experimental Chromium features using the `experimentalFeatures` property.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-6 "Direct link to Why?") 

Experimental features are, as the name suggests, experimental and have not been enabled for all Chromium users. Furthermore, their impact on Electron as a whole has likely not been tested.

Legitimate use cases exist, but unless you know what you are doing, you should not enable this property.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-6 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Bad
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow(
})

main.js (Main Process)

```

This recommendation is Electron\'s default.

Blink is the name of the rendering engine behind Chromium. As with `experimentalFeatures`, the `enableBlinkFeatures` property allows developers to enable features that have been disabled by default.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-7 "Direct link to Why?") 

Generally speaking, there are likely good reasons if a feature was not enabled by default. Legitimate use cases for enabling specific features exist. As a developer, you should know exactly why you need to enable a feature, what the ramifications are, and how it impacts the security of your application. Under no circumstances should you enable features speculatively.

### 11. Do not use `allowpopups` for WebViews[â€‹](#11-do-not-use-allowpopups-for-webviews "Direct link to 11-do-not-use-allowpopups-for-webviews")

This recommendation is Electron\'s default.

If you are using [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag), you might need the pages and scripts loaded in your `<webview>` tag to open new windows. The `allowpopups` attribute enables them to create new [`BrowserWindows`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window) using the `window.open()` method. `<webview>` tags are otherwise not allowed to create new windows.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-8 "Direct link to Why?") 

If you do not need popups, you are better off not allowing the creation of new [`BrowserWindows`](/docs/latest/api/browser-window) by default. This follows the principle of minimally required access: Don\'t let a website create new popups unless you know it needs that feature.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-8 "Direct link to How?") 

index.html (Renderer Process)

``` 
<!-- Bad -->
<webview allowpopups src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- Good -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

### 12. Verify WebView options before creation[â€‹](#12-verify-webview-options-before-creation "Direct link to 12. Verify WebView options before creation") 

A WebView created in a renderer process that does not have Node.js integration enabled will not be able to enable integration itself. However, a WebView will always create an independent renderer process with its own `webPreferences`.

It is a good idea to control the creation of new [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) tags from the main process and to verify that their webPreferences do not disable security features.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-9 "Direct link to Why?") 

Since `<webview>` live in the DOM, they can be created by a script running on your website even if Node.js integration is otherwise disabled.

Electron enables developers to disable various security features that control a renderer process. In most cases, developers do not need to disable any of those features - and you should therefore not allow different configurations for newly created [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) tags.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-9 "Direct link to How?") 

Before a [`<webview>`](/docs/latest/api/webview-tag) tag is attached, Electron will fire the `will-attach-webview` event on the hosting `webContents`. Use the event to prevent the creation of `webViews` with possibly insecure options.

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => 
  })
})
```

Again, this list merely minimizes the risk, but does not remove it. If your goal is to display a website, a browser will be a more secure option.

### 13. Disable or limit navigation[â€‹](#13-disable-or-limit-navigation "Direct link to 13. Disable or limit navigation") 

If your app has no need to navigate or only needs to navigate to known pages, it is a good idea to limit navigation outright to that known scope, disallowing any other kinds of navigation.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-10 "Direct link to Why?") 

Navigation is a common attack vector. If an attacker can convince your app to navigate away from its current page, they can possibly force your app to open web sites on the Internet. Even if your `webContents` are configured to be more secure (like having `nodeIntegration` disabled or `contextIsolation` enabled), getting your app to open a random web site will make the work of exploiting your app a lot easier.

A common attack pattern is that the attacker convinces your app\'s users to interact with the app in such a way that it navigates to one of the attacker\'s pages. This is usually done via links, plugins, or other user-generated content.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-10 "Direct link to How?") 

If your app has no need for navigation, you can call `event.preventDefault()` in a [`will-navigate`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-will-navigate) handler. If you know which pages your app might navigate to, check the URL in the event handler and only let navigation occur if it matches the URLs you\'re expecting.

We recommend that you use Node\'s parser for URLs. Simple string comparisons can sometimes be fooled - a `startsWith('https://example.com')` test would let `https://example.com.attacker.com` through.

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
const  = require('electron')

const  = require('node:url')

app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => 
  })
})
```

### 14. Disable or limit creation of new windows[â€‹](#14-disable-or-limit-creation-of-new-windows "Direct link to 14. Disable or limit creation of new windows") 

If you have a known set of windows, it\'s a good idea to limit the creation of additional windows in your app.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-11 "Direct link to Why?") 

Much like navigation, the creation of new `webContents` is a common attack vector. Attackers attempt to convince your app to create new windows, frames, or other renderer processes with more privileges than they had before; or with pages opened that they couldn\'t open before.

If you have no need to create windows in addition to the ones you know you\'ll need to create, disabling the creation buys you a little bit of extra security at no cost. This is commonly the case for apps that open one `BrowserWindow` and do not need to open an arbitrary number of additional windows at runtime.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-11 "Direct link to How?") 

[`webContents`](/docs/latest/api/web-contents) will delegate to its [window open handler](/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentssetwindowopenhandlerhandler) before creating new windows. The handler will receive, amongst other parameters, the `url` the window was requested to open and the options used to create it. We recommend that you register a handler to monitor the creation of windows, and deny any unexpected window creation.

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
const  = require('electron')

app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => ) => )
    }

    return 
  })
})
```

### 15. Do not use `shell.openExternal` with untrusted content[â€‹](#15-do-not-use-shellopenexternal-with-untrusted-content "Direct link to 15-do-not-use-shellopenexternal-with-untrusted-content") 

The shell module\'s [`openExternal`](/docs/latest/api/shell#shellopenexternalurl-options) API allows opening a given protocol URI with the desktop\'s native utilities. On macOS, for instance, this function is similar to the `open` terminal command utility and will open the specific application based on the URI and filetype association.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-12 "Direct link to Why?") 

Improper use of [`openExternal`](/docs/latest/api/shell#shellopenexternalurl-options) can be leveraged to compromise the user\'s host. When openExternal is used with untrusted content, it can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-12 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
//  Bad
const  = require('electron')

shell.openExternal(USER_CONTROLLED_DATA_HERE)
```

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
//  Good
const  = require('electron')

shell.openExternal('https://example.com/index.html')
```

### 16. Use a current version of Electron[â€‹](#16-use-a-current-version-of-electron "Direct link to 16. Use a current version of Electron") 

You should strive for always using the latest available version of Electron. Whenever a new major version is released, you should attempt to update your app as quickly as possible.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-13 "Direct link to Why?") 

An application built with an older version of Electron, Chromium, and Node.js is an easier target than an application that is using more recent versions of those components. Generally speaking, security issues and exploits for older versions of Chromium and Node.js are more widely available.

Both Chromium and Node.js are impressive feats of engineering built by thousands of talented developers. Given their popularity, their security is carefully tested and analyzed by equally skilled security researchers. Many of those researchers [disclose vulnerabilities responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), which generally means that researchers will give Chromium and Node.js some time to fix issues before publishing them. Your application will be more secure if it is running a recent version of Electron (and thus, Chromium and Node.js) for which potential security issues are not as widely known.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-13 "Direct link to How?") 

Migrate your app one major version at a time, while referring to Electron\'s [Breaking Changes](/docs/latest/breaking-changes) document to see if any code needs to be updated.

### 17. Validate the `sender` of all IPC messages[â€‹](#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages "Direct link to 17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages") 

You should always validate incoming IPC messages `sender` property to ensure you aren\'t performing actions or sending information to untrusted renderers.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-14 "Direct link to Why?") 

All Web Frames can in theory send IPC messages to the main process, including iframes and child windows in some scenarios. If you have an IPC message that returns user data to the sender via `event.reply` or performs privileged actions that the renderer can\'t natively, you should ensure you aren\'t listening to third party web frames.

You should be validating the `sender` of **all** IPC messages by default.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-14 "Direct link to How?") 

main.js (Main Process)

``` 
// Bad
ipcMain.handle('get-secrets', () => )

// Good
ipcMain.handle('get-secrets', (e) => )

function validateSender (frame) 
```

### 18. Avoid usage of the `file://` protocol and prefer usage of custom protocols[â€‹](#18-avoid-usage-of-the-file-protocol-and-prefer-usage-of-custom-protocols "Direct link to 18-avoid-usage-of-the-file-protocol-and-prefer-usage-of-custom-protocols") 

You should serve local pages from a custom protocol instead of the `file://` protocol.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-15 "Direct link to Why?") 

The `file://` protocol gets more privileges in Electron than in a web browser and even in browsers it is treated differently to http/https URLs. Using a custom protocol allows you to be more aligned with classic web url behavior while retaining even more control about what can be loaded and when.

Pages running on `file://` have unilateral access to every file on your machine meaning that XSS issues can be used to load arbitrary files from the users machine. Using a custom protocol prevents issues like this as you can limit the protocol to only serving a specific set of files.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-15 "Direct link to How?") 

Follow the [`protocol.handle`](/docs/latest/api/protocol#protocolhandlescheme-handler) examples to learn how to serve files / content from a custom protocol.

### 19. Check which fuses you can change[â€‹](#19-check-which-fuses-you-can-change "Direct link to 19. Check which fuses you can change") 

Electron ships with a number of options that can be useful but a large portion of applications probably don\'t need. In order to avoid having to build your own version of Electron, these can be turned off or on using [Fuses](/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses).

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-16 "Direct link to Why?") 

Some fuses, like `runAsNode` and `nodeCliInspect`, allow the application to behave differently when run from the command line using specific environment variables or CLI arguments. These can be used to execute commands on the device through your application.

This can let external scripts run commands that they potentially would not be allowed to, but that your application might have the rights for.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-16 "Direct link to How?") 

[`@electron/fuses`](https://npmjs.com/package/@electron/fuses) is a module we made to make flipping these fuses easy. Check out the README of that module for more details on usage and potential error cases, and refer to [How do I flip fuses?](/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses#how-do-i-flip-fuses) in our documentation.

### 20. Do not expose Electron APIs to untrusted web content[â€‹](#20-do-not-expose-electron-apis-to-untrusted-web-content "Direct link to 20. Do not expose Electron APIs to untrusted web content") 

You should not directly expose Electron\'s APIs, especially IPC, to untrusted web content in your preload scripts.

#### Why?[â€‹](#why-17 "Direct link to Why?") 

Exposing raw APIs like `ipcRenderer.on` is dangerous because it gives renderer processes direct access to the entire IPC event system, allowing them to listen for any IPC events, not just the ones intended for them.

To avoid that exposure, we also cannot pass callbacks directly through: The first argument to IPC event callbacks is an `IpcRendererEvent` object, which includes properties like `sender` that provide access to the underlying `ipcRenderer` instance. Even if you only listen for specific events, passing the callback directly means the renderer gets access to this event object.

In short, we want the untrusted web content to only have access to necessary information and APIs.

#### How?[â€‹](#how-17 "Direct link to How?")

// Bad
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', )

// Also bad
