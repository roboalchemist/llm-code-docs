The license you have determines the set of features, customization options, and range of support available in your account. AnyDesk offers the following licenses:

-   [Solo]

-   [Standard]

-   [Ultimate]

### Solo license 

AnyDesk SOLO is a single-user license for self-employed business professionals and IT specialists. It offers a basic feature set for remote work and remote support.

The license includes:

-   Licensed users: 1

-   Simultaneous outgoing connections: 1

-   Licensed devices to start a connection from: 3

-   Devices to connect to ([[[Interactive Access]]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/interactive-access)): unlimited

-   Managed devices ([[[Unattended Access]]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/unattended-access)): up to 100

-   Add-ons available: None

#### **Use case** 

Jack is a self-employed architect who travels often for work. He mainly uses two devices for work: one laptop when he travels, and one desktop computer at his home base. When he travels, he uses AnyDesk on his laptop to make an outgoing connection to remotely access large files on his desktop back home.

Based on Jack\'s requirements, he needs a Solo AnyDesk license.

### Standard license 

AnyDesk STANDARD is the ideal license for small to medium-sized teams and businesses, from IT departments to managed service providers who want to use AnyDesk with a basic set of business features.

The license includes:

-   Licensed users: 20

-   Simultaneous outgoing connections: 1 by default, but up to 19 more can be purchased as an add-on.

-   Devices to connect to ([[Interactive Access]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/interactive-access)): unlimited

-   Managed devices ([[Unattended Access]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/unattended-access)): up to 500

-   Add-ons available: Yes (additional concurrent connections, Address Books, and [Namespace])

#### Use case 

Company A has a team of 20 IT support staff that work in shifts. At any time of the day, only 5 IT support staff are working. Each of these 5 support staff make outgoing connections during their shift at the same time. As part of their company protocol, the IT support staff require these outgoing connections to be screen-recorded.

Based on their team setup, Company A thus needs to purchase a Standard AnyDesk license with 4 add-on concurrent connections.

### Advanced license 

AnyDesk ADVANCED includes the full set of business features. The license is designed for medium-sized businesses and larger teams across all industries for which collaboration is key and multiple concurrent connections is a must.

The license includes:

-   Licensed users: 100

-   Simultaneous outgoing connections: 2 by default, but up to 48 more can be purchased as an add-on.

-   Devices to connect to ([[Interactive Access]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/interactive-access)): unlimited

-   Managed devices ([[Unattended Access]](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/unattended-access)): up to 1,000

-   Add-ons available: Yes (additional concurrent connections, Address Books, and Namespace)

#### Use case 

Company B is a medium-sized business. There are a total of **40 employees** from the IT Support and Design teams who require remote software access.

Throughout the workday, **about 20 of these employees** typically make outgoing connections to remote devices **at the same time**. For example, the IT team may be providing real-time support to clients, while the Design team may be accessing resource-intensive applications hosted externally.

To manage this setup efficiently, the IT Director needs a management console that allows them to **add or remove users**, **assign permissions**, and **monitor software usage** across the company.

Based on their needs, Company B decides to purchase an **Advanced AnyDesk license** with **18 add-on concurrent connections**, which covers their expected peak usage while still allowing access for all 40 employees as needed.

### Ultimate license 

AnyDesk ULTIMATE is a fully customizable license designed for enterprise businesses where scalability and flexibility are a must.
