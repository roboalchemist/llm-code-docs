The Address Book manages your contacts. All clients registered to your license (listed on your [My.AnyDesk](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/customer-portal-my.anydesk.com#clients) customer portal) share the Address Book assuming it has not been disabled via a custom client.

By adding tags to contacts, extensive amounts of entries become manageable by filtering. This feature is available for the premium AnyDesk licenses.

### Android 

To view and manage the Address Book on Android, you need to assign the license key to the AnyDesk application. To do so, please see [AnyDesk for Android](https://support.anydesk.com/knowledge/anydesk-for-android-chromeos#assign-license-key).

After the client has been licensed, you can find the Address Book through the hamburger menu found in the upper left corner of the AnyDesk application.

![AnyDesk Android Menu](https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/7940397/image-png-Nov-04-2021-04-26-03-39-PM.png)

As with the other supported platforms, you can add Address Books and Address Book entries. From there you can also manage the Address Book entries as well as existing tags for those entries.
