User management in **my.anydesk II** allows organization owners and admins to control how users are created, grouped, and granted access to system features. With a structured approach using users, roles, groups, and permission sets, you can ensure efficient administration and secure access control tailored to your organization's needs.

The following sections provide detailed guidance on user management components:

## [Manage users](/v1/docs/users) 

Users are individual accounts within your organization. Admins can invite users manually or create them through an identity provider (IDP). From the user profile, you can view details, assign roles, group memberships, and perform actions like disabling or deleting the user.

Learn more about:

-   Inviting users

-   Viewing and managing user details

-   Disabling or deleting user accounts

## [Manage user roles](/v1/docs/roles) 

Roles determine what users are allowed to do within **my.anydesk II**. Each role is associated with one or more permission sets. You can use default roles or create custom roles to suit your organization\'s specific needs.

Learn how to:

-   Create a custom role

-   Assign permission sets to roles

-   Link users or groups to roles

## [Manage permission sets](/v1/docs/permission-sets) 

Permission sets define access rights to features and pages within **my.anydesk II**. You can set permissions to allow viewing, editing, or no access at all. Once created, a permission set must be assigned to a role.

Topics covered:

-   Creating permission sets

-   Configuring access control levels

-   Managing assignments to roles

## [Manage groups](/v1/docs/groups) 

Groups allow you to manage access collectively. A group can contain multiple users and be assigned one or more roles. Group membership simplifies permissions management by enforcing consistent role assignments.

You can:

-   Create and edit groups

-   Assign roles to groups

-   Add or remove group members

-   Use child groups for more granular access control

By combining these components, **my.anydesk II** provides a flexible and secure framework for managing users and access permissions across your organization.
