## Step 2. Register your license 

After purchasing an AnyDesk license, you must register it in the AnyDesk [Client] to unlock all licensed features.

Licenses are linked to your AnyDesk account. You can register your license either by **signing in to the AnyDesk client** or by **entering your [License Key] manually**.

**Register by signing in to your account**

1.  Open the **AnyDesk** app on your device.

2.  In the upper-right corner, click the user profile icon.

3.  Enter the [my.anydesk II](http://my.anydesk.com/v2) credentials sent to your email or used during account registration.

4.  Click **Sign In**.

Once signed in, your license is activated automatically and you can use the AnyDesk client with all features available in your license.

**Register with license key**

1.  [Sign in to ][[my.anydesk II]](https://my.anydesk.com/v2)[ using the credentials you received to your email. ]

2.  [Navigate to the **License** tab and in the **About** section, copy the license key. ]

3.  Open the AnyDesk app on your device.

4.  In the upper-right corner, click ![image.png](https://cdn.document360.io/b94c9ac2-20ec-4c7e-b325-135b0ed113f9/Images/Documentation/image(102).png) \> **Change License Key\...**.

## Step 3. Set up Unattended Access 

Unattended Access allows you to manage and control remote devices even when no one is physically present at the remote end.

To enable Unattended Access, set up a password on the remote AnyDesk client. You can then use this password to connect from your local device.

To set up Unattended Access:

1.  On the remote device, open **AnyDesk** and go to **Settings** \> **Access.**

2.  In the **Unattended Access** section, click **Set password**.

3.  Create a secure password and click **Apply**.\

2.  On the local device, from which you want to connect to the remote device, enter the **AnyDesk ID** in the **Remote Address** field and click ![](https://7940397.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7940397/image-png-Aug-02-2024-03-13-03-3891-PM.png) or press **Enter**.\

3.  Depending on configuration:

    -   In the **Authorization** pop-up window, enter the **Unattended Access password** that you set up on the remote device in [Step 3](/docs/quick-start-guide#step-3-set-up-unattended-access), or\

    -   Wait for the [Remote User] to manually accept the request.

The session will start, and you\'ll see the [Remote Desktop]. You can now control, transfer files, and interact as needed.
