# Introduction[](#introduction "Link to this heading")

Rich is a Python library for writing *rich* text (with color and style) to the terminal, and for displaying advanced content such as tables, markdown, and syntax highlighted code.

Use Rich to make your command line applications visually appealing and present data in a more readable way. Rich can also be a useful debugging aid by pretty printing and syntax highlighting data structures.

## Requirements[](#requirements "Link to this heading")

Rich works with macOS, Linux and Windows.

On Windows both the (ancient) cmd.exe terminal is supported and the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases). The latter has much improved support for color and style.

Rich requires Python 3.8.0 and above.

Note

PyCharm users will need to enable "emulate terminal" in output console option in run/debug configuration to see styled output.
