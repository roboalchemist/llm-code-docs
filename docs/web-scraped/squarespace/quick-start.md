## Quick Start

The Squarespace Developer Platform enables web developers to access Squarespace template files (as provided to the consumer) and customize those files to create something unique. The advanced developer can go even further and create his or her own custom template from scratch.

*Notice: Use of the Squarespace Developer Platform is subject to our [Developer Terms of Use](https://www.squarespace.com/developer-terms).*

## Choose a Starting Point

First, you can start with one of the consumer level templates created by Squarespace's designers. These templates have loads of style options built-in, allowing you to achieve a high quality design quickly. *If you've already started a Squarespace site and you want to enable Developer Mode, jump to step two.*

[Start With a Consumer Template](https://www.squarespace.com/templates/browse/v7)

**Or** optionally, you can start with the developer Base Template, which features very minimal styles and markup used to create a completely custom template.

[Start With Developer Base Template](https://www.squarespace.com/templates/base-template)

**NOTE:** *Trial sites with Developer Mode enabled do not expire, giving you as much time as you need to build your custom Squarespace site.*

## Enable Developer Mode

Enabling Developer Mode will give you access to a copy of the template repository for your site, allowing you to make changes to the template and add custom code using Git.

*Note: Your site will not receive template updates from Squarespace when Developer Mode is enabled, and you will not be able to switch templates. Additionally, note that using Git will not allow you to run server-side code.*

Before enabling Developer Mode, it's important to note that disabling Developer Mode (or disconnecting GitHub Repository) is an irreversible action. You can expect the following if you disable it in the future:

- Any changes to the template repository including custom collections, new or modified layouts and regions, new or modified scripts and styles, uploaded assets and custom types will be lost.
- All tweaks in the Site Styles panel will revert to their original settings before Developer Mode was enabled.
- All content in block fields such as sidebars, headers and footers will be lost.
- Existing content items based on custom types will still be editable as their base content items but without the custom fields.
- The site's existing navigation structure will revert to the original navigation structure. Pages from the existing navigation structure will be moved to the Not Linked section of the Pages panel.
- Existing custom collections will become uneditable.

If you've decided to move forward with turning on Developer Mode, in the Site Manager, navigate to **Settings -> Developer Tools -> Developer Mode**. At the top right corner of the settings panel, there is a toggle that is set to off. Click the toggle to turn on Developer Mode.

For new Developer Mode sites, the steps to connect to Git are:

- Click Connect to GitHub
- Authorize connection
- Name repository

To migrate an existing site to GitHub you will click a link in the banner of the Developer Mode panel and follow the same steps

*Contact [Customer Care](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/requests/new) for help and troubleshooting Git connection.*
