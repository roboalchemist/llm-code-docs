## Focus on building your site. We'll take care of the rest.

Build your site using the tools we use to create Squarespace templates. With the Squarespace Developer Platform, your site will be backed by the same infrastructure that powers millions of Squarespace websites.

## Full Code Control

Change anything from the doctype to the footer. With Developer Mode enabled, you have access to all the template files that make up your Squarespace website.

## Local Development

Use the Squarespace Development Server to develop your site locally while working with your preferred native build tools.

## Git Built-in

All Squarespace template repositories are exposed via Git automatically, so you can work with a team and easily roll back.

## JSON Data Store

Query any page as JSON to access your site's data in a structured way. Your website content is an API.

## JSON-Template

Our familiar template language has very few language constructs to learn, yet offers the power and expressiveness needed to implement any design.

## Infrastructure

Whether you have 10 or 10,000 visitors a day, your site will remain online. We host Squarespace.com on the same servers, so we're in this together.

## Content Delivery Network

Our built-in CDN reduces load times using geographically distributed servers. Your assets will be delivered quickly to any place on Earth.

## Site Manager

Manage your client's content using the same robust backend that powers millions of sites on our consumer platform.
