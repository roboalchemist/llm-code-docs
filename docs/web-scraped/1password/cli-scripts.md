# Example scripts

The 1Password Solutions team manages [a repository of example 1Password CLI scripts](https://github.com/1Password/solutions) that you can use as inspiration for your own projects.

You\'ll need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a command-line JSON processor, for the example scripts to work correctly.

You can find demo scripts to help you:

- [Migrate from another password solution](https://github.com/1Password/solutions/tree/main/1password/migration)
- [Provision new users from a CSV](https://github.com/1Password/solutions/tree/main/1password/scripted-provisioning)
