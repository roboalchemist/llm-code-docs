# 1Password Events API

The 1Password Events API allows you to retrieve information about activity in your 1Password Business account and send it to your security information and event management (SIEM) system. With the Events API, you can keep track of:

- Actions team members take in the account, such as changes to vaults, groups, users, and more.
- How and when items in shared vaults are used, like when an item is viewed, copied, or edited.
- Attempts to sign in to the 1Password account, including when and where a user signed in to the account, and detailed information about failed sign in attempts.

## Quick start[â€‹](#quick-start "Direct link to Quick start")
