# Mac Automation Scripting Guide: Running a Script

## Running a Script
Scripts can be opened and run in Script Editor and script applications can be run outside of Script Editor like any other OSÂ X application. Some apps and tools, such as Automator and the systemwide script menu, can also run scripts.

### Running a Script in Script Editor
To run a script in Script Editor, click the Run button () in the toolbar, press Command-R, or choose Script > Run, as shown inFigure 8-1.
As the script runs, the Accessory View pane shows events and results of the script. This information can be useful for troubleshooting. SeeViewing Script Events and Results.

### Running a Script Application
To run a script application, double-click the script in the Finder, just like you would do to launch any other application. The script opens and begins running.
Note
When running a script app outside of Script Editor, you canât view a list of the scriptâs events and results. To monitor this activity, open the app in Script Editor instead, run it, and check the Accessory View pane.
