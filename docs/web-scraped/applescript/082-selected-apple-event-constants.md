This appendix describes some commonly used Apple event constants. For more complete documentation, seeApple Event Manager Reference.

## Event ID Constants for Apple Events Sent by the Mac OS
Table B-2shows event IDs for various Apple events that may be sent to your application by the Mac OS. For more information, seeHandling Apple Events Sent by the Mac OS. These events are sometimes referred to as the ârequiredâ events, and have the event class value'aevt', defined by the constantkCoreEventClass.  For related information, seeEvent Class and Event ID.

## Event ID Constants for Standard AppleScript Commands
Table B-3shows event IDs for Apple events that represent various standard AppleScript commands. Each scriptable application should support as many of these commands as make sense for that particular application. These events are sometimes referred to as "standard" or "core" events, and have the event class value'core', defined by the constantkAECoreSuite. For related information, seeEvent Class and Event ID.
Event ID

kAEClose
'clos'

kAECreateElement
'crel'
Create a new object.

kAEDoObjectsExist
'doex'
Return a boolean value indicating whether the specified object or objects exist.
kAEGetData

Return the specified data from an object or set of objects.
kAEMove
'move'

kAESave
'save'
Save an object or objects, often consisting of windows or documents.
kAESetData
'setd'
Set the data of an object or objects.

## Descriptor Type Constants
In a descriptor, thedescriptorTypestructure member stores a value that is a four-character code.Table B-4lists constants for some of the main descriptor types, along with their four-character code values and a description of the kinds of data they identify. For a complete list of the basic descriptor types, seeApple Event Manager Reference.
Descriptor type
Value
Description of data
typeBoolean
'bool'
1-byte Boolean value
typeSInt32
'long'
32-bit integer
typeUTF8Text
'utf8'
Unicode text (UTF-8 encoding)
typeUTF16ExternalRepresentation
'ut16'
Unicode text (UTF-16 encoding)
typeSInt16
'shor'
16-bit integer
typeAEList
'list'
List of descriptors
typeAERecord
'reco'
List of keyword-specified descriptors
typeAppleEvent
'aevt'
Apple event
typeEnumerated
'enum'
Enumerated data
typeType
'type'
Four-character code
typeFSRef
'fsrf'
File-system reference
typeNull
'null'
Nonexistent data

## Address Descriptor Type Constants
The descriptor type in an address descriptor can be specified by one of the type constants shown inTable B-5(or by any type you define for which you provide a coercion to one of these types):
Descriptor type
Value
Description
typeApplSignature
'sign'
Application signature
typeTargetID
'targ'
Deprecated; do not use in Mac OS X
typeProcessSerialNumber
'psn '
Process serial number

typeApplicationURL
'aprl'
Application URL, possibly for a remote application (Mac OS X version 10.1 and later)
typeMachPort
'port'
Mach port.
For information on how to create a target descriptor, seeSpecifying a Target Address.

## Attribute Keyword Constants
Your application cannot examine the attributes and parameters of an assembled Apple event directly. Instead, it calls Apple Event Manager functions to request an attribute or parameter by keyword. Keywords are arbitrary values used to keep track of various descriptors.
See âKeyword Parameter Constantsâ inApple Event Manager Referencefor descriptions of keyword constants for additional Apple event parameters.
Table B-6lists keyword constants for Apple event attributes:
Attribute keyword
Value
Description
keyAddressAttr
'addr'
Address of target or client application
keyEventClassAttr
'evcl'
Event class of Apple event
keyEventIDAttr
'evid'
Event ID of Apple event
keyEventSourceAttr
'esrc'
Nature of the source application
keyInteractLevelAttr
'inte'
Settings for whether to allow bringing a server application to the foreground, if necessary, to interact with the user
keyOriginalAddressAttr
'from'
Address of original source of Apple event if the event has been forwarded
keyReturnIDAttr
'rtid'
Return ID for reply Apple event
keyTimeoutAttr
'timo'
Length of time, in ticks, that the client will wait for a reply or a result from the server
keyTransactionIDAttr
'tran'
Transaction ID identifying a series of Apple events

## Parameter Keyword Constants
Table B-7lists keyword constants for commonly used Apple event parameters:
Parameter keyword
Value
Description
keyDirectObject
'----'
Direct parameter
keyErrorNumber
'errn'
Error number parameter (used only in reply events)
keyErrorString
'errs'
Error string parameter (used only in reply events)
keyProcessSerialNumber
'psn '
Process serial number
keyPreDispatch
'phac'
Dispatch event to predispatch handler
keyAEVersion
'vers'
AppleScript version
See âKeyword Parameter Constantsâ inApple Event Manager Referencefor descriptions of keyword constants for additional Apple event parameters.

## Event Source Constants
You use the constants inTable B-8to check the value of thekeyEventSourceAttrattribute, which specifies the source of an Apple event.Listing 4-3shows how to obtain that attribute from an Apple event.
Constant
Meaning
kAEUnknownSource
Source of Apple event unknown
kAEDirectCall
A direct call that bypassed the PPC Toolbox
kAESameProcess
Target application is also the source application
kAELocalProcess
Source application is another process on the same computer as the target application
kAERemoteProcess
Source application is a process on a remote computer on the network

## Send Mode Constants for the AESend Function
When you send an Apple event withAESend, you use one of the constants inTable B-9in thesendModeparameter to specify how to deal with replies.
Flag
Description
kAENoReply
Your application does not want a reply Apple event.
kAEQueueReply
Your application wants a reply Apple event; the reply appears in your event queue as soon as the server has the opportunity to process and respond to your Apple event.
kAEWaitReply
Your application wants a reply Apple event and is willing to give up the processor while waiting for the reply; for example, if the server application is on the same computer as your application, your application yields the processor to allow the server to respond to your Apple event.
