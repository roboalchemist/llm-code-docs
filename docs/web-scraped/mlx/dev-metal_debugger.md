# Metal Debugger[\#](#metal-debugger "Link to this heading")

Profiling is a key step for performance optimization. You can build MLX with the [`MLX_METAL_DEBUG`] option to improve the Metal debugging and optimization workflow. The [`MLX_METAL_DEBUG`] debug option:

- Records source during Metal compilation, for later inspection while debugging.

- Labels Metal objects such as command queues, improving capture readability.

To build with debugging enabled in Python prepend [`CMAKE_ARGS="-DMLX_METAL_DEBUG=ON"`] to the build call.

The [[`metal.start_capture()`]](../python/_autosummary/mlx.core.metal.start_capture.html#mlx.core.metal.start_capture "mlx.core.metal.start_capture") function initiates a capture of all MLX GPU work.

Note

To capture a GPU trace you must run the application with [`MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1`].

    import mlx.core as mx

    a = mx.random.uniform(shape=(512, 512))
    b = mx.random.uniform(shape=(512, 512))
    mx.eval(a, b)

    trace_file = "mlx_trace.gputrace"

    # Make sure to run with MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1 and
    # that the path trace_file does not already exist.
    mx.metal.start_capture(trace_file)

    for _ in range(10):
      mx.eval(mx.add(a, b))

    mx.metal.stop_capture()

You can open and replay the GPU trace in Xcode. The [`Dependencies`] view has a great overview of all operations. Checkout the [Metal debugger documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/metal-debugger) for more information.

## Xcode Workflow[\#](#xcode-workflow "Link to this heading")

You can skip saving to a path by running within Xcode. First, generate an Xcode project using CMake.

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DMLX_METAL_DEBUG=ON -G Xcode
    open mlx.xcodeproj

Select the [`metal_capture`] example schema and run.
