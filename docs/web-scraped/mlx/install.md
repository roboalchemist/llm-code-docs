# Build and Install[\#](#build-and-install "Link to this heading")

## Python Installation[\#](#python-installation "Link to this heading")

MLX is available on PyPI. All you have to do to use MLX with your own Apple silicon computer is

    pip install mlx

To install from PyPI your system must meet the following requirements:

- Using an M series chip (Apple silicon)

- Using a native Python \>= 3.10

- macOS \>= 14.0

Note

MLX is only available on devices running macOS \>= 14.0 and higher.

### CUDA[\#](#cuda "Link to this heading")

MLX has a CUDA backend which you can install with:

    pip install mlx[cuda12]

To install the CUDA package from PyPi your system must meet the following requirements:

- Nvidia architecture \>= SM 7.5

- Nvidia driver \>= 550.54.14

- CUDA toolkit \>= 12.0

- Linux distribution with glibc \>= 2.35

- Python \>= 3.10

For CUDA 13 use [`pip`]` `[`install`]` `[`mlx[cuda13]`]. The CUDA 13 package requires an Nvidia driver \>= 580 or an appropriate CUDA compatibility package.

### CPU-only (Linux)[\#](#cpu-only-linux "Link to this heading")

For a CPU-only version of MLX that runs on Linux use:

    pip install mlx[cpu]

To install the CPU-only package from PyPi your system must meet the following requirements:

- Linux distribution with glibc \>= 2.35

- Python \>= 3.10

### Troubleshooting[\#](#troubleshooting "Link to this heading")

*My OS and Python versions are in the required range but pip still does not find a matching distribution.*

Probably you are using a non-native Python. The output of

    python -c "import platform; print(platform.processor())"

should be [`arm`]. If it is [`i386`] (and you have M series machine) then you are using a non-native Python. Switch your Python to a native Python. A good way to do this is with [Conda](https://stackoverflow.com/q/65415996).

## Build from source[\#](#build-from-source "Link to this heading")

### Build Requirements[\#](#build-requirements "Link to this heading")

- A C++ compiler with C++17 support (e.g. Clang \>= 5.0)

- [cmake](https://cmake.org/) -- version 3.25 or later, and [`make`]

- Xcode \>= 15.0 and macOS SDK \>= 14.0

Note

Ensure your shell environment is native [`arm`], not [`x86`] via Rosetta. If the output of [`uname`]` `[`-p`] is [`x86`], see the [[troubleshooting section]](#build-shell) below.

### Python API[\#](#python-api "Link to this heading")

To build and install the MLX python library from source, first, clone MLX from [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx):

    git clone git@github.com:ml-explore/mlx.git mlx && cd mlx

Then simply build and install MLX using pip:

    pip install .

For developing, install the package with development dependencies, and use an editable install:

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

Once the development dependencies are installed, you can build faster with:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Run the tests with:

    python -m unittest discover python/tests

Optional: Install stubs to enable auto completions and type checking from your IDE:

    python setup.py generate_stubs

### C++ API[\#](#c-api "Link to this heading")

Currently, MLX must be built and installed from source.

Similarly to the python library, to build and install the MLX C++ library start by cloning MLX from [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx):

    git clone git@github.com:ml-explore/mlx.git mlx && cd mlx

Create a build directory and run CMake and make:

    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake .. && make -j

Run tests with:

    make test

Install with:

    make install

Note that the built [`mlx.metallib`] file should be either at the same directory as the executable statically linked to [`libmlx.a`] or the preprocessor constant [`METAL_PATH`] should be defined at build time and it should point to the path to the built metal library.

: [Build Options][\#](#id5 "Link to this table") 

Note

If you have multiple Xcode installations and wish to use a specific one while building, you can do so by adding the following environment variable before building

    export DEVELOPER_DIR="/path/to/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/"

Further, you can use the following command to find out which macOS SDK will be used

    xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-version

#### Binary Size Minimization[\#](#binary-size-minimization "Link to this heading")

To produce a smaller binary use the CMake flags [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`] and [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`].

The MLX CMake build has several additional options to make smaller binaries. For example, if you don't need the CPU backend or support for safetensors and GGUF, you can do:

    cmake .. \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
      -DMLX_BUILD_CPU=OFF \
      -DMLX_BUILD_SAFETENSORS=OFF \
      -DMLX_BUILD_GGUF=OFF \
      -DMLX_METAL_JIT=ON

THE [`MLX_METAL_JIT`] flag minimizes the size of the MLX Metal library which contains pre-built GPU kernels. This substantially reduces the size of the Metal library by run-time compiling kernels the first time they are used in MLX on a given machine. Note run-time compilation incurs a cold-start cost which can be anwywhere from a few hundred millisecond to a few seconds depending on the application. Once a kernel is compiled, it will be cached by the system. The Metal kernel cache persists across reboots.

### Linux[\#](#linux "Link to this heading")

To build from source on Linux (CPU only), install the BLAS and LAPACK headers. For example on Ubuntu, run the following:

    apt-get update -y
    apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev -y

From here follow the instructions to install either the [[Python]](#python-install) or [[C++]](#cpp-install) APIs.

### CUDA[\#](#id3 "Link to this heading")

To build from source on Linux with CUDA, install the BLAS and LAPACK headers and the CUDA toolkit. For example on Ubuntu, run the following:

    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
    dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
    apt-get update -y
    apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-9
    apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev libcudnn9-dev-cuda-12 -y

When building either the Python or C++ APIs make sure to pass the cmake flag [`MLX_BUILD_CUDA=ON`]. For example, to build the Python API run:

    CMAKE_ARGS="-DMLX_BUILD_CUDA=ON" pip install -e ".[dev]"

To build the C++ package run:

    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake .. -DMLX_BUILD_CUDA=ON && make -j

### Troubleshooting[\#](#id4 "Link to this heading")

#### Metal not found[\#](#metal-not-found "Link to this heading")

You see the following error when you try to build:

    error: unable to find utility "metal", not a developer tool or in PATH

To fix this, first make sure you have Xcode installed:

    xcode-select --install

Then set the active developer directory:

    sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

#### x86 Shell[\#](#x86-shell "Link to this heading")

If the output of [`uname`]` `[`-p`] is [`x86`] then your shell is running as x86 via Rosetta instead of natively.

To fix this, find the application in Finder ([`/Applications`] for iTerm, [`/Applications/Utilities`] for Terminal), right-click, and click "Get Info". Uncheck "Open using Rosetta", close the "Get Info" window, and restart your terminal.

Verify the terminal is now running natively the following command:

    $ uname -p
    arm

Also check that cmake is using the correct architecture:

    $ cmake --system-information | grep CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
    CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR "arm64"

If you see [`"x86_64"`], try re-installing [`cmake`]. If you see [`"arm64"`] but the build errors out with "Building for x86_64 on macOS is not supported." wipe your build cache with [`rm`]` `[`-rf`]` `[`build/`] and try again.
