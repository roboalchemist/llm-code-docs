# Organizations and Projects

An **organization** is the top-level administrative entity in a Voyage account, with each account starting with a default organization. Billing, budget limits, and data controls are managed at the organization level. Rate limits and API keys are also managed at this level but can be further constrained within **projects**, which are sub-groupings of resources and settings often tied to a specific team or use case. An organization can contain multiple projects.

This guide will show you how to manage your organization and projects. All walkthroughs in this guide are done in the Voyage [dashboard](https://dash.voyageai.com/).

#  

What are the different user roles within organizations and projects, and what permissions do they entail?

[](#what-are-the-different-user-roles-within-organizations-and-projects-and-what-permissions-do-they-entail)

Organizations have two roles: **Admin** and **Member**. Admins have full control of and access to their organizations, while Members have more limited permissions. Admins can create and manage projects, invite members, and assign roles. They are also automatically included in all projects within their organization.

Within projects, Admins can designate members as project **Owners**, who have full control and access within their projects. A summary of these roles is provided in the table below.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Role                    Scope                      Description

Can I belong to multiple organizations?

[](#can-i-belong-to-multiple-organizations)

Yes, you can belong to multiple organizations. An admin from an organization must invite you. To switch between organizations, hover over your organization's name in the top-left of the dashboard and select the organization from the list.

[[![Switch Organization](https://files.readme.io/302a75c78eaeafab5e86eecdc7ae1ef5c95ca5f2039c49d011eff43aacdf5094-switch-organization.png)]]

How do I create a project?

You can create projects in two ways.

1.  **Project selector.** Hover on the project name in the upper left-corner of the page and select **Add project**.

[[![Project Selector](https://files.readme.io/b6126080ef7f9434f324751b3410b994994a6ba7a41f5bab419544e39845b4eb-project-selector.png)]]

2.  **Manage projects**. Navigate to the [**Manage Projects**](https://dashboard.voyageai.com/organization/projects) section under **Organization**. Click on the **Create** button in the upper right-corner of the page.

[[![Manage Projects](https://files.readme.io/a32c03276e15bf07b31ce7894c41420448ed7c2eee1a672bb62eca87cf26faf7-manage-projects.png)]]

Both options will launch a **Create a new project** modal. Provide a name and click the **Create** button.
