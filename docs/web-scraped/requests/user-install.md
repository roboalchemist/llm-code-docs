# Installation of Requests¶

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Requests. The first
step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.

## $ python -m pip install requests¶

To install Requests, simply run this simple command in your terminal of
choice:

    
    
    $ python -m pip install requests
    

## Get the Source Code¶

Requests is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is [always
available](https://github.com/psf/requests).

You can either clone the public repository:

    
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/psf/requests.git
    

Or, download the [tarball](https://github.com/psf/requests/tarball/main):

    
    
    $ curl -OL https://github.com/psf/requests/tarball/main
    # optionally, zipball is also available (for Windows users).
    

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

    
    
    $ cd requests
    $ python -m pip install .
    

Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human
beings. You are currently looking at the documentation of the development
release.
