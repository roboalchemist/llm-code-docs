What is Function Calling?[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#what-is-function-calling "Link to this heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Function calling refers to the ability of LLMs to:

*   Recognize when a specific function or tool needs to be used to answer a query or perform a task.

*   Generate a structured output containing the necessary arguments to call that function.

*   Integrate the results of the function call into its response.

Function calling is a powerful mechanism that allows LLMs to perform more complex tasks (e.g. agent orchestration in multi-agent systems) that require specific computations or data retrieval beyond their inherent knowledge. By recognizing when a particular function is needed, LLMs can dynamically extend their functionality, making them more versatile and useful in real-world applications.

Tutorial Overview[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#tutorial-overview "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates function calling using the [Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B) model, which is pre-fine-tuned for this capability. We’ll create a basic stock reporting agent that provides up-to-date stock information and summarizes recent company news.

### Prerequisite: Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#prerequisite-hermes-2-pro-llama-3-8b "Link to this heading")

Before proceeding, please make sure that you’ve successfully deployed [Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B.](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B) model with Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM backend following [these steps.](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Popular_Models_Guide/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B/README.html)

> [!IMPORTANT] Make sure that the `tutorials` folder is mounted to `/tutorials`, when you start the docker container.

Function Definitions[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#function-definitions "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll define three functions for our stock reporting agent:

1.   `get_current_stock_price`: Retrieves the current stock price for a given symbol.

2.   `get_company_news`: Retrieves company news and press releases for a given stock symbol.

3.   `final_answer`: Used as a no-op and to indicate the final response.

Each function includes its name, description, and input parameter schema:

TOOLS = [
   {
       "type": "function",
       "function": {
           "name": "get_current_stock_price",
           "description": "Get the current stock price for a given symbol.\n\nArgs:\n symbol (str): The stock symbol.\n\nReturns:\n float: The current stock price, or None if an error occurs.",
           "parameters": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {"symbol": {"type": "string"}},
               "required": ["symbol"],
           },
       },
   },
   {
       "type": "function",
       "function": {
           "name": "get_company_news",
           "description": "Get company news and press releases for a given stock symbol.\n\nArgs:\nsymbol (str): The stock symbol.\n\nReturns:\npd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing company news and press releases.",
           "parameters": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {"symbol": {"type": "string"}},
               "required": ["symbol"],
           },
       },
   },
   {
       "type": "function",
       "function": {
           "name": "final_answer",
           "description": "Return final generated answer",
           "parameters": {
               "type": "object",
               "properties": {"final_response": {"type": "string"}},
               "required": ["final_response"],
           },
       },
   },
]

These function definitions will be passed to our model through a prompt, enabling it to recognize and utilize them appropriately during the conversation.

Prompt Engineering[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#prompt-engineering "Link to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prompt engineering** is a crucial aspect of function calling, as it guides the LLM in recognizing when and how to utilize specific functions. By carefully crafting prompts, you can effectively define the LLM’s role, objectives, and the tools it can access, ensuring accurate and efficient task execution.

For our task, we’ve organized a sample prompt structure, provided in the accompanying [`system_prompt_schema.yml`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/system_prompt_schema.yml) file. This file meticulously outlines:

*   **Role**: Defines the specific role the LLM is expected to perform.

*   **Objective**: Clearly states the goal or desired outcome of the interaction.

*   **Tools**: Lists the available functions or tools the LLM can use to achieve its objective.

*   **Schema**: Specifies the structure and format required for calling each tool or function.

*   **Instructions**: Provides a clear set of guidelines to ensure the LLM follows the intended path and utilizes the tools appropriately.

By leveraging prompt engineering, you can enhance the LLM’s ability to perform complex tasks and integrate function calls seamlessly into its responses, thereby maximizing its utility in various applications.

Combining Everything Together[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#combining-everything-together "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, let’s start Triton SDK container:

# Using the SDK container as an example
docker run --rm -it --net host --shm-size=2g \
 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --gpus all \
 -v /path/to/tutorials/:/tutorials \
 -v /path/to/tutorials/repo:/tutorials \
 nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:<xx.yy>-py3-sdk

The provided client script uses `pydantic` and `yfinance` libraries, which we do not ship with the sdk container. Make sure to install it, before proceeding:

pip install pydantic yfinance

Run the provided [`client.py`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client.py) as follows:

python3 /tutorials/AI_Agents_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client.py --prompt "Tell me about Rivian. Include current stock price in your final response." -o 200

You should expect to see a response similar to:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
RESPONSE: Rivian, with its current stock price of <CURRENT STOCK PRICE>, <NEWS SUMMARY>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see what tools were “called” by our LLM, simply add `verbose` flag as follows:

python3 /tutorials/AI_Agents_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client.py --prompt "Tell me about Rivian. Include current stock price in your final response." -o 200 --verbose

This will show the step-by-step process of function calling, including:

*   The tools being called

*   The arguments passed to each tool

*   The responses from each function call

*   The final summarized response

[b'\n{\n "step": "1",\n "description": "Get the current stock price for Rivian",\n "tool": "get_current_stock_price",\n "arguments": {\n "symbol": "RIVN"\n }\n}']
=====================================
Executing function: get_current_stock_price({'symbol': 'RIVN'})
Function response: <CURRENT STOCK PRICE>
=====================================
[b'\n{\n "step": "2",\n "description": "Get company news and press releases for Rivian",\n "tool": "get_company_news",\n "arguments": {\n "symbol": "RIVN"\n }\n}']
=====================================
Executing function: get_company_news({'symbol': 'RIVN'})
Function response: [<LIST OF RECENT NEWS TITLES>]
=====================================
[b'\n{\n "step": "3",\n "description": "Summarize the company news and press releases for Rivian",\n "tool": "final_answer",\n "arguments": {\n "final_response": "Rivian, with its current stock price of <CURRENT STOCK PRICE>, <NEWS SUMMARY>"\n }\n}']

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
RESPONSE: Rivian, with its current stock price of <CURRENT STOCK PRICE>, <NEWS SUMMARY>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

> [!TIP] In this tutorial, all functionalities (tool definitions, implementations, and executions) are implemented on the client side (see [client.py](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client.py)). For production scenarios, especially when functions are known beforehand, consider implementing this logic on the server side. A recommended approach for server-side implementation is to deploy your workflow through a Triton [ensemble](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/a6fff975a214ff00221790dd0a5521fb05ce3ac9/docs/user_guide/architecture.md#ensemble-models) or a [BLS](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend?tab=readme-ov-file#business-logic-scripting). Use a pre-processing model to combine and format the user prompt with the system prompt and available tools. Employ a post-processing model to manage multiple calls to the deployed LLM as needed to reach the final answer.

Further Optimizations[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#further-optimizations "Link to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Enforcing Output Format[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#enforcing-output-format "Link to this heading")

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to enforce a specific output format using prompt engineering. The desired structure is as follows:

  {
    "step" : <Step number>
    "description": <Description of what the step does and its output>
    "tool": <Tool to use>,
    "arguments": {
        <Parameters to pass to the tool as a valid dict>
    }
  }

However, there may be instances where the output deviates from this required schema. For example, consider the following prompt execution:

python3 /tutorials/AI_Agents_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client.py --prompt "How Rivian is doing?" -o 500 --verbose

This execution may fail with an invalid JSON format error. The verbose output will reveal that the final LLM response contained plain text instead of the expected JSON format:

{
  "step": "3",
  "description": <Description of what the step does and its output>
  "tool": "final_answer",
  "arguments": {
    "final_response": <Final Response>
  }
}

Fortunately, this behavior can be controlled using constrained decoding, a technique that guides the model to generate outputs that meet specific formatting and content requirements. We strongly recommend exploring our dedicated [tutorial](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Constrained_Decoding/README.html) on constrained decoding to gain deeper insights and enhance your ability to manage model outputs effectively.

> [!TIP] For optimal results, utilize the `FunctionCall` class defined in [client_utils.py](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials/blob/main/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/artifacts/client_utils.py) as the JSON schema for your Logits Post-Processor. This approach ensures consistent and properly formatted outputs, aligning with the structure we’ve established throughout this tutorial.

### Parallel Tool Call[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/tutorials/Feature_Guide/Function_Calling/README.html#parallel-tool-call "Link to this heading")

This tutorial focuses on a single turn forced call, the LLM is prompted to make a specific function call within a single interaction. This approach is useful when a precise action is needed immediately, ensuring that the function is executed as part of the current conversation.

It is possible, that come of function calls can be executed simultaneously. This technique is beneficial for tasks that can be divided into independent operations, allowing for increased efficiency and reduced response time.

We encourage our readers to take on the challenge of implementing parallel tool calls as a practical exercise.
