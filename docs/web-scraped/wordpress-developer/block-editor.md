Welcome to the Block Editor Handbook.


TheBlock Editoris a modern paradigm for WordPress site building and publishing. It uses a modular system ofblocksto compose and format content and is designed to create rich and flexible layouts for websites and digital products.


The Block Editor consists of several primary elements, as shown in the following figure:



The elements highlighted are:


1. Inserter:A panel for inserting blocks into the content canvas
1. Content canvas:The content editor, which holds content created with blocks
1. Settings Panel:A panel for configuring a block’s settings when selected or the settings of the post


Through the Block Editor, you create content modularly using blocks. Manyblocksare available in WordPress by default, and you can alsocreate your own.


Ablockis a discrete element such as a Paragraph, Heading, Media, or Embed. Each block is treated as a separate element with individual editing and format controls. When all these components are pieced together, they make up the content of the page or post, which is thenstored in the WordPress database.


The Block Editor is the result of the work done on theGutenberg project, which aims to revolutionize the WordPress editing experience.


Besides offering anenhanced editing experiencethrough visual content creation tools, the Block Editor is also a powerful developer platform with arich feature set of APIsthat allow it to be manipulated and extended in countless ways.
