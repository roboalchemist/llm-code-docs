Your plugin may need to do some clean-up when it is uninstalled from a site.

A plugin is considered uninstalled if a user has deactivated the plugin, and then clicks the delete link within the WordPress Admin.

When your plugin is uninstalled, you’ll want to clear out any plugin options and/or settings specific to the plugin, and/or other database entities such as tables.

Less experienced developers sometimes make the mistake of using the deactivation hook for this purpose.

This table illustrates the differences between deactivation and uninstall.

## Method 1: register_uninstall_hook

To set up an uninstall hook, use theregister_uninstall_hook()function:

```php
register_uninstall_hook(
    __FILE__,
    'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```php

## Method 2: uninstall.php

To use this method you need to create anuninstall.phpfile inside the root folder of your plugin. This magic file is run automatically when the users deletes the plugin.

For example:/plugin-name/uninstall.php

Always check for the constant `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` in `uninstall.php` before doing anything. This protects against direct access.
The constant will be defined by WordPress during theuninstall.phpinvocation.

The constant isNOTdefined when uninstall is performed byregister_uninstall_hook().

Here is an example deleting option entries and dropping a database table:

```php
// if uninstall.php is not called by WordPress, die
if ( ! defined( 'WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN' ) ) {
    die;
}

$option_name = 'wporg_option';

delete_option( $option_name );

// for site options in Multisite
delete_site_option( $option_name );

// drop a custom database table
global $wpdb;
$wpdb->query( "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {$wpdb->prefix}mytable" );
```php

In Multisite, looping through all blogs to delete options can be very resource intensive.
