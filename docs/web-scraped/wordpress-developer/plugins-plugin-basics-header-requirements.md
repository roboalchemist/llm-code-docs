```php
/*

 * Plugin Name: YOUR PLUGIN NAME
 */
```php

## Header Fields

Available header fields:

- Plugin Name:(required) The name of your plugin, which will be displayed in the Plugins list in the WordPress Admin.
- Plugin URI:The home page of the plugin, which should be a unique URL, preferably on your own website. Thismust be uniqueto your plugin. You cannot use a WordPress.org URL here.

- Author URI:The author’s website or profile on another website, such as WordPress.org.

- Network:Whether the plugin can only be activated network-wide. Can only be set totrue, and should be left out when not needed.
- Update URI:Allows third-party plugins to avoid accidentally being overwritten with an update of a plugin of a similar name from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. For more info read relateddev note.
- Requires Plugins: A comma-separated list of WordPress.org-formatted slugs for its dependencies, such asmy-plugin(my-plugin/my-plugin.phpis not supported). It does not support commas in plugin slugs. For more info read the relateddev note.

A valid PHP file with a header comment might look like this:

```php
/*

 * Plugin Name:       My Basics Plugin
 * Plugin URI:        https://example.com/plugins/the-basics/
 * Description:       Handle the basics with this plugin.
 * Version:           1.10.3
 * Requires at least: 5.2
 * Requires PHP:      7.2
 * Author:            John Smith
 * Author URI:        https://author.example.com/
 * License:           GPL v2 or later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Update URI:        https://example.com/my-plugin/
 * Text Domain:       my-basics-plugin
 * Domain Path:       /languages
 * Requires Plugins:  my-plugin, yet-another-plugin
 */
```php

Here’s another example which allows file-level PHPDoc DocBlock as well as WordPress plugin file headers:

```php
/**

 * Plugin Name
 *

 * @package           PluginPackage
 * @author            Your Name
 * @copyright         2019 Your Name or Company Name
 * @license           GPL-2.0-or-later
 *

 * @wordpress-plugin
 * Plugin Name:       Plugin Name
 * Plugin URI:        https://example.com/plugin-name
 * Description:       Description of the plugin.
 * Version:           1.0.0
 * Requires at least: 5.2
 * Requires PHP:      7.2
 * Author:            Your Name
 * Author URI:        https://example.com
 * Text Domain:       plugin-slug
 * License:           GPL v2 or later
 * License URI:       http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
 * Update URI:        https://example.com/my-plugin/
 * Requires Plugins:  my-plugin, yet-another-plugin
 */
```php

## Notes

When assigning a version number to your project, keep in mind that WordPress uses the PHP version_compare() function to compare plugin version numbers. Therefore, before you release a new version of your plugin, you should make sure that this PHP function considers the new version to be “greater” than the old one.  For example, 1.02 is actually greater than 1.1.
