Actionsare one of the two types ofHooks. They provide a way for running a function at a specific point in the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. Callback functions for an Action do not return anything back to the calling Action hook. They are the counterpart toFilters. Here is a refresher ofthe difference between actions and filters.


## Adding an Action


The process of adding an action includes two steps:


### Create a callback function


First, create acallback function. This function will be run when the action it is hooked to is run.


The callback function is just like a normal function: it should be prefixed, and it should be infunctions.phpor somewhere callable. The parameters it should accept will be defined by the action you are hooking to; most hooks are well defined, so review the hooks docs to see what parameters the action you have selected will pass to your function.


### Assign (hook) your callback function


Second, add your callback function to the action. This is calledhookingand tells the action to run your callback function when the action is run.


When your callback function is ready, useadd_action()to hook it to the action you have selected. At a minimum,add_action()requires two parameters:


1. string $hook_namewhich is the name of the action you’re hooking to, and
1. callable $callbackthe name of your callback function.


The example below will runwporg_callback()when theinithook is executed:


```
function wporg_callback() {
    // do something
}
add_action( 'init', 'wporg_callback' );
```


You can refer to theHookschapter for a list of available hooks.


As you gain more experience, looking through WordPress Core source code will allow you to find the most appropriate hook.


### Additional Parameters


add_action()can accept two additional parameters,int $priorityfor the priority given to the callback function, andint $accepted_argsfor the number of arguments that will be passed to the callback function.


#### Priority


Many callback functions can be hooked to a single action. Theinithook for example gets a lot of use. There may be cases where you need to ensure that your callback function runs before or after other callback functions, even when those other functions may not yet have been hooked.


WordPress determines the order that callback functions are run based on two things: The first way is by manually setting thepriority. This is done using the third argument toadd_action().


Here are some important facts about priorities:


- priorities are positive integers, typically between 1 and 20
- the default priority (meaning, the priority assigned when nopriorityvalue is manually supplied) is 10
- there is no theoretical upper limit on the priority value, but the realistic upper limit is 100


A function with a priority of 11 will runaftera function with a priority of 10; and a function with a priority of 9 will runbeforea function with a priority of 10.


The second way that callback function order is determined is simply by the order in which it was registeredwithin the same priority value. So if two callback functions are registered for the same hook with the same priority, they will be run in the order that they were registered to the hook.


For example, the following callback functions are all registered to theinithook, but with different priorities:


```
add_action('init', 'wporg_callback_run_me_late', 11);
add_action('init', 'wporg_callback_run_me_normal');
add_action('init', 'wporg_callback_run_me_early', 9);
add_action('init', 'wporg_callback_run_me_later', 11);
```


In the example above:


- The first function run will bewporg_callback_run_me_early(), because it has a manual priority of 9
- Next,wporg_callback_run_me_normal(),because it has no priority set and so its priority is 10
- Next,wporg_callback_run_me_late()is run because it has a manual priority of 11
- Finally,wporg_callback_run_me_later()is run: it also has a priority of 11, but it was hooked afterwporg_callback_run_me_late().


#### Number of Arguments


Sometimes it’s desirable for a callback function to receive some extra data related to the action being hooked to.


For example, when WordPress saves a post and runs thesave_posthook, it passes two parameters to the callback function: the ID of the post being saved, and the post object itself:


```
do_action( 'save_post', $post->ID, $post );
```


When a callback function is registered for thesave_posthook, it can specify that it wants to receive those two parameters. It does so by tellingadd_actionto expect them by (in this case) putting2as the fourth argument:


```
add_action('save_post', 'wporg_custom', 10, 2);
```


In order to actually receive those parameters in your callback function, modify the parameters your callback function will accept, like this:


```
function wporg_custom( $post_id, $post ) {
    // do something
}
```




It’s good practice to give your callback function parameters the same name as the passed parameters, or as close as you can.
