Title: Use REST to Invoke the API

URL Source: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest

Markdown Content:
*   The Custom Search JSON API is a service accessed via a single URI endpoint using HTTP GET requests with details passed as query parameters.

*   Each search request requires an API key, a Programmable Search Engine ID, and a search query as parameters.

*   Query parameters can be API-specific, defining search properties, or standard, defining technical aspects like the API key.

*   Successful requests return a `200 OK` status and response data in JSON format, including metadata about the search, the search engine, and the search results.

*   You can use REST from JavaScript with a `callback` parameter to display search results without server-side code.

This document describes how to use the Custom Search JSON API.

Make a request
--------------

REST, or [Representational State Transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer), in the Custom Search JSON API is somewhat different from the usual RESTful APIs. Instead of providing access to resources, the API provides access to a service. As a result, the API provides a single URI that acts as the service endpoint.

You can retrieve results for a particular search by sending an HTTP `GET` request to its URI. You pass in the details of the search request as query parameters. The format for the Custom Search JSON API URI is:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?[parameters]
```

Three query `[parameters]` are required with each search request:

*   **API key** - Use the `key` query parameter to [identify your application](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key).

    *   **Programmable Search Engine ID** - Use `cx`to specify the Programmable Search Engine you want to use to perform this search. The search engine must be created with the [Control Panel](https://cse.google.com/all) Note: The Search Engine ID (cx) can be of different format (e.g. 8ac1ab64606d234f1)

*   **Search query** - Use the`q`query parameter to specify your search expression.

All other[query parameters](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list)are optional.

Here is an example of a request which searches a test Programmable Search Engine for _lectures_:

GET https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY&cx=017576662512468239146:omuauf_lfve&q=lectures
Query parameters
----------------

There are two types of parameters that you can pass in your request:

*   API-specific parameters - define properties of your search, like the search expression, number of results, language etc.
*   Standard query parameters - define technical aspects of your request, like the API key.

All parameter values need to be URL encoded.

### API-specific query parameters

Request parameters that apply specifically to the Custom Search JSON API and define your search request are summarized in the [reference](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list#request).

### Standard query parameters

Query parameters that apply to all Custom Search JSON API operations are documented at [System Parameters](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters).

Response data
-------------

If the request succeeds, the server responds with a `200 OK` HTTP status code and the response data in JSON format. You can look up the response data structure in the [reference](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list#response).

The response data is a JSON object that includes three types of properties:

*   Metadata describing the requested search (and, possibly, related search requests)
*   Metadata describing the Programmable Search Engine
*   Search results

For a detailed description of each property, see the [reference](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list#response).

### Search request metadata

The search metadata includes:

*   `url` property, which has information about the [OpenSearch template](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md#the-url-element) used for the results returned in this request.
*   `queries` property, which is an array of objects describing the characteristics of possible searches. The name of each object in the array is either the name of an [OpenSearch query role](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md#local-role-values) or one of the two custom roles defined by this API: `previousPage` and `nextPage`. Possible query role objects include: 
    *   `request`: Metadata describing the query for the current set of results.
    *   This role is always present in the response. 
        *   It is always an array with just one element.
        *   `nextPage`: Metadata describing the query to use for the next page of results. 
            *   This role is not present if the current results are the last page. **Note:**This API returns up to the first 100 results only. 
            *   When present, it is always a array with just one element.

    *   `previousPage`: Metadata describing the query to use for the previous page of results. 
        *   Not present if the current results are the first page.
        *   When present, it is always a array with just one element. 

### Search engine metadata

The `context` property has metadata describing the search engine that performed the search query. It includes the name of the search engine, and any [facet objects](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/refinements#create) it provides for refining a search.

### Search results

The `items` array contains the actual search results. The search results include the URL, title and text snippets that describe the result. In addition, they can contain [rich snippet](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/snippets) information, if applicable.

If the search results include a `promotions` property, it contains a set of [promotions](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/promotions#sl).

REST from JavaScript
--------------------

You can invoke the Custom Search JSON API using REST from JavaScript, using the `callback` query parameter and a callback function. This lets you write rich applications that display Programmable Search Engine data without writing any server side code.

The following example uses this approach to display the first page of search results for the query **lecture**:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Custom Search JSON API Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
    function hndlr(response) {
      if (response.items == null) {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML +=`<h3> No Results Found </h3>`;
      } else {
        for (var i = 1; i < response.items.length; i++) {
          var item = response.items[i];
          // Make sure HTML in item.htmlTitle is escaped.
          document.getElementById("content").append(
            document.createElement("br"),
            document.createTextNode(item.htmlTitle)
          );
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    <script src="https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=YOUR-KEY&cx=017576662512468239146:omuauf_lfve&q=lecture&callback=hndlr">
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
