# Disclosure

A simple, accessible foundation for building custom UIs that show and hide content, like togglable accordion panels.

PreviewCode

## [](#installation)Installation

To get started, install Headless UI via npm:

```
npm install @headlessui/react
```

## [](#basic-example)Basic example

Disclosures are built using the `Disclosure`, `DisclosureButton`, and `DisclosurePanel` components.

The button will automatically open/close the panel when clicked, and all components will receive the appropriate
`aria-*` related attributes like `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton className="py-2">Is team pricing available?</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel className="text-gray-500">
        Yes! You can purchase a license that you can share with your entire team.
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}
```

## [](#styling)Styling

Headless UI keeps track of a lot of state about each component, like which listbox option is currently selected, whether
a popover is open or closed, or which item in a disclosure is currently focused via the keyboard.

But because the components are headless and completely unstyled out of the box, you can&#x27;t see this information in your
UI until you provide the styles you want for each state yourself.

### [](#using-data-attributes)Using data attributes

The easiest way to style the different states of a Headless UI component is using the `data-*` attributes that each
component exposes.

For example, the `DisclosureButton` component exposes a `data-open` attribute, which tells you if the disclosure is
currently open.

```
<!-- Rendered `Disclosure` -->
<button data-open>Do you offer technical support?</button>
<div data-open>No</div>
```

Use the [CSS attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to conditionally
apply styles based on the presence of these data attributes. If you&#x27;re using Tailwind CSS, the
[data attribute modifier](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#data-attributes) makes this easy:

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from '@heroicons/react/20/solid'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton className="group flex items-center gap-2">
        Do you offer technical support?

        <ChevronDownIcon className="w-5 group-data-open:rotate-180" />
      </DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>No</DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

See the [component API](#component-api) for a list of all the available data attributes.

### [](#using-render-props)Using render props

Each component also exposes information about its current state via
[render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that you can use to conditionally apply different styles or
render different content.

For example, the `DisclosureButton` component exposes an `open` state, which tells you if the disclosure is currently
open.

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'
import { ChevronDownIcon } from '@heroicons/react/20/solid'
import clsx from 'clsx'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>

      {({ open }) => (
        <>
          <DisclosureButton className="flex items-center gap-2">
            Do you offer technical support?

            <ChevronDownIcon className={clsx('w-5', open && 'rotate-180')} />
          </DisclosureButton>
          <DisclosurePanel>No</DisclosurePanel>
        </>

      )}
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

See the [component API](#component-api) for a list of all the available render props.

## [](#examples)Examples

### [](#adding-transitions)Adding transitions

To animate the opening and closing of the disclosure panel, add the `transition` prop to the `DisclosurePanel` component
and then use CSS to style the different stages of the transition:

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure as="div" className="w-full max-w-md">
      <DisclosureButton className="w-full border-b pb-2 text-left">Is team pricing available?</DisclosureButton>
      <div className="overflow-hidden py-2">
        <DisclosurePanel

          transition

          className="origin-top transition duration-200 ease-out data-closed:-translate-y-6 data-closed:opacity-0"
        >
          Yes! You can purchase a license that you can share with your entire team.
        </DisclosurePanel>
      </div>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

Internally, the `transition` prop is implemented in the exact same way as the `Transition` component. See the
[Transition documentation](/react/transition) to learn more.

### [](#animating-with-framer-motion)Animating with Framer Motion

Headless UI also composes well with other animation libraries in the React ecosystem like
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/). You just need to
expose some state to those libraries.

For example, to animate the menu with Framer Motion, add the `static` prop to the `DisclosurePanel` component and then
conditionally render it based on the `open` render prop:

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'
import { AnimatePresence, easeOut, motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { Fragment } from 'react'

function Example() {
  return (

    <Disclosure as="div" className="w-full max-w-md">
      {({ open }) => (
        <>
          <DisclosureButton className="w-full border-b pb-2 text-left">Is team pricing available?</DisclosureButton>
          <div className="overflow-hidden py-2">
            <AnimatePresence>
              {open && (

                <DisclosurePanel static as={Fragment}>
                  <motion.div
                    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -24 }}
                    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
                    exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -24 }}
                    transition={{ duration: 0.2, ease: easeOut }}
                    className="origin-top"
                  >
                    Yes! You can purchase a license that you can share with your entire team.
                  </motion.div>
                </DisclosurePanel>
              )}
            </AnimatePresence>
          </div>

        </>
      )}
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

### [](#closing-disclosures-manually)Closing disclosures manually

To close a disclosure manually when clicking a child of its panel, render that child as a `CloseButton`. You can use the
`as` prop to customize which element is being rendered.

```
import { CloseButton, Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'
import MyLink from './MyLink'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton>Open mobile menu</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>

        <CloseButton as={MyLink} href="/home">

          Home

        </CloseButton>
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

This is especially useful when using disclosures for things like mobile menus that contain links where you want the
disclosure to close when navigating to the next page.

The `Disclosure` and `DisclosurePanel` also expose a `close` render prop which you can use to imperatively close the
panel, say after running an async action:

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton>Terms</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>

        {({ close }) => (

          <button

            onClick={async () => {

              await fetch('/accept-terms', { method: 'POST' })

              close()

            }}

          >

            Read and accept

          </button>

        )}
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

By default the `DisclosureButton` receives focus after calling `close`, but you can change this by passing a ref into
`close(ref)`.

Finally, Headless UI also provides a `useClose` hook that can be used to imperatively close the nearest disclosure
ancestor when you don&#x27;t have easy access to the `close` render prop, such as in a nested component:

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel, useClose } from '@headlessui/react'

function MySearchForm() {

  let close = useClose()

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(event) => {
        event.preventDefault()
        /* Perform search... */

        close()
      }}
    >
      <input type="search" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}

function Example() {
  return (
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureButton>Filters</DisclosureButton>
      <DisclosurePanel>
        <MySearchForm />
        {/* ... */}
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```

The `useClose` hook must be used in a component that&#x27;s nested within the `Disclosure`, otherwise it will not work.

### [](#rendering-as-different-elements)Rendering as different elements

`Disclosure` and its subcomponents each render a default element that is sensible for that component: the `Button`
renders a `<button>`, `Panel` renders a `<div>`. By contrast, the root `Disclosure` component *does not render an
element*, and instead renders its children directly by default.

Use the `as` prop to render the component as a different element or as your own custom component, making sure your
custom components [forward refs](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) so that Headless UI can wire things up
correctly.

```
import { Disclosure, DisclosureButton, DisclosurePanel } from '@headlessui/react'
import { forwardRef } from 'react'

let MyCustomButton = forwardRef(function (props, ref) {

  return <button className="..." ref={ref} {...props} />

})

function Example() {
  return (

    <Disclosure as="div">

      <DisclosureButton as={MyCustomButton}>What languages do you support?</DisclosureButton>

      <DisclosurePanel as="ul">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

```
