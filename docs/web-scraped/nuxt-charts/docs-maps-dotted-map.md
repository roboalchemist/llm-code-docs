Title: Dotted Map

URL Source: https://nuxtcharts.com/docs/maps/dotted-map

Markdown Content:
Render geographic data as a dot-matrix style map. Add pins to highlight locations, filter by country or region, and customize dot appearance. Ideal for showing global presence, office locations, or geographic distributions.

The `grid` prop defines how dots are aligned in the matrix. By default, dots are aligned in a regular `vertical` grid. Setting it to `diagonal` creates a staggered, honeycomb-like arrangement.

The map uses a grid of dots to represent geographic data. You can control the density and appearance of the grid using `mapWidth`, `mapHeight`, and `dotSize`.

*   **Density**: Provide either `mapHeight` or `mapWidth` to define the number of dots in the grid. The other dimension is calculated automatically to preserve the map's aspect ratio.
*   **Dot Size**: Use `dotSize` to control the radius of individual dots. A value of `0.5` creates a grid where dots are perfectly adjacent without overlapping.

By adjusting these values together, you can achieve the exact grid layout you want. For example, a larger `mapWidth` with a smaller `dotSize` will result in a more detailed, high-resolution map.

```
<!-- Big dots touching each other -->
<DottedMap
  :map-height="50"
  :dot-size="0.3"
/>

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mapHeight` | `number` | `undefined` | Height of the map in dots. Width is calculated automatically to preserve aspect ratio. |
| `mapWidth` | `number` | `undefined` | Width of the map in dots. Height is calculated automatically to preserve aspect ratio. |
| `countries` | `string[]` | `undefined` | Array of ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes to include. If omitted, shows the whole world. |
| `region` | `MapRegion` | `undefined` | Specific region to display (lat/lng bounds). |
| `grid` | `'vertical' | 'diagonal'` | `'vertical'` | How dots should be aligned. |
| `avoidOuterPins` | `boolean` | `false` | If true, prevents adding pins outside of region/countries. |
| `pins` | `MapPin[]` | `undefined` | Array of pins to place on the map. |
| `precomputedMap` | `string | object` | `undefined` | Precomputed map data (JSON) to skip map computation. |
| `color` | `string` | `'#ffffff'` | Default color of the dots. |
| `dotSize` | `number` | `0.5` | Default size (radius) of the dots. |
| `strokeColor` | `string` | `undefined` | Stroke color of the dots. |
| `strokeWidth` | `number` | `undefined` | Stroke width of the dots. |
| `strokeOpacity` | `number` | `undefined` | Stroke opacity of the dots. |
| `shape` | `'circle' | 'hexagon'` | `'circle'` | Shape of the dots. |
| `countryColors` | `Record<string, string>` | `undefined` | Custom colors for specific countries (keyed by ISO code). |
| `backgroundColor` | `string` | `undefined` | Background color of the map container. |
