Important

Understanding container architecture basics is essential for properly maintaining your SearXNG instance. This guide assumes familiarity with container concepts and provides deployment steps at a high level.

If you're new to containers, we recommend learning the fundamentals at [Docker 101](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview) before proceeding.

Container images are the basis for deployments in containerized environments, [Docker compose](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker), Kubernetes and more.

## Installation[¶](#installation "Link to this heading")

[]

### Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Link to this heading")

You need a working Docker or Podman installation on your system. Choose the option that works best for your environment:

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (recommended for most users)

-   [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)

In the case of Docker, you need to add the user running the container to the [`docker`] group and restart the session:

    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

In the case of Podman, no additional steps are generally required, but there are some considerations when running [Podman rootless containers](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

### Pulling images[¶](#pulling-images "Link to this heading")

Note

DockerHub now applies rate limits to unauthenticated image pulls. If you are affected by this, you can use the [GHCR mirror](https://ghcr.io/searxng/searxng) instead.

The official images are mirrored at:

-   [DockerHub mirror](https://hub.docker.com/r/searxng/searxng)

-   [GHCR mirror](https://ghcr.io/searxng/searxng) (GitHub Container Registry)

Pull the latest image:

    $ docker pull docker.io/searxng/searxng:latest

.. or if you want to lock in to a specific version:

    $ docker pull docker.io/searxng/searxng:2025.8.1-3d96414

[]

## Instancing[¶](#instancing "Link to this heading")

This section is intended for advanced users who need custom deployments. We recommend using [Docker compose](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker), which provides a preconfigured environment with sensible defaults.

Basic container instancing example:

    # Create directories for configuration and persistent data
    $ mkdir -p ./searxng/config/ ./searxng/data/
    $ cd ./searxng/

    # Run the container
    $ docker run --name searxng -d \
        -p 8888:8080 \
        -v "./config/:/etc/searxng/" \
        -v "./data/:/var/cache/searxng/" \
        docker.io/searxng/searxng:latest

This will start SearXNG in the background, accessible at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

[]

### Management[¶](#management "Link to this heading")

List running containers:

    $ docker container list
    CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  ...  CREATED        PORTS                   NAMES
    1af574997e63  ...    ...  3 minutes ago  0.0.0.0:8888->8080/tcp  searxng

Access the container shell (troubleshooting):

    $ docker container exec -it --user root searxng /bin/sh -l
    1af574997e63:/usr/local/searxng#

Stop and remove the container:

    $ docker container stop searxng
    $ docker container rm searxng

[]

## Volumes[¶](#volumes "Link to this heading")

Two volumes are exposed that should be mounted to preserve its contents:

-   [`/etc/searxng`]: Configuration files (settings.yml, etc.)

-   [`/var/cache/searxng`]: Persistent data (faviconcache.db, etc.)

[]

## Environment variables[¶](#environment-variables "Link to this heading")

The following environment variables can be configured:

-   [`$SEARXNG_*`]: Controls the SearXNG configuration options, look out for environment [`$SEARXNG_*`] in [[server:]](settings/settings_server.html#settings-server) and [[general:]](settings/settings_general.html#settings-general).

-   [`$GRANIAN_*`]: Controls the [[Granian server options]](installation-granian.html#granian-configuration).

-   [`$FORCE_OWNERSHIP`]: Ensures mounted volumes/files are owned by the [`searxng:searxng`] user (default: [`true`])

Container internal paths (don't modify unless you know what you're doing):

-   [`$CONFIG_PATH`]: Path to the SearXNG configuration directory (default: [`/etc/searxng`])

-   [`$SEARXNG_SETTINGS_PATH`]: Path to the SearXNG settings file (default: [`$CONFIG_PATH/settings.yml`])

-   [`$DATA_PATH`]: Path to the SearXNG data directory (default: [`/var/cache/searxng`])

[]

## Custom certificates[¶](#custom-certificates "Link to this heading")

You can mount [`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/`] folder to add/remove additional certificates as needed.

They will be available on container (re)start or when running [`update-ca-certificates`] in the container shell.

[]

## Custom images[¶](#custom-images "Link to this heading")

To build your own SearXNG container image from source (please note, custom container images are not officially supported):

    $ git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng.git
    $ cd ./searxng/

    # Run the container build script
    $ make container

    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID  CREATED             SIZE
