Note

Granian will be the future replacement for [[uWSGI]](installation-uwsgi.html#searxng-uwsgi) in SearXNG. At the moment, it's only officially supported in the [[Installation container]](installation-docker.html#installation-container).

## Installation[¶](#installation "Link to this heading")

We only recommend installing Granian with pip, as officially documented. Run the following command in the Python environment of the SearXNG installation:

    $ pip install granian

## Configuration[¶](#configuration "Link to this heading")

Note

It's not advised to modify the amount of workers, expect increased resource usage and potential issues with [[Bot Detection]](../src/searx.botdetection.html#botdetection).

Granian can be configured via option parameters and environment variables ([`$GRANIAN_*`]).

We provide sane defaults that should fit most use cases, however if you feel you should change something, Granian documents all available parameters in the [Options](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian/blob/master/README.md#options) section.
