## [How to update](#id3)[¶](#how-to-update "Link to this heading")

How to update depends on the [[Installation]](installation.html#installation) method. If you have used the [[Installation Script]](installation-scripts.html#installation-scripts), use the [`update`] command from the [[utils/searxng.sh]](../utils/searxng.sh.html#searxng-sh) script.

    sudo -H ./utils/searxng.sh instance update

## [How to inspect & debug](#id4)[¶](#how-to-inspect-debug "Link to this heading")

How to debug depends on the [[Installation]](installation.html#installation) method. If you have used the [[Installation Script]](installation-scripts.html#installation-scripts), use the [`inspect`] command from the [[utils/searxng.sh]](../utils/searxng.sh.html#searxng-sh) script.

    sudo -H ./utils/searxng.sh instance inspect

-   [PR 1332](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/pull/1332)

-   [PR 456](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/pull/456)

-   [A comment about rolling release](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/pull/446#issuecomment-954730358)

SearXNG is a *rolling release*; each commit to the master branch is a release. SearXNG is growing rapidly, the services and opportunities are change every now and then, to name just a few:

-   Bot protection has been switched from filtron to SearXNG's [[limiter]](searx.limiter.html#limiter), this requires a [[Valkey]](settings/settings_valkey.html#settings-valkey) database.

To stay tuned and get in use of the new features, instance maintainers have to update the SearXNG code regularly (see [[How to update]](#update-searxng)). As the above examples show, this is not always enough, sometimes services have to be set up or reconfigured and sometimes services that are no longer needed should be uninstalled.

Here you will find a list of changes that affect the infrastructure. Please check to what extent it is necessary to update your installations:

[PR 1595](https://github.com/searxng/searxng/pull/1595): [`[fix]`]` `[`uWSGI:`]` `[`increase`]` `[`buffer-size`]

:   Re-install uWSGI ([[utils/searxng.sh]](../utils/searxng.sh.html#searxng-sh)) or fix your uWSGI [`searxng.ini`] file manually.

### [Check after Installation](#id6)[¶](#check-after-installation "Link to this heading")

Once you have done your installation, you can run a SearXNG *check* procedure, to see if there are some left overs. In this example there exists a *old* [`/etc/searx/settings.yml`]:

    $ sudo -H ./utils/searxng.sh instance check

    SearXNG checks
