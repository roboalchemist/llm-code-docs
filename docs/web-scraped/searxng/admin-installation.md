The [[Step by step installation]](installation-searxng.html#installation-basic) is an excellent illustration of *how a SearXNG instance is build up* (see [[uWSGI Setup]](architecture.html#architecture-uwsgi)). If you do not have any special preferences, it's recommended to use the [[Installation container]](installation-docker.html#installation-container) or the [[Installation Script]](installation-scripts.html#installation-scripts).
