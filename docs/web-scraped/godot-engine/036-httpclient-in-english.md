Low-level hyper-text transfer protocol client.

## Description
Hyper-text transfer protocol client (sometimes called "User Agent"). Used to make HTTP requests to download web content, upload files and other data or to communicate with various services, among other use cases.
See theHTTPRequestnode for a higher-level alternative.
Note:This client only needs to connect to a host once (seeconnect_to_host()) to send multiple requests. Because of this, methods that take URLs usually take just the part after the host instead of the full URL, as the client is already connected to a host. Seerequest()for a full example and to get started.
AnHTTPClientshould be reused between multiple requests or to connect to different hosts instead of creating one client per request. Supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), including server certificate verification. HTTP status codes in the 2xx range indicate success, 3xx redirection (i.e. "try again, but over here"), 4xx something was wrong with the request, and 5xx something went wrong on the server's side.
For more information on HTTP, seeMDN's documentation on HTTP(or readRFC 2616to get it straight from the source).
Note:When exporting to Android, make sure to enable theINTERNETpermission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.
Note:It's recommended to use transport encryption (TLS) and to avoid sending sensitive information (such as login credentials) in HTTP GET URL parameters. Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers for such information instead.
Note:When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to Web, keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign origins due toCORS. If you host the server in question, you should modify its backend to allow requests from foreign origins by adding theAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:*HTTP header.
Note:TLS support is currently limited to TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. Attempting to connect to a server that only supports older (insecure) TLS versions will return an error.
Warning:TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported. Revoked certificates are accepted as long as they are otherwise valid. If this is a concern, you may want to use automatically managed certificates with a short validity period.

## Enumerations
enumMethod:🔗
MethodMETHOD_GET=0
HTTP GET method. The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
MethodMETHOD_HEAD=1
HTTP HEAD method. The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful to request metadata like HTTP headers or to check if a resource exists.
MethodMETHOD_POST=2
HTTP POST method. The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. This is often used for forms and submitting data or uploading files.
MethodMETHOD_PUT=3
HTTP PUT method. The PUT method asks to replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. (You can think of POST as "create or update" and PUT as "update", although many services tend to not make a clear distinction or change their meaning).
MethodMETHOD_DELETE=4
HTTP DELETE method. The DELETE method requests to delete the specified resource.
MethodMETHOD_OPTIONS=5
HTTP OPTIONS method. The OPTIONS method asks for a description of the communication options for the target resource. Rarely used.
MethodMETHOD_TRACE=6
HTTP TRACE method. The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource. Returns the entire HTTP request received in the response body. Rarely used.
MethodMETHOD_CONNECT=7
HTTP CONNECT method. The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource. Rarely used.
MethodMETHOD_PATCH=8
HTTP PATCH method. The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
MethodMETHOD_MAX=9
Represents the size of theMethodenum.
enumStatus:🔗
StatusSTATUS_DISCONNECTED=0
Status: Disconnected from the server.
StatusSTATUS_RESOLVING=1
Status: Currently resolving the hostname for the given URL into an IP.
StatusSTATUS_CANT_RESOLVE=2
Status: DNS failure: Can't resolve the hostname for the given URL.
StatusSTATUS_CONNECTING=3
Status: Currently connecting to server.
StatusSTATUS_CANT_CONNECT=4
Status: Can't connect to the server.
StatusSTATUS_CONNECTED=5
Status: Connection established.
StatusSTATUS_REQUESTING=6
Status: Currently sending request.
StatusSTATUS_BODY=7
Status: HTTP body received.
StatusSTATUS_CONNECTION_ERROR=8
Status: Error in HTTP connection.
StatusSTATUS_TLS_HANDSHAKE_ERROR=9
Status: Error in TLS handshake.
enumResponseCode:🔗
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_CONTINUE=100
HTTP status code100Continue. Interim response that indicates everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request (or ignore this status if already finished).
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS=101
HTTP status code101SwitchingProtocol. Sent in response to anUpgraderequest header by the client. Indicates the protocol the server is switching to.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PROCESSING=102
HTTP status code102Processing(WebDAV). Indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_OK=200
HTTP status code200OK. The request has succeeded. Default response for successful requests. Meaning varies depending on the request:
- METHOD_GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
METHOD_GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
- METHOD_HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
METHOD_HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.
- METHOD_POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
METHOD_POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
- METHOD_TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
METHOD_TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_CREATED=201
HTTP status code201Created. The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_ACCEPTED=202
HTTP status code202Accepted. The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION=203
HTTP status code203Non-AuthoritativeInformation. This response code means returned meta-information set is not exact set as available from the origin server, but collected from a local or a third party copy. Except this condition, 200 OK response should be preferred instead of this response.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NO_CONTENT=204
HTTP status code204NoContent. There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_RESET_CONTENT=205
HTTP status code205ResetContent. The server has fulfilled the request and desires that the client resets the "document view" that caused the request to be sent to its original state as received from the origin server.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PARTIAL_CONTENT=206
HTTP status code206PartialContent. This response code is used because of a range header sent by the client to separate download into multiple streams.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_MULTI_STATUS=207
HTTP status code207Multi-Status(WebDAV). A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple resources in situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_ALREADY_REPORTED=208
HTTP status code208AlreadyReported(WebDAV). Used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_IM_USED=226
HTTP status code226IMUsed(WebDAV). The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_MULTIPLE_CHOICES=300
HTTP status code300MultipleChoice. The request has more than one possible responses and there is no standardized way to choose one of the responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY=301
HTTP status code301MovedPermanently. Redirection. This response code means the URI of requested resource has been changed. The new URI is usually included in the response.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_FOUND=302
HTTP status code302Found. Temporary redirection. This response code means the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_SEE_OTHER=303
HTTP status code303SeeOther. The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NOT_MODIFIED=304
HTTP status code304NotModified. A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 OK response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated tofalse.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_USE_PROXY=305
Deprecated:Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.
HTTP status code305UseProxy.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_SWITCH_PROXY=306
Deprecated:Many clients ignore this response code for security reasons. It is also deprecated by the HTTP standard.
HTTP status code306SwitchProxy.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT=307
HTTP status code307TemporaryRedirect. The target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PERMANENT_REDIRECT=308
HTTP status code308PermanentRedirect. The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST=400
HTTP status code400BadRequest. The request was invalid. The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, invalid request contents, or deceptive request routing).
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_UNAUTHORIZED=401
HTTP status code401Unauthorized. Credentials required. The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PAYMENT_REQUIRED=402
HTTP status code402PaymentRequired. This response code is reserved for future use. Initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this is not currently used.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_FORBIDDEN=403
HTTP status code403Forbidden. The client does not have access rights to the content, i.e. they are unauthorized, so server is rejecting to give proper response. Unlike401, the client's identity is known to the server.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NOT_FOUND=404
HTTP status code404NotFound. The server can not find requested resource. Either the URL is not recognized or the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. May also be sent instead of 403 to hide existence of a resource if the client is not authorized.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED=405
HTTP status code405MethodNotAllowed. The request's HTTP method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource. The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this error code.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NOT_ACCEPTABLE=406
HTTP status code406NotAcceptable. The target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request. Used when negotiation content.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED=407
HTTP status code407ProxyAuthenticationRequired. Similar to 401 Unauthorized, but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=408
HTTP status code408RequestTimeout. The server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_CONFLICT=409
HTTP status code409Conflict. The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. This code is used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_GONE=410
HTTP status code410Gone. The target resource is no longer available at the origin server and this condition is likely permanent.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_LENGTH_REQUIRED=411
HTTP status code411LengthRequired. The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length header.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PRECONDITION_FAILED=412
HTTP status code412PreconditionFailed. One or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated tofalsewhen tested on the server.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE=413
HTTP status code413EntityTooLarge. The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG=414
HTTP status code414Request-URITooLong. The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE=415
HTTP status code415UnsupportedMediaType. The origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE=416
HTTP status code416RequestedRangeNotSatisfiable. None of the ranges in the request's Range header field overlap the current extent of the selected resource or the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_EXPECTATION_FAILED=417
HTTP status code417ExpectationFailed. The expectation given in the request's Expect header field could not be met by at least one of the inbound servers.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_IM_A_TEAPOT=418
HTTP status code418I'mATeapot. Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_MISDIRECTED_REQUEST=421
HTTP status code421MisdirectedRequest. The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY=422
HTTP status code422UnprocessableEntity(WebDAV). The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 Bad Request status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_LOCKED=423
HTTP status code423Locked(WebDAV). The source or destination resource of a method is locked.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_FAILED_DEPENDENCY=424
HTTP status code424FailedDependency(WebDAV). The method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_UPGRADE_REQUIRED=426
HTTP status code426UpgradeRequired. The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_PRECONDITION_REQUIRED=428
HTTP status code428PreconditionRequired. The origin server requires the request to be conditional.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS=429
HTTP status code429TooManyRequests. The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (see "rate limiting"). Back off and increase time between requests or try again later.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE=431
HTTP status code431RequestHeaderFieldsTooLarge. The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_UNAVAILABLE_FOR_LEGAL_REASONS=451
HTTP status code451ResponseUnavailableForLegalReasons. The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR=500
HTTP status code500InternalServerError. The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED=501
HTTP status code501NotImplemented. The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_BAD_GATEWAY=502
HTTP status code502BadGateway. The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request. Usually returned by load balancers or proxies.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE=503
HTTP status code503ServiceUnavailable. The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some delay. Try again later.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT=504
HTTP status code504GatewayTimeout. The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request. Usually returned by load balancers or proxies.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED=505
HTTP status code505HTTPVersionNotSupported. The server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of HTTP that was used in the request message.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_VARIANT_ALSO_NEGOTIATES=506
HTTP status code506VariantAlsoNegotiates. The server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE=507
HTTP status code507InsufficientStorage. The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_LOOP_DETECTED=508
HTTP status code508LoopDetected. The server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with "Depth: infinity". This status indicates that the entire operation failed.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NOT_EXTENDED=510
HTTP status code510NotExtended. The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request. The server should send back all the information necessary for the client to issue an extended request.
ResponseCodeRESPONSE_NETWORK_AUTH_REQUIRED=511
HTTP status code511NetworkAuthenticationRequired. The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.

## Method Descriptions
voidclose()🔗
Closes the current connection, allowing reuse of thisHTTPClient.
Errorconnect_to_host(host:String, port:int= -1, tls_options:TLSOptions= null)🔗
Connects to a host. This needs to be done before any requests are sent.
If noportis specified (or-1is used), it is automatically set to 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. You can pass the optionaltls_optionsparameter to customize the trusted certification authorities, or the common name verification when using HTTPS. SeeTLSOptions.client()andTLSOptions.client_unsafe().
intget_response_body_length()const🔗
Returns the response's body length.
Note:Some Web servers may not send a body length. In this case, the value returned will be-1. If using chunked transfer encoding, the body length will also be-1.
Note:This function always returns-1on the Web platform due to browsers limitations.
intget_response_code()const🔗
Returns the response's HTTP status code.
PackedStringArrayget_response_headers()🔗
Returns the response headers.
Dictionaryget_response_headers_as_dictionary()🔗
Returns all response headers as aDictionary. Each entry is composed by the header name, and aStringcontaining the values separated by";". The casing is kept the same as the headers were received.
```
{
    "content-length": 12,
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
}
```
Statusget_status()const🔗
Returns aStatusconstant. Need to callpoll()in order to get status updates.
boolhas_response()const🔗
Iftrue, thisHTTPClienthas a response available.
boolis_response_chunked()const🔗
Iftrue, thisHTTPClienthas a response that is chunked.
Errorpoll()🔗
This needs to be called in order to have any request processed. Check results withget_status().
Stringquery_string_from_dict(fields:Dictionary)🔗
Generates a GET/POST application/x-www-form-urlencoded style query string from a provided dictionary, e.g.:
```
var fields = { "username": "user", "password": "pass" }
var query_string = http_client.query_string_from_dict(fields)
# Returns "username=user&password=pass"
```
```
var fields = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary { { "username", "user" }, { "password", "pass" } };
string queryString = httpClient.QueryStringFromDict(fields);
// Returns "username=user&password=pass"
```
Furthermore, if a key has anullvalue, only the key itself is added, without equal sign and value. If the value is an array, for each value in it a pair with the same key is added.
```
var fields = { "single": 123, "not_valued": null, "multiple": [22, 33, 44] }
var query_string = http_client.query_string_from_dict(fields)
# Returns "single=123&not_valued&multiple=22&multiple=33&multiple=44"
```
```
var fields = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary
{
    { "single", 123 },
    { "notValued", default },
    { "multiple", new Godot.Collections.Array { 22, 33, 44 } },
};
string queryString = httpClient.QueryStringFromDict(fields);
// Returns "single=123&not_valued&multiple=22&multiple=33&multiple=44"
```
PackedByteArrayread_response_body_chunk()🔗
Reads one chunk from the response.
Errorrequest(method:Method, url:String, headers:PackedStringArray, body:String= "")🔗
Sends an HTTP request to the connected host with the givenmethod.
The URL parameter is usually just the part after the host, so forhttps://example.com/index.php, it is/index.php. When sending requests to an HTTP proxy server, it should be an absolute URL. ForMETHOD_OPTIONSrequests,*is also allowed. ForMETHOD_CONNECTrequests, it should be the authority component (host:port).
headersare HTTP request headers.
To create a POST request with query strings to push to the server, do:
```
var fields = { "username": "user", "password": "pass" }
var query_string = http_client.query_string_from_dict(fields)
var headers = ["Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "Content-Length: " + str(query_string.length())]
var result = http_client.request(http_client.METHOD_POST, "/index.php", headers, query_string)
```
```
var fields = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary { { "username", "user" }, { "password", "pass" } };
string queryString = new HttpClient().QueryStringFromDict(fields);
string[] headers = ["Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded", $"Content-Length: {queryString.Length}"];
var result = new HttpClient().Request(HttpClient.Method.Post, "index.php", headers, queryString);
```
Note:Thebodyparameter is ignored ifmethodisMETHOD_GET. This is because GET methods can't contain request data. As a workaround, you can pass request data as a query string in the URL. SeeString.uri_encode()for an example.
Errorrequest_raw(method:Method, url:String, headers:PackedStringArray, body:PackedByteArray)🔗
Sends a raw HTTP request to the connected host with the givenmethod.
The URL parameter is usually just the part after the host, so forhttps://example.com/index.php, it is/index.php. When sending requests to an HTTP proxy server, it should be an absolute URL. ForMETHOD_OPTIONSrequests,*is also allowed. ForMETHOD_CONNECTrequests, it should be the authority component (host:port).
headersare HTTP request headers.
Sends the body data raw, as a byte array and does not encode it in any way.
voidset_http_proxy(host:String, port:int)🔗
Sets the proxy server for HTTP requests.
The proxy server is unset ifhostis empty orportis -1.
voidset_https_proxy(host:String, port:int)🔗
Sets the proxy server for HTTPS requests.
The proxy server is unset ifhostis empty orportis -1.
