## High-level vs low-level API
The following explains the differences of high- and low-level networking in Godot as well as some fundamentals. If you want to jump in head-first and add networking to your first nodes, skip toInitializing the networkbelow. But make sure to read the rest later on!
Godot always supported standard low-level networking viaUDP,TCPand some higher-level protocols such asHTTPandSSL.
These protocols are flexible and can be used for almost anything. However, using them to synchronize game state manually can be a large amount of work. Sometimes that work can't be avoided or is worth it, for example when working with a custom server implementation on the backend. But in most cases, it's worthwhile to consider Godot's high-level networking API, which sacrifices some of the fine-grained control of low-level networking for greater ease of use.
This is due to the inherent limitations of the low-level protocols:
- TCP ensures packets will always arrive reliably and in order, but latency is generally higher due to error correction.
It's also quite a complex protocol because it understands what a "connection" is, and optimizes for goals that often don't suit applications like multiplayer games. Packets are buffered to be sent in larger batches, trading less per-packet overhead for higher latency. This can be useful for things like HTTP, but generally not for games. Some of this can be configured and disabled (e.g. by disabling "Nagle's algorithm" for the TCP connection).

Some of this can be configured and disabled (e.g. by disabling "Nagle's algorithm" for the TCP connection).
- UDP is a simpler protocol, which only sends packets (and has no concept of a "connection"). No error correction
makes it pretty quick (low latency), but packets may be lost along the way or received in the wrong order.
Added to that, the MTU (maximum packet size) for UDP is generally low (only a few hundred bytes), so transmitting
larger packets means splitting them, reorganizing them and retrying if a part fails.

Added to that, the MTU (maximum packet size) for UDP is generally low (only a few hundred bytes), so transmitting
larger packets means splitting them, reorganizing them and retrying if a part fails.
In general, TCP can be thought of as reliable, ordered, and slow; UDP as unreliable, unordered and fast.
Because of the large difference in performance, it often makes sense to re-build the parts of TCP wanted for games (optional reliability and packet order), while avoiding the unwanted parts (congestion/traffic control features, Nagle's algorithm, etc). Due to this, most game engines come with such an implementation, and Godot is no exception.
In summary, you can use the low-level networking API for maximum control and implement everything on top of bare network protocols or use the high-level API based onSceneTreethat does most of the heavy lifting behind the scenes in a generally optimized way.
Note
Most of Godot's supported platforms offer all or most of the mentioned high- and low-level networking
features. As networking is always largely hardware and operating system dependent, however,
some features may change or not be available on some target platforms. Most notably,
the HTML5 platform currently offers WebSockets and WebRTC support but lacks some of the higher-level features, as
well as raw access to low-level protocols like TCP and UDP.

Gaffer On Games has a lot of useful articles about networking in Games
(here), including the comprehensiveintroduction to networking models in games.
Warning
Adding networking to your game comes with some responsibility.
It can make your application vulnerable if done wrong and may lead to cheats or exploits.
It may even allow an attacker to compromise the machines your application runs on
and use your servers to send spam, attack others or steal your users' data if they play your game.
This is always the case when networking is involved and has nothing to do with Godot.
You can of course experiment, but when you release a networked application,
always take care of any possible security concerns.

## Mid-level abstraction
Before going into how we would like to synchronize a game across the network, it can be helpful to understand how the base network API for synchronization works.
Godot uses a mid-level objectMultiplayerPeer.
This object is not meant to be created directly, but is designed so that several C++ implementations can provide it.
This object extends fromPacketPeer, so it inherits all the useful methods for serializing, sending and receiving data. On top of that, it adds methods to set a peer, transfer mode, etc. It also includes signals that will let you know when peers connect or disconnect.
This class interface can abstract most types of network layers, topologies and libraries. By default, Godot
provides an implementation based on ENet (ENetMultiplayerPeer),
one based on WebRTC (WebRTCMultiplayerPeer), and one based on WebSocket
(WebSocketMultiplayerPeer), but this could be used to implement
mobile APIs (for ad hoc WiFi, Bluetooth) or custom device/console-specific networking APIs.
For most common cases, using this object directly is discouraged, as Godot provides even higher level networking facilities.
This object is still made available in case a game has specific needs for a lower-level API.

## Hosting considerations
When hosting a server, clients on yourLANcan
connect using the internal IP address which is usually of the form192.168.*.*. This internal IP address isnotreachable by
non-LAN/Internet clients.
On Windows, you can find your internal IP address by opening a command prompt
and enteringipconfig. On macOS, open a Terminal and enterifconfig. On
Linux, open a terminal and enteripaddr.
If you're hosting a server on your own machine and want non-LAN clients to
connect to it, you'll probably have toforwardthe server port on your router.
This is required to make your server reachable from the Internet since most
residential connections use aNAT. Godot's
high-level multiplayer API only uses UDP, so you must forward the port in UDP,
not just TCP.
After forwarding a UDP port and making sure your server uses that port, you can
usethis websiteto find your public IP address.
Then give this public IP address to any Internet clients that wish to connect to
your server.
Godot's high-level multiplayer API uses a modified version of ENet which allows
for full IPv6 support.

## Initializing the network
High-level networking in Godot is managed by theSceneTree.
Each node has amultiplayerproperty, which is a reference to theMultiplayerAPIinstance configured for it
by the scene tree. Initially, every node is configured with the same defaultMultiplayerAPIobject.
It is possible to create a newMultiplayerAPIobject and assign it to aNodePathin the scene tree,
which will overridemultiplayerfor the node at that path and all of its descendants.
This allows sibling nodes to be configured with different peers, which makes it possible to run a server
and a client simultaneously in one instance of Godot.
```
# By default, these expressions are interchangeable.
multiplayer # Get the MultiplayerAPI object configured for this node.
get_tree().get_multiplayer() # Get the default MultiplayerAPI object.
```
```
// By default, these expressions are interchangeable.
Multiplayer; // Get the MultiplayerAPI object configured for this node.
GetTree().GetMultiplayer(); // Get the default MultiplayerAPI object.
```
To initialize networking, aMultiplayerPeerobject must be created, initialized as a server or client,
and passed to theMultiplayerAPI.
```
# Create client.
var peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
peer.create_client(IP_ADDRESS, PORT)
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = peer

# Create server.
var peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
peer.create_server(PORT, MAX_CLIENTS)
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = peer
```
```
// Create client.
var peer = new ENetMultiplayerPeer();
peer.CreateClient(IPAddress, Port);
Multiplayer.MultiplayerPeer = peer;

// Create server.
var peer = new ENetMultiplayerPeer();
peer.CreateServer(Port, MaxClients);
Multiplayer.MultiplayerPeer = peer;
```
To terminate networking:
```
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = OfflineMultiplayerPeer.new()
```
```
Multiplayer.MultiplayerPeer = null;
```
Warning
When exporting to Android, make sure to enable theINTERNETpermission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or
using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be
blocked by Android.

## Managing connections
Every peer is assigned a unique ID. The server's ID is always 1, and clients are assigned a random positive integer.
Responding to connections or disconnections is possible by connecting toMultiplayerAPI's signals:
- peer_connected(id:int)This signal is emitted with the newly connected peer's ID on each other peer, and on the new peer multiple times, once with each other peer's ID.
peer_connected(id:int)This signal is emitted with the newly connected peer's ID on each other peer, and on the new peer multiple times, once with each other peer's ID.
- peer_disconnected(id:int)This signal is emitted on every remaining peer when one disconnects.
peer_disconnected(id:int)This signal is emitted on every remaining peer when one disconnects.
The rest are only emitted on clients:
- connected_to_server()
connected_to_server()
- connection_failed()
connection_failed()
- server_disconnected()
server_disconnected()
To get the unique ID of the associated peer:
```
multiplayer.get_unique_id()
```
```
Multiplayer.GetUniqueId();
```
To check whether the peer is server or client:
```
multiplayer.is_server()
```
```
Multiplayer.IsServer();
```

## Remote procedure calls
Remote procedure calls, or RPCs, are functions that can be called on other peers. To create one, use the@rpcannotation
before a function definition. To call an RPC, useCallable's methodrpc()to call in every peer, orrpc_id()to
call in a specific peer.
```
func _ready():
    if multiplayer.is_server():
        print_once_per_client.rpc()

@rpc
func print_once_per_client():
    print("I will be printed to the console once per each connected client.")
```
```
public override void _Ready()
{
    if (Multiplayer.IsServer())
    {
        Rpc(MethodName.PrintOncePerClient);
    }
}

[Rpc]
private void PrintOncePerClient()
{
    GD.Print("I will be printed to the console once per each connected client.");
}
```
RPCs will not serialize objects or callables.
For a remote call to be successful, the sending and receiving node need to have the sameNodePath, which means they
must have the same name. When usingadd_child()for nodes which are expected to use RPCs, set the argumentforce_readable_nametotrue.
Warning
If a function is annotated with@rpcon the client script (resp. server script),
then this function must also be declared on the server script (resp. client script).
Both RPCs must have the same signature which is evaluated with a checksum ofall RPCs.
All RPCs in a script are checked at once, and all RPCs must be declared on both the client
scripts and the server scripts,even functions that are currently not in use.
The signature of the RPC includes the@rpc()declaration, the function, return type,andthe NodePath. If an RPC resides in a script attached to/root/Main/Node1, then it
must reside in precisely the same path and node on both the client script and the server
script. Function arguments are not checked for matching between the server and client code
(example:funcsendstuff():andfuncsendstuff(arg1,arg2):will passsignature
matching).
If these conditions are not met (if all RPCs do not pass signature matching), the script may print an
error or cause unwanted behavior. The error message may be unrelated to the RPC function you are
currently building and testing.
See further explanation and troubleshooting onthis post.
The annotation can take a number of arguments, which have default values.@rpcis equivalent to:
```
@rpc("authority", "call_remote", "reliable", 0)
```
```
[Rpc(MultiplayerApi.RpcMode.Authority, CallLocal = false, TransferMode = MultiplayerPeer.TransferModeEnum.Reliable, TransferChannel = 0)]
```
The parameters and their functions are as follows:
mode:
- "authority": Only the multiplayer authority can call remotely.
The authority is the server by default, but can be changed per-node usingNode.set_multiplayer_authority.
"authority": Only the multiplayer authority can call remotely.
The authority is the server by default, but can be changed per-node usingNode.set_multiplayer_authority.
- "any_peer": Clients are allowed to call remotely. Useful for transferring user input.
"any_peer": Clients are allowed to call remotely. Useful for transferring user input.
sync:
- "call_remote": The function will not be called on the local peer.
"call_remote": The function will not be called on the local peer.
- "call_local": The function can be called on the local peer. Useful when the server is also a player.
"call_local": The function can be called on the local peer. Useful when the server is also a player.
transfer_mode:
- "unreliable"Packets are not acknowledged, can be lost, and can arrive at any order.
"unreliable"Packets are not acknowledged, can be lost, and can arrive at any order.
- "unreliable_ordered"Packets are received in the order they were sent in. This is achieved by ignoring packets that arrive later if another that was sent after them has already been received. Can cause packet loss if used incorrectly.
"unreliable_ordered"Packets are received in the order they were sent in. This is achieved by ignoring packets that arrive later if another that was sent after them has already been received. Can cause packet loss if used incorrectly.
- "reliable"Resend attempts are sent until packets are acknowledged, and their order is preserved. Has a significant performance penalty.
"reliable"Resend attempts are sent until packets are acknowledged, and their order is preserved. Has a significant performance penalty.
transfer_channelis the channel index.
The first 3 can be passed in any order, buttransfer_channelmust always be last.
The functionmultiplayer.get_remote_sender_id()can be used to get the unique id of an rpc sender, when used within the function called by rpc.
```
func _on_some_input(): # Connected to some input.
    transfer_some_input.rpc_id(1) # Send the input only to the server.

# Call local is required if the server is also a player.
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func transfer_some_input():
    # The server knows who sent the input.
    var sender_id = multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id()
    # Process the input and affect game logic.
```
```
private void OnSomeInput() // Connected to some input.
{
    RpcId(1, MethodName.TransferSomeInput); // Send the input only to the server.
}

// Call local is required if the server is also a player.
[Rpc(MultiplayerApi.RpcMode.AnyPeer, CallLocal = true, TransferMode = MultiplayerPeer.TransferModeEnum.Reliable)]
private void TransferSomeInput()
{
    // The server knows who sent the input.
    int senderId = Multiplayer.GetRemoteSenderId();
    // Process the input and affect game logic.
}
```

## Channels
Modern networking protocols support channels, which are separate connections within the connection. This allows for multiple
streams of packets that do not interfere with each other.
For example, game chat related messages and some of the core gameplay messages should all be sent reliably, but a gameplay
message should not wait for a chat message to be acknowledged. This can be achieved by using different channels.
Channels are also useful when used with the unreliable ordered transfer mode. Sending packets of variable size with this transfer mode can
cause packet loss, since packets which are slower to arrive are ignored. Separating them into multiple streams of homogeneous packets
by using channels allows ordered transfer with little packet loss, and without the latency penalty caused by reliable mode.
The default channel with index 0 is actually three different channels - one for each transfer mode.

## Example lobby implementation
This is an example lobby that can handle peers joining and leaving, notify UI scenes through signals, and start the game after all clients
have loaded the game scene.
```

# This will contain player info for every player,
# with the keys being each player's unique IDs.
var players = {}

# This is the local player info. This should be modified locally
# before the connection is made. It will be passed to every other peer.
# For example, the value of "name" can be set to something the player
# entered in a UI scene.

## Exporting for dedicated servers
Once you've made a multiplayer game, you may want to export it to run it on
a dedicated server with no GPU available. SeeExporting for dedicated serversfor more information.
Note
The code samples on this page aren't designed to run on a dedicated
server. You'll have to modify them so the server isn't considered to be a
player. You'll also have to modify the game starting mechanism so that the
first player who joins can start the game.
