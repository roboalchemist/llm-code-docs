Migration Guide: Dashboards 4.0.0, Grid Lite 2.0.0 & Grid Pro 2.0.0
===================================================================

Quick Start - Critical Changes
------------------------------

Before diving into the detailed migration guide, here are the most critical breaking changes:

*   **Grid Pro (DataGrid) is now a separate package** - must be installed and imported independently
*   **Columns use IDs instead of names** - update all `getColumnNames()` to `getColumnIds()`
*   **Components must use `renderTo`** - the `cell` option has been removed
*   **Replace `getJSON()` with `getData()`** - for Grid Lite and Grid Pro users
*   **Connector options are flattened** - move nested `options` content to top level
*   **`table.modified` is now `table.getModified()`** - property replaced with method
*   **`.highcharts-datagrid-` is now `.hcg-`** - replace all occurrences in CSS overrides

Overview
--------

This guide covers breaking changes when upgrading to the following versions:

| Product | From | To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashboards | 3.6.0 | 4.0.0 |
| Grid Lite | 1.4.0 | 2.0.0 |
| Grid Pro (DataGrid) | (bundled with Dashboards) | 2.0.0 (standalone) |

**Key Change:** Grid Pro (formerly DataGrid) is now distributed as a separate package. In versions prior to Dashboards 4.0.0, Grid Pro was bundled with Dashboards.

Who This Affects
----------------

*   **Dashboards + Grid Pro users**: Follow sections 1, 2, and 4
*   **Dashboards only users**: Follow sections 1 and 2
*   **Grid Lite users**: Follow sections 1 and 3
*   **Grid Pro standalone users**: Follow sections 1 and 4

* * *

1. Data Layer Breaking Changes
------------------------------

These changes apply to users of the Data Layer (standalone or within Dashboards). Grid-only users who don't use the Data Layer can skip this section.

### Column Identifiers: Names → IDs

**What changed:** All column references now use IDs instead of names.

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace `getColumnNames()` with `getColumnIds()`
*   Update event handlers that used `columnName` to use `columnId` or `columnIds`
*   Change any code iterating over `table.columns` by name to use IDs

**Example:**

// Before

const names = table.getColumnNames();

table.on('afterSetColumns', (e) => {

 console.log(e.columnName);

});

// After

const ids = table.getColumnIds();

table.on('afterSetColumns', (e) => {

 console.log(e.columnIds);

});

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `columnName is undefined` in your console, you need to replace it with `columnId`.

### DataTable.modified Property

**What changed:** To retrieve the modified table, use the `getModified()` method. While the old `modified` property is still available, it's not defined when the table hasn't been modified (the `getModified()` method results in a reference to the original, non-modified table in such cases).

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace `table.modified` with `table.getModified()` if you want to keep the old way of functioning
*   Remove references to `DataTable.NULL` and `DataTable.isNull()` (both removed)
*   Use empty-object checks instead of null-row helpers

**Note:** When a table is not modified, it no longer has the `modified` field defined. In such cases, `getModified()` returns a reference to the table itself.

**Example:**

// Before

const modifiedData = table.modified;

// After

const modifiedData = table.getModified();

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `Cannot read property 'modified' of undefined`, replace `table.modified` with `table.getModified()`.

### Data Connector Options Flattening

**What changed:** Connector configurations no longer nest options in a sub-object.

**Migration steps:**

*   Move nested `options` content to the top level
*   Ensure each connector has `id` and `type` at the top level
*   Update `dataTables` array format

**Example:**

// Before

dataPool: {

 connectors: [{

 id: 'my-connector',

 type: 'CSV',

 options: {

 csv: `Product,Price

 Apples,1.5

 Oranges,2.0`,

 // ... other options

 },

 dataTables: [{

 key: 'myTable'

 // ... table options

 }]

 }]

}

// After

dataPool: {

 connectors: [{

 id: 'my-connector',

 type: 'CSV',

 csv: `Product,Price

 Apples,1.5

 Oranges,2.0`,

 // ... other options

 dataTables: [{

 key: 'myTable'

 // ... table options

 }]

 }]

}

Copy

**Common error:** If your connector fails to load or you see `options is not recognized`, you need to flatten your connector configuration.

### DataConnector API Changes

**What changed:** Several properties and methods were removed or renamed. Connector events now only expose external payloads. Internal objects such as the parsed DataTable instances are no longer included (`e.tables`)—grab them from the connector itself (`connector.getTable()`, `connector.dataTables`) instead.

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace `connector.table` with `connector.getTable()`
*   Remove calls to `connector.save()` and `connector.whatIs()` (removed)
*   Remove uses of `e.tables` in events

**Common error:** If you see `connector.table is undefined`, replace it with `connector.getTable()`.

### Data Modifier Simplification

**What changed:** Incremental modification hooks removed.

**Migration steps:**

*   Consolidate all modifier logic into `modifyTable()` method
*   Remove implementations of `modifyRows()`, `modifyColumns()`, and `modifyCell()`
*   Ensure `modifyTable()` returns the modified table

### DataConverter Updates

**What changed:** Helper methods moved to DataConverterUtils, the type guessing API changed, and custom converters must now return column collections instead of DataTables.

**Migration steps:**

1.   **Rename Helper Usage**

    *   `converter.asGuessedType(value)` → `converter.convertByType(value)`
    *   Use helpers from `DataConverterUtils` namespace (e.g., `DataConverterUtils.trim()`, `DataConverterUtils.asNumber()`)

2.   **Update Custom Connectors/Converters**

    *   `DataConverter.getTable()` was removed
    *   `DataConnector.CreateConverterFunction` no longer receives the `DataTable` as an argument

**Code Example:**

**Before (3.6):**

const converter = new CustomConverter(table);

converter.parse(payload);

table.setColumns(converter.getTable().getColumns());

Copy

**After (4.0):**

const converter = new CustomConverter();

const columns = converter.parse(payload); // returns DataTable.ColumnCollection

table.setColumns(columns);

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `converter.getTable is not a function`, you need to update your converter to return columns directly.

* * *

2. Dashboards 4.0.0 Breaking Changes
------------------------------------

### Component Rendering

**What changed:** The deprecated `cell` option is now removed; components must use `renderTo`.

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace all `cell` options with `renderTo`
*   Update component configurations to explicitly specify render targets
*   Remove any code relying on implicit cell fallback

**Example:**

// Before

component: {

 type: 'Highcharts',

 cell: 'chart-cell'

}

// After

component: {

 type: 'Highcharts',

 renderTo: 'chart-cell'

}

Copy

**Common error:** If your components fail to render or you see `cell is not a valid option`, replace `cell` with `renderTo`.

### Column Assignment for Components

**What changed:** The deprecated `components[].columnAssignment` option has been removed.

**Migration steps:**

*   Move any component-level column assignment to `components[].connector.columnAssignment`
*   The connector-level `columnAssignment` option remains available and unchanged

**Note:** This only affects the deprecated component-level option. The commonly used `components[].connector.columnAssignment` is still fully supported.

**Example:**

// Before (deprecated)

component: {

 type: 'Highcharts',

 columnAssignment: {

 // ... mappings

 }

}

// After (use connector-level option)

component: {

 type: 'Highcharts',

 connector: {

 columnAssignment: {

 // ... mappings

 }

 }

}

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `columnAssignment is not recognized at component level`, move it to `connector.columnAssignment`.

### Component-Connector Integration

**What changed:** Connector load events and table access patterns changed.

**Migration steps:**

*   Remove listeners for `e.tables` in connector load events
*   Use component events: `component.emit({ type: 'tableChanged' })`
*   Access tables via `connector.getTable().getModified()`
*   Use `DataConverterUtils` helpers when patching connector tables

* * *

3. Grid Lite 2.0.0 Breaking Changes
-----------------------------------

### Column Resizing API

**What changed:**`ColumnDistribution` replaced with `ColumnResizing` and new mode system.

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace `Highcharts.DataGrid.ColumnDistribution` with `Highcharts.DataGrid.ColumnResizing`
*   Update `rendering.columns.distribution` to `rendering.columns.resizing.mode`
*   Map old values to new modes:
    *   `fixed` → `distributed` (only updates the dragged column)
    *   `mixed` → `adjacent` (resizes the column plus its neighbor)
    *   `full` → No direct equivalent (widths no longer maintained as shared percentages)
        *   **Recommendation**: Use `adjacent` or `distributed` mode and remove any CSS column width settings, as column widths are now fully managed by JavaScript

**Example:**

// Before (old 'mixed' strategy)

gridOptions: {

 rendering: {

 columns: {

 distribution: 'mixed'

 }

 }

}

// After

gridOptions: {

 rendering: {

 columns: {

 resizing: {

 mode: 'adjacent'

 }

 }

 }

}

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `distribution is not a valid option`, replace it with `resizing.mode`.

### Grid Data Export

**What changed:**`getJSON()` removed; `getData()` signature changed.

**Migration steps:**

*   Replace all `grid.getJSON()` calls with `grid.getData()`
*   Use `grid.getData(false)` when raw/unmodified table data is needed
*   Use `grid.getData(true)` (or `grid.getData()`) for formatted JSON (default)

**Example:**

// Before

const data = grid.getJSON();

// After

const data = grid.getData(); // formatted by default

const rawData = grid.getData(false); // unmodified

Copy

**Common error:** If you see `grid.getJSON is not a function`, replace it with `grid.getData()`.

* * *

4. Grid Pro 2.0.0 Breaking Changes
----------------------------------

### Separate Package Installation

**What changed:** Grid Pro is now distributed as a separate package.

**Migration steps:**

**For standalone Grid Pro users:**

1.   Install Grid Pro:

npm install @highcharts/grid-pro Copy 
2.   Import in your project:

**Option A - ESM (recommended for modern bundlers):**

import Grid from '@highcharts/grid-pro/es-modules/masters/grid-pro.src.js'; import '@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css'; Copy 
**Option B - Script tags (for browser):**

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@highcharts/grid-pro/grid-pro.js"></script> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css"> Copy 
**Option C - CommonJS:**

const Grid = require('@highcharts/grid-pro'); require('@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css'); Copy 

**For Dashboards + Grid Pro users:**

1.   Install both packages:

npm install @highcharts/dashboards @highcharts/grid-pro Copy 
2.   Import Grid Pro before Dashboards:

**Option A - ESM (recommended for modern bundlers):**

import Grid from '@highcharts/grid-pro/es-modules/masters/grid-pro.src.js'; import '@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css';  import Dashboards from '@highcharts/dashboards/es-modules/masters/dashboards.src.js'; import '@highcharts/dashboards/css/dashboards.css';  // Connect Grid Pro to Dashboards Dashboards.GridPlugin.custom.connectGrid(Grid); Dashboards.PluginHandler.addPlugin(Dashboards.GridPlugin); Copy 
**Option B - Script tags (for browser):**

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@highcharts/grid-pro/grid-pro.js"></script> <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/dashboards.js"></script> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/css/dashboards.css"> Copy 
**Option C - CommonJS:**

const Grid = require('@highcharts/grid-pro'); require('@highcharts/grid-pro/css/grid-pro.css');  const Dashboards = require('@highcharts/dashboards'); require('@highcharts/dashboards/css/dashboards.css');  // Connect Grid Pro to Dashboards Dashboards.GridPlugin.custom.connectGrid(Grid); Dashboards.PluginHandler.addPlugin(Dashboards.GridPlugin); Copy 

**Important Notes:**

*   Grid Pro must be imported/loaded before Dashboards
*   When using script tags, Grid Pro is served from jsDelivr CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`), while Dashboards is served from `code.highcharts.com`
*   Grid Pro CSS contains all Grid Lite styles, so you only need to include Grid Pro CSS (not Grid Lite CSS)

**Common error:** If you see `DataGrid is not defined` or Grid Pro features don't work, ensure Grid Pro is installed and imported before Dashboards.

### New CSS prefix

**What changed:** CSS class prefix in Grid Pro is now `.hcg-`.

**Migration steps:**

*   Change all occurrences of `.highcharts-datagrid-` to `.hcg-` in any custom styles overrides.
*   Recommended: use [theming variables](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/grid/theming/theming) instead of CSS overrides.

**Example:**

// Before

.highcharts-datagrid-row-even {background: #ccc;}

// After

.hcg-row-even {background: #ccc;}

// Recommended

--hcg-row-even-background: #ccc;
