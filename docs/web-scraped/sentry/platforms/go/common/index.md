On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK. If you are using our previous Go SDK, you can access the legacy SDK documentation, until further notice.

Check out the other SDKs we support in the left-hand dropdown.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an account and Sentry project established already, please head over to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/), and then return to this page.

## Install

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our Usage documentation.

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
