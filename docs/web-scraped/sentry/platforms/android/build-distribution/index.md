description: Upload Android builds to Sentry for distribution to internal teams and beta testers.

[Build Distribution](/product/build-distribution) helps you securely distribute Android builds to your internal teams and beta testers.

## Getting Started

**Accepted Formats**: APK (preferred) | AAB

- **APK**: Distributed as uploaded. You must ensure uploaded APKs are properly signed and universal (if required) before uploading. Using a consistent signing key allows users to update previously installed builds.
- **AAB (Android App Bundle)**: Build Distribution automatically converts AABs to universal APKs, but signs each upload with a unique key, which prevents users from updating previously installed builds.

**Upload Mechanisms**: [Gradle](#uploading-with-gradle) | [Sentry CLI](#uploading-with-the-sentry-cli)
