title: Set Up Metrics
description: "Metrics allow you to send, view and query counters, gauges and measurements from your Sentry-configured apps to track application health and drill down into related traces, logs, and errors."

With Sentry Metrics, you can send counters, gauges, distributions, and sets from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these metrics can be viewed alongside relevant errors, and searched using their individual attributes.

This feature is currently in open beta. Please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/discussions/18055) if you have feedback or questions. Features in beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
