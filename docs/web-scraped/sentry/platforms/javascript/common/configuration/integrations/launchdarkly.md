This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

The [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the LaunchDarkly SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and are sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.** This integration is available in Sentry SDK **versions 8.43.0 or higher.**

_Import names: `Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration` and `Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler`_

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
