description: "Adds module metadata to stack frames."

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

_Import name: `Sentry.moduleMetadataIntegration`_

Metadata can be injected by the Sentry bundler plugins using the `_experiments.moduleMetadata` config option.
Once this integration is added, the metadata passed to the bundler plugin will be added to the stack frames of all events under the `module_metadata` property. This can be used to help tag or route events from different teams
or sources.
