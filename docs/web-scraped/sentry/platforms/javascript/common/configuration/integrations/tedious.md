description: "Adds instrumentation for Tedious. (default)"
---

This integration only works in the Node.js and Bun runtimes. Requires SDK version `8.38.0` or higher.

_Import name: `Sentry.tediousIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default when performance monitoring is enabled. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `tediousIntegration` adds instrumentation for the `tedious` library to capture spans using [`@opentelemetry/instrumentation-tedious`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-tedious).

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.tediousIntegration()],
});
```
