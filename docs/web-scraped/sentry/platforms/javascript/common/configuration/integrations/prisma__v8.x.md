description: "Adds instrumentation for Prisma."

This integration only works in the Node.js and Bun runtimes.

_Import name: `Sentry.prismaIntegration`_

Sentry supports tracing [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) queries with the Prisma integration.

The Prisma Integrations creates a spans for each query and reports to Sentry with relevant details inside `description` if available.

## Prisma Version 6

The Sentry Prisma Integration comes with Prisma version 5 support by default. For Prisma version 6 compatibility we need to pass a specific version of the Prisma instrumentation to the Sentry Prisma integration.

To use the integration with Prisma version 6, first install the `@prisma/instrumentation` package on version 6 (ideally the exact same version as your `prisma` and `@prisma/client` packages).

Then, add the `prismaIntegration` to your Sentry initialization as follows:

```javascript {1,6-9}
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [
    Sentry.prismaIntegration({
      // Override the default instrumentation that Sentry uses
      prismaInstrumentation: new PrismaInstrumentation(),
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Prisma Version 5

To configure the integration for Prisma version 5, first add the `tracing` feature flag to the `generator` block of your Prisma schema:

```txt {tabTitle: Prisma Schema} {filename: schema.prisma} {3}
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

Then, add the `prismaIntegration` to your Sentry initialization as follows:

```javascript {3}
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [Sentry.prismaIntegration()],
});
```

## Options
