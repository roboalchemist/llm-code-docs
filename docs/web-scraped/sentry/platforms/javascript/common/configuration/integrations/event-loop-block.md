title: Event Loop Block
description: "Monitor for blocked event loops in all threads of a Node.js application."
---

This integration only works in the Node.js runtime.

_Import name: `eventLoopBlockIntegration` from `@sentry/node-native`_

The `eventLoopBlockIntegration` can be used to monitor for blocked event loops in all threads of a Node.js application. Stack traces are automatically captured when blocking is detected.

## Installation

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/node-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/node-native
```

## Usage

If you instrument your application via the Node.js `--import` flag, Sentry will be started and this instrumentation will be automatically applied to all worker threads.

`instrument.mjs`

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__YOUR_DSN__",
  // Monitor event loop blocking for more than 500ms (stack traces automatically captured)
  integrations: [eventLoopBlockIntegration({ threshold: 500 })],
});
```

`app.mjs`

```javascript
const worker = new Worker(new URL("./worker.mjs", import.meta.url));

// This main thread will be monitored for blocked event loops
```

`worker.mjs`

```javascript
// This worker thread will also be monitored for blocked event loops too
```

Start your application:

```bash
node --import instrument.mjs app.mjs
```

If a thread is blocked for more than the configured threshold, stack traces are automatically captured for all threads and sent to Sentry.

_(Available in version 6.9.0 and above)_

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [eventLoopBlockIntegration({ threshold: 500 })],
});
```

## Configuration Options

You can pass a configuration object to the `eventLoopBlockIntegration` to customize the behavior:

```typescript
interface ThreadBlockedIntegrationOptions {
  /**
   * Threshold in milliseconds to trigger an event.
   *
   * Defaults to 1000ms.
   */
  threshold: number;
  /**
   * Maximum number of blocked events to send per clock hour.
   *
   * Defaults to 1.
   */
  maxEventsPerHour: number;
  /**
   * Tags to include with blocked events.
   */
  staticTags: { [key: string]: Primitive };
}
```

## Example Configuration

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__YOUR_DSN__",
  integrations: [
    eventLoopBlockIntegration({
      threshold: 500, // Trigger after 500ms of blocking (stack traces automatically captured)
      maxEventsPerHour: 5, // Maximum 5 events per hour
      staticTags: {
        component: "main-thread",
        environment: "production",
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
