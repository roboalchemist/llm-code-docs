title: FileSystem
description: "Adds instrumentation for filesystem operations."
---

This integration only works in the Node.js and Bun runtimes.

_Import name: `Sentry.fsIntegration`_

The `fsIntegration` creates spans for `fs` API operations, like reading and writing files. The integration uses the [`@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fs) package.

  The `fsIntegration` may add significant overhead to your application.
  Especially in scenarios with a lot of file I/O, like for example when you are
  running a framework dev server, including this integration can massively slow
  down your application.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.fsIntegration()],
});
```

## Options

### `recordFilePaths`

_Type: `boolean | undefined`_

Setting this option to `true` will include any filepath arguments from your `fs` API calls as span attributes.
Defaults to `false`.

### `recordErrorMessagesAsSpanAttributes`

_Type: `boolean | undefined`_

Setting this option to `true` will include the error messages of failed `fs` API calls as a span attribute.
Defaults to `false`.
