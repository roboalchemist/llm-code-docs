title: Child Process Integration
description: "Adds instrumentation for child processes and worker threads (default)"
---

This integration only works in Node.js `>=20` and requires SDK version `8.39.0` or higher.

_Import name: `Sentry.childProcessIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read Modifying Default Integrations.

The `childProcessIntegration` captures breadcrumbs and events for `child_process` and `worker_threads` errors and `child_process` non-zero exit codes.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.childProcessIntegration()],
});
```

## Options

### `includeChildProcessArgs`

_Type: `boolean`_

If set to `true`, the integration will include the arguments used to start child processes.

### `captureWorkerErrors`

_Type: `boolean`_

By default, this option is `true`. If set to `false`, the integration will not capture errors from worker threads.
