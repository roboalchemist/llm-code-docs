This integration only works inside a browser environment.

_Import name: `Sentry.httpContextIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration attaches HTTP request information, such as URL, user-agent, referrer, and other headers, to the event.
It allows us to correctly catalog and tag events with specific OS, browser, and version information.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.httpContextIntegration()],
});
```
