## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Sentry supports multiple versions of React Router. To learn how to configure them, read the React Router Integration docs.

## Use

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our Usage documentation.

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
