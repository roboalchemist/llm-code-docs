description: "Upload your source maps with the Sentry esbuild Plugin."
---

This guide assumes you're using a Sentry **SDK version `7.47.0` or higher**. If you're on an older version and you want to upload source maps, we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

The Sentry esbuild plugin doesn't fully support esbuild configurations with `splitting: true`.
If you rely on code splitting, use the esbuild plugin with legacy source maps upload
or Sentry CLI to upload source maps instead.

You can use the Sentry esbuild plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure source map uploading with esbuild is by using the Sentry Wizard:

If you want to configure source map uploading with esbuild manually, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

Install the Sentry esbuild plugin:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/esbuild-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/esbuild-plugin --dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/esbuild-plugin --save-dev
```

### Configure

To upload source maps you have to configure an [Organization Token](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/).

Alternatively, you can also use a [Personal Token](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/), with the "Project: Read & Write" and "Release: Admin" permissions.

Auth tokens can be passed to the plugin explicitly with the `authToken` option, with a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, or with an `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file (don't forget to add it to your `.gitignore` file, as this is sensitive data) in the working directory when building your project.
We recommend you add the auth token to your CI/CD environment as an environment variable.

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry esbuild Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/esbuild-plugin).

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Example:

```javascript {filename:esbuild.config.js}
const { sentryEsbuildPlugin } = require("@sentry/esbuild-plugin");

require("esbuild").build({
  sourcemap: "hidden", // Source map generation must be turned on ("hidden", true, etc.)
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry esbuild plugin after all other plugins
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      sourcemaps: {
        // As you're enabling client source maps, you probably want to delete them after they're uploaded to Sentry.
        // Set the appropriate glob pattern for your output folder - some glob examples below:
        filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ["./**/*.map", ".*/**/public/**/*.map", "./dist/**/client/**/*.map"]
      }
    }),
  ],
});
```

  Generating source maps **may expose them to the public**, potentially causing your
  source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to
  deny access to `.js.map` files, or by using [Sentry Esbuild Plugin's
  `sourcemaps.filesToDeleteAfterUpload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/esbuild-plugin#sourcemapsfilestodeleteafterupload)
  option to delete source maps after they've been uploaded to Sentry.

The Sentry esbuild plugin doesn't upload source maps in watch-mode/development-mode.
We recommend running a production build to test your configuration.
