In this guide, you'll learn how to successfully upload source maps using our `sentry-cli` tool.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure source map uploading using the Sentry CLI is with Sentry's Wizard:

If you want to configure source map uploading using the CLI, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

### 1. Generate Source Maps

You can generate source maps using the tooling of your choice. See examples from other guides linked under Uploading Source Maps.

## Fixing Angular Service Worker caching issues

If you use the [Angular service worker](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers), you might encounter caching issues when uploading source maps with Sentry CLI.
This happens because Sentry CLI injects debugIds into the generated JavaScript chunks after the build process.
This means that the file hashes in `ngsw.json` for these chunks become invalid.
To resolve the invalid hashes, regenerate `ngsw.json` after the debugIds have been injected using the following command:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/ngsw-config <dist> <config>
```

- `dist` Path to the built chunk files. The `ngsw.json` with the old hashes should be located there.
- `config` Location of `ngsw-config.json` (should be in project root)
