Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

### Parameterized Transaction Names

To get parameterized transaction names (for example, `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid` instead of `/teams/123/user/345`), you must explicitly set the routes you want parameterized. That's because there is no static route config that the SDK can use in React Router v4/v5.

We recommend you use the `withSentryRouting` higher order component to create a `SentryRoute` component that will update the match path on render.

```javascript {1, 7, 14-16, 28-30}
// Create Custom Sentry Route component
const SentryRoute = Sentry.withSentryRouting(Route);

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration({ history }),
    // OR
    Sentry.reactRouterV4BrowserTracingIntegration({ history }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

render() {
  return (
    
      
         <div>UserId</div>} />
         <div>Users</div>} />
         <div>Home</div>} />
      
    
  );
}
```

If you don't want to wrap individual routes, you can still specify parameterized routes manually by passing an array of route config objects, per [react-router-config](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config), to the instrumentation function call. You'll also need to provide the `matchPath` function exported from the `react-router-dom` or `react-router` packages.

```javascript {1,8-10,15-19}
const history = createBrowserHistory();

// Array of Route Config Objects
// Make sure the order of the routes is correct. The longest url under the same parent should be placed first and in decreasing order.
const routes = [{ path: '/users/:userid' }, { path: '/users' }, { path: '/' }];

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration({
      history,
      routes,
      matchPath
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// In your App render:
render() {
  return (
    
      
          <div>UserId</div>} />
          <div>Users</div>} />
          <div>Home</div>} />
      
    
  );
}
```
