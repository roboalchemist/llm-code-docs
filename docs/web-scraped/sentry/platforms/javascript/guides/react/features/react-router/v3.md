To use the router integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation and pass it the history, your routes and a match function. React Router v3 support is maintained for React Router >= 3.2.0 and < 4.0.0.

```javascript {18-23}
// Routes looks like this:
const routes = (
  
    
       <div>OrgId</div>} />
       <div>Team</div>} />
    
  
);

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV3BrowserTracingIntegration({
      history: Router.browserHistory,
      // Must be Plain Routes.
      routes: Router.createRoutes(routes),
      match: Router.match,
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
