If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that Tracing is enabled.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using custom instrumentation.
- Enable debug mode in the SDK and check the logs.
