title: OpenTelemetry Agent With Auto Init
description: "Using OpenTelemetry with sentry-opentelemetry-agent and AUTO_INIT enabled."

If you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined, and then initialize Sentry automatically. You'll just need to configure your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate`.
