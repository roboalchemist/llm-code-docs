If you do not want to use our recommended Java Agent, we also offer a dependency that allows you to use OpenTelemetry with Sentry.

## Install

## Usage

You'll have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.
