If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/organization/integrations/troubleshooting).

This integration renders "View issues in Sentry" links next to error throwing statements in Sourcegraph. The links direct to the corresponding issues pages in Sentry. Sourcegraph is a universal code search and intelligence platform that helps developers understand, fix, and automate changes across their entire codebase.

You can find [installation instructions here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-sentry).
