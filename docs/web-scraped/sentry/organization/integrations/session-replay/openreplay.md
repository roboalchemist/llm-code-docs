If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/organization/integrations/troubleshooting).

OpenReplay is a session replay tool for developers. Replay each user session alongside your front/backend logs and other data spread across your stack so you can immediately find, reproduce, and fix bugs faster.

You can find [installation instructions here](https://docs.openreplay.com/integrations/sentry).
