Sentry AI Agent Monitoring helps you track and debug AI agent applications using our supported SDKs and integrations. Monitor your complete agent workflows from user interaction to final response, including tool calls, model interactions, and custom logic.

To start sending AI agent data to Sentry, make sure you've created a Sentry project for your AI-enabled repository and follow one of the guides below:

- [Python](/platforms/python/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/ai-agents-module)
- [Node.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/tracing/instrumentation/ai-agents-module/)
- [Browser (JavaScript)](/platforms/javascript/tracing/instrumentation/ai-agents-module-browser/)
- [.NET](/platforms/dotnet/tracing/instrumentation/ai-agents-module/)

You can also instrument AI agents manually by following our [manual instrumentation guides](/platforms/python/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/ai-agents-module).
