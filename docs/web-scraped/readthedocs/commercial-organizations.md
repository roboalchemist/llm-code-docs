# Organizations[](#organizations "Link to this heading")

Note

This feature is only available on [Read the Docs for Business](https://app.readthedocs.com/).

In this article, we explain how the *organizations* feature allows you to manage access to your projects. On Read the Docs for Business, your account is linked to an *organization*. Organizations allow you to define both individual and team permissions for your projects.

## Important objects[](#important-objects "Link to this heading")

-   **Owners** -- Get full access to both view and edit the organization and all projects

-   **Members** -- Get access to a subset of the organization projects

-   **Teams** -- Where you give members access to a set of projects.

The best way to think about this relationship is:

*Owners* will create *Teams* to assign permissions to all *Members*.

Warning

Owners, Members, and Teams behave differently if you are using [[Single sign-on with GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab]](single-sign-on.html#sso-git-provider).
