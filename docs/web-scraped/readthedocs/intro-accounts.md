# Account authentication methods[](#account-authentication-methods "Link to this heading")

Read the Docs supports several authentication methods for creating an account and logging in. The method you choose depends on your preferences and the security requirements of your organization.

These authentication methods are not mutually exclusive; you can use multiple methods to access your account.
