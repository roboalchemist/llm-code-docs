Read the Docs simplifies managing software documentation by building and hosting your docs automatically, using the Git workflow you already use for code. Treating documentation like code lets your team use tools they already know, and makes keeping your docs updated easier.

Up to date documentation

:   Whenever you push code to Git, Read the Docs will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are always up-to-date. Get started with our [[tutorial]](tutorial/index.html).

Documentation for every version

:   Read the Docs can host multiple versions of your docs. Keep your 1.0 and 2.0 documentation online, pulled directly from Git. Start hosting all your [[versions]](versions.html).

Open source and user focused

:   Our company is bootstrapped and 100% user-focused, so our product gets better for our users instead of our investors. Read the Docs Community hosts documentation for over 100,000 large and small open source projects at no cost. Read the Docs for Business supports hundreds of organizations with product and internal documentation. Learn more about these differences on [our pricing page](https://about.readthedocs.com/pricing/).
