# How to structure your documentation[](#how-to-structure-your-documentation "Link to this heading")

A documentation project's ultimate goal is to be read and understood by a reader. Readers need to be able to [[discover]](../glossary.html#term-discoverability) the information that they need. Without an defined structure, readers either won't find information that they need or get frustrated on the way.

One of the largest benefits of a good structure is that it removes questions that keep authors from writing documentation. Starting with a blank page is often the hardest part of documentation, so anything we can do to remove this problem is a win.

## Choosing a structure[](#choosing-a-structure "Link to this heading")

Good news! You don't have to invent all of the structure yourself, since a lot of experience-based work has been done to come up with a universal documentation structure.

In order to avoid starting with a blank page, we recommend a simple process:

-   Choose a structure for your documentation. We recommend [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) for this.

-   Find a [[example project]](../examples.html) or template to start from.

-   Start writing by filling in the structure.

This process helps you get started quickly, and helps keep things consistent for the reader of your documentation.
