# Status badges[](#status-badges "Link to this heading")

Status badges let you show the state of your documentation to your users. They will show if the latest build has passed, failed, or is in an unknown state. They are great for embedding in your README, or putting inside your actual doc pages.

You can see a badge in action in the [Read the Docs README](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/main/README.rst).

## Display states[](#display-states "Link to this heading")

Badges have the following states which can be shown to users:

-   **Green**: [`passing`] - the last build was successful.

-   **Red**: [`failing`] - the last build failed.

-   **Yellow**: [`unknown`] - we couldn't figure out the status of your last build.

An example of each is shown here:
