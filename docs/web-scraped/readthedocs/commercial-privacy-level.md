# Privacy levels[](#privacy-levels "Link to this heading")

Note

This feature is only available on [Read the Docs for Business](https://app.readthedocs.com/).

Privacy levels allow you to set the visibility of your project and its versions. This allows you to specify what information is available to the public and what is private. Privacy can be controlled at the level of the project and each version, and nothing more granular (eg. specific directories or URLs) can be controlled.

## Project privacy[](#project-privacy "Link to this heading")

By default, only users that belong to your organization can see the dashboard of your project and its builds. If you want users outside your organization to be able to see the dashboard of your project, and the build output of *public versions* you can set the privacy level of your project to [`Public`].

You can set the project privacy level in your [[dashboard]](../glossary.html#term-dashboard) by navigating to [Admin ‣ Settings] and changing [Privacy level] to [`Public`].

**Making a project public doesn't give access to any versions.** So if you want all your versions to be accessible, you need to configure those to be [`Public`] as well.
