# Offline formats (PDF, ePub, HTML)[](#offline-formats-pdf-epub-html "Link to this heading")

This page will provide an overview of a core Read the Docs feature: building docs in multiple formats.

Read the Docs supports the following formats by default:

-   PDF

-   ePub

-   Zipped HTML

This means that every commit that you push will automatically update your offline formats as well as your documentation website.

## Use cases[](#use-cases "Link to this heading")

This functionality is great for anyone who needs documentation when they aren't connected to the internet. Users who are about to get on a plane can grab a single file and have the entire documentation during their trip. Many academic and scientific projects benefit from these additional formats.

PDF versions are also helpful to automatically **create printable versions of your documentation**. The source of your documentation will be structured to support both online and offline formats. This means that a documentation project displayed as a website can be downloaded as a PDF, ready to be printed as a report or a book.

Offline formats also support having the entire documentation in a single file. Your entire documentation can now be delivered as an email attachment, uploaded to an eReader, or accessed and searched locally without online latency. This makes your documentation project **easy to redistribute or archive**.
