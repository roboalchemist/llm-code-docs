# Security logs[](#security-logs "Link to this heading")

Security logs allow you to audit what has happened recently in your organization or account. This feature is quite important for many security compliance programs, as well as the general peace of mind of knowing what is happening on your account. We store the IP address and the browser used on each event, so that you can confirm this access was from the intended person.

Security logs are only visible to organization owners. You can invite other team members as owners.

## User security log[](#user-security-log "Link to this heading")

We store a user security log for the latest 90 days of activity. This log is useful to validate that no unauthorized events have occurred.

The security log tracks the following events:

-   Authentication on the dashboard.

-   Authentication on documentation pages ([[Business hosting]](commercial/index.html) only).

-   When invitations to manage a project are sent, accepted, revoked or declined.

Authentication failures and successes are both tracked.

Logs are available in [\<Username dropdown\> ‣ Settings ‣ Security Log].
