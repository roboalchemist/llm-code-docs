# Adding a documentation project[](#adding-a-documentation-project "Link to this heading")

This page takes you through the process of adding a documentation project to Read the Docs. If you have [[connected your Read the Docs account]](../guides/connecting-git-account.html) to GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, and you have admin access to the repository you want to add, you will be able to add your project automatically. Otherwise, you will need to add it manually and perform some extra steps.

4.  Click on [Continue].

5.  Edit any of the pre-filled fields with information of the repository.

6.  Click on [Next].
