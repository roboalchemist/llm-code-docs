Your Read the Docs account can be connected to your Git provider's account. Connecting your account provides the following features:

🔑️ Easy login

:   Log in to Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab account.

🔁️ List your projects

:   Select a project to automatically import from all your Git repositories and organizations. See: [[Adding a documentation project]](../intro/add-project.html).

⚙️ Automatic configuration

:   Have your Git repository automatically configured with your Read the Docs [[webhook]](../glossary.html#term-webhook), which allows Read the Docs to build your docs on every change to your repository.

🚥️ Commit status

:   See your documentation build status as a commit status indicator on [[pull request builds]](../pull-requests.html).

:   Using a different provider? You can configure it manually. Read the Docs still supports other providers such as Gitea or GitHub Enterprise.

## Getting started[](#getting-started "Link to this heading")

✅️ Signed up with your Git provider?

:   If you signed up or logged in to Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab credentials, you're all done. Your account is connected.

    The rest of this guide explains how the automatic configuration works.

⏩️️ Signed up with your email address?

:   If you have signed up to Read the Docs with your email address, you can add the connection to the Git provider afterward. You can also add a connection to an additional Git provider this way.

    Please follow [[How to connect your Read the Docs account to your Git provider]](../guides/connecting-git-account.html) in this case.

Once you have your account connected, you can follow the [[Adding a documentation project]](../intro/add-project.html) guide to actually add your project to Read the Docs.
