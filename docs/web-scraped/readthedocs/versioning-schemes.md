# URL versioning schemes[](#url-versioning-schemes "Link to this heading")

The URL versioning scheme of your project defines the URL of your documentation, and if your project supports multiple versions or translations.

Read the Docs supports three different versioning schemes:

-   [Multiple versions with translations](#multiple-versions-with-translations).

-   [Multiple versions without translations](#multiple-versions-without-translations).

-   [Single version without translations](#single-version-without-translations).

## Multiple versions with translations[](#multiple-versions-with-translations "Link to this heading")

This is the default versioning scheme, it's the recommend one if your project has multiple versions, and has or plans to support translations.

The URLs of your documentation will look like:

-   [`/en/latest/`]

-   [`/en/1.5/`]

-   [`/es/latest/install.html`]

-   [`/es/1.5/contributing.html`]
