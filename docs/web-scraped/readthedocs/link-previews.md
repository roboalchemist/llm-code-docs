# Link previews[](#link-previews "Link to this heading")

Link previews allows you to see the content of the link you are about to click when you hover over it. This gives you the ability to quickly preview where a link points, so you can keep your context while reading but learn more from other resources.

Link previews will only be generated for internal links--links that point to pages within your documentation site. No link previews will be generated for links to external sites or links that appear outside of the primary content of the documentation page (eg. nav bars).

You can see an example of a link preview by hovering over the following link: [[Addons]](addons.html).
