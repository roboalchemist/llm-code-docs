# Search analytics[](#search-analytics "Link to this heading")

When someone visits your documentation and uses the built-in [[server side search]](server-side-search/index.html) feature, Read the Docs will collect analytics on their search queries.

These are aggregated into a simple view of the "Top queries in the past 30 days". You can also download this data.

This is helpful to optimize your documentation in alignment with your readers' interests. You can discover new trends and expand your documentation to new needs.
