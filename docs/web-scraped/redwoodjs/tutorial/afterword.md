# Afterword

</div>

You made it! Get yourself some ice cream or a slice of pie: you definitely deserve it.

Will there be a chapters 8+ of the tutorial? We\'ve spent a lot of time getting our features working but not much time with optimization and polish. [Premature optimization is the root of all evil](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization), but once your site is live and you\'ve got real users on it you\'ll get a sense of what could be faster, prettier or more efficient. That\'s when time spent optimizing can pay huge dividends. But, discovering the techniques and best practices for those optimizations\...that\'s a whole different story. The kind of story that Redwood loves to help you write!

So until next time, a bit of wisdom to help combat that next bout of every developer\'s nemesis, imposter syndrome:
