Once you&#x27;ve purchased a subscription, you should receive an email from Semgrep with your license information. Follow the instructions provided in the email to claim your license and begin onboarding your Semgrep products.

## For license key holders or manual license claims[​](#for-license-key-holders-or-manual-license-claims)
cautionFor **single-tenant** users, reach out to the [Semgrep Support Team](https://semgrep.dev/docs/support) directly. Please do not attempt to claim a license manually.

If you have been provided a license key by Semgrep or if you would like to claim a license manually:

- Sign up or log in to your Semgrep account.
- [Create an org](/docs/deployment/create-account-and-orgs#initial-sign-in-to-semgrep-appsec-platform) if you haven&#x27;t already done so.
- Navigate to `http://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/upgrade/YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`, making sure that you **replace** the `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` placeholder with your license key value.
