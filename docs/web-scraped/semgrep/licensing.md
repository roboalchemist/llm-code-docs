The following is a list of products offered by Semgrep, Inc., along with their license information.

Semgrep RegistryThe [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) is a collection of rules and rulesets:

- All rules, which includes both Community and Pro rules, listed in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-rules) repository are licensed under [Semgrep Rules License v.1.0](https://semgrep.dev/legal/rules-license). They are available only for internal business use. Vendors cannot use Semgrep-maintained rules in competing products or SaaS offerings. Individuals, security consultants, and companies are welcome to use the rules internally. - Rules from third-party repositories in the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) inherit the licenses of their source repositories. These licenses are displayed within the rule definition in the editor.
