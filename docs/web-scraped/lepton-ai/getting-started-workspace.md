# Workspace

Copy page

Learn what a workspace is and how to create and manage a workspace on DGX Cloud Lepton.

A workspace is a virtual environment that provides a set of tools and resources for managing your infrastructure and workloads.

## Create Workspace

### NVIDIA Cloud Account

Before creating a workspace on DGX Cloud Lepton, you need a valid [NVIDIA Cloud Account (NCA)](https://cloudaccounts.nvidia.com/) and access to the DGX Cloud Lepton platform. After logging into DGX Cloud Lepton with your NCA, a workspace is generated automatically.

### Activate Workspace

Given that DGX Cloud Lepton is in early access, your workspace must be activated after it is created. A banner will appear indicating your workspace is not yet activated. Follow the instructions to apply for access on the [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/dgx-cloud/get-lepton) website.

After you apply, NVIDIA will review your application and contact you.

### External SSO Integration

DGX Cloud Lepton can integrate with an external SSO/IdP to centralize user authentication and manage access to NVIDIA cloud services. To get started, refer to [NGC External SSO](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/latest/ngc-user-guide.html#using-an-external-sso-for-ngc-org-authentication). Contact your NVIDIA TAM if you have questions.

## Next Steps

DGX Cloud Lepton provides many features to help you manage your workspace. Learn more:
