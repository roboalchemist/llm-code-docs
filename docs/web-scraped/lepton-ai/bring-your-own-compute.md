# Introduction to BYOC

Copy page

Learn how to bring your own compute to DGX Cloud Lepton.

DGX Cloud Lepton allows you to seamlessly integrate your own compute infrastructure, providing enterprise-grade workload management capabilities.

## What is Bring Your Own Compute?

Bring Your Own Compute (BYOC) is a feature that enables you to use your existing hardware infrastructure with Lepton's platform. This approach offers several advantages:

  * Leverage your existing hardware investments
  * Maintain control over your physical infrastructure
  * Unify your compute resources under Lepton's management interface
  * Access Lepton's enterprise-grade orchestration capabilities



## Getting Started with BYOC

To start using your own compute with Lepton, follow these steps:

  1. Review Requirements: Ensure your machines meet the BYOC Requirements for hardware, software, network, and storage configurations.
  2. Create a Node Group: Before importing machines, create a node group to organize your compute resources.
  3. Add Your Machines: Use either SSH or GPUd to add machines to your node group.
  4. Manage Your Nodes: After importing, manage your BYOC nodes through the node group management interface.
