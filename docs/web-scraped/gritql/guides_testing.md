# Testing GritQL

If you are crafting a complex query, we recommend iterating on test cases to ensure that your query behaves as expected.

Run the `grit patterns test` command to test all defined patterns in your repo. You can also use `--filter` to run a subset of patterns.

```shell
grit patterns test --filter=pattern_to_test
```

## Markdown format

Reusable queries and test cases can be bundled together in a Markdown file to create a pattern. This allows you to combine documentation, GritQL, and source code examples in a single file.

The markdown file should be placed in a `.grit/patterns` folder at the root of your repo. It can be formatted however you like, so long as you follow these conventions:

- The `name` of the file is used as the name of the pattern (without the `.md` extension).
- The `title` of the pattern is retrieved from the first heading in the file. This can be overridden by adding a `title` field in the front matter.
- The `description` of the pattern is retrieved from the first non-heading paragraph in the file.
- The GritQL `body` is retrieved from the first fenced code block in the file.
- Additional pattern metadata can be configured as YAML in the frontmatter of the markdown file, delineated between `---` lines at the start of the document.
  - `level`: (Optional, one of `none`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) The enforcement level of the pattern for running diagnostics via `grit check`. Defaults to `info`.
  - `tags`: (Optional, `string[]`) A list of tags which can be used to filter patterns.

Subheadings are used for each test case, following these conventions:

- If a subheading has a single code block, it represents a test case that should be matched by the pattern. You don't need to provide a transformed example.
- If a subheading has two code blocks, the first represents the input and the second represents the expected output.
- A negative test case should have two identical code blocks.
- Within the sample patterns, you can use `// @filename: example.js` to represent multiple input/output files that should be tested as a group - like [this example](https://github.com/getgrit/stdlib/blob/main/.grit/patterns/js/split_trpc_router.md?plain=1#L129).

### Markdown example

````markdown
.grit/patterns/remove_console_log.md---
tags: [optional, tags, here]
---
# Remove console.log

Remove console.log in production code.

```grit
`console.log($_)` => .
```

## Test case one

This is the first test case. You can include an explanation of the case here.

```typescript
console.error("keep this");
console.log('remove this!');
```

It is fine to include additional descriptive text around the test cases.
This is often used to explain the context of the test case, or to explain a convention.

```typescript
console.error("keep this");
```
````

You can find many more examples in the [Grit standard library](https://github.com/getgrit/stdlib/tree/main/.grit/patterns).

## YAML format

If you define patterns directly in the `.grit/grit.yaml` [file](http://localhost:3200/guides/config#configuration-reference), you can also include before and after test cases underneath the `samples` key. Each sample *must* include a `input` and `output` key.

### YAML example

```yaml
patterns:
  - name: avoid_only
    body: |
      `$testlike.only` => `$testlike` where {
        `$testlike` <: or {
          `describe`
          `it`
          `test`
        }
      }
    samples:
      - input: |
          describe.only('this is a test', () => {
            // ...
          });
        output: |
          describe('this is a test', () => {
            // ...
          });
```
