# Compliance validation for AWS SDK for Go

To learn whether an AWS service is within the scope of specific compliance programs, see [AWS services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) and choose the compliance program that you are interested in. For general information, see [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).

You can download third-party audit reports using AWS Artifact. For more information, see [Downloading Reports in AWS Artifact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/artifact/latest/ug/downloading-documents.html).

Your compliance responsibility when using AWS services is determined by the sensitivity of your data, your company's compliance objectives, and applicable laws and regulations. For more information about your compliance responsibility when using AWS services, see [AWS Security Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/).
