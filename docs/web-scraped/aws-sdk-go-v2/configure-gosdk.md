Loading AWS Shared Configuration FilesSpecifying the AWS RegionSpecifying Credentials

# Configure the SDK

In the AWS SDK for Go V2, you can configure common settings for service clients, such as the logger, log level, and retry configuration. Most settings are optional. However, for each service client, you must specify an AWS Region and your credentials. The SDK uses these values to send requests to the correct Region and sign requests with the correct credentials. You can specify these values as programmatically in code or via the execution environment. 

## Loading AWS Shared Configuration Files

There are a number of ways to initialize a service API client, but the following is the most common pattern recommended to users. 

To configure the SDK to use the AWS shared configuration files, use the following code: 
    
    
    import (
      "context"
      "log"
      "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
    )
    
    // ...
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("failed to load configuration, %v", err)
    }
    

`config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())` will construct an [aws.Config](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#Config) using the AWS shared configuration sources. This includes configuring a credential provider, configuring the AWS Region, and loading service specific configuration. Service clients can be constructed using the loaded `aws.Config`, providing a consistent pattern for constructing clients. 

For more information about AWS shared configuration files, see [ Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/creds-config-files.html) in the AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide. 

## Specifying the AWS Region

When you specify the Region, you specify where to send requests, such as `us-west-2` or `us-east-2`. For a list of Regions for each service, see [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. 

The SDK does not have a default Region. To specify a Region: 

  * Set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable to the default Region. 

  * Set the region explicitly using [config.WithRegion](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/blob/config/v0.2.2/config/provider.go#L127) as an argument to `config.LoadDefaultConfig` when loading configuration. 




REVIEW: If you set a Region using all of these techniques, the SDK uses the Region you explicitly specified. 

### Configure Region with Environment Variable

#### Linux, macOS, or Unix
    
    
    export AWS_REGION=us-west-2

#### Windows
    
    
    set AWS_REGION=us-west-2

### Specify Region Programmatically
    
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), config.WithRegion("us-west-2"))

## Specifying Credentials

The AWS SDK for Go requires credentials (an access key and secret access key) to sign requests to AWS. You can specify your credentials in several locations, depending on your particular use case. For information about obtaining credentials, see [Get started with AWS SDK for Go](./getting-started.html). 

When you initialize an `aws.Config` instance using `config.LoadDefaultConfig`, the SDK uses its default credential chain to find AWS credentials. This default credential chain looks for credentials in the following order: 

  1. Environment variables. 

     1. Static Credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) 

     2. Web Identity Token (`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`) 

  2. Shared configuration files. 

     1. SDK defaults to `credentials` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer. 

     2. SDK defaults to `config` file under `.aws` folder that is placed in the home folder on your computer. 

  3. If your application uses an Amazon ECS task definition or RunTask API operation, IAM role for tasks. 

  4. If your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, IAM role for Amazon EC2. 




The SDK detects and uses the built-in providers automatically, without requiring manual configurations. For example, if you use IAM roles for Amazon EC2 instances, your applications automatically use the instance's credentials. You don't need to manually configure credentials in your application. 

As a best practice, AWS recommends that you specify credentials in the following order: 

  1. Use IAM roles for tasks if your application uses an Amazon ECS task definition or RunTask API operation. 

  2. Use IAM roles for Amazon EC2 (if your application is running on an Amazon EC2 instance). 

IAM roles provide applications on the instance temporary security credentials to make AWS calls. IAM roles provide an easy way to distribute and manage credentials on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. 

  3. Use shared credentials or config files. 

The credentials and config files are shared across other AWS SDKs and AWS CLI. As a security best practice, we recommend using credentials file for setting sensitive values such as access key IDs and secret keys. Here are the [formatting requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) for each of these files. 

  4. Use environment variables. 

Setting environment variables is useful if you're doing development work on a machine other than an Amazon EC2 instance. 




### IAM Roles for Tasks

If your application uses an Amazon ECS task definition or `RunTask` operation, use [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) to specify an IAM role that can be used by the containers in a task. 

### IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 Instances

If you are running your application on an Amazon EC2 instance, use the instance's [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) to get temporary security credentials to make calls to AWS. 

If you have configured your instance to use IAM roles, the SDK uses these credentials for your application automatically. You don't need to manually specify these credentials. 

### Shared Credentials and Configuration

The shared credentials and config files can be used to share common configuration amongst AWS SDKs and other tools. If you use different credentials for different tools or applications, you can use _profiles_ to configure multiple access keys in the same configuration file. 

You can provide multiple credential or config files locations using `config.LoadOptions`, by default the SDK loads files stored at default locations mentioned in the Specifying Credentials. 
    
    
    import (
        "context"
        "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"    
    )
    
    // ...
    
    cfg , err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), 
        config.WithSharedCredentialsFiles(
        []string{"test/credentials", "data/credentials"},
        ), 
        config.WithSharedConfigFiles(
            []string{"test/config", "data/config"},
        )   
    ) 
    

When working with shared credentials and config files, if duplicate profiles are specified they are merged to resolve a profile. In case of merge conflict, 

  1. If duplicate profiles are specified within a same credentials/config file, the profile properties specified in the latter profile takes precedence. 

  2. If duplicate profiles are specified across either multiple credentials files or across multiple config files, the profile properties are resolved as per the order of file input to the `config.LoadOptions`. The profile properties in the latter files take precedence. 

  3. If a profile exists in both credentials file and config file, the credentials file properties take precedence. 




If needed, you can enable `LogConfigurationWarnings` on `config.LoadOptions` and log the profile resolution steps. 

#### Creating the Credentials File

If you don't have a shared credentials file (`.aws/credentials`), you can use any text editor to create one in your home directory. Add the following content to your credentials file, replacing `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` and `<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` with your credentials. 
    
    
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    

The `[default]` heading defines credentials for the default profile, which the SDK will use unless you configure it to use another profile. 

You can also use temporary security credentials by adding the session tokens to your profile, as shown in the following example: 
    
    
    [temp]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_TEMP_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_TEMP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_session_token = <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>
    

The section name for a non-default profile within a credentials file must not begin with the word `profile`. You can read more at [AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html#file-format-creds). 

#### Creating the Config File

If you don't have a shared credentials file (`.aws/config`), you can use any text editor to create one in your home directory. Add the following content to your config file, replacing `<REGION>` with the desired region. 
    
    
    [default]
    region = <REGION>
    

The `[default]` heading defines config for the default profile, which the SDK will use unless you configure it to use another profile. 

You can use named profiles as shown in the following example: 
    
    
    [profile named-profile]
    region = <REGION>
    

The section name for a non-default profile within a config file must always begin with the word `profile`, followed by the intended profile name. You can read more at the [AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/file-format.html#file-format-config). 

#### Specifying Profiles

You can include multiple access keys in the same configuration file by associating each set of access keys with a profile. For example, in your credentials file, you can declare multiple profiles, as follows. 
    
    
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_DEFAULT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    
    [test-account]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_TEST_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_TEST_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    
    [prod-account]
    ; work profile
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_PROD_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_PROD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    

By default, the SDK checks the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to determine which profile to use. If no `AWS_PROFILE` variable is set, the SDK uses the `default` profile. 

Sometimes, you may want to use a different profile with your application. For example, you want to use the `test-account` credentials with your `myapp` application. You can use this profile by using the following command: 
    
    
    $ AWS_PROFILE=test-account myapp

You can also use instruct the SDK to select a profile by either calling `os.Setenv("AWS_PROFILE", "test-account")` before calling `config.LoadDefaultConfig`, or by passing an explicit profile as an argument as shown in the following example: 
    
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), 
        config.WithSharedConfigProfile("test-account"))
    

###### Note

If you specify credentials in environment variables, the SDK always uses those credentials, no matter which profile you specify.

### Environment Variables

By default, the SDK detects AWS credentials set in your environment and uses them to sign requests to AWS. That way you don't need to manage credentials in your applications. 

The SDK looks for credentials in the following environment variables: 

  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

  * `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional) 




The following examples show how you configure the environment variables. 

#### Linux, OS X, or Unix
    
    
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AKID
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    $ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=TOKEN
    

#### Windows
    
    
    > set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AKID
    > set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    > set AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=TOKEN
    

### Specify Credentials Programmatically

`config.LoadDefaultConfig` allows you to provide an explicit [aws.CredentialProvider](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#CredentialsProvider) when loading the shared configuration sources. To pass an explicit credential provider when loading shared configuration use [config.WithCredentialsProvider](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config#WithCredentialsProvider). For example, if `customProvider` references an instance of `aws.CredentialProvider` implementation, it can be passed during configuration loading like so: 
    
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), 
        config.WithCredentialsProvider(customProvider))
    

If you explicitly provide credentials, as in this example, the SDK uses only those credentials. 

###### Note

All credential providers passed to or returned by `LoadDefaultConfig` are wrapped in a [CredentialsCache](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#CredentialsCache) automatically. This enables caching and credential rotation that is concurrency safe. If you explicitly configure a provider on `aws.Config` directly, you must also explicitly wrap the provider with this type using [NewCredentialsCache](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws#NewCredentialsCache). 

#### Static Credentials

You can hard-code credentials in your application by using the [credentials.NewStaticCredentialsProvider](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials#NewStaticCredentialsProvider) credential provider to explicitly set the access keys to be used. For example: 
    
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), 
        config.WithCredentialsProvider(credentials.NewStaticCredentialsProvider("AKID", "SECRET_KEY", "TOKEN")),
    )
    

###### Warning

Do not embed credentials inside an application. Use this method only for testing purposes. 

#### Single Sign-on Credentials

The SDK provides a credential provider for retrieving temporary AWS credentials using AWS IAM Identity Center. Using the AWS CLI, you authenticate with the AWS access portal and authorize access to temporary AWS credentials. You then configure your application to load the single sign-on (SSO) profile, and the SDK uses your SSO credentials to retrieve temporary AWS credentials that will be automatically renewed if expired. If your SSO credentials expire, you must explicitly renew them by logging in to your IAM Identity Center account again using the AWS CLI. 

For example, you can create a profile, `dev-profile`, authenticate and authorize that profile using the AWS CLI, and configure your application as shown below. 

  1. First create the `profile` and `sso-session`



    
    
    [profile dev-profile]
    sso_session = dev-session
    sso_account_id = 012345678901
    sso_role_name = Developer
    region = us-east-1
    
    [sso-session dev-session]
    sso_region = us-west-2
    sso_start_url = https://company-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
    sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
    

  1. Login using the AWS CLI to authenticate and authorize the SSO profile. 



    
    
    $ aws --profile dev-profile sso login 
    Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
    If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:
    
    https://device.sso.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
    
    Then enter the code:
    
    ABCD-EFGH
    Successully logged into Start URL: https://company-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
    

  1. Next configure your application to use the SSO profile. 



    
    
    import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
    
    // ...
    
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(
        context.Background(),
        config.WithSharedConfigProfile("dev-profile"),
    )
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    

For more information on configuring SSO profiles and authenticating using the AWS CLI see [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) in the AWS CLI User Guide. For more information on programmatically constructing the SSO credential provider see the [ssocreds](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/ssocreds) API reference documentation. 

#### Login credentials

You can use your existing AWS Management Console sign-in credentials for programmatic access to AWS services. After a browser-based authentication flow, AWS generates temporary credentials that work across local development tools like the AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell and AWS SDKs. This feature simplifies the process of configuring and managing AWS CLI credentials, especially if you prefer interactive authentication over managing long-term access keys.

  1. Initiate the login flow using the AWS CLI, and follow the browser prompts. In this example, we save the login session to a new profile **dev-profile** , but this is optional.
         
         $ aws --profile dev-profile login

  2. (Optional) Inspect your AWS shared configuration file to verify that the session was established.
         
         [profile dev-profile]
         login_session = arn:aws:sts::account id>:role
                     

  3. Next configure your application to use the login profile.
         
         import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
         
         // ...
         
         cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(
             context.Background(),
             // only necessary if login session is saved to a non-default profile
             config.WithSharedConfigProfile("dev-profile"),
         )
         if err != nil {
             return err
         }
                     




For more information on configuring login profiles and authenticating using the AWS CLI, see [Login for AWS local development using console credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sign-in.html).

#### Other Credentials Providers

The SDK provides other methods for retrieving credentials in the [credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials) module. For example, you can retrieve temporary security credentials from AWS Security Token Service or credentials from encrypted storage. 

**Available Credential Providers** : 

  * [ec2rolecreds](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/ec2rolecreds) – Retrieve Credentials from Amazon EC2 Instances Roles via Amazon EC2 IMDS. 

  * [endpointcreds](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/endpointcreds) – Retrieve Credentials from an arbitrary HTTP endpoint. 

  * [processcreds](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/processcreds) – Retrieve Credentials from an external process that will be invoked by the host environment's shell. 

  * [stscreds](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/stscreds) – Retrieve Credentials from AWS STS
