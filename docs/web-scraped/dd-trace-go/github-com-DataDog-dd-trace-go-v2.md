### Datadog Client Libraries for Go

This repository contains Go packages for the client-side components of the Datadog product suite for Application Performance Monitoring, Continuous Profiling and Application Security Monitoring of Go applications.

*   [Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/): Trace requests as they flow across web servers, databases, and microservices so that developers have great visibility into bottlenecks and troublesome requests. The package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer) allows you to trace any piece of your Go code, and commonly used Go libraries can be automatically traced thanks to our out-of-the-box integrations which can be found in the package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/contrib`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/contrib).

*   [Datadog Go Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/): Continuously profile your Go apps to find CPU, memory, and synchronization bottlenecks, broken down by function name, and line number, to significantly reduce end-user latency and infrastructure costs. The package [`github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler) allows you to periodically collect and send Go profiles to the Datadog API.

*   [Datadog Application Security Management (ASM)](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/) provides in-app monitoring and protection against application-level attacks that aim to exploit code-level vulnerabilities, such as a Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF), a SQL injection (SQLi), or Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). ASM identifies services exposed to application attacks and leverages in-app security rules to detect and protect against threats in your application environment. ASM is not a standalone Go package and is transparently integrated into the APM tracer. You can simply enable it with [`DD_APPSEC_ENABLED=true`](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/enabling/go).

### Installing

This module contains many packages, but most users should probably install the two packages below:

```
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace/tracer
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/profiler
```

Additionally there are many [contrib](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/blob/v2.6.0/contrib) packages, published as nested modules, that can be installed to automatically instrument and trace commonly used Go libraries such as [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/net/http/v2), [gorilla/mux](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/gorilla/mux/v2) or [database/sql/v2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/database/sql/v2)

```
go get github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/contrib/gorilla/mux/v2
```

If you installed more packages than you intended, you can use `go mod tidy` to remove any unused packages.

### Documentation

*   [APM Tracing API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/v2/ddtrace)
*   [APM Tracing Go Applications](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup/go/)
*   [Continuous Go Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/profiler/enabling/go)
*   [Application Security Monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security_platform/application_security/setup_and_configure/?code-lang=go)
*   If you are migrating from an older version of the tracer (e.g., 1.60.x) you may also find the [migration document](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/blob/v2.6.0/MIGRATING.md) we've put together helpful.

### Go Support Policy

Datadog APM for Go is built upon dependencies defined in specific versions of the host operating system, Go releases, and the Datadog Agent/API. dd-trace-go supports the two latest releases of Go, matching the [official Go policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). This library only officially supports [first class ports](https://go.dev/wiki/PortingPolicy) of Go.

### Contributing

Before considering contributions to the project, please take a moment to read our brief [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/blob/v2.6.0/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing

Tests can be run locally using make targets or Go toolset directly.

**Using Make (Recommended)**:

```
Usage: make [target]

Targets:
  help                 Show this help message
  all                  Run complete build pipeline (tools, generate, lint, test)
  tools-install        Install development tools
  tools-install/checkmake Install checkmake binary for Makefile linting
  clean                Clean build artifacts
  clean-all            Clean everything including tools and temporary files
  generate             Run code generation
  lint                 Run linting checks
  lint/go              Run Go linting checks
  lint/go/fix          Fix linting issues automatically
  lint/shell           Run shell script linting checks
  lint/misc            Run miscellaneous linting checks (copyright, Makefiles)
  lint/action          Lint GitHub Actions workflows
  format               Format code
  format/shell         install shfmt
  test                 Run all tests (core, integration, contrib)
  test/unit            Run unit tests
  test/appsec          Run tests with AppSec enabled
  test/contrib         Run contrib package tests
  test/integration     Run integration tests
  test-deadlock        Run tests with deadlock detection
  test-debug-deadlock  Run tests with debug and deadlock detection
  fix-modules          Fix module dependencies and consistency
  docs                 Generate and Update embedded documentation in README files
  upgrade/orchestrion  Upgrade Orchestrion and fix modules
```

**Direct Script Usage**: For more control, you can use the [scripts/test.sh](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/blob/v2.6.0/scripts/test.sh) script directly. You'll need Docker and docker-compose installed for integration tests. Run `./scripts/test.sh --help` for all available options.

To run integration tests locally, you should set the `INTEGRATION` environment variable. The dependencies of the integration tests are best run via Docker. To get an idea about the versions and the set-up take a look at our [docker-compose config](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-go/blob/v2.6.0/docker-compose.yaml).

If you're only interested in the tests for a specific integration it can be useful to spin up just the required containers via docker-compose. For example if you're running tests that need the `mysql` database container to be up:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p dd-trace-go up -d mysql
```
