# GraphQL[&para;](#graphql)

As **FastAPI** is based on the **ASGI** standard, it's very easy to integrate any **GraphQL** library also compatible with ASGI.

You can combine normal FastAPI *path operations* with GraphQL on the same application.

Tip

**GraphQL** solves some very specific use cases.

It has **advantages** and **disadvantages** when compared to common **web APIs**.

Make sure you evaluate if the **benefits** for your use case compensate the **drawbacks**. 🤓

## GraphQL Libraries[&para;](#graphql-libraries)

Here are some of the **GraphQL** libraries that have **ASGI** support. You could use them with **FastAPI**:

- [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) 🍓

With [docs for FastAPI](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/fastapi)

- [Ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/)

With [docs for FastAPI](https://ariadnegraphql.org/docs/fastapi-integration)

- [Tartiflette](https://tartiflette.io/)

With [Tartiflette ASGI](https://tartiflette.github.io/tartiflette-asgi/) to provide ASGI integration

- [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/)

With [starlette-graphene3](https://github.com/ciscorn/starlette-graphene3)

## GraphQL with Strawberry[&para;](#graphql-with-strawberry)

If you need or want to work with **GraphQL**, [**Strawberry**](https://strawberry.rocks/) is the **recommended** library as it has the design closest to **FastAPI's** design, it's all based on **type annotations**.

Depending on your use case, you might prefer to use a different library, but if you asked me, I would probably suggest you try **Strawberry**.

Here's a small preview of how you could integrate Strawberry with FastAPI:

Python 3.9+

You can learn more about Strawberry in the [Strawberry documentation](https://strawberry.rocks/).

And also the docs about [Strawberry with FastAPI](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/fastapi).

## Older `GraphQLApp` from Starlette[&para;](#older-graphqlapp-from-starlette)

Previous versions of Starlette included a `GraphQLApp` class to integrate with [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/).

It was deprecated from Starlette, but if you have code that used it, you can easily **migrate** to [starlette-graphene3](https://github.com/ciscorn/starlette-graphene3), that covers the same use case and has an **almost identical interface**.

Tip

If you need GraphQL, I still would recommend you check out [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/), as it's based on type annotations instead of custom classes and types.
