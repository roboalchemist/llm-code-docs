# Static Files[&para;](#static-files)

You can serve static files automatically from a directory using `StaticFiles`.

## Use `StaticFiles`[&para;](#use-staticfiles)

- Import `StaticFiles`.

- "Mount" a `StaticFiles()` instance in a specific path.

Python 3.9+

Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.staticfiles` as `fastapi.staticfiles` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it actually comes directly from Starlette.

### What is "Mounting"[&para;](#what-is-mounting)

"Mounting" means adding a complete "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling all the sub-paths.

This is different from using an `APIRouter` as a mounted application is completely independent. The OpenAPI and docs from your main application won't include anything from the mounted application, etc.

You can read more about this in the [Advanced User Guide](../../advanced/).

## Details[&para;](#details)

The first `"/static"` refers to the sub-path this "sub-application" will be "mounted" on. So, any path that starts with `"/static"` will be handled by it.

The `directory="static"` refers to the name of the directory that contains your static files.

The `name="static"` gives it a name that can be used internally by **FastAPI**.

All these parameters can be different than "`static`", adjust them with the needs and specific details of your own application.
