## Use a `Response` parameter[&para;](#use-a-response-parameter)

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function*.

And then you can set cookies in that *temporal* response object.

Python 3.9+

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the cookies (also headers and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set cookies (and headers) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly[&para;](#return-a-response-directly)

You can also create cookies when returning a `Response` directly in your code.

To do that, you can create a response as described in [Return a Response Directly](../response-directly/).

Then set Cookies in it, and then return it:

Python 3.9+

Tip

Keep in mind that if you return a response directly instead of using the `Response` parameter, FastAPI will return it directly.

So, you will have to make sure your data is of the correct type. E.g. it is compatible with JSON, if you are returning a `JSONResponse`.

And also that you are not sending any data that should have been filtered by a `response_model`.

Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import Response` or `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

And as the `Response` can be used frequently to set headers and cookies, **FastAPI** also provides it at `fastapi.Response`.

To see all the available parameters and options, check the [documentation in Starlette](https://www.starlette.dev/responses/#set-cookie).
