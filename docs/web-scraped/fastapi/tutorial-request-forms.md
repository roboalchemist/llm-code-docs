# Form Data[&para;](#form-data)

When you need to receive form fields instead of JSON, you can use `Form`.

Info

To use forms, first install [`python-multipart`](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart).

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../../virtual-environments/), activate it, and then install it, for example:

`$ pip install python-multipart
`

## Import `Form`[&para;](#import-form)

Import `Form` from `fastapi`:

Python 3.9+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+ - non-Annotated

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Form

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login/")
async def login(username: str = Form(), password: str = Form()):
    return {"username": username}
`

## Define `Form` parameters[&para;](#define-form-parameters)

Create form parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Query`:

Python 3.9+

Python 3.9+ - non-Annotated

`from fastapi import FastAPI, Form

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/login/")
async def login(username: str = Form(), password: str = Form()):
    return {"username": username}
`

For example, in one of the ways the OAuth2 specification can be used (called "password flow") it is required to send a `username` and `password` as form fields.

The spec requires the fields to be exactly named `username` and `password`, and to be sent as form fields, not JSON.

With `Form` you can declare the same configurations as with `Body` (and `Query`, `Path`, `Cookie`), including validation, examples, an alias (e.g. `user-name` instead of `username`), etc.

Info

`Form` is a class that inherits directly from `Body`.

Tip

To declare form bodies, you need to use `Form` explicitly, because without it the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters or body (JSON) parameters.

## About "Form Fields"[&para;](#about-form-fields)

The way HTML forms (`<form></form>`) sends the data to the server normally uses a "special" encoding for that data, it's different from JSON.

**FastAPI** will make sure to read that data from the right place instead of JSON.

Technical Details

Data from forms is normally encoded using the "media type" `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

But when the form includes files, it is encoded as `multipart/form-data`. You'll read about handling files in the next chapter.

If you want to read more about these encodings and form fields, head to the [MDN web docs for `POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST).

Warning

You can declare multiple `Form` parameters in a *path operation*, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` instead of `application/json`.

This is not a limitation of **FastAPI**, it's part of the HTTP protocol.

## Recap[&para;](#recap)

Use `Form` to declare form data input parameters.
