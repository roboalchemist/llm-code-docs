## `Depends()`[&para;](#depends)

Dependencies are handled mainly with the special function `Depends()` that takes a callable.

Here is the reference for it and its parameters.

You can import it directly from `fastapi`:

`from fastapi import Depends
`

## 
``            fastapi.Depends

[&para;](#fastapi.Depends)

`Depends(dependency=None, *, use_cache=True, scope=None)
`

        Declare a FastAPI dependency.

It takes a single "dependable" callable (like a function).

Don't call it directly, FastAPI will call it for you.

Read more about it in the
[FastAPI docs for Dependencies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/).

**Example**

`from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]):
    return commons
`

          PARAMETER
          DESCRIPTION

                `dependency`

                A "dependable" callable (like a function).

Don't call it directly, FastAPI will call it for you, just pass the object
directly.

                    **TYPE:**
                      `Optional[Callable[..., Any]]`

                    **DEFAULT:**
                      `None`

                `use_cache`

By default, after a dependency is called the first time in a request, if
the dependency is declared again for the rest of the request (for example
if the dependency is needed by several dependencies), the value will be
re-used for the rest of the request.

Set `use_cache` to `False` to disable this behavior and ensure the
dependency is called again (if declared more than once) in the same request.

                    **TYPE:**
                      `bool`

                    **DEFAULT:**
                      `True`

                `scope`

Mainly for dependencies with `yield`, define when the dependency function
should start (the code before `yield`) and when it should end (the code
after `yield`).

- `"function"`: start the dependency before the *path operation function*
    that handles the request, end the dependency after the *path operation
    function* ends, but **before** the response is sent back to the client.
    So, the dependency function will be executed **around** the *path operation
    **function***.

- `"request"`: start the dependency before the *path operation function*
    that handles the request (similar to when using `"function"`), but end
    **after** the response is sent back to the client. So, the dependency
    function will be executed **around** the **request** and response cycle.

                    **TYPE:**
                      `Union[Literal['function', 'request'], None]`

                    **DEFAULT:**
                      `None`

## `Security()`[&para;](#security)

For many scenarios, you can handle security (authorization, authentication, etc.) with dependencies, using `Depends()`.

But when you want to also declare OAuth2 scopes, you can use `Security()` instead of `Depends()`.

You can import `Security()` directly from `fastapi`:

`from fastapi import Security
`

## 
``            fastapi.Security

[&para;](#fastapi.Security)

`Security(dependency=None, *, scopes=None, use_cache=True)
`

        Declare a FastAPI Security dependency.

The only difference with a regular dependency is that it can declare OAuth2
scopes that will be integrated with OpenAPI and the automatic UI docs (by default
at `/docs`).

It takes a single "dependable" callable (like a function).

Don't call it directly, FastAPI will call it for you.

Read more about it in the
[FastAPI docs for Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) and
in the
[FastAPI docs for OAuth2 scopes](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/).

**Example**

`from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Security, FastAPI

from .db import User
from .security import get_current_active_user

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/users/me/items/")
async def read_own_items(

                `scopes`

OAuth2 scopes required for the *path operation* that uses this Security
dependency.

The term "scope" comes from the OAuth2 specification, it seems to be
intentionally vague and interpretable. It normally refers to permissions,
in cases to roles.

These scopes are integrated with OpenAPI (and the API docs at `/docs`).
So they are visible in the OpenAPI specification.
