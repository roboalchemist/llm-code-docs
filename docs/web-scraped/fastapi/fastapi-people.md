Answers: 1900

Pull Requests: 808

I'm the creator of **FastAPI**. You can read more about that in [Help FastAPI - Get Help - Connect with the author](../help-fastapi/#connect-with-the-author).

...But here I want to show you the community.

**FastAPI** receives a lot of support from the community. And I want to highlight their contributions.

These are the people that:

- [Help others with questions in GitHub](../help-fastapi/#help-others-with-questions-in-github).

- [Create Pull Requests](../help-fastapi/#create-a-pull-request).

- Review Pull Requests, [especially important for translations](../contributing/#translations).

- Help [manage the repository](../management-tasks/) (team members).

All these tasks help maintain the repository.

A round of applause to them. 👏 🙇

## Team[&para;](#team)

This is the current list of team members. 😎

They have different levels of involvement and permissions, they can perform [repository management tasks](../management-tasks/) and together we  [manage the FastAPI repository](../management/).

## Top Translation Reviewers[&para;](#top-translation-reviewers)

These users are the **Top Translation Reviewers**. 🕵️

I only speak a few languages (and not very well 😅). So, the reviewers are the ones that have the [**power to approve translations**](../contributing/#translations) of the documentation. Without them, there wouldn't be documentation in several other languages.

## About the data - technical details[&para;](#about-the-data-technical-details)

The main intention of this page is to highlight the effort of the community to help others.

Especially including efforts that are normally less visible, and in many cases more arduous, like helping others with questions and reviewing Pull Requests with translations.

The data is calculated each month, you can read the [source code here](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/scripts/).

Here I'm also highlighting contributions from sponsors.

I also reserve the right to update the algorithm, sections, thresholds, etc (just in case 🤷).
