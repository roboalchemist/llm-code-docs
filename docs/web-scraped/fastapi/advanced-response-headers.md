## Use a `Response` parameter[&para;](#use-a-response-parameter)

You can declare a parameter of type `Response` in your *path operation function* (as you can do for cookies).

And then you can set headers in that *temporal* response object.

Python 3.9+

And then you can return any object you need, as you normally would (a `dict`, a database model, etc).

And if you declared a `response_model`, it will still be used to filter and convert the object you returned.

**FastAPI** will use that *temporal* response to extract the headers (also cookies and status code), and will put them in the final response that contains the value you returned, filtered by any `response_model`.

You can also declare the `Response` parameter in dependencies, and set headers (and cookies) in them.

## Return a `Response` directly[&para;](#return-a-response-directly)

You can also add headers when you return a `Response` directly.

Create a response as described in [Return a Response Directly](../response-directly/) and pass the headers as an additional parameter:

Python 3.9+

Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.responses import Response` or `from starlette.responses import JSONResponse`.

**FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.responses` as `fastapi.responses` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But most of the available responses come directly from Starlette.

And as the `Response` can be used frequently to set headers and cookies, **FastAPI** also provides it at `fastapi.Response`.

## Custom Headers[&para;](#custom-headers)

Keep in mind that custom proprietary headers can be added [using the `X-` prefix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

But if you have custom headers that you want a client in a browser to be able to see, you need to add them to your CORS configurations (read more in [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](../../tutorial/cors/)), using the parameter `expose_headers` documented in [Starlette's CORS docs](https://www.starlette.dev/middleware/#corsmiddleware).
