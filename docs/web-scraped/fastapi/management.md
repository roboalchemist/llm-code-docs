# Repository Management[&para;](#repository-management)

Here's a short description of how the FastAPI repository is managed and maintained.

## Owner[&para;](#owner)

I, [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), am the creator and owner of the FastAPI repository. 🤓

I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). 😅

## Team[&para;](#team)

There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎

They have different levels of permissions and [specific instructions](../management-tasks/).

Some of the tasks they can perform include:

- Adding labels to PRs.

- Editing PR titles.

- Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.

- Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.

- Merge some specific types of PRs.

You can see the current team members in [FastAPI People - Team](../fastapi-people/#team).

Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.

## FastAPI Experts[&para;](#fastapi-experts)

The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become [**FastAPI Experts**](../fastapi-people/#fastapi-experts).

This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.

## External Contributions[&para;](#external-contributions)

External contributions are very welcome and appreciated, including answering questions, submitting PRs, etc. 🙇‍♂️
