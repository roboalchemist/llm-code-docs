## About FastAPI Cloud[&para;](#about-fastapi-cloud)

**[FastAPI Cloud](https://fastapicloud.com)** is built by the same author and team behind **FastAPI**.

It streamlines the process of **building**, **deploying**, and **accessing** an API with minimal effort.

It brings the same **developer experience** of building apps with FastAPI to **deploying** them to the cloud. 🎉

It will also take care of most of the things you would need when deploying an app, like:

- HTTPS

- Replication, with autoscaling based on requests

- etc.

FastAPI Cloud is the primary sponsor and funding provider for the *FastAPI and friends* open source projects. ✨

## Deploy to other cloud providers[&para;](#deploy-to-other-cloud-providers)

FastAPI is open source and based on standards. You can deploy FastAPI apps to any cloud provider you choose.

Follow your cloud provider's guides to deploy FastAPI apps with them. 🤓

## Deploy your own server[&para;](#deploy-your-own-server)

I will also teach you later in this **Deployment** guide all the details, so you can understand what is going on, what needs to happen, or how to deploy FastAPI apps on your own, also with your own servers. 🤓
