# Body - Nested Models[&para;](#body-nested-models)

With **FastAPI**, you can define, validate, document, and use arbitrarily deeply nested models (thanks to Pydantic).

## List fields[&para;](#list-fields)

You can define an attribute to be a subtype. For example, a Python `list`:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

This will make `tags` be a list, although it doesn't declare the type of the elements of the list.

## List fields with type parameter[&para;](#list-fields-with-type-parameter)

But Python has a specific way to declare lists with internal types, or "type parameters":

### Declare a `list` with a type parameter[&para;](#declare-a-list-with-a-type-parameter)

To declare types that have type parameters (internal types), like `list`, `dict`, `tuple`,
pass the internal type(s) as "type parameters" using square brackets: `[` and `]`

`my_list: list[str]
`

That's all standard Python syntax for type declarations.

Use that same standard syntax for model attributes with internal types.

So, in our example, we can make `tags` be specifically a "list of strings":

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

## Set types[&para;](#set-types)

But then we think about it, and realize that tags shouldn't repeat, they would probably be unique strings.

And Python has a special data type for sets of unique items, the `set`.

Then we can declare `tags` as a set of strings:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

With this, even if you receive a request with duplicate data, it will be converted to a set of unique items.

And whenever you output that data, even if the source had duplicates, it will be output as a set of unique items.

And it will be annotated / documented accordingly too.

## Nested Models[&para;](#nested-models)

Each attribute of a Pydantic model has a type.

But that type can itself be another Pydantic model.

So, you can declare deeply nested JSON "objects" with specific attribute names, types and validations.

All that, arbitrarily nested.

### Define a submodel[&para;](#define-a-submodel)

For example, we can define an `Image` model:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

### Use the submodel as a type[&para;](#use-the-submodel-as-a-type)

And then we can use it as the type of an attribute:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

This would mean that **FastAPI** would expect a body similar to:

`{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": ["rock", "metal", "bar"],
    "image": {
        "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
        "name": "The Foo live"
    }
}
`

Again, doing just that declaration, with **FastAPI** you get:

- Editor support (completion, etc.), even for nested models

- Data conversion

- Data validation

- Automatic documentation

## Special types and validation[&para;](#special-types-and-validation)

Apart from normal singular types like `str`, `int`, `float`, etc. you can use more complex singular types that inherit from `str`.

To see all the options you have, checkout [Pydantic's Type Overview](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/types/). You will see some examples in the next chapter.

For example, as in the `Image` model we have a `url` field, we can declare it to be an instance of Pydantic's `HttpUrl` instead of a `str`:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

The string will be checked to be a valid URL, and documented in JSON Schema / OpenAPI as such.

## Attributes with lists of submodels[&para;](#attributes-with-lists-of-submodels)

You can also use Pydantic models as subtypes of `list`, `set`, etc.:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

This will expect (convert, validate, document, etc.) a JSON body like:

`{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": [
        "rock",
        "metal",
        "bar"
    ],
    "images": [
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
            "name": "The Foo live"
        },
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/dave.jpg",
            "name": "The Baz"
        }
    ]
}
`

Info

Notice how the `images` key now has a list of image objects.

## Deeply nested models[&para;](#deeply-nested-models)

You can define arbitrarily deeply nested models:

Python 3.10+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+

Info

Notice how `Offer` has a list of `Item`s, which in turn have an optional list of `Image`s

## Bodies of pure lists[&para;](#bodies-of-pure-lists)

If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON `array` (a Python `list`), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function, the same as in Pydantic models:

`images: list[Image]
`

as in:

Python 3.9+

## Editor support everywhere[&para;](#editor-support-everywhere)

And you get editor support everywhere.

Even for items inside of lists:

You couldn't get this kind of editor support if you were working directly with `dict` instead of Pydantic models.

But you don't have to worry about them either, incoming dicts are converted automatically and your output is converted automatically to JSON too.

## Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s[&para;](#bodies-of-arbitrary-dicts)

You can also declare a body as a `dict` with keys of some type and values of some other type.

This way, you don't have to know beforehand what the valid field/attribute names are (as would be the case with Pydantic models).

This would be useful if you want to receive keys that you don't already know.

Another useful case is when you want to have keys of another type (e.g., `int`).

That's what we are going to see here.

In this case, you would accept any `dict` as long as it has `int` keys with `float` values:

Python 3.9+

Tip

Keep in mind that JSON only supports `str` as keys.

But Pydantic has automatic data conversion.

This means that, even though your API clients can only send strings as keys, as long as those strings contain pure integers, Pydantic will convert them and validate them.

And the `dict` you receive as `weights` will actually have `int` keys and `float` values.

## Recap[&para;](#recap)

With **FastAPI** you have the maximum flexibility provided by Pydantic models, while keeping your code simple, short and elegant.

But with all the benefits:

- Editor support (completion everywhere!)

- Data conversion (a.k.a. parsing / serialization)

- Data validation

- Schema documentation

- Automatic docs
