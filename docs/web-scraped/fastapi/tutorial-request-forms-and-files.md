# Request Forms and Files[&para;](#request-forms-and-files)

You can define files and form fields at the same time using `File` and `Form`.

Info

To receive uploaded files and/or form data, first install [`python-multipart`](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart).

Make sure you create a [virtual environment](../../virtual-environments/), activate it, and then install it, for example:

`$ pip install python-multipart
`

## Import `File` and `Form`[&para;](#import-file-and-form)

Python 3.9+

🤓 Other versions and variants

Python 3.9+ - non-Annotated

`from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(
    file: bytes = File(), fileb: UploadFile = File(), token: str = Form()
):
    return {
        "file_size": len(file),
        "token": token,
        "fileb_content_type": fileb.content_type,
    }
`

## Define `File` and `Form` parameters[&para;](#define-file-and-form-parameters)

Create file and form parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Query`:

`from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form, UploadFile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/files/")
async def create_file(
    file: bytes = File(), fileb: UploadFile = File(), token: str = Form()
):
    return {
        "file_size": len(file),
        "token": token,
        "fileb_content_type": fileb.content_type,
    }
`

The files and form fields will be uploaded as form data and you will receive the files and form fields.

And you can declare some of the files as `bytes` and some as `UploadFile`.

Warning

You can declare multiple `File` and `Form` parameters in a *path operation*, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json`.

This is not a limitation of **FastAPI**, it's part of the HTTP protocol.

## Recap[&para;](#recap)

Use `File` and `Form` together when you need to receive data and files in the same request.
