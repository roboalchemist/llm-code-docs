Markdown Content:
To attach files to an email, use the `attachments` option of the [message object](https://nodemailer.com/). The `attachments` option accepts an array of attachment objects, and you can include **as many files as you need**.

Each attachment object supports the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filename` | `string` | The filename that will be shown to recipients. Unicode characters are supported. |
| `content` | `string | Buffer | Stream` | The attachment contents. Can be a string, a Buffer, or a readable stream. |
| `path` | `string` | A file path, URL, or data URI. Nodemailer streams the file directly instead of loading it entirely into memory, making this the recommended approach for large files. |
| `href` | `string` | An HTTP or HTTPS URL. Nodemailer will fetch the content from this URL and include it as an attachment. |
| `httpHeaders` | `object` | Custom HTTP headers to send when fetching content from `href`. For example: `{ authorization: 'Bearer token123' }`. |
| `contentType` | `string` | The [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of the attachment. If not specified, Nodemailer will attempt to detect it from the `filename` or `path`. |
| `contentDisposition` | `string` | The Content-Disposition header value. Defaults to `'attachment'`. Use `'inline'` for embedded content like images referenced in HTML. |
| `cid` | `string` | A Content-ID value for referencing the attachment in HTML content. Use this with `<img src="cid:your-cid-value"/>` to [embed images inline](https://nodemailer.com/message/embedded-images). |
| `encoding` | `string` | Specifies how to decode the `content` string. Common values include `'base64'`, `'hex'`, and `'utf8'`. |
| `contentTransferEncoding` | `string` | The Content-Transfer-Encoding header value. Supported values are `'base64'`, `'quoted-printable'`, `'7bit'`, and `'8bit'`. Defaults to `'base64'` for most attachments. |
| `headers` | `object` | Additional [custom headers](https://nodemailer.com/message/custom-headers) to add to this specific attachment's MIME node. |
| `raw` | `string` | **Advanced**: A complete, pre-built MIME node including all headers. When specified, this overrides all other attachment properties. |

Streaming vs. in-memory

For large files, prefer using `path`, `href`, or a readable stream for the `content` property. This allows Nodemailer to stream the data incrementally rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.

Examples[​](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments#examples "Direct link to Examples")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following examples demonstrate different ways to attach files to an email message.

`const fs = require("fs");// The attachments array goes inside your message objectattachments: [  // 1. Plain text string  // The simplest way to create an attachment from a string  {    filename: "hello.txt",    content: "Hello world!",  },  // 2. Buffer content  // Useful when you have binary data in memory  {    filename: "buffer.txt",    content: Buffer.from("Hello world!", "utf8"),  },  // 3. File from the filesystem  // Uses streaming, which is memory-efficient for large files  {    filename: "report.pdf",    path: "/absolute/path/to/report.pdf",  },  // 4. File path only  // When you omit filename, Nodemailer derives it from the path  // The content type is also automatically detected from the file extension  {    path: "/absolute/path/to/image.png",  },  // 5. Readable stream  // Provides full control over how content is read  {    filename: "notes.txt",    content: fs.createReadStream("./notes.txt"),  },  // 6. Explicit content type  // Override automatic MIME type detection when needed  {    filename: "data.bin",    content: Buffer.from("deadbeef", "hex"),    contentType: "application/octet-stream",  },  // 7. Remote URL  // Nodemailer fetches the content from the URL when sending  {    filename: "license.txt",    href: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/master/LICENSE",  },  // 8. Base64-encoded string  // Specify the encoding when your content string is not plain text  {    filename: "photo.jpg",    content: "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD...", // base64 image data (truncated)    encoding: "base64",  },  // 9. Data URI  // Useful for inline data or content from canvas elements  {    path: "data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=",  },  // 10. Pre-built MIME node (advanced)  // Provides complete control over the attachment's MIME structure  {    raw: [      "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8",      'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="greeting.txt"',      "",      "Hello world!"    ].join("\r\n"),  },];`

Embedding images[​](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments#embedding-images "Direct link to Embedding images")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can embed images directly in the HTML body of your email instead of displaying them as downloadable attachments. To do this, assign a Content-ID (`cid`) to the attachment and reference it in your HTML using the `cid:` URL scheme. For more details and examples, see the [embedded images](https://nodemailer.com/message/embedded-images) page.

The `cid` value can be any unique string. A common convention is to use an email-like format (for example, `logo@nodemailer`), but this is not required.

`{  attachments: [    {      filename: 'logo.png',      path: './assets/logo.png',      cid: 'logo@nodemailer' // unique identifier for this attachment    }  ],  html: '<p><img src="cid:logo@nodemailer" alt="Nodemailer logo"></p>'}`

When an attachment has a `cid` and the content type is an image, Nodemailer automatically sets the Content-Disposition to `inline` rather than `attachment`, so the image displays within the email body rather than appearing as a downloadable file.
