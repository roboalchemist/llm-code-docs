Abstract
--------

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for
representing information in the Web. This document defines an abstract syntax
(a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and
specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures:
RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples,
where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They
are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used
to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph
and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax
also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses
datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within
RDF graphs.

1. Introduction
---------------

*This section is non-normative.*

The *Resource Description Framework* (RDF) is a framework
for representing information in the Web.

This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model)
which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications,
including:

* the [formal
  model-theoretic semantics for RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/) [[RDF11-MT](#bib-RDF11-MT)];
* serialization syntaxes for storing and exchanging RDF such as
  [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) [[TURTLE](#bib-TURTLE)]
  and [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) [[JSON-LD](#bib-JSON-LD)];
* the [SPARQL
  Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW](#bib-SPARQL11-OVERVIEW)];
* the [RDF Schema vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)
  [[RDF11-SCHEMA](#bib-RDF11-SCHEMA)].

### 1.1 Graph-based Data Model

The core structure of the abstract syntax is a set of
[triples](#dfn-rdf-triple "RDF triple"), each consisting of a [subject](#dfn-subject),
a [predicate](#dfn-predicate) and an [object](#dfn-object). A set of such triples is called
an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph). An RDF graph can be visualized as a node and
directed-arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a
node-arc-node link.

[![An RDF graph with two nodes (Subject and Object) and a triple connecting them (Predicate)](rdf-graph.svg)](rdf-graph.svg)


Fig. 1 An RDF graph with two nodes (Subject and Object) and a triple connecting them (Predicate)

There can be three kinds of [nodes](#dfn-node "node") in an
[RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph): [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"), [literals](#dfn-literal "literal"),
and [blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node").

### 1.2 Resources and Statements

Any [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") or [literal](#dfn-literal) denotes
something in the world (the "universe of discourse").
These things are called
resources. Anything can be a resource,
including physical things, documents, abstract concepts, numbers
and strings; the term is synonymous with "entity" as it is used in
the RDF Semantics specification [[RDF11-MT](#bib-RDF11-MT)].
The resource denoted by an IRI is called its [referent](#dfn-referent), and the
resource denoted by a literal is called its
[literal value](#dfn-literal-value "literal value"). Literals have
[datatypes](#dfn-datatype "datatype") that define the range of possible
values, such as strings, numbers, and dates. Special kind of literals,
[language-tagged strings](#dfn-language-tagged-string "language-tagged string"), denote
plain-text strings in a natural language.

Asserting an [RDF triple](#dfn-rdf-triple) says that *some relationship,
indicated by the [predicate](#dfn-predicate), holds between the
[resources](#dfn-resource "resource") [denoted](#dfn-denote "denote") by
the [subject](#dfn-subject) and [object](#dfn-object)*. This statement corresponding
to an RDF triple is known as an RDF statement.
The predicate itself is an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") and denotes a property,
that is, a [resource](#dfn-resource) that can be thought of as a binary relation.
(Relations that involve more than two entities can only be
[indirectly
expressed in RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/) [[SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS](#bib-SWBP-N-ARYRELATIONS)].)

Unlike [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") and [literals](#dfn-literal "literal"),
[blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") do not identify specific
[resources](#dfn-resource "resource"). [Statements](#dfn-rdf-statement "RDF statement")
involving blank nodes say that something with the given relationships
exists, without explicitly naming it.

### 1.3 The Referent of an IRI

The [resource](#dfn-resource) [denoted](#dfn-denote "denote") by an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI")
is also called its referent. For some IRIs with particular
meanings, such as those identifying XSD datatypes, the referent is
fixed by this specification. For all other IRIs, what exactly is
denoted by any given IRI is not defined by this specification. Other
specifications may fix IRI referents, or apply other constraints on
what may be the referent of any IRI.

Guidelines for determining the [referent](#dfn-referent) of an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") are
provided in other documents, like
*[Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/)* [[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)]
and *[Cool URIs for the Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/)* [[COOLURIS](#bib-COOLURIS)].
A very brief, informal, and partial account follows:

* By design, IRIs have global scope. Thus, two different appearances of an IRI
  [denote](#dfn-denote) the same [resource](#dfn-resource). Violating this principle constitutes
  an [IRI collision](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-collision) [[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)].
* By social convention, the
  [IRI owner](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-ownership)
  [[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)] gets to say what the intended (or usual)
  referent of an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") is. Applications and users need not
  abide by this intended denotation, but there may be a loss of
  interoperability with other applications and users if they do
  not do so.
* The IRI owner can establish the intended [referent](#dfn-referent)
  by means of a specification or other document that explains
  what is denoted. For example, the
  [Organization Ontology document](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) [[VOCAB-ORG](#bib-VOCAB-ORG)]
  specifies the intended referents of various IRIs that start with
  `http://www.w3.org/ns/org#`.
* A good way of communicating the intended referent
  is to set up the IRI so that it
  [dereferences](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-dereference) [[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)]
  to such a document.
* Such a document can, in fact, be an [RDF document](#dfn-rdf-document)
  that describes the denoted resource by means of
  [RDF statements](#dfn-rdf-statement "RDF statement").

Perhaps the most important characteristic of [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI")
in web architecture is that they can be
[dereferenced](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-dereference),
and hence serve as starting points for interactions with a remote server.
This specification is not concerned with such interactions.
It does not define an interaction model. It only treats IRIs as globally
unique identifiers in a graph data model that describes resources.
However, those interactions are critical to the concept of
*[Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)* [[LINKED-DATA](#bib-LINKED-DATA)],
which makes use of the RDF data model and serialization formats.

### 1.4 RDF Vocabularies and Namespace IRIs

An RDF vocabulary is a collection of [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI")
intended for use in [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"). For example,
the IRIs documented in [[RDF11-SCHEMA](#bib-RDF11-SCHEMA)] are the RDF Schema vocabulary.
RDF Schema can itself be used to define and document additional
RDF vocabularies. Some such vocabularies are mentioned in the
Primer [[RDF11-PRIMER](#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)].

The [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") in an [RDF vocabulary](#dfn-rdf-vocabulary) often begin with
a common substring known as a namespace IRI.
Some namespace IRIs are associated by convention with a short name
known as a namespace prefix. Some examples:

Some example namespace prefixes and IRIs

| Namespace prefix | Namespace IRI | RDF vocabulary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rdf | [`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`](https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#) | The RDF built-in vocabulary [[RDF11-SCHEMA](#bib-RDF11-SCHEMA)] |
| rdfs | [`http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`](https://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#) | The RDF Schema vocabulary [[RDF11-SCHEMA](#bib-RDF11-SCHEMA)] |
| xsd | [`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#`](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#) | The [RDF-compatible XSD types](#dfn-rdf-compatible-xsd-types) |

In some serialization formats it is common to abbreviate [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI")
that start with [namespace IRIs](#dfn-namespace-iri "namespace IRI") by using a
[namespace prefix](#dfn-namespace-prefix) in order to assist readability. For example, the IRI
`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral`
would be abbreviated as `rdf:XMLLiteral`.
Note however that these abbreviations are *not* valid IRIs,
and must not be used in contexts where IRIs are expected.
Namespace IRIs and namespace prefixes are *not* a formal part of the
RDF data model. They are merely a syntactic convenience for
abbreviating IRIs.

The term “namespace” on its own does not have a
well-defined meaning in the context of RDF, but is sometimes informally
used to mean “[namespace IRI](#dfn-namespace-iri)” or “[RDF vocabulary](#dfn-rdf-vocabulary)”.

### 1.5 RDF and Change over Time

The RDF data model is *atemporal*: [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph")
are static snapshots of information.

However, [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph") can express information
about events and about temporal aspects of other entities,
given appropriate [vocabulary](#dfn-rdf-vocabulary "RDF vocabulary") terms.

Since [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph") are defined as mathematical
sets, adding or removing [triples](#dfn-rdf-triple "RDF triple") from an
RDF graph yields a different RDF graph.

We informally use the term RDF source to refer to a
persistent yet mutable source or container of
[RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"). An RDF source is a [resource](#dfn-resource)
that may be said to have a state that can change over time.
A snapshot of the state can be expressed as an RDF graph.
For example, any web document that has an RDF-bearing representation
may be considered an RDF source. Like all resources, RDF sources may
be named with [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") and therefore described in
other RDF graphs.

Intuitively speaking, changes in the universe of discourse
can be reflected in the following ways:

* An [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI"), once minted, should never
  change its intended [referent](#dfn-referent). (See
  [URI persistence](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence)
  [[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)].)
* [Literals](#dfn-literal "literal"), by design, are constants and
  never change their [value](#dfn-literal-value "literal value").
* A relationship that holds between two [resources](#dfn-resource "resource")
  at one time may not hold at another time.
* [RDF sources](#dfn-rdf-source "RDF source") may change their state over time.
  That is, they may provide different [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph")
  at different times.
* Some [RDF sources](#dfn-rdf-source "RDF source") may, however, be immutable
  snapshots of another RDF source, archiving its state at some
  point in time.

### 1.6 Working with Multiple RDF Graphs

As RDF graphs are sets of triples, they can be
combined easily, supporting the use of data from
multiple sources. Nevertheless, it is sometimes desirable to work
with multiple RDF graphs while keeping their contents separate.
[RDF datasets](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF dataset") support this requirement.

An [RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset) is a collection of
[RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"). All but one of these graphs have
an associated [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") or blank node. They are called
[named graphs](#dfn-named-graph "named graph"), and the IRI or blank node
is called the [graph name](#dfn-graph-name).
The remaining graph does not have an associated IRI, and is called
the [default graph](#dfn-default-graph) of the RDF dataset.

There are many possible uses for [RDF datasets](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF dataset").
One such use is to hold snapshots of multiple
[RDF sources](#dfn-rdf-source "RDF source").

### 1.7 Equivalence, Entailment and Inconsistency

An [RDF triple](#dfn-rdf-triple) encodes a [statement](#dfn-rdf-statement "RDF statement")—a
simple logical expression, or claim about the world.
An [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) is the conjunction (logical *AND*) of
its triples. The precise details of this meaning of RDF triples and graphs are
the subject of the RDF Semantics specification [[RDF11-MT](#bib-RDF11-MT)], which yields the
following relationships between [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph)s:

Entailment
:   An [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) *A* entails another RDF graph *B*
    if every possible arrangement of the world
    that makes *A* true also makes *B* true. When *A*
    entails *B*, if the truth of *A* is presumed or demonstrated
    then the truth of *B* is established.

Equivalence
:   Two [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph") *A* and *B*
    are equivalent if they make the same claim about the world.
    *A* is equivalent to *B* if and only if
    *A* [entails](#dfn-entailment "entailment") *B* and
    *B* entails *A*.

Inconsistency
:   An [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) is inconsistent if it contains
    an internal contradiction. There is no possible arrangement
    of the world that would make the expression true.

An entailment regime [[RDF11-MT](#bib-RDF11-MT)] is a specification that
defines precise conditions that make these relationships hold.
RDF itself recognizes only some basic cases of entailment, equivalence
and inconsistency. Other specifications, such as
[RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) [[RDF11-SCHEMA](#bib-RDF11-SCHEMA)]
and [OWL 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/)
[[OWL2-OVERVIEW](#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)], add more powerful entailment regimes,
as do some domain-specific [vocabularies](#dfn-rdf-vocabulary "RDF vocabulary").

This specification does not constrain how implementations
use the logical relationships defined by
[entailment regimes](#dfn-entailment-regime "entailment regime").
Implementations may or may not detect
[inconsistencies](#dfn-inconsistency "inconsistency"), and may make all,
some or no [entailed](#dfn-entailment "entailment") information
available to users.

### 1.8 RDF Documents and Syntaxes

An RDF document is a document that encodes an
[RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) or [RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset) in a concrete RDF syntax,
such as Turtle [[TURTLE](#bib-TURTLE)], RDFa [[RDFA-PRIMER](#bib-RDFA-PRIMER)], JSON-LD [[JSON-LD](#bib-JSON-LD)], or
TriG [[TRIG](#bib-TRIG)]. RDF documents enable the exchange of RDF graphs and RDF
datasets between systems.

A [concrete RDF syntax](#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax) may offer
many different ways to encode the same [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) or
[RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset), for example through the use of
[namespace prefixes](#dfn-namespace-prefix "namespace prefix"),
relative IRIs, [blank node identifiers](#dfn-blank-node-identifier "blank node identifier"),
and different ordering of statements. While these aspects can have great
effect on the convenience of working with the [RDF document](#dfn-rdf-document),
they are not significant for its meaning.

2. Conformance
--------------

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples,
and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is
normative.

The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*,
and *OPTIONAL* in this specification are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#bib-RFC2119)].

This specification, *RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax*,
defines a data model and related terminology for use in
other specifications, such as
[concrete RDF syntaxes](#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax "concrete RDF syntax"),
API specifications, and query languages.
Implementations cannot directly conform to
*RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax*,
but can conform to such other specifications that normatively
reference terms defined here.

3. RDF Graphs
-------------

An RDF graph is a set of
[RDF triples](#dfn-rdf-triple "RDF triple").

### 3.1 Triples

An RDF triple consists of three components:

* the subject, which is an
  [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") or a [blank node](#dfn-blank-node)
* the predicate, which is an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI")
* the object, which is an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI"),
  a [literal](#dfn-literal) or a [blank node](#dfn-blank-node)

An RDF triple is conventionally written in the order subject,
predicate, object.

The set of nodes of an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph)
is the set of subjects and objects of triples in the graph.
It is possible for a predicate IRI to also occur as a node in
the same graph.

[IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"), [literals](#dfn-literal "literal") and
[blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") are collectively known as
RDF terms.

[IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"), [literals](#dfn-literal "literal")
and [blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") are distinct and distinguishable.
For example, `http://example.org/` as a string literal
is neither equal to `http://example.org/` as an IRI,
nor to a blank node with the [blank node identifier](#dfn-blank-node-identifier)
`http://example.org/`.

### 3.2 IRIs

An IRI
(Internationalized Resource Identifier) within an RDF graph
is a Unicode string [[UNICODE](#bib-UNICODE)] that conforms to the syntax
defined in RFC 3987 [[RFC3987](#bib-RFC3987)].

IRIs in the RDF abstract syntax *MUST* be absolute, and *MAY*
contain a fragment identifier.

IRI equality:
Two IRIs are equal if and only if they are equivalent
under Simple String Comparison according to
[section 5.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-5.1)
of [[RFC3987](#bib-RFC3987)]. Further normalization *MUST NOT* be performed when
comparing IRIs for equality.

Note

**URIs and IRIs:**
IRIs are a generalization of
URIs
[[RFC3986](#bib-RFC3986)] that permits a wider range of Unicode characters.
Every absolute URI and URL is an IRI, but not every IRI is an URI.
When IRIs are used in operations that are only
defined for URIs, they must first be converted according to
the mapping defined in
[section 3.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-3.1)
of [[RFC3987](#bib-RFC3987)]. A notable example is retrieval over the HTTP
protocol. The mapping involves UTF-8 encoding of non-ASCII
characters, %-encoding of octets not allowed in URIs, and
Punycode-encoding of domain names.

**Relative IRIs:**
Some [concrete RDF syntaxes](#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax "concrete RDF syntax") permit
relative IRIs as a convenient shorthand
that allows authoring of documents independently from their final
publishing location. Relative IRIs must be
[resolved
against](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.2) a base IRI to make them absolute.
Therefore, the RDF graph serialized in such syntaxes is well-defined only
if a [base IRI
can be established](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1) [[RFC3986](#bib-RFC3986)].

**IRI normalization:**
Interoperability problems can be avoided by minting
only IRIs that are normalized according to
[Section 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-5)
of [[RFC3987](#bib-RFC3987)]. Non-normalized forms that are best avoided
include:

* Uppercase characters in scheme names and domain names
* Percent-encoding of characters where it is not
  required by IRI syntax
* Explicitly stated HTTP default port
  (`http://example.com:80/`);
  `http://example.com/` is preferable
* Completely empty path in HTTP IRIs
  (`http://example.com`);
  `http://example.com/` is preferable
* “`/./`” or “`/../`” in the path
  component of an IRI
* Lowercase hexadecimal letters within percent-encoding
  triplets (“`%3F`” is preferable over
  “`%3f`”)
* Punycode-encoding of Internationalized Domain Names
  in IRIs
* IRIs that are not in Unicode Normalization
  Form C [[NFC](#bib-NFC)]

### 3.3 Literals

Literals are used for values such as strings, numbers, and dates.

A literal in an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) consists of two or three
elements:

* a lexical form, being a Unicode [[UNICODE](#bib-UNICODE)] string,
  which *SHOULD* be in Normal Form C [[NFC](#bib-NFC)],
* a datatype IRI, being an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI")
  identifying a datatype that determines how the lexical form maps
  to a [literal value](#dfn-literal-value), and
* if and only if the [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri) is
  `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString`, a
  non-empty language tag as defined by [[BCP47](#bib-BCP47)]. The
  language tag *MUST* be well-formed according to
  [section 2.2.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.9)
  of [[BCP47](#bib-BCP47)].

A literal is a language-tagged string if the third element
is present. Lexical representations of language tags *MAY* be converted
to lower case. The value space of language tags is always in lower
case.

Please note that concrete syntaxes *MAY* support
simple literals consisting of only a
[lexical form](#dfn-lexical-form) without any [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri) or [language tag](#dfn-language-tag).
Simple literals are syntactic sugar for abstract syntax
[literals](#dfn-literal "literal")
with the [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri)
`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string`. Similarly, most
concrete syntaxes represent
[language-tagged strings](#dfn-language-tagged-string "language-tagged string") without
the [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri) because it always equals
`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString`.

The literal value associated with a [literal](#dfn-literal) is:

1. If the literal is a [language-tagged string](#dfn-language-tagged-string),
   then the literal value is a pair consisting of its [lexical form](#dfn-lexical-form)
   and its [language tag](#dfn-language-tag), in that order.
2. If the literal's [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri) is in the set of
   [recognized datatype IRIs](#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris), let d be the
   [referent](#dfn-referent) of the datatype IRI.
   1. If the literal's [lexical form](#dfn-lexical-form) is in the [lexical space](#dfn-lexical-space)
      of d, then the literal value is the result of applying
      the [lexical-to-value mapping](#dfn-lexical-to-value-mapping) of d to the
      [lexical form](#dfn-lexical-form).
   2. Otherwise, the literal is ill-typed and no literal value can be
      associated with the literal. Such a case produces a semantic
      inconsistency but is not *syntactically* ill-formed.
      Implementations *MUST* accept ill-typed literals and produce RDF
      graphs from them. Implementations *MAY* produce warnings when
      encountering ill-typed literals.
3. If the literal's [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri) is *not* in the set of
   [recognized datatype IRIs](#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris), then the literal value is
   not defined by this specification.

Literal term equality: Two literals are term-equal (the same
RDF literal) if and only if the two [lexical forms](#dfn-lexical-form "lexical form"),
the two [datatype IRIs](#dfn-datatype-iri "datatype IRI"), and the two
[language tags](#dfn-language-tag "language tag") (if any) compare equal,
character by character. Thus, two literals can have the same value
without being the same RDF term. For example:

```
      "1"^^xs:integer
      "01"^^xs:integer
```

denote the same [value](#dfn-literal-value "literal value"), but are not the
same literal [RDF terms](#dfn-rdf-term "RDF Term") and are not
[term-equal](#dfn-literal-term-equality "literal term equality") because their
[lexical form](#dfn-lexical-form) differs.

### 3.4 Blank Nodes

Blank nodes are disjoint from
[IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") and [literals](#dfn-literal "literal"). Otherwise,
the set of possible blank nodes is arbitrary. RDF makes no reference to
any internal structure of blank nodes.

Note

Blank node identifiers
are local identifiers that are used in some
[concrete RDF syntaxes](#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax "concrete RDF syntax")
or RDF store implementations.
They are always locally scoped to the file or RDF store,
and are *not* persistent or portable identifiers
for blank nodes. Blank node identifiers are *not*
part of the RDF abstract syntax, but are entirely dependent
on the concrete syntax or implementation. The syntactic restrictions
on blank node identifiers, if any, therefore also depend on
the concrete RDF syntax or implementation. Implementations that handle blank node
identifiers in concrete syntaxes need to be careful not to create the
same blank node from multiple occurrences of the same blank node identifier
except in situations where this is supported by the syntax.

### 3.5 Replacing Blank Nodes with IRIs

Blank nodes do not have identifiers in the RDF abstract syntax. The
[blank node identifiers](#dfn-blank-node-identifier "blank node identifier") introduced
by some concrete syntaxes have only
local scope and are purely an artifact of the serialization.

In situations where stronger identification is needed, systems *MAY*
systematically replace some or all of the blank nodes in an RDF graph
with [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"). Systems wishing to do this *SHOULD*
mint a new, globally
unique IRI (a Skolem IRI) for each blank node so replaced.

This transformation does not appreciably change the meaning of an
RDF graph, provided that the Skolem IRIs do not occur anywhere else.
It does however permit the possibility of other graphs
subsequently using the Skolem IRIs, which is not possible
for blank nodes.

Systems may wish to mint Skolem IRIs in such a way that they can
recognize the IRIs as having been introduced solely to replace blank
nodes. This allows a system to map IRIs back to blank nodes
if needed.

Systems that want Skolem IRIs to be recognizable outside of the system
boundaries *SHOULD* use a well-known IRI [[RFC5785](#bib-RFC5785)] with the registered
name `genid`. This is an IRI that uses the HTTP or HTTPS scheme,
or another scheme that has been specified to use well-known IRIs; and whose
path component starts with `/.well-known/genid/`.

For example, the authority responsible for the domain
`example.com` could mint the following recognizable Skolem IRI:

```
http://example.com/.well-known/genid/d26a2d0e98334696f4ad70a677abc1f6
```

Note

RFC 5785 [[RFC5785](#bib-RFC5785)] only specifies well-known URIs,
not IRIs. For the purpose of this document, a well-known IRI is any
IRI that results in a well-known URI after IRI-to-URI mapping [[RFC3987](#bib-RFC3987)].

### 3.6 Graph Comparison

Two
[RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph") G and G' are
isomorphic (that is, they have an identical
form) if there is a bijection M between the sets of nodes of the two
graphs, such that:

1. M maps blank nodes to blank nodes.
2. M(lit)=lit for all [RDF literals](#dfn-literal "literal") lit which
   are nodes of G.
3. M(iri)=iri for all [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") iri
   which are nodes of G.
4. The triple ( s, p, o ) is in G if and
   only if the triple ( M(s), p, M(o) ) is in
   G'

See also: [IRI equality](#dfn-iri-equality), [literal term equality](#dfn-literal-term-equality).

With this definition, M shows how each blank node
in G can be replaced with
a new blank node to give G'. Graph isomorphism
is needed to support the RDF Test Cases [[RDF11-TESTCASES](#bib-RDF11-TESTCASES)] specification.

4. RDF Datasets
---------------

An RDF dataset is a collection of
[RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"), and comprises:

* Exactly one default graph, being an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph).
  The default graph does not have a name and *MAY* be empty.
* Zero or more named graphs.
  Each named graph is a pair consisting of an [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") or a blank node
  (the graph name), and an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph).
  Graph names are unique within an RDF dataset.

[Blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") can be shared between graphs
in an [RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset").

Note

Despite the use of the word “name” in “[named graph](#dfn-named-graph)”, the
[graph name](#dfn-graph-name) is not required to [denote](#dfn-denote) the graph. It is
merely syntactically paired with the graph. RDF does not place any
formal restrictions on what [resource](#dfn-resource) the graph name may denote,
nor on the relationship between that resource and the graph.
A discussion of different RDF dataset semantics can be found in
[[RDF11-DATASETS](#bib-RDF11-DATASETS)].

Some [RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset") implementations do not
track empty [named graphs](#dfn-named-graph "named graph"). Applications
can avoid interoperability issues by not ascribing importance to
the presence or absence of empty named graphs.

SPARQL 1.1 [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW](#bib-SPARQL11-OVERVIEW)] also defines the concept of an RDF
Dataset. The definition of an RDF Dataset in SPARQL 1.1 and this
specification differ slightly in that this specification allows RDF
Graphs to be identified using either an IRI or a blank node. SPARQL 1.1
Query Language only allows RDF Graphs to be identified using an IRI.
Existing SPARQL implementations might not allow blank nodes to be used
to identify RDF Graphs for some time, so their use can cause
interoperability problems.
[Skolemizing](#section-skolemization) blank nodes used as
graph names can be used to overcome these interoperability problems.

### 4.1 RDF Dataset Comparison

Two [RDF datasets](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset")
(the RDF dataset D1 with default graph DG1 and any named
graph NG1 and the RDF dataset D2 with default graph
DG2 and any named graph NG2)
are dataset-isomorphic if and only if
there is a bijection M between the nodes, triples and graphs in
D1 and those in D2 such that:

1. M maps blank nodes to blank nodes;
2. M is the identity map on literals and URIs;
3. For every triple <s p o>, M(<s, p, o>)=
   <M(s), M(p), M(o)>;
4. For every graph G={t1, ..., tn},
   M(G)={M(t1), ..., M(tn)};
5. DG2 = M(DG1); and
6. <n, G> is in NG1 if and only if
   <M(n), M(G)> is in NG2.

### 4.2 Content Negotiation of RDF Datasets

*This section is non-normative.*

Web resources may have multiple representations that are made available via
[content negotiation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#frag-coneg)
[[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)]. A representation may be returned in an RDF serialization
format that supports the expression of both [RDF datasets](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset") and
[RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"). If an [RDF dataset](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset")
is returned and the consumer is expecting an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"),
the consumer is expected to use the [RDF dataset's](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF Dataset") default graph.

5. Datatypes
------------

Datatypes are used with RDF [literals](#dfn-literal "literal")
to represent values such as strings, numbers and dates.
The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema
[[XMLSCHEMA11-2](#bib-XMLSCHEMA11-2)]. Any datatype definition that conforms
to this abstraction *MAY* be used in RDF, even if not defined
in terms of XML Schema. RDF re-uses many of the XML Schema
built-in datatypes, and defines two additional non-normative datatypes,
`rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral`.
The list of datatypes supported by an implementation is determined
by its [recognized datatype IRIs](#dfn-recognized-datatype-iris).

A datatype consists of a [lexical space](#dfn-lexical-space),
a [value space](#dfn-value-space) and a [lexical-to-value mapping](#dfn-lexical-to-value-mapping), and
is denoted by one or more [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI").

The lexical space of a datatype is a set of Unicode [[UNICODE](#bib-UNICODE)] strings.

The lexical-to-value mapping of a datatype is a set of
pairs whose first element belongs to the [lexical space](#dfn-lexical-space),
and the second element belongs to the value space
of the datatype. Each member of the lexical space is paired with exactly
one value, and is a *lexical representation*
of that value. The mapping can be seen as a function
from the lexical space to the value space.

Note

[Language-tagged
strings](#dfn-language-tagged-string "language-tagged string") have the [datatype IRI](#dfn-datatype-iri)
`http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#langString`.
No datatype is formally defined for this IRI because the definition
of [datatypes](#dfn-datatype "datatype") does not accommodate
[language tags](#dfn-language-tag "language tag") in the [lexical space](#dfn-lexical-space).
The [value space](#dfn-value-space) associated with this datatype IRI is the set
of all pairs of strings and language tags.

For example, the XML Schema datatype `xsd:boolean`,
where each member of the [value space](#dfn-value-space) has two lexical
representations, is defined as follows:

Lexical space:
:   {“`true`”, “`false`”, “`1`”, “`0`”}

Value space:
:   {***true***, ***false***}

Lexical-to-value mapping
:   {
    <“`true`”, ***true***>,
    <“`false`”, ***false***>,
    <“`1`”, ***true***>,
    <“`0`”, ***false***>,
    }

The [literals](#dfn-literal "literal") that can be defined using this
datatype are:

This table lists the literals of type xsd:boolean.

| Literal | Value |
| --- | --- |
| <“`true`”, `xsd:boolean`> | ***true*** |
| <“`false`”, `xsd:boolean`> | ***false*** |
| <“`1`”, `xsd:boolean`> | ***true*** |
| <“`0`”, `xsd:boolean`> | ***false*** |

### 5.1 The XML Schema Built-in Datatypes

[IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI") of the form
`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#xxx`,
where `xxx`
is the name of a datatype, denote the built-in datatypes defined in
*[XML Schema 1.1 Part 2:
Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/)* [[XMLSCHEMA11-2](#bib-XMLSCHEMA11-2)]. The XML Schema built-in types
listed in the following table are the
RDF-compatible XSD types. Their use is *RECOMMENDED*.

Readers might note that the xsd:hexBinary and xsd:base64Binary
datatypes are the only safe datatypes for transferring binary
information.

The other built-in XML Schema datatypes are unsuitable
for various reasons and *SHOULD NOT* be used:

* [`xsd:QName`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#QName)
  and [`xsd:ENTITY`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#ENTITY)
  require an enclosing XML document context.
* [`xsd:ID`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#ID)
  and [`xsd:IDREF`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#IDREF)
  are for cross references within an XML document.
* [`xsd:NOTATION`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#NOTATION)
  is not intended for direct use.
* [`xsd:IDREFS`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#IDREFS),
  [`xsd:ENTITIES`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#ENTITIES)
  and [`xsd:NMTOKENS`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#NMTOKENS)
  are sequence-valued datatypes which do not fit the RDF [datatype](#dfn-datatype)
  model.

### 5.2 The `rdf:HTML` Datatype

*This section is non-normative.*

RDF provides for HTML content as a possible [literal value](#dfn-literal-value).
This allows markup in literal values. Such content is indicated
in an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) using a [literal](#dfn-literal) whose [datatype](#dfn-datatype)
is set to `rdf:HTML`. This datatype is defined
as non-normative because it depends on [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)], a specification that
has not yet reached W3C Recommendation status.

The `rdf:HTML` datatype is defined as follows:

The IRI denoting this datatype
:   is `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML`.

The lexical space
:   is the set of Unicode [[UNICODE](#bib-UNICODE)] strings.

The value space
:   is a set of DOM
    [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment)
    nodes [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)]. Two
    [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment)
    nodes *A* and *B* are considered equal if and only if
    the DOM method
    `A.isEqualNode(B)`
    [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)] returns `true`.

The lexical-to-value mapping
:   Each member of the lexical space is associated with the result
    of applying the following algorithm:

    * Let `domnodes` be the list of [DOM nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#node) [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)]
      that result from applying the
      [HTML fragment parsing algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#parsing-html-fragments) [[HTML5](#bib-HTML5)]
      to the input string, without a context element.
    * Let `domfrag` be a DOM
      [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment) [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)]
      whose `childNodes` attribute is equal to `domnodes`
    * Return `domfrag.normalize()`

Note

Any language annotation (`lang="…"`) or
XML namespaces (`xmlns`) desired in the HTML content
must be included explicitly in the HTML literal. Relative URLs
in attributes such as `href` do not have a well-defined
base URL and are best avoided.
RDF applications may use additional equivalence relations,
such as that which relates an `xsd:string` with an
`rdf:HTML` literal corresponding to a single text node
of the same string.

### 5.3 The `rdf:XMLLiteral` Datatype

*This section is non-normative.*

RDF provides for XML content as a possible [literal value](#dfn-literal-value).
Such content is indicated in an [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) using a [literal](#dfn-literal)
whose [datatype](#dfn-datatype) is set to `rdf:XMLLiteral`.
This datatype is defined as non-normative because it depends on [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)],
a specification that has not yet reached W3C Recommendation status.

The `rdf:XMLLiteral` datatype is defined as follows:

The IRI denoting this [datatype](#dfn-datatype)
:   is `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral`.

The [lexical space](#dfn-lexical-space)
:   is the set of all strings which are well-balanced, self-contained
    [XML content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-content)
    [[XML10](#bib-XML10)]; and for which embedding between an arbitrary
    XML start tag and an end tag yields a document conforming to
    [XML Namespaces](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/)
    [[XML-NAMES](#bib-XML-NAMES)].

The [value space](#dfn-value-space)
:   is a set of DOM
    [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment)
    nodes [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)]. Two
    [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment)
    nodes *A* and *B* are considered equal if and only if the DOM method
    `A.isEqualNode(B)`
    returns `true`.

The [lexical-to-value mapping](#dfn-lexical-to-value-mapping)
:   Each member of the lexical space is associated with the result of applying the following algorithm:

    * Let `domfrag` be a DOM
      [`DocumentFragment`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-documentfragment)
      node [[DOM4](#bib-DOM4)] corresponding to the input string
    * Return `domfrag.normalize()`

The canonical mapping
:   defines a
    [canonical lexical form](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dt-canonical-mapping) [[XMLSCHEMA11-2](#bib-XMLSCHEMA11-2)]
    for each member of the value space. The `rdf:XMLLiteral` canonical mapping is the
    [exclusive XML canonicalization method](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-exclusive-XML-canonicalization-method)
    (*with comments, with empty
    [InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList](https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718/#def-InclusiveNamespaces-PrefixList)*)
    [[XML-EXC-C14N](#bib-XML-EXC-C14N)].

Note

Any XML namespace declarations (`xmlns`),
language annotation (`xml:lang`) or base URI declarations
(`xml:base`) desired in the XML content must be included
explicitly in the XML literal. Note that some concrete RDF syntaxes
may define mechanisms for inheriting them from the context (e.g.,
[`@parseType="literal"`](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt)
in RDF/XML [[RDF11-XML](#bib-RDF11-XML)]).

### 5.4 Datatype IRIs

Datatypes are identified by [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"). If
D is a set of IRIs which are used to refer to
datatypes, then the elements of D are called recognized
datatype IRIs. Recognized IRIs have fixed
[referents](#referents). If any IRI of the form
`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#xxx` is recognized, it
*MUST* refer to the RDF-compatible XSD type named `xsd:xxx` for
every XSD type listed in [section 5.1](#xsd-datatypes).
Furthermore, the following IRIs are allocated for non-normative
datatypes:

* The IRI `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral`
  refers to the datatype `rdf:XMLLiteral`
* The IRI `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML`
  refers to the datatype `rdf:HTML`

Note

Semantic extensions of RDF might choose to
recognize other datatype IRIs
and require them to refer to a fixed datatype. See the RDF
Semantics specification [[RDF11-MT](#bib-RDF11-MT)] for more information on
semantic extensions.

RDF processors are not required to recognize datatype IRIs.
Any literal typed with an unrecognized IRI is treated just like
an unknown IRI, i.e. as referring to an unknown thing. Applications
*MAY* give a warning message if they are unable to determine the
referent of an IRI used in a typed literal, but they *SHOULD NOT*
reject such RDF as either a syntactic or semantic error.

Other specifications *MAY* impose additional constraints on
[datatype IRIs](#dfn-datatype-iri "datatype IRI"), for example, require support
for certain datatypes.

Note

The Web Ontology Language
[[OWL2-OVERVIEW](#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)] offers facilities for formally defining
[custom
datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Datatype_Definitions) that can be used with RDF. Furthermore, a practice for
identifying
[user-defined simple XML Schema datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-xsch-datatypes/#sec-userDefined)
is suggested in [[SWBP-XSCH-DATATYPES](#bib-SWBP-XSCH-DATATYPES)]. RDF implementations
are not required to support either of these facilities.

6. Fragment Identifiers
-----------------------

*This section is non-normative.*

RDF uses [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"), which may include
fragment identifiers, as resource identifiers.
The semantics of fragment identifiers is
[defined in
RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5) [[RFC3986](#bib-RFC3986)]: They identify a secondary resource
that is usually a part of, view of, defined in, or described in
the primary resource, and the precise semantics depend on the set
of representations that might result from a retrieval action
on the primary resource.

This section discusses the handling of fragment identifiers
in representations that encode [RDF graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph").

In RDF-bearing representations of a primary resource
`<foo>`,
the secondary resource identified by a fragment `bar`
is the [resource](#dfn-resource) [denoted](#dfn-denote "denote") by the
full [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") `<foo#bar>` in the [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph).
Since IRIs in RDF graphs can denote anything, this can be
something external to the representation, or even external
to the web.

In this way, the RDF-bearing representation acts as an intermediary
between the web-accessible primary resource, and some set of possibly
non-web or abstract entities that the [RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) may describe.

In cases where other specifications constrain the semantics of
fragment identifiers in RDF-bearing representations, the encoded
[RDF graph](#dfn-rdf-graph) should use fragment identifiers in a way that is consistent
with these constraints. For example, in an HTML+RDFa document [[HTML-RDFA](#bib-HTML-RDFA)],
the fragment `chapter1` may identify a document section
via the semantics of HTML's `@name` or `@id`
attributes. The [IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") `<#chapter1>` should
then be taken to [denote](#dfn-denote) that same section in any RDFa-encoded
[triples](#dfn-rdf-triple "RDF triple") within the same document.
Similarly, fragment identifiers should be used consistently in resources
with multiple representations that are made available via
[content negotiation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#frag-coneg)
[[WEBARCH](#bib-WEBARCH)]. For example, if the fragment `chapter1` identifies a
document section in an HTML representation of the primary resource, then the
[IRI](#dfn-iri "IRI") `<#chapter1>` should be taken to
[denote](#dfn-denote) that same section in all RDF-bearing representations of the
same primary resource.

7. Generalized RDF Triples, Graphs, and Datasets
------------------------------------------------

*This section is non-normative.*

It is sometimes convenient to loosen the requirements
on [RDF triple](#dfn-rdf-triple)s. For example, the completeness
of the RDFS entailment rules is easier to show with a
generalization of RDF triples.

A generalized RDF
triple is a triple having a subject, a predicate,
and object, where each can be an [IRI](#dfn-iri "iri"), a
[blank node](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") or a
[literal](#dfn-literal). A
generalized RDF graph
is a set of generalized RDF triples. A
generalized RDF dataset
comprises a distinguished generalized RDF graph, and zero
or more pairs each associating an IRI, a blank node or a literal
to a generalized RDF graph.

Generalized RDF triples, graphs, and datasets differ
from normative RDF [triples](#dfn-rdf-triple "RDF triple"),
[graphs](#dfn-rdf-graph "RDF graph"), and
[datasets](#dfn-rdf-dataset "RDF dataset") only
by allowing [IRIs](#dfn-iri "IRI"),
[blank nodes](#dfn-blank-node "blank node") and
[literals](#dfn-literal "literal") to appear
in any position, i.e., as subject, predicate, object or graph names.

Note

Any users of
generalized RDF triples, graphs or datasets need to be
aware that these notions are non-standard extensions of
RDF and their use may cause interoperability problems.
There is no requirement on the part of any RDF tool to
accept, process, or produce anything beyond standard RDF
triples, graphs, and datasets.
