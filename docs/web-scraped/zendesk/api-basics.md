## Getting started 

Getting a trial or sponsored account for development 
You can try out the Zendesk platform with a free, 14-day trial account. If you're interested in becoming a Zendesk developer partner, you can convert your trial account into a sponsored Zendesk Support account. 

Installing and using curl 
All the examples in the Zendesk REST API docs use curl, a lightweight, command-line tool for making HTTP requests without a web browser. curl lets you try out various API requests in a command-line interface such as the command prompt in Windows or Terminal in macOS. 

Working with JSON 
The Zendesk REST API is a JSON API. If you want to send data to the API to update or create data in your Zendesk product, you need to convert it to JSON first. This guide covers the basics and how to use JSON in curl statements.
