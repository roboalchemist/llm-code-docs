## Learn about the different apps you can build 

You may have already read about the Zendesk Apps framework (ZAF) and how you can use it to modify and extend your agent's interface in a number of ways. 

But are you aware of all the paths that you can choose when starting your custom code adventure? Know the benefits of each approach, so you can determine what direction is best. 

Choose your own app adventure 

## Getting started 

Build an app with App Builder 
Create Zendesk apps with natural language prompts and AI, no code required. 

Zendesk app quick start 
In this quick start, you'll build and locally run a Zendesk app. The quick start introduces you to the tools and workflow commonly used for Zendesk app development. 

Test drive the Apps framework 
In this 15-minute tutorial, you'll use the Zendesk Apps framework to access ticket data. You'll also use the framework to add a comment to a ticket as well as create a ticket. 

Using the Zendesk Command Line Interface (ZCLI) 
Install ZCLI, a local development tool that lets you test, validate and package
Zendesk apps. 

## Building your first app 

Weâve created step by step tutorials on creating your first Support, Sell, Chat and server-side apps. 

Building your first Support app 
The âRequester X-rayâ app will display the requester's name, any user tags applied to the requester, when the requester was added and when they last signed in to Zendesk Support. 

Building your first Sell app 
The âRelated Leadsâ app displays new leads for an organization associated with a deal. 

Building your first Chat app 
The app âLearn Moreâ is designed to let a chat agent send a visitor links to more information about any subject. It'll have a simple interface consisting of a search box and button. 

Building your first server-side app 
Because a Zendesk app runs in an iframe in the product, you can use a server-side web application to generate the content for the iframe. You can use any server-side technology you want so long as you have a component that can send HTML pages in response to HTTP requests. 

## Publish your app to the Zendesk Marketplace 

By now, you've either already created an app or are considering building one. The steps in this guide will take you through the process of publishing your app and becoming a Zendesk Marketplace partner.
