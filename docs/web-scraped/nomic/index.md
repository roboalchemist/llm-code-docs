# Use Cases

Source: https://docs.nomic.ai/

The Nomic Platform enables developers to build knowledge agents that require strong data, document understanding, and retrieval capabilities.

- Datasets: Store, embed, search, and visualize millions of rows of unstructured data.
- Parse: Turn unstructured, complex PDFs into language model ready inputs by parsing them into blocks and chunks.
- Extraction: Extract information and structured schemas from collections of unstructured documents and PDFs.
- Embeddings: Generate embeddings that enable your agents to search over unstructured information with Nomic Embed.
