Atlas is a great way to analyze spreadsheet data, as it helps teams discover patterns and relationships that may be hidden in traditional row and column views. By visualizing spreadsheet content in Atlas's interactive maps, teams can uncover clusters, outliers, and trends across their data that wouldn't be apparent through sorting and filtering alone. This semantic analysis of spreadsheet content can surface insights about customer segments, product usage, or business metrics that inform data-driven decisions.
