The Platform Dashboard is your central hub for managing the datasets, members, API access, and settings for your Atlas organization. It consists of the following sections:

- Datasets: View and manage all datasets in your organization
- Members: Manage organization membership and permission levels
- API Keys: Create and manage API keys for programmatic access
- Settings: View and configure organization-level platform usage and billing settings
Visit your Platform dashboard at https://atlas.nomic.ai/data.

## Datasets​

The Datasets tab provides a gallery of all the datasets in your organization. Each dataset is represented by a card that displays a preview of the data map corresponding to the dataset, its name, and metadata including its and size and visibility (public or private).

You can search for specific datasets by name or sort the gallery alphabetically, by creation date, or by dataset size.

When you select a dataset by clicking its card, you'll be taken to a dedicated dataset page with two sections:

### Dataset Preview​

The preview section offers a quick way to see and understand your dataset.

You can scroll through rows of the dataset, inspect which columns are present, and see metadata from its upload.

### Dataset Settings​

The settings section lets you control your dataset's name, description, and access permissions. Additionally, this is where you have the option to delete your dataset.

For users on Business & Enterprise tiers, you can give dataset-specific access permissions:

- Add or remove individual members from specific datasets
- Implement precise access control to determine who can view or edit particular datasets within your organization
- Dataset-level permissions are independent from organization-wide settings
## Organization Members​

From the Members tab, you can:

- Add new members to your organization
- Set permission levels (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer, or Guest)
- Remove members from your organization
For detailed information about permission levels and access control, see our Security and RBAC documentation.

Adding members to your Nomic Platform organization is only available for users in the Business and Enterprise plans.

## API Keys​

The API Keys tab provides functionality to manage API access to the Nomic Platform. You can generate new API keys for your applications and delete keys that are no longer needed.

API keys provide secure programmatic access enabling you to interact with the platform's core functionality through code.

## Organization Settings​

### Organization Usage & Limits​

The Settings tab provides visibility into your organization's platform and API usage, including:

- Dataset Storage: Track the total storage used by your datasets, including embedding storage
- Text Tokens: Monitor the amount of text processed through dataset embedding creation or API usage
- Images: View the number of images processed through dataset embedding creation or API usage
Each metric shows both current usage and total allocation limits for your plan.

### Upgrade Organization Tier​

In the settings page you can upgrade your Platform organization to the Plus, Business or Enterprise plan.

Upgrading your Platform tier gives you access to increased data storage and API usage limits, collaboration on your maps, dataset & organization role-based access control, and more.
