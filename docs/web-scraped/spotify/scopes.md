# Scopes  
Scopes provide Spotify users using third-party apps the confidence that only
the information they choose to share will be shared, and nothing more.

## Pre-requisites

Scopes are needed when implementing some of the authorization grant types. Make
sure you have read the
[Authorization]() guide to
understand the basics.
