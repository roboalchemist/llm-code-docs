# Access Token  

The *access token* is a string which contains the credentials and permissions
that can be used to access a given resource (e.g artists, albums or tracks) or
user's data (e.g your profile or your playlists).

To use the *access token* you must include the following header in your API
calls:

Header ParameterValueAuthorizationValid access token following the format: `Bearer <Access Token>`
Note that the *access token* is valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds). After that
time, the token expires and you need to request a new one.

## Examples

The following example uses `cURL` to retrieve information about a track using
the [Get a track]()
endpoint:

`
_10curl --request GET \_10    'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2TpxZ7JUBn3uw46aR7qd6V' \_10     --header "Authorization: Bearer NgCXRK...MzYjw"
`
The following code implements the `getProfile()` function which performs the
API call to the [Get Current User's Profile]() endpoint
to retrieve the user profile related information:

`
_11async function getProfile(accessToken) {_11  let accessToken = localStorage.getItem('access_token');_11_11  const response = await fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me', {_11    headers: {_11      Authorization: 'Bearer ' + accessToken_11    }_11  });_11_11  const data = await response.json();_11}
