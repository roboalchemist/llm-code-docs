Welcome to the Hardhat plugin development documentation. In this section, you’ll learn how to extend and customize Hardhat’s behavior using plugins.

What is a Hardhat plugin?
-------------------------

[Section titled “What is a Hardhat plugin?”](https://hardhat.org/docs/plugin-development#what-is-a-hardhat-plugin)

A Hardhat plugin is a reusable extension of the functionality of Hardhat and its plugins.

Plugins are defined as TypeScript objects with a `HardhatPlugin` type. Users add them to the `plugins` array in their `hardhat.config.ts` file.

Let’s look at the structure of a basic plugin:

`import type { HardhatPlugin } from "hardhat/types/plugins";import "./type-extensions.js";const plugin: HardhatPlugin = {  id: "hardhat-my-plugin",  hookHandlers: {    // The hook handlers that this plugin defines  },  tasks: [    // The tasks that this plugin defines  ],  globalOptions: [    // The global options that this plugin defines  ],  dependencies: [    // Other plugins that this plugin depends on  ],  conditionalDependencies: [    // Plugins that are loaded only if the user is already using certain other plugins  ],};export default plugin;`

A plugin can define:

*   **Type Extensions** allow you to extend Hardhat’s built-in types. For example, you can add custom fields to the `HardhatUserConfig` type. Read more about them [here](https://hardhat.org/docs/plugin-development/explanations/type-extensions).

*   **Hook Handlers** are functions that customize different parts of Hardhat’s behavior. Each extensibility point is called a Hook. Learn more about them [here](https://hardhat.org/docs/plugin-development/explanations/hooks).

*   **Hardhat Tasks** are exposed in the CLI and can be run with `npx hardhat <task>`.

*   **Global Options** are exposed in the CLI and can be used with `--<option>`. When you define a Global Option, its value is available everywhere (Hook Handlers, Hardhat Tasks, tests, etc.).

*   **Dependencies** specify other plugins that this plugin depends on. Hardhat guarantees that dependencies are loaded before the plugin itself. Read [this guide](https://hardhat.org/docs/plugin-development/guides/dependencies) to learn how to use them.

*   **Conditional Dependencies** declare plugins that are loaded only if the user is already using certain other plugins, without forcing those to be loaded.
