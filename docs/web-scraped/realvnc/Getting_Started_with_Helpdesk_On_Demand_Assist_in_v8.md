The Helpdesk feature enables you to quickly connect to somebody else's computer without them having to install any software onto their device.

If your subscription does not include On-Demand Assist you will need to upgrade your subscription. You can navigate to the [RealVNC Connect Portal](https://manage.realvnc.com) by clicking the **Upgrade** button or by contacting your RealVNC account representative.

# Starting an On-Demand Assist session with an end user 

As a technician providing support to an end user, navigate to the Helpdesk section of the RealVNC Connect application in the sidebar menu and hit **Generate session code** to create a time-limited one time use code.

Ask the end user to navigate to www.realvnc.help, and download the disposable app by clicking the Download for Windows and then running the downloaded app.

Communicate the unique session code you generated to the end user (over the phone, via email or SMS); there's no mechanism in VNC Viewer to do this.

Wait for the end user to enter the session code, read and confirm the privacy warning.

Take control of the end user's computer when the session automatically begins.\
Use toolbar to perform necessary actions, for more information see the Connection session toolbar section of [The RealVNC Connect v8 User Interface](/hc/en-us/articles/25743972924573)

You can close the session either by clicking the Disconnect button in the toolbar or by clicking **End Session** on the end user's computer

After clicking the Disconnect button in the toolbar confirm session termination.\
You will be notified if the session is terminated from the end user's side.

## Elevating permissions 

An On-Demand Assist technician can perform administrative operations on the remote device once the session has been elevated.

Elevation only applies when controlling Windows computers.

Refer to [Performing administrative operations with On-Demand Assist](/hc/en-us/articles/360024351852)

## Chat 

The technician and end user can communicate using chat.
