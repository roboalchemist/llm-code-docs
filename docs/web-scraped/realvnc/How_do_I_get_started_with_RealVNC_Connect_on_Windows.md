# Connecting for the first time 

In RealVNC Viewer, double click or tap on the remote computer that you want to connect to.

Make sure you are using RealVNC Viewer on a separate device to the one with RealVNC Server installed, otherwise you will see an [infinite \"hall of mirrors\"](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/14110369864861)!

As part of the first connection to a RealVNC Server, RealVNC Viewer will show you a Identity Check screen that you can use to verify you are connecting to the right computer.

You can check the displayed Catchphrase and Signature against the values shown in RealVNC Server.

![RealVNC Server.png](/hc/article_attachments/14140243729053)

RealVNC Viewer will store the identity which it will automatically check against for future connections to that computer to ensure they match. If they don\'t, RealVNC Viewer will display a warning to alert you before it makes the connection. 

#### Did you know? 

You can connect to a remote computer from the [RealVNC Connect Portal](https://manage.realvnc.com/) by visiting the Computers page and clicking the \'Connect\' button. Read more [here](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/9987343661469-Connecting-to-a-computer-from-the-VNC-Connect-Portal). 

## Authenticating 

When you connect to a remote computer, you will be prompted to authenticate. Enter the password you [made a note of from step 6 above](#on-the-device-you-want-to-control-0-0).

![Authenticating.png](/hc/article_attachments/14140196611357)

#### Selected Windows Password during setup? 

This means you will need to use the username and password of an account on the remote computer. [Click here for more information](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004013351)

# Further information 

## Permissions 

If you selected Windows Password during setup, you need to ensure that the users you want to be able to connect remotely have been given permission (by default, only members of the Administrators group are able to connect).

To add other users, see [Managing users and session permissions for RealVNC Server](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002253618). Failure to do this may result in not being able to connect to your computer remotely.
