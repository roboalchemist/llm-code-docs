# Signing into the RealVNC Help Center 

You can sign into the RealVNC Help Center to manage your support requests and comment on knowledgebase articles to help us improve them. You can also follow topics to be notified of any updates.

To sign in, you can either create a support account or login using your Google or Microsoft accounts. If you have previously had a support request with us, we\'ve already created a support account for you and you just need to set a password using the \"Get a password\" link on the sign in screen.

Please note - your RealVNC Support account is completely separate from the RealVNC account you use to sign into RealVNC online services and applications.

If you\'d like to be able to see tickets from others in your organisation, just let us know and we can enable this.

# Finding and following information in the Help Center
