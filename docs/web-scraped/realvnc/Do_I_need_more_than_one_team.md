We'll create one [team](/hc/en-us/articles/360024741652) for each subscription you have in your [RealVNC account](https://help.realvnc.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002317757-Do-I-have-to-sign-up-for-a-RealVNC-account-).

For example, if you have a Lite subscription for your own private use and an Enterprise subscription at work, you'll have two teams. There's a picker to choose between them in the [online portal](https://manage.realvnc.com):

These teams are completely separate. People you invite in to one team cannot remotely access computers in the other team, nor can people you [promote](/hc/en-us/articles/360002317817) to be managers or administrators of one team manage any aspect of the other.

It's important to note that you don't need to create a new team (that is, take out a new subscription) in order to:

-   Divide responsibility for computers with RealVNC Connect installed among people. Instead, you can [assign discovery permissions](/hc/en-us/articles/360002320778) on the **Computers** page.
-   Increase the capacity for your subscription as your remote access needs grow. Instead, you can [add capacity](/hc/en-us/articles/360024258092) at any time from the **Billing** page.
