Cloud CDN Service Level Agreement (SLA) | Google Cloud
===============

*   Current

Cloud CDN Service Level Agreement (SLA)
=======================================

During the Term of the agreement under which Google has agreed to provide Google Cloud Platform to Customer (as applicable, the "Agreement"), the Covered Service will provide a Monthly Uptime Percentage to Customer of at least 99.95% (the "Service Level Objective" or "SLO"). If Google does not meet the SLO, and if Customer meets its obligations under this SLA, Customer will be eligible to receive the Financial Credits described below. This SLA states Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Google to meet the SLO. Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this SLA have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. If the Agreement authorizes the resale or supply of Google Cloud Platform under a Google Cloud partner or reseller program, then all references to Customer in this SLA mean Partner or Reseller (as applicable), and any Financial Credit(s) will only apply for impacted Partner or Reseller order(s) under the Agreement.

#### Definitions

The following definitions apply to the SLA.

*   **"Covered Service"**means Cloud CDN.
*   **"Downtime"**means loss of external connectivity (via the external IP addresses associated with load balancing forwarding rules) due to the failure of Google's systems.
*   **"Downtime Period"**means a period of five consecutive minutes of Downtime. Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than five minutes will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.
*   **"Financial Credit"**means the following:

**Monthly Uptime Percentage****Percentage of monthly bill for Covered Service which does not meet SLO that will be credited to future monthly bills of Customer**
99.0% - < 99.95%10%
95.0% - < 99.0%25%
< 95.0%50%

**Monthly Uptime Percentage**

**Percentage of monthly bill for Covered Service which does not meet SLO that will be credited to future monthly bills of Customer**

99.0% - < 99.95%

10%

95.0% - < 99.0%

25%

< 95.0%

50%

*   **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"**means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month.

#### Customer Must Request Financial Credit

In order to receive any of the Financial Credits described above, Customer must[notify Google technical support](https://support.google.com/cloud/contact/cloud_platform_sla)within thirty days from the time Customer becomes eligible to receive a Financial Credit. Customer must also provide Google with server log files showing loss of external connectivity errors and the date and time those errors occurred. If Customer does not comply with these requirements, Customer will forfeit its right to receive a Financial Credit. If a dispute arises with respect to this SLA, Google will make a determination in good faith based on its system logs, monitoring reports, configuration records, and other available information.

#### Maximum Financial Credit

The aggregate maximum number of Financial Credits to be issued by Google to Customer for any and all Downtime Periods that occur in a single billing month will not exceed 50% of the amount due by Customer for the Covered Service for the applicable month. Financial Credits will be made in the form of a monetary credit applied to future use of the Service and will be applied within 60 days after the Financial Credit was requested.

#### SLA Exclusions

The SLA does not apply to any: (a) features designated Alpha or Beta (unless otherwise set forth in the associated Documentation), (b) features excluded from the SLA (in the associated Documentation), or (c) errors: (i) caused by factors outside of Google's reasonable control; (ii) that resulted from Customer's software or hardware or third party software or hardware, or both; (iii) that resulted from abuses or other behaviors that violate the Agreement; or (iv) that resulted from quotas applied by the system and/or listed in the Admin Console.
