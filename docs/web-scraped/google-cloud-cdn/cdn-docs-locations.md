Cloud CDN relies on the [same CDN edge points of presence that Google uses](https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure) to serve Google's web properties to billions of users. This approach connects individual points of presence (PoPs) into as many networks as possible, reducing latency and ensuring that we have capacity for large traffic spikes (for example, for streaming media or holiday sales). We have an open peering policy with ISPs. Learn more about our open approach to [peering with ISPs](https://peering.google.com/).

Points of presence
------------------

Cloud CDN operates caches at more than 100 locations across the following metropolitan areas. Google Cloud also has [interconnect locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/colocation-facilities) to connect your corporate network to Google Cloud and [network edge locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/edge-locations) to connect to Google Cloud services. Google connects its network with other network operators at numerous [edge PoPs](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/#network) around the world, including many of the Cloud CDN sites in the following list.

The set of PoPs in active use can change without notice. Equipment maintenance, equipment failure, the introduction of new PoPs, the removal of old PoPs, and other events mean that the following list might not reflect the PoPs that are in use.

Many of the following cities have multiple PoPs to support service demand or to peer with different network partners. Cloud CDN caches separately in each location.
