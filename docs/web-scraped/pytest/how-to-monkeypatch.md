# How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments[¶](#how-to-monkeypatch-mock-modules-and-environments "Link to this heading")

Sometimes tests need to invoke functionality which depends on global settings or which invokes code which cannot be easily tested such as network access. The [`monkeypatch`] fixture helps you to safely set/delete an attribute, dictionary item or environment variable, or to modify [`sys.path`] for importing.

The [`monkeypatch`] fixture provides these helper methods for safely patching and mocking functionality in tests:

-   [[`monkeypatch.setattr(obj,`]` `[`name,`]` `[`value,`]` `[`raising=True)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr")

-   [[`monkeypatch.delattr(obj,`]` `[`name,`]` `[`raising=True)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr")

-   [[`monkeypatch.setitem(mapping,`]` `[`name,`]` `[`value)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem")

-   [[`monkeypatch.delitem(obj,`]` `[`name,`]` `[`raising=True)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem")

-   [[`monkeypatch.setenv(name,`]` `[`value,`]` `[`prepend=None)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv")

-   [[`monkeypatch.delenv(name,`]` `[`raising=True)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv")

-   [[`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend(path)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend "pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend")

-   [[`monkeypatch.chdir(path)`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir "pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir")

-   [[`monkeypatch.context()`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.context "pytest.MonkeyPatch.context")

All modifications will be undone after the requesting test function or fixture has finished. The [`raising`] parameter determines if a [`KeyError`] or [`AttributeError`] will be raised if the target of the set/deletion operation does not exist.

Consider the following scenarios:

1\. Modifying the behavior of a function or the property of a class for a test e.g. there is an API call or database connection you will not make for a test but you know what the expected output should be. Use [[`monkeypatch.setattr`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr") to patch the function or property with your desired testing behavior. This can include your own functions. Use [[`monkeypatch.delattr`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr") to remove the function or property for the test.

2\. Modifying the values of dictionaries e.g. you have a global configuration that you want to modify for certain test cases. Use [[`monkeypatch.setitem`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem") to patch the dictionary for the test. [[`monkeypatch.delitem`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem") can be used to remove items.

3\. Modifying environment variables for a test e.g. to test program behavior if an environment variable is missing, or to set multiple values to a known variable. [[`monkeypatch.setenv`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv") and [[`monkeypatch.delenv`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv") can be used for these patches.

4\. Use [`monkeypatch.setenv("PATH",`]` `[`value,`]` `[`prepend=os.pathsep)`] to modify [`$PATH`], and [[`monkeypatch.chdir`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir "pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir") to change the context of the current working directory during a test.

5\. Use [[`monkeypatch.syspath_prepend`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend "pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend") to modify [`sys.path`] which will also call [`pkg_resources.fixup_namespace_packages`] and [[`importlib.invalidate_caches()`]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.invalidate_caches "(in Python v3.14)").

6\. Use [[`monkeypatch.context`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.context "pytest.MonkeyPatch.context") to apply patches only in a specific scope, which can help control teardown of complex fixtures or patches to the stdlib.

See the [monkeypatch blog post](https://tetamap.wordpress.com//2009/03/03/monkeypatching-in-unit-tests-done-right/) for some introduction material and a discussion of its motivation.

## Monkeypatching functions[¶](#monkeypatching-functions "Link to this heading")

Consider a scenario where you are working with user directories. In the context of testing, you do not want your test to depend on the running user. [`monkeypatch`] can be used to patch functions dependent on the user to always return a specific value.

In this example, [[`monkeypatch.setattr`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr") is used to patch [`Path.home`] so that the known testing path [`Path("/abc")`] is always used when the test is run. This removes any dependency on the running user for testing purposes. [[`monkeypatch.setattr`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr") must be called before the function which will use the patched function is called. After the test function finishes the [`Path.home`] modification will be undone.

    # contents of test_module.py with source code and the test
    from pathlib import Path

    def getssh():
        """Simple function to return expanded homedir ssh path."""
        return Path.home() / ".ssh"

    def test_getssh(monkeypatch):
        # mocked return function to replace Path.home
        # always return '/abc'
        def mockreturn():
            return Path("/abc")

        # Application of the monkeypatch to replace Path.home
        # with the behavior of mockreturn defined above.
        monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", mockreturn)

        # Calling getssh() will use mockreturn in place of Path.home
        # for this test with the monkeypatch.
        x = getssh()
        assert x == Path("/abc/.ssh")

## Monkeypatching returned objects: building mock classes[¶](#monkeypatching-returned-objects-building-mock-classes "Link to this heading")

[[`monkeypatch.setattr`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr") can be used in conjunction with classes to mock returned objects from functions instead of values. Imagine a simple function to take an API url and return the json response.

    # contents of app.py, a simple API retrieval example
    import requests

    def get_json(url):
        """Takes a URL, and returns the JSON."""
        r = requests.get(url)
        return r.json()

We need to mock [`r`], the returned response object for testing purposes. The mock of [`r`] needs a [`.json()`] method which returns a dictionary. This can be done in our test file by defining a class to represent [`r`].

    # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
    # import requests for the purposes of monkeypatching
    import requests

    # our app.py that includes the get_json() function
    # this is the previous code block example
    import app

    # custom class to be the mock return value
    # will override the requests.Response returned from requests.get
    class MockResponse:
        # mock json() method always returns a specific testing dictionary
        @staticmethod
        def json():
            return 

    def test_get_json(monkeypatch):
        # Any arguments may be passed and mock_get() will always return our
        # mocked object, which only has the .json() method.
        def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
            return MockResponse()

        # apply the monkeypatch for requests.get to mock_get
        monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)

        # app.get_json, which contains requests.get, uses the monkeypatch
        result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
        assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"

[`monkeypatch`] applies the mock for [`requests.get`] with our [`mock_get`] function. The [`mock_get`] function returns an instance of the [`MockResponse`] class, which has a [`json()`] method defined to return a known testing dictionary and does not require any outside API connection.

You can build the [`MockResponse`] class with the appropriate degree of complexity for the scenario you are testing. For instance, it could include an [`ok`] property that always returns [`True`], or return different values from the [`json()`] mocked method based on input strings.

This mock can be shared across tests using a [`fixture`]:

    # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval
    import pytest
    import requests

    # app.py that includes the get_json() function
    import app

    # custom class to be the mock return value of requests.get()
    class MockResponse:
        @staticmethod
        def json():
            return 

    # monkeypatched requests.get moved to a fixture
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_response(monkeypatch):
        """Requests.get() mocked to return ."""

        def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
            return MockResponse()

        monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)

    # notice our test uses the custom fixture instead of monkeypatch directly
    def test_get_json(mock_response):
        result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")
        assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"

Furthermore, if the mock was designed to be applied to all tests, the [`fixture`] could be moved to a [`conftest.py`] file and use the with [`autouse=True`] option.

## Global patch example: preventing "requests" from remote operations[¶](#global-patch-example-preventing-requests-from-remote-operations "Link to this heading")

If you want to prevent the "requests" library from performing http requests in all your tests, you can do:

    # contents of conftest.py
    import pytest

    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def no_requests(monkeypatch):
        """Remove requests.sessions.Session.request for all tests."""
        monkeypatch.delattr("requests.sessions.Session.request")

This autouse fixture will be executed for each test function and it will delete the method [`request.session.Session.request`] so that any attempts within tests to create http requests will fail.

Note

Be advised that it is not recommended to patch builtin functions such as [`open`], [`compile`], etc., because it might break pytest's internals. If that's unavoidable, passing [[`--tb=native`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-tb), [[`--assert=plain`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-assert) and [[`--capture=no`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-capture) might help although there's no guarantee.

Note

Mind that patching [`stdlib`] functions and some third-party libraries used by pytest might break pytest itself, therefore in those cases it is recommended to use [[`MonkeyPatch.context()`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.context "pytest.MonkeyPatch.context") to limit the patching to the block you want tested:

    import functools

    def test_partial(monkeypatch):
        with monkeypatch.context() as m:
            m.setattr(functools, "partial", 3)
            assert functools.partial == 3

See [#3290](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3290) for details.

## Monkeypatching environment variables[¶](#monkeypatching-environment-variables "Link to this heading")

If you are working with environment variables you often need to safely change the values or delete them from the system for testing purposes. [`monkeypatch`] provides a mechanism to do this using the [`setenv`] and [`delenv`] method. Our example code to test:

    # contents of our original code file e.g. code.py
    import os

    def get_os_user_lower():
        """Simple retrieval function.
        Returns lowercase USER or raises OSError."""
        username = os.getenv("USER")

        if username is None:
            raise OSError("USER environment is not set.")

        return username.lower()

There are two potential paths. First, the [`USER`] environment variable is set to a value. Second, the [`USER`] environment variable does not exist. Using [`monkeypatch`] both paths can be safely tested without impacting the running environment:

    # contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
    import pytest

    def test_upper_to_lower(monkeypatch):
        """Set the USER env var to assert the behavior."""
        monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")
        assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"

    def test_raise_exception(monkeypatch):
        """Remove the USER env var and assert OSError is raised."""
        monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

        with pytest.raises(OSError):
            _ = get_os_user_lower()

This behavior can be moved into [`fixture`] structures and shared across tests:

    # contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
    import pytest

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_env_user(monkeypatch):
        monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_env_missing(monkeypatch):
        monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

    # notice the tests reference the fixtures for mocks
    def test_upper_to_lower(mock_env_user):
        assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"

    def test_raise_exception(mock_env_missing):
        with pytest.raises(OSError):
            _ = get_os_user_lower()

## Monkeypatching dictionaries[¶](#monkeypatching-dictionaries "Link to this heading")

[[`monkeypatch.setitem`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem") can be used to safely set the values of dictionaries to specific values during tests. Take this simplified connection string example:

    # contents of app.py to generate a simple connection string
    DEFAULT_CONFIG = 

    def create_connection_string(config=None):
        """Creates a connection string from input or defaults."""
        config = config or DEFAULT_CONFIG
        return f"User Id=; Location=;"

For testing purposes we can patch the [`DEFAULT_CONFIG`] dictionary to specific values.

    # contents of test_app.py
    # app.py with the connection string function (prior code block)
    import app

    def test_connection(monkeypatch):
        # Patch the values of DEFAULT_CONFIG to specific
        # testing values only for this test.
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

        # expected result based on the mocks
        expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

        # the test uses the monkeypatched dictionary settings
        result = app.create_connection_string()
        assert result == expected

You can use the [[`monkeypatch.delitem`]](../reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem "pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem") to remove values.

    # contents of test_app.py
    import pytest

    # app.py with the connection string function
    import app

    def test_missing_user(monkeypatch):
        # patch the DEFAULT_CONFIG t be missing the 'user' key
        monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

        # Key error expected because a config is not passed, and the
        # default is now missing the 'user' entry.
        with pytest.raises(KeyError):
            _ = app.create_connection_string()

The modularity of fixtures gives you the flexibility to define separate fixtures for each potential mock and reference them in the needed tests.

    # contents of test_app.py
    import pytest

    # app.py with the connection string function
    import app

    # all of the mocks are moved into separated fixtures
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_test_user(monkeypatch):
        """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG user to test_user."""
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_test_database(monkeypatch):
        """Set the DEFAULT_CONFIG database to test_db."""
        monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_missing_default_user(monkeypatch):
        """Remove the user key from DEFAULT_CONFIG"""
        monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

    # tests reference only the fixture mocks that are needed
    def test_connection(mock_test_user, mock_test_database):
        expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

        result = app.create_connection_string()
        assert result == expected

    def test_missing_user(mock_missing_default_user):
        with pytest.raises(KeyError):
            _ = app.create_connection_string()
