# How to invoke pytest[¶](#how-to-invoke-pytest "Link to this heading")

See also

[[Complete pytest command-line flags reference]](../reference/reference.html#command-line-flags)

In general, pytest is invoked with the command [`pytest`] (see below for [[other ways to invoke pytest]](#invoke-other)). This will execute all tests in all files whose names follow the form [`test_*.py`] or [`\*_test.py`] in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, pytest follows [[standard test discovery rules]](../explanation/goodpractices.html#test-discovery).

## Specifying which tests to run[¶](#specifying-which-tests-to-run "Link to this heading")

Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line or from a file (see below for [[reading arguments from file]](#args-from-file)).

**Run tests in a module**

    pytest test_mod.py

**Run tests in a directory**

    pytest testing/

**Run tests by keyword expressions**

    pytest -k 'MyClass and not method'

This will run tests which contain names that match the given *string expression* (case-insensitive), which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables. The example above will run [`TestMyClass.test_something`] but not [`TestMyClass.test_method_simple`]. Use [`""`] instead of [`''`] in expression when running this on Windows

**Run tests by collection arguments**

Pass the module filename relative to the working directory, followed by specifiers like the class name and function name separated by [`::`] characters, and parameters from parameterization enclosed in [`[]`].

To run a specific test within a module:

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func

To run all tests in a class:

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass

Specifying a specific test method:

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method

Specifying a specific parametrization of a test:

    pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func[x1,y2]

**Run tests by marker expressions**

To run all tests which are decorated with the [`@pytest.mark.slow`] decorator:

    pytest -m slow

To run all tests which are decorated with the annotated [`@pytest.mark.slow(phase=1)`] decorator, with the [`phase`] keyword argument set to [`1`]:

    pytest -m "slow(phase=1)"

For more information see [[marks]](mark.html#mark).

**Run tests from packages**

    pytest --pyargs pkg.testing

This will import [`pkg.testing`] and use its filesystem location to find and run tests from.

**Read arguments from file**

[Added in version 8.2.]

All of the above can be read from a file using the [`@`] prefix:

    pytest @tests_to_run.txt

where [`tests_to_run.txt`] contains an entry per line, e.g.:

    tests/test_file.py
    tests/test_mod.py::test_func[x1,y2]
    tests/test_mod.py::TestClass
    -m slow

This file can also be generated using [`pytest`]` `[`--collect-only`]` `[`-q`] and modified as needed.

## Getting help on version, option names, environment variables[¶](#getting-help-on-version-option-names-environment-variables "Link to this heading")

    pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from
    pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments
    pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options

[]

## Profiling test execution duration[¶](#profiling-test-execution-duration "Link to this heading")

[Changed in version 6.0.]

To get a list of the slowest 10 test durations over 1.0s long:

    pytest --durations=10 --durations-min=1.0

By default, pytest will not show test durations that are too small (\<0.005s) unless [`-vv`] is passed on the command-line.

## Managing loading of plugins[¶](#managing-loading-of-plugins "Link to this heading")

### Early loading plugins[¶](#early-loading-plugins "Link to this heading")

You can early-load plugins (internal and external) explicitly in the command-line with the [[`-p`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-p) option:

    pytest -p mypluginmodule

The option receives a [`name`] parameter, which can be:

-   A full module dotted name, for example [`myproject.plugins`]. This dotted name must be importable.

-   The entry-point name of a plugin. This is the name passed to [`importlib`] when the plugin is registered. For example to early-load the [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov) plugin you can use:

    ::: 
    ::: highlight
        pytest -p pytest_cov
    :::
    :::

### Disabling plugins[¶](#disabling-plugins "Link to this heading")

To disable loading specific plugins at invocation time, use the [[`-p`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-p) option together with the prefix [`no:`].

Example: to disable loading the plugin [`doctest`], which is responsible for executing doctest tests from text files, invoke pytest like this:

    pytest -p no:doctest

[]

## Other ways of calling pytest[¶](#other-ways-of-calling-pytest "Link to this heading")

[]

### Calling pytest through [`python`]` `[`-m`]` `[`pytest`][¶](#calling-pytest-through-python-m-pytest "Link to this heading")

You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:

    python -m pytest [...]

This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script [`pytest`]` `[`[...]`] directly, except that calling via [`python`] will also add the current directory to [`sys.path`].

[]

### Calling pytest from Python code[¶](#calling-pytest-from-python-code "Link to this heading")

You can invoke [`pytest`] from Python code directly:

    retcode = pytest.main()

this acts as if you would call "pytest" from the command line. It will not raise [[`SystemExit`]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit "(in Python v3.14)") but return the [[exit code]](../reference/exit-codes.html#exit-codes) instead. If you don't pass it any arguments, [`main`] reads the arguments from the command line arguments of the process ([[`sys.argv`]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv "(in Python v3.14)")), which may be undesirable. You can pass in options and arguments explicitly:

    retcode = pytest.main(["-x", "mytestdir"])

You can specify additional plugins to [`pytest.main`]:

    # content of myinvoke.py
    import sys

    import pytest

    class MyPlugin:
        def pytest_sessionfinish(self):
            print("*** test run reporting finishing")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(pytest.main(["-qq"], plugins=[MyPlugin()]))

Running it will show that [`MyPlugin`] was added and its hook was invoked:

    $ python myinvoke.py
    *** test run reporting finishing

Note

Calling [`pytest.main()`] will result in importing your tests and any modules that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of python's import system, making subsequent calls to [`pytest.main()`] from the same process will not reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making multiple calls to [`pytest.main()`] from the same process (in order to re-run tests, for example) is not recommended.
