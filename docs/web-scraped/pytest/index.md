# pytest: helps you write better programs[¶](#pytest-helps-you-write-better-programs "Link to this heading")

The [`pytest`] framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

**PyPI package name**: [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest)

## A quick example[¶](#a-quick-example "Link to this heading")

    # content of test_sample.py
    def inc(x):
        return x + 1

    def test_answer():
        assert inc(3) == 5

To execute it:

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-9.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y
    rootdir: /home/sweet/project
    collected 1 item

    test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]

    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert inc(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

    test_sample.py:6: AssertionError
    ========================= short test summary info ==========================
    FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5
    ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================

Due to [`pytest`]'s detailed assertion introspection, only plain [`assert`] statements are used. See [[Get started]](getting-started.html#getstarted) for a basic introduction to using pytest.

## Features[¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")
