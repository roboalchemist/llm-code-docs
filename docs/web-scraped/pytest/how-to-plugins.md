# How to install and use plugins[¶](#how-to-install-and-use-plugins "Link to this heading")

This section talks about installing and using third party plugins. For writing your own plugins, please refer to [[Writing plugins]](writing_plugins.html#writing-plugins).

Installing a third party plugin can be easily done with [`pip`]:

    pip install pytest-NAME
    pip uninstall pytest-NAME

If a plugin is installed, [`pytest`] automatically finds and integrates it, there is no need to activate it.

Here is a little annotated list for some popular plugins:

-   [pytest-django](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-django): write tests for [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) apps, using pytest integration.

-   [pytest-twisted](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-twisted): write tests for [twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) apps, starting a reactor and processing deferreds from test functions.

-   [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov): coverage reporting, compatible with distributed testing

-   [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist): to distribute tests to CPUs and remote hosts, to run in boxed mode which allows to survive segmentation faults, to run in looponfailing mode, automatically re-running failing tests on file changes.

-   [pytest-instafail](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instafail): to report failures while the test run is happening.

-   [pytest-bdd](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-bdd): to write tests using behaviour-driven testing.

-   [pytest-timeout](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout): to timeout tests based on function marks or global definitions.

-   [pytest-pep8](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-pep8): a [`--pep8`] option to enable PEP8 compliance checking.

-   [pytest-flakes](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-flakes): check source code with pyflakes.

-   [allure-pytest](https://pypi.org/project/allure-pytest): report test results via [allure-framework](https://github.com/allure-framework/).

To see a complete list of all plugins with their latest testing status against different pytest and Python versions, please visit [[Pytest Plugin List]](../reference/plugin_list.html#plugin-list).

You may also discover more plugins through a [pytest- pypi.org search](https://pypi.org/search/?q=pytest-).

## Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file[¶](#requiring-loading-plugins-in-a-test-module-or-conftest-file "Link to this heading")

You can require plugins in a test module or a conftest file using [[`pytest_plugins`]](../reference/reference.html#globalvar-pytest_plugins):

    pytest_plugins = ("myapp.testsupport.myplugin",)

When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins will be loaded as well.

Note

Requiring plugins using a [`pytest_plugins`] variable in non-root [`conftest.py`] files is deprecated. See [[full explanation]](writing_plugins.html#requiring-plugins-in-non-root-conftests) in the Writing plugins section.

Note

The name [`pytest_plugins`] is reserved and should not be used as a name for a custom plugin module.

## Finding out which plugins are active[¶](#finding-out-which-plugins-are-active "Link to this heading")

If you want to find out which plugins are active in your environment you can type:

    pytest --trace-config

and will get an extended test header which shows activated plugins and their names. It will also print local plugins aka [[conftest.py]](writing_plugins.html#conftest-py-plugins) files when they are loaded.

[]

## Deactivating / unregistering a plugin by name[¶](#deactivating-unregistering-a-plugin-by-name "Link to this heading")

You can prevent plugins from loading or unregister them:

    pytest -p no:NAME

This means that any subsequent try to activate/load the named plugin will not work.

If you want to unconditionally disable a plugin for a project, you can add this option to your configuration file:

toml

    [pytest]
    addopts = ["-p", "no:NAME"]

ini

    [pytest]
    addopts = -p no:NAME

Alternatively to disable it only in certain environments (for example in a CI server), you can set [`PYTEST_ADDOPTS`] environment variable to [`-p`]` `[`no:name`].

See [[Finding out which plugins are active]](#findpluginname) for how to obtain the name of a plugin.

[]

## Disabling plugins from autoloading[¶](#disabling-plugins-from-autoloading "Link to this heading")

If you want to disable plugins from loading automatically, instead of requiring you to manually specify each plugin with [[`-p`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-p) or [][[`PYTEST_PLUGINS`]](../reference/reference.html#envvar-PYTEST_PLUGINS), you can use [[`--disable-plugin-autoload`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-disable-plugin-autoload) or [][[`PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`]](../reference/reference.html#envvar-PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD).

    export PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1
    export PYTEST_PLUGINS=NAME,NAME2
    pytest

    pytest --disable-plugin-autoload -p NAME,NAME2

toml

    [pytest]
    addopts = ["--disable-plugin-autoload", "-p", "NAME", "-p", "NAME2"]

ini

    [pytest]
    addopts =
        --disable-plugin-autoload
        -p NAME
        -p NAME2

[Added in version 8.4: ]The [[`--disable-plugin-autoload`]](../reference/reference.html#cmdoption-disable-plugin-autoload) command-line flag.
