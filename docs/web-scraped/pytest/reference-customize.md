## Command line options and configuration file settings[¶](#command-line-options-and-configuration-file-settings "Link to this heading")

You can get help on command line and configuration options by using the general help option:

    pytest -h   # prints options _and_ config file settings

This will display command line and configuration file settings which were registered by installed plugins.

## Configuration file formats[¶](#configuration-file-formats "Link to this heading")

Many [[pytest settings]](reference.html#ini-options-ref) can be set in a *configuration file*, which by convention resides in the root directory of your repository.

A quick example of the configuration files supported by pytest:

### pytest.toml[¶](#pytest-toml "Link to this heading")

[Added in version 9.0.]

[`pytest.toml`] files take precedence over other files, even when empty.

Alternatively, the hidden version [`.pytest.toml`] can be used.

toml

    # pytest.toml or .pytest.toml
    [pytest]
    minversion = "9.0"
    addopts = ["-ra", "-q"]
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

### pytest.ini[¶](#pytest-ini "Link to this heading")

[`pytest.ini`] files take precedence over other files (except [`pytest.toml`] and [`.pytest.toml`]), even when empty.

Alternatively, the hidden version [`.pytest.ini`] can be used.

ini

    # pytest.ini or .pytest.ini
    [pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration

### pyproject.toml[¶](#pyproject-toml "Link to this heading")

[Added in version 6.0.]

[Changed in version 9.0.]

[`pyproject.toml`] files are supported for configuration.

toml

Use [`[tool.pytest]`] to leverage native TOML types (supported since pytest 9.0):

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest]
    minversion = "9.0"
    addopts = ["-ra", "-q"]
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

ini

Use [`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`] for INI-style configuration (supported since pytest 6.0):

    # pyproject.toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    minversion = "6.0"
    addopts = "-ra -q"
    testpaths = [
        "tests",
        "integration",
    ]

### tox.ini[¶](#tox-ini "Link to this heading")

[`tox.ini`] files are the configuration files of the [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) project, and can also be used to hold pytest configuration if they have a [`[pytest]`] section.

ini

    # tox.ini
    [pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration

### setup.cfg[¶](#setup-cfg "Link to this heading")

[`setup.cfg`] files are general purpose configuration files, used originally by [`distutils`] (now deprecated) and [[setuptools]](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/declarative_config.html "(in setuptools v80.9.0.post20250527)"), and can also be used to hold pytest configuration if they have a [`[tool:pytest]`] section.

ini

    # setup.cfg
    [tool:pytest]
    minversion = 6.0
    addopts = -ra -q
    testpaths =
        tests
        integration

Warning

Usage of [`setup.cfg`] is not recommended unless for very simple use cases. [`.cfg`] files use a different parser than [`pytest.ini`] and [`tox.ini`] which might cause hard to track down problems. When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or [`pyproject.toml`], to hold your pytest configuration.

## Initialization: determining rootdir and configfile[¶](#initialization-determining-rootdir-and-configfile "Link to this heading")

pytest determines a [`rootdir`] for each test run which depends on the command line arguments (specified test files, paths) and on the existence of configuration files. The determined [`rootdir`] and [`configfile`] are printed as part of the pytest header during startup.

Here's a summary what [`pytest`] uses [`rootdir`] for:

-   Construct *nodeids* during collection; each test is assigned a unique *nodeid* which is rooted at the [`rootdir`] and takes into account the full path, class name, function name and parametrization (if any).

-   Is used by plugins as a stable location to store project/test run specific information; for example, the internal [[cache]](../how-to/cache.html#cache) plugin creates a [`.pytest_cache`] subdirectory in [`rootdir`] to store its cross-test run state.

[`rootdir`] is **NOT** used to modify [`sys.path`]/[`PYTHONPATH`] or influence how modules are imported. See [[pytest import mechanisms and sys.path/PYTHONPATH]](../explanation/pythonpath.html#pythonpath) for more details.

The [[`--rootdir=path`]](reference.html#cmdoption-rootdir) command-line option can be used to force a specific directory. Note that contrary to other command-line options, [`--rootdir`] cannot be used with [[`addopts`]](reference.html#confval-addopts) inside a configuration file because the [`rootdir`] is used to *find* the configuration file already.

### Finding the [`rootdir`][¶](#finding-the-rootdir "Link to this heading")

Here is the algorithm which finds the rootdir from [`args`]:

-   If [[`-c`]](reference.html#cmdoption-c) is passed in the command-line, use that as configuration file, and its directory as [`rootdir`].

-   Determine the common ancestor directory for the specified [`args`] that are recognised as paths that exist in the file system. If no such paths are found, the common ancestor directory is set to the current working directory.

-   Look for [`pytest.toml`], [`.pytest.toml`], [`pytest.ini`], [`.pytest.ini`], [`pyproject.toml`], [`tox.ini`], and [`setup.cfg`] files in the ancestor directory and upwards. If one is matched, it becomes the [`configfile`] and its directory becomes the [`rootdir`].

-   If no configuration file was found, look for [`setup.py`] upwards from the common ancestor directory to determine the [`rootdir`].

-   If no [`setup.py`] was found, look for [`pytest.toml`], [`.pytest.toml`], [`pytest.ini`], [`.pytest.ini`], [`pyproject.toml`], [`tox.ini`], and [`setup.cfg`] in each of the specified [`args`] and upwards. If one is matched, it becomes the [`configfile`] and its directory becomes the [`rootdir`].

-   If no [`configfile`] was found and no configuration argument is passed, use the already determined common ancestor as root directory. This allows the use of pytest in structures that are not part of a package and don't have any particular configuration file.

If no [`args`] are given, pytest collects test below the current working directory and also starts determining the [`rootdir`] from there.

Files will only be matched for configuration if:

-   [`pytest.toml`]: will always match and take highest precedence, even if empty.

-   [`pytest.ini`]: will always match and take precedence (after [`pytest.toml`] and [`.pytest.toml`]), even if empty.

-   [`pyproject.toml`]: contains a [`[tool.pytest]`] or [`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`] table.

-   [`tox.ini`]: contains a [`[pytest]`] section.

-   [`setup.cfg`]: contains a [`[tool:pytest]`] section.

Finally, a [`pyproject.toml`] file will be considered the [`configfile`] if no other match was found, in this case even if it does not contain a [`[tool.pytest]`] table (since version [`9.0`]) or a [`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`] table (since version [`8.1`]).

The files are considered in the order above. Options from multiple [`configfiles`] candidates are never merged - the first match wins.

The configuration file also determines the value of the [`rootpath`].

The [[`Config`]](reference.html#pytest.Config "pytest.Config") object (accessible via hooks or through the [[`pytestconfig`]](reference.html#std-fixture-pytestconfig) fixture) will subsequently carry these attributes:

-   [[`config.rootpath`]](reference.html#pytest.Config.rootpath "pytest.Config.rootpath"): the determined root directory, guaranteed to exist. It is used as a reference directory for constructing test addresses ("nodeids") and can be used also by plugins for storing per-testrun information.

-   [[`config.inipath`]](reference.html#pytest.Config.inipath "pytest.Config.inipath"): the determined [`configfile`], may be [`None`] (it is named [`inipath`] for historical reasons).

[Added in version 6.1: ]The [`config.rootpath`] and [`config.inipath`] properties. They are [[`pathlib.Path`]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "(in Python v3.14)") versions of the older [`config.rootdir`] and [`config.inifile`], which have type [`py.path.local`], and still exist for backward compatibility.

Example:

    pytest path/to/testdir path/other/

will determine the common ancestor as [`path`] and then check for configuration files as follows:

    # first look for path/pytest.toml
    path/pytest.toml
    path/pytest.ini
    path/pyproject.toml  # must contain a [tool.pytest] table to match
    path/tox.ini         # must contain [pytest] section to match
    path/setup.cfg       # must contain [tool:pytest] section to match
    pytest.toml
    pytest.ini
    ... # all the way up to the root

    # now look for setup.py
    path/setup.py
    setup.py
    ... # all the way up to the root

Warning

Custom pytest plugin commandline arguments may include a path, as in [`pytest`]` `[`--log-output`]` `[`../../test.log`]` `[`args`]. Then [`args`] is mandatory, otherwise pytest uses the folder of test.log for rootdir determination (see also [#1435](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1435)). A dot [`.`] for referencing to the current working directory is also possible.

## Builtin configuration file options[¶](#builtin-configuration-file-options "Link to this heading")

For the full list of options consult the [[reference documentation]](reference.html#ini-options-ref).

## Syntax highlighting theme customization[¶](#syntax-highlighting-theme-customization "Link to this heading")

The syntax highlighting themes used by pytest can be customized using two environment variables:

-   [][[`PYTEST_THEME`]](reference.html#envvar-PYTEST_THEME) sets a [pygment style](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/) to use.

-   [][[`PYTEST_THEME_MODE`]](reference.html#envvar-PYTEST_THEME_MODE) sets this style to *light* or *dark*.
