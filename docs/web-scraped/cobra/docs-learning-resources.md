Learning Resources
==================

The Cobra & Viper Learning Hub
==============================

Welcome to the official learning hub for Cobra and Viper, the foundational pillars of modern command-line application development in the Go ecosystem. Created by Steve Francia (spf13), these libraries have become the de facto standard, powering some of the most critical and widely-used cloud-native tools, including Kubernetes, Hugo, Docker, and the GitHub CLI.

Their success stems from a simple, powerful philosophy: Cobra provides the robust framework for building an intuitive and feature-rich command-line interface, while Viper delivers a comprehensive and flexible solution for managing application configuration from any source. Together, they enable developers to build clean, professional, and highly configurable 12-factor applications with remarkable efficiency.

This hub is the official, curated collection of the best learning resources from the creator, the core team, and the global Go community. It is designed to be a living document that guides developers of all skill levels on their journey with these powerful tools.

Learning Path Overview
