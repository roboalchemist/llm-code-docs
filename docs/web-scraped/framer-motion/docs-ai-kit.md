The Motion+ AI Kit is a set of AI skills and tools that turn your LLM into an animation expert:

*   Motion best practises

*   Animation performance auditing

*   CSS spring generation

*   Transition visualisation

*   Documentation search

The AI Kit is available to all Motion+ members. It's also available[for purchase as a lower-priced standalone purchase](https://motion.dev/plus) than the full Motion+ package.

-----------------------------------------------

### [Motion expert](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#motion-expert)

The `/motion` skill gives your AI assistant deep knowledge of the Motion API across all platforms: vanilla JavaScript, React, and Vue.

It automatically detects which platform you're using and provides guidance specific to that framework. This includes correct import patterns, performance best practices like when to use `transform` vs independent transforms, spring physics recommendations, `will-change` usage, and motion value patterns.

It also detects whether you're using Radix or Base UI and additionally provides integration best practises, and can use the Motion MCP to search the full and latest Motion documentation. No more hallucinated import paths or APIs!

### [Performance audit](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#performance-audit)

The `/motion-audit` skill scans every Motion and CSS animation in your codebase, classifies each by render pipeline cost from S-tier (compositor only) to F-tier (layout thrashing), and generates a full report with scorecard, findings, and specific fixes.

## Breakdown

S █████████████████░░░░░░░░░ 2· 68%

A ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0· 0%

D ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0· 0%

F ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0· 0%

Run it against a specific animation, component, or your whole codebase. Then have your LLM implement the recommended fixes immediately.

In a future update, the performance audit skill will also be able to perform runtime audits using [MotionScore](https://score.motion.dev/).

### [Generate CSS springs](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#generate-css-springs)

Thanks to the new `linear()` easing in CSS, it's possible to run spring animations using CSS alone. However, `linear()` easing curves usually look like this:

linear(
  0, 0.009, 0.035 2.1%, 0.141, 0.281 6.7%, 0.723 12.9%, 0.938 16.7%, 1.017,
  1.077, 1.121, 1.149 24.3%, 1.159, 1.163, 1.161, 1.154 29.9%, 1.129 32.8%,
  1.051 39.6%, 1.017 43.1%, 0.991, 0.977 51%, 0.974 53.8%, 0.975 57.1%,
  0.997 69.8%, 1.003 76.9%, 1.004 83.8%, 1
)

By using the `/css-spring` skill, you can use natural language to describe a spring:

> /css-spring generate a bouncy spring

And your LLM will use Motion's real `spring` function to generate a `linear()` easing string at the exact correct resolution for the animation's duration.

### [Transition visualiser](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#transition-visualiser)

The `/see-transition` skill can be used to let your vision-capable LLM to better understand the easing curves and spring settings in your animations.

[Tools](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#tools)
---------------------------------------------

### [Documentation search](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#documentation-search)

The Motion MCP comes with a search tool that can connect your AI editor to the full, and latest, Motion documentation. You can ask questions about Motion or use this to improve the quality of your generated code.

![Image 2](https://framerusercontent.com/images/6xhH6iNEsI9gZmS94ZW4m4yTk.png)

This runs automatically whenever your AI assistant needs to reference Motion APIs, so you always get answers based on the latest documentation rather than the model's out-of-date training data.

[Install](https://motion.dev/docs/ai-kit#install)
-------------------------------------------------

First, generate a personal token via the [Motion+ dashboard](https://plus.motion.dev/personal-token).

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

curl -sL "https://api.motion.dev/registry/skills/motion-ai-kit?token=YOUR_TOKEN" -o /tmp/ai-kit.sh && bash

This script will let you choose which skills to install:

The install script supports:

*   Cursor

*   Claude Code

*   Windsurf

*   Amp

*   OpenCode

*   Gemini CLI

*   VS Code

Many skills utilise the Motion MCP. This will be automatically installed in future versions, but for now must be [installed separately](https://motion.dev/docs/studio-install).
