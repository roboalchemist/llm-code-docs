Community

## Join the Harbor community!

Harbor is developed in the open, and is constantly being improved by our **users, contributors, and maintainers**.

## Community Meetings

We have a recurring bi-weekly Harbor community meeting at `9PM UTC+8 time zone`. We will use this meeting to communicate updates to the project, listen to feedback from the Harbor community, and also collect requirements/use cases for new features.

### Bi-weekly public community meetings

Read, comment, or add agenda items on the [meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/@harbor/r14BkYaOa) and add our calendar and subscribe at [our mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/harbor-users) to get the latest Harbor news, what we're working on, and provide suggestions and feedback.

### Catch up with past meetings on YouTube

All Harbor community meetings are recorded and added to our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgInP-D86bCwTC0DYAa1pgupsQIAWPomv).
