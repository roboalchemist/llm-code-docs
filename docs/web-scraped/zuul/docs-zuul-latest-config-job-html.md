Title: Job — Zuul documentation

URL Source: https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html

Markdown Content:
A job is a unit of work performed by Zuul on an item enqueued into a pipeline. Items may run any number of jobs (which may depend on each other). Each job is an invocation of an Ansible playbook with a specific inventory of hosts. The actual tasks that are run by the job appear in the playbook for that job while the attributes that appear in the Zuul configuration specify information about when, where, and how the job should be run.

Jobs in Zuul support inheritance. Any job may specify a single parent job, and any attributes not set on the child job are collected from the parent job. In this way, a configuration structure may be built starting with very basic jobs which describe characteristics that all jobs on the system should have, progressing through stages of specialization before arriving at a particular job. A job may inherit from any other job in any project (however, if the other job is marked as [job.final](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.final "attr-job.final"), jobs may not inherit from it, and if any of its attributes are marked as final with [job.attribute-control](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.attribute-control "attr-job.attribute-control"), those attributes may not be changed).

Generally, if an attribute is set on a child job, it will override (or completely replace) attributes on the parent. This is always true for attributes that only accept single values, but attributes that accept multiple values (lists, or mappings) are sometimes combined. The default behavior varies; see the documentation for individual attributes for details. A special YAML tag may be used to control the behavior explicitly. For example, in order to specify that the tags in the present job should override those in the parent:

- job:
 name: child
 tags: !override
 - foo

Or to indicate that they should be combined with those in the parent:

- job:
 name: child
 tags: !inherit
 - foo

Attributes which support this feature are indicated in this documentation with “Supports override control”.

When lists are combined, they are merged without duplication.

When mappings (or dictionaries, for example, those used for job variables) are combined, they are deeply merged. This means a leaf node (an entry whose value is not another mapping) with the same name will override a previous entry, but non-leaf nodes (entries whose values are mappings) will have their entries updated in the same manner, recursively. New entries with unique names will be added to mappings.

A job with no parent is called a _base job_ and may only be defined in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project). Every other job must have a parent, and so ultimately, all jobs must have an inheritance path which terminates at a base job. Each tenant has a default parent job which will be used if no explicit parent is specified.

Multiple job definitions with the same name are called variants. These may have different selection criteria which indicate to Zuul that, for instance, the job should behave differently on a different git branch. Unlike inheritance, all job variants must be defined in the same project. Some attributes of jobs marked [job.final](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.final "attr-job.final") may not be overridden. Individual attributes marked as final with with [job.attribute-control](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.attribute-control "attr-job.attribute-control") may not be overridden.

When Zuul decides to run a job, it performs a process known as freezing the job. Because any number of job variants may be applicable, Zuul collects all of the matching variants and applies them in the order they appeared in the configuration. The resulting frozen job is built from attributes gathered from all of the matching variants. In this way, exactly what is run is dependent on the pipeline, project, branch, and content of the item.

In addition to the job’s main playbook, each job may specify one or more pre- and post-playbooks. These are run, in order, before and after (respectively) the main playbook. They may be used to set up and tear down resources needed by the main playbook. When combined with inheritance, they provide powerful tools for job construction. A job only has a single main playbook, and when inheriting from a parent, the child’s main playbook overrides (or replaces) the parent’s. However, the pre- and post-playbooks are appended and prepended in a nesting fashion. So if a parent job and child job both specified pre and post playbooks, the sequence of playbooks run would be:

*   parent pre-run playbook

*   child pre-run playbook

*   child playbook

*   child post-run playbook

*   parent post-run playbook

Further inheritance would nest even deeper. If a job fails or is aborted before the main playbook starts, Zuul will run only the post-run playbooks corresponding with the inheritance levels of the pre-run playbooks which were run. In other words, if the child pre-run playbook was not run, then the child post-run playbook will not be run, but the parent post-run playbook will.

Here is an example of two job definitions:

- job:
 name: base
 pre-run: copy-git-repos
 post-run: copy-logs

- job:
 name: run-tests
 parent: base
 nodeset:
 nodes:
 - name: test-node
 label: fedora

job[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job "Link to this definition")

The following attributes are available on a job; all are optional unless otherwise specified:

job.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the job. By default, Zuul looks for a playbook with this name to use as the main playbook for the job. This name is also referenced later in a project pipeline configuration.

job.parent[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.parent "Link to this definition")

Default:`Tenant default-parent`

Specifies a job to inherit from. The parent job can be defined in this or any other project. Any attributes not specified on a job will be collected from its parent. If no value is supplied here, the job specified by [tenant.default-parent](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#attr-tenant.default-parent "attr-tenant.default-parent") will be used. If **parent** is set to `null` (which is only valid in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project)), this is a [base job](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-base-job).

job.description[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.description "Link to this definition")

A textual description of the job. Not currently used directly by Zuul, but it is used by the zuul-sphinx extension to Sphinx to auto-document Zuul jobs (in which case it is interpreted as ReStructuredText.

job.final[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.final "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

To prevent other jobs from inheriting from this job, and also to prevent changing execution-related attributes when this job is specified in a project’s pipeline, set this attribute to `true`.

Warning

It is possible to circumvent the use of final in an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project) by creating a change which Depends-On a change which alters final. This limitation does not apply to jobs in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project).

job.protected[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.protected "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

When set to `true` only jobs defined in the same project may inherit from this job. This includes changing execution-related attributes when this job is specified in a project’s pipeline. Once this is set to `true` it cannot be reset to `false`.

Warning

It is possible to circumvent the use of protected in an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project) by creating a change which Depends-On a change which alters protected. This limitation does not apply to jobs in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project).

job.abstract[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.abstract "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

To indicate a job is not intended to be run directly, but instead must be inherited from, set this attribute to `true`.

Once this is set to `true` in a job it cannot be reset to `false` within the same job by other variants; however jobs which inherit from it can (and by default do) reset it to `false`.

Warning

It is possible to circumvent the use of abstract in an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project) by creating a change which Depends-On a change which alters abstract. This limitation does not apply to jobs in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project).

job.intermediate[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.intermediate "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

An intermediate job must be inherited by an abstract job; it can not be inherited by a final job. All `intermediate` jobs _must_ also be `abstract`; a configuration error will be raised if not.

Once this is set to `true` in a job it cannot be reset to `false` within the same job by other variants; however jobs which inherit from it can (and by default do) reset it to `false`.

For example, you may define a base abstract job foo and create two abstract jobs that inherit from foo called foo-production and foo-development. If it would be an error to accidentally inherit from the base job foo instead of choosing one of the two variants, foo could be marked as `intermediate`.

job.type[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.type "Link to this definition")

Default:`regular`

The type of job; see below for details.

regular[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.type.regular "Link to this definition")
This is a normal Zuul job and is appropriate for the vast majority of circumstances.

initializer[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.type.initializer "Link to this definition")
An initializer job is always automatically inserted at the start of the job graph, so that it runs before any other jobs and acts as a dependency for all other jobs in the graph. It behaves exactly as if all other jobs run for a queue item were declared with a dependency on this job using [job.dependencies](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.dependencies "attr-job.dependencies").

reporter[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.type.reporter "Link to this definition")
An reporter job is run after all other jobs in the buildset have completed, and after all pipeline reporters have reported. It only runs if the buildset is successful and no errors were encountered by the pipeline reporters. Because of this, its results may not be used to influence the result of a buildset, or whether a change is merged. In the case of a change that is merged (for example, in a [gate](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-gate) pipeline), the reporter job runs after the merge is complete.

If a reporter job runs after a change is merged, the job variable [zuul.buildset_refs.merge_commit_id](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/job-content.html#var-zuul.buildset_refs.merge_commit_id "var-zuul.buildset_refs.merge_commit_id") is available with information about the merged commit id.

A reporter job may be used to synchronously update external references to git repositories that are gated by Zuul.

While a reporter job is running, no action is taken for other items in the pipeline’s shared queue. It is recommended that reporter jobs run only on the executor and complete quickly in order to minimize delays.

If a reporter job fails, any changes in the pipeline behind it will be reset and their jobs restarted with the current state of all relevant repositories.

Normally, reporter jobs may only be attached to a project-pipeline within a config-project. To allow an untrusted project to add its own reporter jobs, see the [tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.allow-reporter-jobs](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#attr-tenant.untrusted-projects.%3Cproject%3E.allow-reporter-jobs "attr-tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.allow-reporter-jobs") tenant configuration option.

job.attribute-control[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.attribute-control "Link to this definition")

Individual attributes may be set to final so that any attempt to set them by child jobs or variants will result in an error.

This is a dictionary where each key is a job attribute; the value is another dictionary with `final: true` to set the attribute final.

For example, to set the required-projects list fo final:

- job:
 attribute-control:
 required-projects:
 final: true

The following attributes are supported:

> *   requires
> 
> *   provides
> 
> *   tags
> 
> *   files
> 
> *   irrelevant-files
> 
> *   required-projects
> 
> *   include-projects
> 
> *   exclude-projects
> 
> *   vars
> 
> *   extra-vars
> 
> *   host-vars
> 
> *   group-vars
> 
> *   include-vars
> 
> *   dependencies
> 
> *   failure-output
> 
> *   type

job.success-message[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.success-message "Link to this definition")

Default:`SUCCESS`

Normally when a job succeeds, the string `SUCCESS` is reported as the result for the job. If set, this option may be used to supply a different string.

job.failure-message[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.failure-message "Link to this definition")

Default:`FAILURE`

Normally when a job fails, the string `FAILURE` is reported as the result for the job. If set, this option may be used to supply a different string.

job.hold-following-changes[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.hold-following-changes "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

In a dependent pipeline, this option may be used to indicate that no jobs should start on any items which depend on the current item until this job has completed successfully. This may be used to conserve build resources, at the expense of inhibiting the parallelization which speeds the processing of items in a dependent pipeline.

job.voting[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.voting "Link to this definition")

Default:`true`

Indicates whether the result of this job should be used in determining the overall result of the item.

job.semaphore[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphore "Link to this definition")

A deprecated alias of [job.semaphores](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphores "attr-job.semaphores").

job.semaphores[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphores "Link to this definition")

The name of a [Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/semaphore.html#semaphore) (or list of them) or [Global Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#global-semaphore) which should be acquired and released when the job begins and ends. If the semaphore is at maximum capacity, then Zuul will wait until it can be acquired before starting the job. The format is either a string, a dictionary, or a list of either of those in the case of multiple semaphores. If it’s a string it references a semaphore using the default value for [job.semaphores.resources-first](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphores.resources-first "attr-job.semaphores.resources-first").

Also the name of a semaphore can be any string (without being previously defined via semaphore directive). In this case an implicit semaphore is created with capacity max=1.

If multiple semaphores are requested, the job will not start until all have been acquired, and Zuul will wait until all are available before acquiring any.

When inheriting jobs or applying variants, the list of semaphores is extended (semaphores specified in a job definition are added to any supplied by their parents). This can not be changed via override control.

job.semaphores.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphores.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the referenced semaphore

job.semaphores.resources-first[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.semaphores.resources-first "Link to this definition")

Default:`False`

By default a semaphore is acquired before the resources are requested. However in some cases the user may want to run cheap jobs as quickly as possible in a consecutive manner. In this case resources-first can be enabled to request the resources before locking the semaphore. This can lead to some amount of blocked resources while waiting for the semaphore so this should be used with caution.

job.tags[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.tags "Link to this definition")

Metadata about this job. Tags are units of information attached to the job; they do not affect Zuul’s behavior, but they can be used within the job to characterize the job. For example, a job which tests a certain subsystem could be tagged with the name of that subsystem, and if the job’s results are reported into a database, then the results of all jobs affecting that subsystem could be queried. This attribute is specified as a list of strings.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

job.provides[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.provides "Link to this definition")

A list of free-form strings which identifies resources provided by this job which may be used by other jobs for other changes using the [job.requires](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.requires "attr-job.requires") attribute.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

job.requires[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.requires "Link to this definition")

A list of free-form strings which identify resources which may be provided by other jobs for other changes (via the [job.provides](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.provides "attr-job.provides") attribute) that are used by this job.

When Zuul encounters a job with a requires attribute, it searches for those values in the provides attributes of any jobs associated with any queue items ahead of the current change. In this way, if a change uses either git dependencies or a Depends-On header to indicate a dependency on another change, Zuul will be able to determine that the parent change affects the run-time environment of the child change. If such a relationship is found, the job with requires will not start until all of the jobs with matching provides have completed or paused. Additionally, the [artifacts](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/job-content.html#return-artifacts) returned by the provides jobs will be made available to the requires job.

If the child change is enqueued after the moment the provides job has finished artifacts are still made available to the requires job.

If provides job has failed, then requires job is marked as failed and is not run.

provides/requires artifact resolution is ignored for non-change items, e.g. for branch items in supercedent pipeline, branch items in periodic independent pipeline, tag items in independent pipeline.

For example, a job which produces a builder container image in one project that is then consumed by a container image build job in another project might look like this:

- job:
 name: build-builder-image
 provides: images

- job:
 name: build-final-image
 requires: images

- project:
 name: builder-project
 check:
 jobs:
 - build-builder-image

- project:
 name: final-project
 check:
 jobs:
 - build-final-image

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

job.secrets[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.secrets "Link to this definition")

A list of secrets which may be used by the job. A [Secret](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/secret.html#secret) is a named collection of private information defined separately in the configuration. The secrets that appear here must be defined in the same project as this job definition.

Each item in the list may be supplied either as a string, in which case it references the name of a [Secret](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/secret.html#secret) definition, or as a dict. If an element in this list is given as a dict, it may have the following fields:

job.secrets.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.secrets.name "Link to this definition")

The name to use for the Ansible variable into which the secret content will be placed.

job.secrets.secret(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.secrets.secret "Link to this definition")

The name to use to find the secret’s definition in the configuration.

job.secrets.pass-to-parent[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.secrets.pass-to-parent "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

A boolean indicating that this secret should be made available to playbooks in parent jobs. Use caution when setting this value – parent jobs may be in different projects with different security standards. Setting this to true makes the secret available to those playbooks and therefore subject to intentional or accidental exposure.

For example:

- secret:
 name: important-secret
 data:
 key: encrypted-secret-key-data

- job:
 name: amazing-job
 secrets:
 - name: ssh_key
 secret: important-secret

will result in the following being passed as a variable to the playbooks in `amazing-job`:

ssh_key:
 key: decrypted-secret-key-data

job.nodeset[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.nodeset "Link to this definition")

The nodes which should be supplied to the job. This parameter may be supplied either as a string, in which case it references a [Nodeset](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/nodeset.html#nodeset) definition which appears elsewhere in the configuration, or a dictionary, in which case it is interpreted in the same way as a Nodeset definition, though the top-level nodeset `name` attribute should be omitted (in essence, it is an anonymous Nodeset definition unique to this job; the nodes themselves still require names). See the [Nodeset](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/nodeset.html#nodeset) reference for the syntax to use in that case.

If a job has an empty (or no) [Nodeset](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/nodeset.html#nodeset) definition, it will still run and is able to perform limited actions within the Zuul executor sandbox. Note so-called “executor-only” jobs run with an empty inventory, and hence Ansible’s _implicit localhost_. This means an executor-only playbook must be written to match `localhost` directly; i.e.

- hosts: localhost
 tasks:
 ...

not with `hosts: all` (as this does not match the implicit localhost and the playbook will not run). There are also caveats around things like enumerating the magic variable `hostvars` in this situation. For more information see the Ansible [implicit localhost documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory/implicit_localhost.html).

A useful example of executor-only jobs is saving resources by directly utilising the prior results from testing a committed change. For example, a review which updates documentation source files would generally test validity by building a documentation tree. When this change is committed, the pre-built output can be copied in an executor-only job directly to the publishing location in a post-commit _promote_ pipeline; avoiding having to use a node to rebuild the documentation for final publishing.

job.override-checkout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.override-checkout "Link to this definition")

When Zuul runs jobs for a proposed change, it normally checks out the branch associated with that change on every project present in the job. If jobs are running on a ref (such as a branch tip or tag), then that ref is normally checked out. This attribute is used to override that behavior and indicate that this job should, regardless of the branch for the queue item, use the indicated ref (i.e., branch or tag) instead. This can be used, for example, to run a previous version of the software (from a stable maintenance branch) under test even if the change being tested applies to a different branch (this is only likely to be useful if there is some cross-branch interaction with some component of the system being tested). See also the project-specific [job.required-projects.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout "attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout") attribute to apply this behavior to a subset of a job’s projects.

This value is also used to help select which variants of a job to run. If `override-checkout` is set, then Zuul will use this value instead of the branch of the item being tested when collecting jobs to run.

job.pre-timeout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.pre-timeout "Link to this definition")

The time in seconds that the job will allow all pre-run playbooks to consume before timing out. If set this value must be less than or equal to the job `timeout` value as pre-run playbook runtime counts against the job `timeout`. If left unset then the job `timeout` value will be used.

job.timeout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.timeout "Link to this definition")

The time in seconds that the job should be allowed to run before it is automatically aborted and failure is reported. If no timeout is supplied, the job may run indefinitely. Supplying a timeout is highly recommended.

This timeout only applies to the pre-run and run playbooks in a job.

job.post-timeout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-timeout "Link to this definition")

The time in seconds that each post playbook should be allowed to run before it is automatically aborted and failure is reported. If no post-timeout is supplied, the job may run indefinitely. Supplying a post-timeout is highly recommended.

The post-timeout is handled separately from the above timeout because the post playbooks are typically where you will copy jobs logs. In the event of the pre-run or run playbooks timing out we want to do our best to copy the job logs in the post-run playbooks.

job.attempts[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.attempts "Link to this definition")

Default:`3`

When Zuul encounters an error running a job’s pre-run playbook, Zuul will stop and restart the job. Errors during the main or post-run -playbook phase of a job are not affected by this parameter (they are reported immediately). This parameter controls the number of attempts to make before an error is reported.

job.pre-run[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.pre-run "Link to this definition")

The name of a playbook or list of playbooks to run before the main body of a job. Values are either a string describing the full path to the playbook in the repo where the job is defined, or a dictionary described below.

When a job inherits from a parent, the child’s pre-run playbooks are run after the parent’s. See [Job](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#job) for more information.

If the value is a dictionary, the following attributes are available:

job.pre-run.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.pre-run.name "Link to this definition")

The path to the playbook relative to the root of the repo.

job.pre-run.semaphore[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.pre-run.semaphore "Link to this definition")

The name of a [Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/semaphore.html#semaphore) (or list of them) or [Global Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#global-semaphore) which should be acquired and released when the playbook begins and ends. If the semaphore is at maximum capacity, then Zuul will wait until it can be acquired before starting the playbook. The format is either a string, or a list of strings.

If multiple semaphores are requested, the playbook will not start until all have been acquired, and Zuul will wait until all are available before acquiring any. The time spent waiting for pre-run playbook semaphores is counted against the [job.timeout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.timeout "attr-job.timeout").

None of the semaphores specified for a playbook may also be specified in the same job.

job.post-run[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-run "Link to this definition")

The name of a playbook or list of playbooks to run after the main body of a job. Values are either a string describing the full path to the playbook in the repo where the job is defined, or a dictionary described below.

When a job inherits from a parent, the child’s post-run playbooks are run before the parent’s. See [Job](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#job) for more information.

If the value is a dictionary, the following attributes are available:

job.post-run.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-run.name "Link to this definition")

The path to the playbook relative to the root of the repo.

job.post-run.semaphore[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-run.semaphore "Link to this definition")

The name of a [Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/semaphore.html#semaphore) (or list of them) or [Global Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#global-semaphore) which should be acquired and released when the playbook begins and ends. If the semaphore is at maximum capacity, then Zuul will wait until it can be acquired before starting the playbook. The format is either a string, or a list of strings.

If multiple semaphores are requested, the playbook will not start until all have been acquired, and Zuul will wait until all are available before acquiring any. The time spent waiting for post-run playbook semaphores is counted against the [job.post-timeout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-timeout "attr-job.post-timeout").

None of the semaphores specified for a playbook may also be specified in the same job.

job.post-run.cleanup[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-run.cleanup "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

A boolean value indicating whether this is a “cleanup” playbook. Normally Zuul does not run post-run playbooks when it cancels a job, because the results of the job are discarded. If this value is set, then Zuul will make an effort to run the playbook even if the job is canceled.

job.cleanup-run[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.cleanup-run "Link to this definition")

Warning

This attribute is deprecated. Use [job.post-run.cleanup](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-run.cleanup "attr-job.post-run.cleanup") instead.

The name of a playbook or list of playbooks to run after job execution. Values are either a string describing the full path to the playbook in the repo where the job is defined, or a dictionary described below.

The cleanup phase is performed regardless of the job’s result, even when the job is canceled. Cleanup results are not taken into account when reporting the job result.

When a job inherits from a parent, the child’s cleanup-run playbooks are run before the parent’s. See [Job](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#job) for more information.

There is a hard-coded five minute timeout for cleanup playbooks.

If the value is a dictionary, the following attributes are available:

job.cleanup-run.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.cleanup-run.name "Link to this definition")

The path to the playbook relative to the root of the repo.

job.cleanup-run.semaphore[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.cleanup-run.semaphore "Link to this definition")

The name of a [Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/semaphore.html#semaphore) (or list of them) or [Global Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#global-semaphore) which should be acquired and released when the playbook begins and ends. If the semaphore is at maximum capacity, then Zuul will wait until it can be acquired before starting the playbook. The format is either a string, or a list of strings.

If multiple semaphores are requested, the playbook will not start until all have been acquired, and Zuul will wait until all are available before acquiring any. The time spent waiting for post-run playbook semaphores is counted against the cleanup phase timeout.

None of the semaphores specified for a playbook may also be specified in the same job.

job.run[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.run "Link to this definition")

The name of a playbook or list of playbooks for this job. If it is not supplied, the parent’s playbook will be used (and likewise up the inheritance chain). Values are either a string describing the full path to the playbook in the repo where the job is defined, or a dictionary described below.

If the value is a dictionary, the following attributes are available:

job.run.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.run.name "Link to this definition")

The path to the playbook relative to the root of the repo.

job.run.semaphore[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.run.semaphore "Link to this definition")

The name of a [Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/semaphore.html#semaphore) (or list of them) or [Global Semaphore](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#global-semaphore) which should be acquired and released when the playbook begins and ends. If the semaphore is at maximum capacity, then Zuul will wait until it can be acquired before starting the playbook. The format is either a string, or a list of strings.

If multiple semaphores are requested, the playbook will not start until all have been acquired, and Zuul will wait until all are available before acquiring any. The time spent waiting for run playbook semaphores is counted against the [job.timeout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.timeout "attr-job.timeout").

None of the semaphores specified for a playbook may also be specified in the same job.

Example:

run: playbooks/job-playbook.yaml

Or:

run:
 - name: playbooks/job-playbook.yaml
 semaphores: playbook-semaphore

job.ansible-split-streams[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.ansible-split-streams "Link to this definition")

Default:`False`

Keep stdout/stderr of command and shell tasks separate (the Ansible default behavior) instead of merging stdout and stderr.

Since version 3, Zuul has combined the stdout and stderr streams in Ansible command tasks, but will soon switch to using the normal Ansible behavior. In an upcoming release of Zuul, this default will change to True, and in a later release, this option will be removed altogether.

This option may be used in the interim to verify playbook compatibility and facilitate upgrading to the new behavior.

job.ansible-version[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.ansible-version "Link to this definition")

The ansible version to use for all playbooks of the job. This can be defined at the following layers of configuration where the first match takes precedence:

*   [job.ansible-version](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.ansible-version "attr-job.ansible-version")

*   [tenant.default-ansible-version](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#attr-tenant.default-ansible-version "attr-tenant.default-ansible-version")

*   [scheduler.default_ansible_version](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/configuration.html#attr-scheduler.default_ansible_version "attr-scheduler.default_ansible_version")

*   Zuul default version

The supported ansible versions are:

9 (default)
11

job.roles[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.roles "Link to this definition")

- job:
 name: myjob
 roles:
 - zuul: myorg/our-roles-project
 - zuul: myorg/ansible-role-foo
 name: foo

A list of Ansible roles to prepare for the job. Because a job runs an Ansible playbook, any roles which are used by the job must be prepared and installed by Zuul before the job begins. This value is a list of dictionaries, each of which indicates one of two types of roles: a Galaxy role, which is simply a role that is installed from Ansible Galaxy, or a Zuul role, which is a role provided by a project managed by Zuul. Zuul roles are able to benefit from speculative merging and cross-project dependencies when used by playbooks in untrusted projects. Roles are added to the Ansible role path in the order they appear on the job – roles earlier in the list will take precedence over those which follow.

This attribute is not overridden on inheritance or variance; instead roles are added with each new job or variant. In the case of job inheritance or variance, the roles used for each of the playbooks run by the job will be only those which were cumulatively defined up to that point in the inheritance hierarchy where that playbook was added. If a child job inherits from a parent which defines a pre and post playbook, then the pre and post playbooks it inherits from the parent job will run only with the roles that were defined on the parent. If the child adds its own pre and post playbooks, then any roles added by the child will be available to the child’s playbooks. This is so that a job which inherits from a parent does not inadvertently alter the behavior of the parent’s playbooks by the addition of conflicting roles. Roles added by a child will appear before those it inherits from its parent.

If a project used for a Zuul role has branches, the usual process of selecting which branch should be checked out applies. See [job.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.override-checkout "attr-job.override-checkout") for a description of that process and how to override it. As a special case, if the role project is the project in which this job definition appears, then the branch in which this definition appears will be used. In other words, a playbook may not use a role from a different branch of the same project.

If the job is run on a ref (for example, a branch tip or a tag) then a different form of the branch selection process is used. There is no single branch context available for selecting an appropriate branch of the role’s repo to check out, so only the following are considered: First the ref specified by [job.required-projects.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout "attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout"), or [job.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.override-checkout "attr-job.override-checkout"). Then if the role repo is the playbook repo or has a branch name that matches the branch of the playbook repo, that branch is used; otherwise the project’s default branch is selected.

Warning

Keep this behavior difference in mind when designing jobs that run on both branches and tags. If the same job must be used in both circumstances, ensure that any roles from other repos used by playbooks in the job originate only in un-branched repositories. Otherwise different branches of the role repo may be checked out.

A project which supplies a role may be structured in one of two configurations: a bare role (in which the role exists at the root of the project), or a contained role (in which the role exists within the `roles/` directory of the project, perhaps along with other roles). In the case of a contained role, the `roles/` directory of the project is added to the role search path. In the case of a bare role, the project itself is added to the role search path. In case the name of the project is not the name under which the role should be installed (and therefore referenced from Ansible), the `name` attribute may be used to specify an alternate.

A job automatically has the project in which it is defined added to the roles path if that project appears to contain a role or `roles/` directory. By default, the project is added to the path under its own name, however, that may be changed by explicitly listing the project in the roles list in the usual way.

job.roles.galaxy[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.roles.galaxy "Link to this definition")

Warning

Galaxy roles are not yet implemented.

The name of the role in Ansible Galaxy. If this attribute is supplied, Zuul will search Ansible Galaxy for a role by this name and install it. Mutually exclusive with `zuul`; either `galaxy` or `zuul` must be supplied.

job.roles.zuul[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.roles.zuul "Link to this definition")

The name of a Zuul project which supplies the role. Mutually exclusive with `galaxy`; either `galaxy` or `zuul` must be supplied.

job.roles.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.roles.name "Link to this definition")

The installation name of the role. In the case of a bare role, the role will be made available under this name. Ignored in the case of a contained role.

job.required-projects[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects "Link to this definition")

A list of other projects which are used by this job. Any Zuul projects specified here will also be checked out by Zuul into the working directory for the job. Speculative merging and cross-repo dependencies will be honored. If there is not a change for the project ahead in the pipeline, its repo state as of the time the item was enqueued will be frozen and used for all jobs for a given change (see [Global Repo State](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/gating.html#global-repo-state)).

The format for this attribute is either a list of strings or dictionaries. Strings are interpreted as project names, dictionaries, if used, may have the following attributes:

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

job.required-projects.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the required project.

job.required-projects.override-checkout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout "Link to this definition")

When Zuul runs jobs for a proposed change, it normally checks out the branch associated with that change on every project present in the job. If jobs are running on a ref (such as a branch tip or tag), then that ref is normally checked out. This attribute is used to override that behavior and indicate that this job should, regardless of the branch for the queue item, use the indicated ref (i.e., branch or tag) instead, for only this project. See also the [job.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.override-checkout "attr-job.override-checkout") attribute to apply the same behavior to all projects in a job.

This value is also used to help select which variants of a job to run. If `override-checkout` is set, then Zuul will use this value instead of the branch of the item being tested when collecting any jobs to run which are defined in this project.

job.include-projects[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects "Link to this definition")

Default:`null`

A list of projects that should be included when preparing the workspace for this job. Any projects that are required for playbooks, roles, include-vars, or required-projects will be present and prepared regardless. This may only be used to filter projects that would otherwise already be present in the workspace for other reasons. That includes projects for changes related to any items ahead in the queue, dependencies of those changes, and also the changes under test for the current queue item, and any required projects for the job.

Note that include-projects alone is not sufficient to cause a project to be prepared in the workspace. It must be selected due to one of the preceding reasons. See [job.required-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects "attr-job.required-projects") to force a project to appear in the workspace.

This feature may be useful for jobs which are known to interact with a known set of repositories (or even no repositories). Such jobs may be able to run faster if only the necessary projects are prepared in the workspace.

The default value of `null` indicates no filtering is to be performed.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

The items in the list may either be a string, in which case they are interpreted as the name of a project, or a dictionary with the following form:

job.include-projects.type[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects.type "Link to this definition")

The type of entry. May be one of the following values:

job.include-projects.type.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects.type.name "Link to this definition")

The entry is the name of a project (equivalent to a bare string). If this entry is supplied, the `name` key in the dictionary must also be present.

job.include-projects.type.change[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects.type.change "Link to this definition")

The entry matches the project of the current change under test.

job.include-projects.type.item[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects.type.item "Link to this definition")

The entry matches any project in the current queue item.

job.include-projects.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects.name "Link to this definition")

Only used with the `name` type, this string is the name of the project to match.

job.exclude-projects[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects "Link to this definition")

Default:`null`

A list of projects that should be excluded when preparing the workspace for this job.

See [job.include-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects "attr-job.include-projects") for a general description of the feature.

This filter is applied after [job.include-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-projects "attr-job.include-projects"), so it may further refine a list of projects.

The default value of `null` indicates no filtering is to be performed.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

The items in the list may either be a string, in which case they are interpreted as the name of a project, or a dictionary with the following form:

job.exclude-projects.type[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects.type "Link to this definition")

The type of entry. May be one of the following values:

job.exclude-projects.type.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects.type.name "Link to this definition")

The entry is the name of a project (equivalent to a bare string). If this entry is supplied, the `name` key in the dictionary must also be present.

job.exclude-projects.type.change[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects.type.change "Link to this definition")

The entry matches the project of the current change under test.

job.exclude-projects.type.item[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects.type.item "Link to this definition")

The entry matches any project in the current queue item.

job.exclude-projects.name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.exclude-projects.name "Link to this definition")

Only used with the `name` type, this string is the name of the project to match.

job.vars[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.vars "Link to this definition")

A dictionary of variables to supply to Ansible.

When running a trusted playbook, the value of variables will be frozen at the start of the job. Therefore if the value of the variable is an Ansible Jinja template, it may only reference values which are known at the start of the job, and its value will not change. Untrusted playbooks dynamically evaluate variables and are not limited by this restriction.

Un-frozen versions of all the original job variables are available tagged with the `!unsafe` YAML tag under the `unsafe_vars` variable hierarchy. This tag prevents Ansible from evaluating them as Jinja templates. For example, the job variable myvar would be available under unsafe_vars.myvar. Advanced users may force Ansible to evaluate these values, but it is not recommended to do so except in the most controlled of circumstances. They are almost impossible to render safely.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are deep-merged.

A dictionary of variables to supply to Ansible with higher precedence than job, host, or group vars. Note, that despite the name this is not passed to Ansible using the –extra-vars flag.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are deep-merged.

job.host-vars[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.host-vars "Link to this definition")

A dictionary of host variables to supply to Ansible. The keys of this dictionary are node names as defined in a [Nodeset](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/nodeset.html#nodeset), and the values are dictionaries of variables, just as in [job.vars](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.vars "attr-job.vars").

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are deep-merged.

job.group-vars[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.group-vars "Link to this definition")

A dictionary of group variables to supply to Ansible. The keys of this dictionary are node groups as defined in a [Nodeset](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/nodeset.html#nodeset), and the values are dictionaries of variables, just as in [job.vars](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.vars "attr-job.vars").

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are deep-merged.

An example of three kinds of variables:

- job:
 name: variable-example
 nodeset:
 nodes:
 - name: controller
 label: fedora-27
 - name: api1
 label: centos-7
 - name: api2
 label: centos-7
 groups:
 - name: api
 nodes:
 - api1
 - api2
  vars:
 foo: "this variable is visible to all nodes"
 host-vars:
 controller:
 bar: "this variable is visible only on the controller node"
 group-vars:
 api:
 baz: "this variable is visible on api1 and api2"

job.include-vars[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars "Link to this definition")

A list of files from which to read variables.

The value may be supplied as a list or a single item, and each value may be a string or a dictionary described below. If supplied as a string, it is treated as the [job.include-vars.name](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.name "attr-job.include-vars.name").

Files are read in order, with later variable values overriding earlier ones. Variables specified by [job.vars](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.vars "attr-job.vars") and related attributes will override variables read from files.

The file should be in YAML or JSON format.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are appended without duplication.

job.include-vars.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.name "Link to this definition")

The name (relative to the root of the repository) of the file to read.

job.include-vars.project[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.project "Link to this definition")

The name of the project containing the file to read. If this is left unspecified, the project containing the current job definition is used. This option is mutually exclusive with [job.include-vars.zuul-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.zuul-project "attr-job.include-vars.zuul-project").

job.include-vars.required[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.required "Link to this definition")

Default:`true`

A boolean indicating whether this file is required to be present. If this is set to `true` and the file is not present, it is considered an error and the job result will reflect this.

job.include-vars.zuul-project[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.zuul-project "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

A boolean indicating that instead of using a specified project, the project associated with the change under test (which can be found in the [zuul.project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/job-content.html#var-zuul.project "var-zuul.project") variable) should be used. This permits the definition of jobs that may be centrally defined and used globally to read variables from files in the projects upon which they run.

This option is mutually exclusive with [job.include-vars.project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.project "attr-job.include-vars.project").

job.include-vars.use-ref[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars.use-ref "Link to this definition")

Default:`true`

When this is `true` (the default) if the job is triggered by a ref, and that ref is for the include-vars project, then Zuul will checkout the ref and use the file from that ref checkout. If the include-vars is for a different project than the triggering ref, or the job is not triggered by a ref, or this is set to `false`, then Zuul will follow the normal fallback procedure for branches to determine from which branch to load the file.

An example using job-vars:

- job:
 name: central-job
 description: |
 This job reads versions.yaml from whatever project
 it is used to test.
 include-vars:
 - name: versions.yaml
 zuul-project: true

- job:
 name: integration-job
 description: |
 This job reads data/product-versions.yaml from the repo
 that contains this very job definition, no matter which
 project runs the job.
 include-vars: data/product-versions.yaml

job.dependencies[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.dependencies "Link to this definition")

A list of other jobs upon which this job depends. Zuul will not start executing this job until all of its dependencies have completed successfully or have been paused, and if one or more of them fail, this job will not be run.

The dependent job is provided with [artifacts](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/job-content.html#return-artifacts) returned by preceding jobs, e.g. if jobC depends on jobB, jobB depends on jobA, then jobC is provided with artifacts from both jobA and jobB.

The format for this attribute is either a list of strings or dictionaries. Strings are interpreted as job names, dictionaries, if used, may have the following attributes:

job.dependencies.name(required)[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.dependencies.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the required job.

job.dependencies.soft[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.dependencies.soft "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

A boolean value which indicates whether this job is a _hard_ or _soft_ dependency. A _hard_ dependency will cause an error if the specified job is not run. That is, if job B depends on job A, but job A is not run for any reason (for example, it contains a file matcher which does not match), then Zuul will not run any jobs and report an error. A _soft_ dependency will simply be ignored if the dependent job is not run.

Supports override control. The default is `!override`: values are overridden.

job.allowed-projects[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.allowed-projects "Link to this definition")

A list of Zuul projects which may use this job. By default, a job may be used by any other project known to Zuul, however, some jobs use resources or perform actions which are not appropriate for other projects. In these cases, a list of projects which are allowed to use this job may be supplied. If this list is not empty, then it must be an exhaustive list of all projects permitted to use the job. The current project (where the job is defined) is not automatically included, so if it should be able to run this job, then it must be explicitly listed. This setting is ignored by [config projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project) – they may add any job to any project’s pipelines. By default, all projects may use the job.

If a [job.secrets](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.secrets "attr-job.secrets") is used in a job definition in an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project), allowed-projects is automatically set to the current project only, and can not be overridden. However, a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project) may still add such a job to any project’s pipeline. Apply caution when doing so as other projects may be able to expose the source project’s secrets.

This attribute is not overridden by inheritance; instead it is the intersection of all applicable parents and variants (i.e., jobs can reduce but not expand the set of allowed projects when they inherit).

It is possible to circumvent the use of allowed-projects in an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project) by creating a change which Depends-On a change which alters allowed-projects.

job.post-review[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.post-review "Link to this definition")

Default:`false`

A boolean value which indicates whether this job may only be used in pipelines where [pipeline.post-review](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/pipeline.html#attr-pipeline.post-review "attr-pipeline.post-review") is `true`. This is automatically set to `true` if this job uses a [Secret](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/secret.html#secret) and is defined in a [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project). It may be explicitly set to obtain the same behavior for jobs defined in [config projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project). Once this is set to `true` anywhere in the inheritance hierarchy for a job, it will remain set for all child jobs and variants (it can not be set to `false`).

job.branches[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.branches "Link to this definition")

A [regular expression](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/project-config.html#regex) (or list of regular expressions) which describe on what branches a job should run (or in the case of variants, to alter the behavior of a job for a certain branch).

This attribute is not inherited in the usual manner. Instead, it is used to determine whether each variant on which it appears will be used when running the job.

If none of the defined job variants contain a branches setting which matches the branch of an item, then that job is not run for the item. Otherwise, all of the job variants which match that branch are used when freezing the job. However, if [job.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.override-checkout "attr-job.override-checkout") or [job.required-projects.override-checkout](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout "attr-job.required-projects.override-checkout") are set for a project, Zuul will attempt to use the job variants which match the values supplied in `override-checkout` for jobs defined in those projects. This can be used to run a job defined in one project on another project without a matching branch.

If a tag item is enqueued, we look up the branches which contain the commit referenced by the tag. If any of those branches match a branch matcher, the matcher is considered to have matched.

Additionally in the case of a tag item, if the expression matches the full name of the ref (eg, refs/tags/foo) then the job is considered to match. The preceding section still applies, so the definition must appear in a branch containing the commit referenced by the tag to be considered, and then the expression must also match the tag.

This example illustrates a job called _run-tests_ which uses a nodeset based on the current release of an operating system to perform its tests, except when testing changes to the stable/2.0 branch, in which case it uses an older release:

- job:
 name: run-tests
 nodeset: current-release

- job:
 name: run-tests
 branches: stable/2.0
 nodeset: old-release

In some cases, Zuul uses an implied value for the branch specifier if none is supplied:

*   For a job definition in a [config-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-config-project), no implied branch specifier is used. If no branch specifier appears, the job applies to all branches.

*   In the case of an [untrusted-project](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/glossary.html#term-untrusted-project), if the project has only one branch, no implied branch specifier is applied to [Job](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#job) definitions. If the project has more than one branch, the branch containing the job definition is used as an implied branch specifier.

This allows for the very simple and expected workflow where if a project defines a job on the `master` branch with no branch specifier, and then creates a new branch based on `master`, any changes to that job definition within the new branch only affect that branch, and likewise, changes to the master branch only affect it.

See [pragma.implied-branch-matchers](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/pragma.html#attr-pragma.implied-branch-matchers "attr-pragma.implied-branch-matchers") for how to override this behavior on a per-file basis. The behavior may also be configured by a Zuul administrator using [tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.implied-branch-matchers](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#attr-tenant.untrusted-projects.%3Cproject%3E.implied-branch-matchers "attr-tenant.untrusted-projects.<project>.implied-branch-matchers").

job.files[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.files "Link to this definition")

This indicates that the job should only run on changes where the specified files are modified. Unlike **branches**, this value is subject to inheritance and overriding, so only the final value is used to determine if the job should run. This is a [regular expression](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/project-config.html#regex) or list of regular expressions.

Supports override control. The default is `!override`: values are overridden.

Warning

File filters will be ignored for refs that don’t have any files. This will be the case for merge commits (e.g. in a post pipeline) or empty commits created with `git commit --allow-empty` (which can be used in order to run all jobs).

job.irrelevant-files[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.irrelevant-files "Link to this definition")

This is a negative complement of **files**. It indicates that the job should run unless _all_ of the files changed match this list. In other words, if the regular expression `docs/.*` is supplied, then this job will not run if the only files changed are in the docs directory. A [regular expression](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/project-config.html#regex) or list of regular expressions.

Supports override control. The default is `!override`: values are overridden.

Warning

File filters will be ignored for refs that don’t have any files. This will be the case for merge commits (e.g. in a post pipeline) or empty commits created with `git commit --allow-empty` (which can be used in order to run all jobs).

job.match-on-config-updates[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.match-on-config-updates "Link to this definition")

Default:`true`

If this is set to `true` (the default), then the job’s file matchers are ignored if a change alters the job’s configuration, any of its playbooks, or any of its [job.include-vars](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.include-vars "attr-job.include-vars") files. This means that changes to jobs with file matchers will be self-testing without requiring that the file matchers include the Zuul configuration file defining the job or other referenced files.

job.deduplicate[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.deduplicate "Link to this definition")

Default:`auto`

In the case of a dependency cycle where multiple changes within the cycle run the same job, this setting indicates whether Zuul should attempt to deduplicate the job. If it is deduplicated, then the job will only run for one queue item within the cycle and other items which run the same job will use the results of that build.

This setting determines whether Zuul will consider deduplication. If it is set to `false`, Zuul will never attempt to deduplicate the job. If it is set to `auto` (the default), then Zuul will compare the job with other jobs of other queue items in the dependency cycle, and if they are equivalent and meet certain project criteria, it will deduplicate them.

The project criteria that Zuul considers under the `auto` setting are either:

*   The job must specify [job.required-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects "attr-job.required-projects").

*   Or the queue items must be for the same project.

This is because of the following heuristic: if a job specifies [job.required-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects "attr-job.required-projects"), it is most likely to be one which operates in the same way regardless of which project the change under test belongs to, therefore the result of the same job running on two queue items in the same dependency cycle should be the same. If a job does not specify [job.required-projects](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.required-projects "attr-job.required-projects") and runs with two different projects under test, the outcome is likely different for those two items.

If this is not true for a job (e.g., the job ignores the project under test and interacts only with external resources) [job.deduplicate](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.deduplicate "attr-job.deduplicate") may be set to `true` to ignore the heuristic and deduplicate anyway.

job.failure-output[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.failure-output "Link to this definition")

A regular expression (or list of regular expressions) that should be matched against job output to determine if the job is going to fail. Matches are performed line-by-line (multiline regular expressions will not be effective).

This option is not required; job failure is determined by the result code from its Ansible playbooks. However, if this option is supplied, and one of the regular expressions matches a line in the streaming output from the job, Zuul will be able to anticipate the failure before the completion of the playbook. In this case, it will be able to restart jobs for changes behind it in a dependent pipeline.

Use caution when specifying this option. If an early failure is triggered, the job result will be recorded as FAILURE even if the job playbooks ultimately succeed.

Supports override control. The default is `!inherit`: values are merged without duplication.

job.workspace-checkout[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.workspace-checkout "Link to this definition")

Default:`true`

Whether to perform a full checkout of projects in the workspace.

This only applies to the workspace on the executor. Most Zuul jobs copy repositories to remote [Build Nodes](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/build-nodes.html#build-nodes) and independently checkout the appropriate refs. Changing this setting should typically not affect the contents on remote nodes.

Setting this option may be useful to save time or space when preparing large repositories which are not expected to be used on the Zuul executor, but care is needed to ensure that it does not affect job execution.

When set to `true` (the default and recommended value under most circumstances), Zuul will perform a full git checkout of all of the involved repositories in the executor’s workspace.

When set to `false`, Zuul will not perform a checkout of any of the involved repositories in the workspace. Further, when it checks out repositories within private directories in order to run playbooks or roles, it will perform a sparse checkout with only the directories it expects to need. This may cause problems if playbooks or roles reference files outside of the sparse checkout. In this case, the option is unsuitable and should be set to `true` for the job so that full checkouts are performed.

When set to the string `auto`, Zuul will behave as if the value is `true` if and only if the job contains an empty nodeset, otherwise it will behave as if the value is `false`. The reasoning is that jobs with no nodeset are likely to access the contents of the repos on the executor, whereas jobs with a nodeset may access them only on remote nodes.

job.workspace-scheme[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.workspace-scheme "Link to this definition")

Default:`golang`

The scheme to use when placing git repositories in the workspace.

golang[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.workspace-scheme.golang "Link to this definition")
This writes the repository into a directory based on the canonical hostname and the full name of the repository. For example:

src/example.com/organization/project

This is the default and, despite the name, is suitable and recommended for any language.

flat[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.workspace-scheme.flat "Link to this definition")
This writes the repository into a directory based only on the last component of the name. For example:

src/project

In some cases the `golang` scheme can produce collisions (consider the projects component and component/subcomponent). In this case it may be preferable to use the `flat` scheme (which would produce repositories at component and subcomponent).

Note, however, that this scheme may produce collisions with component and component/component.

unique[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#value-job.workspace-scheme.unique "Link to this definition")
This writes the repository into a directory based on the organization name and the `urllib.parse.quote_plus` formatted project name. For example:

src/example.com/organization/organization%2Fproject

This scheme will produce unique workspace paths for every repository and won’t cause collisions.

job.image-name[](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/job.html#attr-job.image-name "Link to this definition")

Type:_str_

If this is an image build job (see [Image Creation](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/build-nodes.html#image-creation)), set this to the name of the image that is to be built. This must match an [image](https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/config/image.html#attr-image "attr-image") object defined in the same project.
