# Assets not captured
Assets fail to capture refers to a situation where the capturing or rendering process of assets on a web page fails due to authentication issues.

The most common reason assets fail to capture is due to authentication issues. As Percy re-renders the DOM in a browser outside of your test suite, providing authentication to the requests made by this browser may be necessary. Thediscoveryconfiguration key in Percy’s SDKs offers several methods for authenticating requests, such as:

[discovery](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/percy/take-percy-snapshots/overview#all-configuration-options)`discovery`- request-headers: An object containing HTTP headers to be sent for each request made during asset discovery
- authorization: A username/password combo to authenticate requests for Percy
- cookies: Cookies to use for discovery’s browser session
