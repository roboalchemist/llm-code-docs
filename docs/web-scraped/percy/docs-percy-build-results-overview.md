# Percy build results overview
Overview page for viewing Percy build results

Percy build results streamline the visual testing process with several key features. Approve builds by validating visual changes and request changes if discrepancies arise. Use comments and notifications for collaboration, and specify ignore regions to focus on significant changes.

Responsive visual testing ensures UI consistency across screen sizes. Snapshot grouping with matching diffs simplifies comparison, while test case grouping helps in organizing snapshots.

The diff highlighter highlights differences between snapshots. Additionally, Intelli Ignore and contextual diff help refine comparisons, and layout testing confirms UI elements align with design guidelines.

This page presents a list of the key features available for viewing in Percy build results, making it easier to understand and utilize the tool effectively.
