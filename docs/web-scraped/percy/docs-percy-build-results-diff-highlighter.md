# Diff highlighter
Quickly identify where your visual differences appear on a page

The diff highlighter is a static bar alongside a new image showing where changed areas are located. Very small changes or elements that match the diff overlay color may be difficult to spot. The highlighter can help identify where differences are at quick glance instead of having to zoom in or enable the diff overlay.

## Zoom functionality
Easily zoom in and out of snapshots to inspect differences in detail while maintaining context. Use the zoom controls such as cursor magnification, zoom-in, and zoom-out buttons to adjust the view.

- Click+to zoom in.
- Click-to zoom out.
- ClickFit widthto reset to the original size.
The interface displays the zoom level, with predefined increments for precise adjustments.

## Diff Navigator
Quickly navigate between detected differences using dedicated controls. Click the<and>UI buttons or press Shift + Left/Right keyboard arrow keys to move between highlighted changes. The navigator auto-zooms on each difference, providing a focused view while keeping surrounding context visible.
