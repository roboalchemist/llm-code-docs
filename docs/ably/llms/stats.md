# Stats

The stats tab is an interface to monitor your app's performance and usage via the [statistics table](#table) and [statistics chart](#chart).

## Statistics table

The statistics table provides a summary of your app's messaging and data usage patterns over different time frames, including the previous month, the current month, and more granular insights from the last hour and last minute:

## Statistics chart

The Stats page also includes a chart that visualizes your app's data over time:

The following explains how to use the statistics chart:

* **Duration**: Define a specific time range for the statistics you want to view. This enables you to focus on periods of particular interest. For example, set the time range from "2024-06-17 00:00" to "2024-08-06 11:18" to analyze data within that period.
* **Zoom**: Use preset zoom options (1h, 8h, 24h, 7d, 1m, 6m, 1y, all) to adjust the chart's view to different periods, enabling you to analyze data at various granularities.
