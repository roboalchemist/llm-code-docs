Title: Upgrading - Rocket Web Framework

URL Source: https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/

Markdown Content:
Rocket v0.5 bring many new features and improvements over Rocket v0.4. Rocket v0.5 also includes many changes that improve the overall usability, stability, and security of the framework and applications written in it. While the Rust compiler can guide you through many of these changes, others require special attention. The intent of this guide is to guide you through these changes and more, migrating your Rocket application to 0.5 and reaping the benefits of new features and improvements.

This guide is _not_ intended to replace, but instead complement, a reading of the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md). The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md) should be considered required reading for all developers wishing to migrate their applications to Rocket v0.5.

Simply upgrading Rocket's version string to the `0.5` series will result in _many_`rustc` compiler errors. But don't let this faze you! The vast majority of changes are simple renames and `#[async_trait]` attributions which manifest in a cascading of errors. As such, resolving _one_ top-level issue, typically requiring minimal, trivial changes, often resolves _many_ errors in one go.

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#crate-organization "anchor")Crate Organization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket v0.5 incorporates an improved module structure and crate ecosystem. Modules and items that have been moved or removed will trigger a compiler error. We encourage users to search through the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md) or [API docs](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/) for the v0.5 analog. All previously existing functionality, except for that incompatible with async I/O, is available in v0.5.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#off-by-default-secrets "anchor")Off-by-Default Secrets

The `private-cookies` crate feature, which was previously enabled by default, has been renamed to `secrets` and is disabled by default. If you are using private cookies, you _must_ enable the `secrets` feature in `Cargo.toml`:

1
2[dependencies]rocket = { version = "0.5.1", features = ["secrets"] }

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#contrib-deprecation "anchor")Contrib Deprecation

The `rocket_contrib` crate is deprecated and is wholly incompatible with Rocket 0.5. _All_ users of `rocket_contrib`_must_:

* Remove all dependencies and references to `rocket_contrib`.
* For templating support, depend on the new [`rocket_dyn_templates`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket_dyn_templates/) crate.
* For database pools, depend on the new [`rocket_sync_db_pools`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket_sync_db_pools/) and/or [`rocket_db_pools`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket_db_pools/) crates.
* Enable [features in `rocket`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/#features) as necessary.

For example, to make use of JSON and Tera templates, make the following changes to `Cargo.toml`:

1
2
3
4
5[dependencies] - rocket = "0.4" - rocket_contrib = { version = "0.4", features = ["json"], default-features = false } + rocket = { version = "0.5.1", features = ["json"] } + rocket_dyn_templates = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["tera"] }

`rocket_dyn_templates` (and co.) _does not_ follow in version lock-step with the `rocket` crate.

This is intentional. The crate depends on many external dependencies which may evolve at a different pace than Rocket itself. Allowing their versions to diverge enables keeping dependencies up-to-date without breaking `rocket` itself.

All features previously in `rocket_contrib` are available. Consult the [contrib graduation](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md#contrib-graduation) section of the CHANGELOG for full details.

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#stable-and-async-support "anchor")Stable and Async Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket v0.5 compiles and builds on Rust stable with an entirely asynchronous core. You are encouraged to:

* Switch to the Rust stable release channel for production builds.
* Remove the previously required `#![feature(..)]` crate attribute.

All application authors _must_:

* Use `rocket::build()` instead of `rocket::ignite()`.
* Use either the `#[launch]` or `#[rocket::main]` async entry attribute.
* Use `async` versions of any blocking I/O or execute it in another thread.

Application authors _may_:

* Prefer to explicitly import macros via `use` instead of `#[macro_use]`.

The rest of the section describes making these changes in detail.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#stable-release-channel "anchor")Stable Release Channel

If you prefer to use Rust's stable release channel, you can switch to it using `rustup`:

1
2
3
4
5 rustup default stable rustup override set stable

Using the stable release channel ensures that _no_ breakages will occur when upgrading your Rust compiler or Rocket. That being said, Rocket continues to take advantage of features only present in the nightly channel. As a result, the development experience will be superior on nightly for the foreseeable future. For example, compiler diagnostics on `nightly` are more detailed and accurate:

Our **recommendation** is to develop locally on the nightly channel but build and deploy for production on the stable channel.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#feature-attribute "anchor")Feature Attribute

As a result of support for the stable release channel, Rocket applications no longer need to enable any features to be used. You should **remove all `#[feature(..)]` crate attributes:**

1
2
3
4
5- #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)] - #[macro_use] extern crate rocket; fn main() { .. }

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#updates-to-launch "anchor")Updates to Launch

The new asynchronous core requires an async runtime to run. The new [`launch`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/attr.launch.html) and [`main`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/attr.main.html) attributes simplify starting a runtime suitable for running Rocket applications. You should use [`launch`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/attr.launch.html) whenever possible.

Additionally, the `rocket::ignite()` function has been renamed to [`rocket::build()`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#method.build); calls to the function or method should be replaced accordingly. Together, these two changes result in the following diff to what was previously the `main` function:

7- fn main() { - rocket::ignite().mount("/hello", routes![hello]).launch(); - } + #[launch] + fn rocket() -> _ { + rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![hello]) + }

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#blocking-i-o "anchor")Blocking I/O

Rocket v0.5 takes advantage of the latest developments in async I/O in Rust by migrating to a fully asynchronous core powered by [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/). Specifically, _every_ request is handled by an asynchronous task which internally calls one or more request handlers. Asynchronous tasks are multiplexed on a [configurable number of worker threads](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/#workers). Though there is no limit to the number of tasks that can run concurrently, at most `worker` tasks can run in parallel.

The runtime can switch between tasks in a single worker thread _iff_(_if and only if_) an `await` point in reached. In other words, context switching is _cooperative_, _not_ preemptive. This _iff_ is critical: if an `await` point is _not_ reached, no task switching can occur. As such, it is important that `await` points occur periodically in a task so that tasks waiting to be scheduled are not starved.

In general, when working with `async` APIs, await points occur naturally. However, an application written for synchronous I/O, including all Rocket applications prior to v0.5, must take great care to convert all synchronous, blocking I/O, to `async` I/O. This is because, as the name implies, blocking I/O blocks a thread from making progress until the I/O result is available, meaning that no tasks can be scheduled on the waiting thread, wasting valuable resources and degrading performance.

Common sources of blocking I/O and their `async` replacements include:

* Anything in `std::fs`: replace with `rocket::tokio::fs`.
* Anything in `std::sync`: replace with `rocket::tokio::sync`.
* Anything in `std::net`: replace with `rocket::tokio::net`.
* Anything in `std::io`: replace with `rocket::tokio::io`.
* Sleep or timers: replace with `rocket::tokio::time`.
* Any networking: replace with `rocket::tokio::net`.
* Any file system access: replace with `rocket::tokio::fs`.

Unfortunately, the Rust compiler provides no support for identifying blocking I/O via lints or compile-time checks: it is up to you to scan your application for sources of blocking I/O and replace them with their `async` counterpart. If no such counterpart exists, you should execute the relevant I/O in its own thread by using [`rocket::tokio::task::spawn_blocking`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html).

All of Rocket's I/O APIs have been updated to be `async`-safe. This results in requiring `.await` calls for common APIs like [`NamedFile`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/fs/struct.NamedFile.html). To use `.await` in a route, the handler must be marked with `async`:

1
2
3
4
5
6 use rocket::fs::NamedFile;#[get("/")] async fn index() -> Option<NamedFile> { NamedFile::open("index.html").await.ok()}

Non-`async` routes are _also_ executed on the `async` runtime.

A route that _isn't_ declared as `async` is _still_ executed on the `async` runtime. As a result, it should not execute blocking I/O.

See a diff of the changes from v0.4.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#blocking-compute "anchor")Blocking Compute

By the same reasoning, performing large amounts of compute (really, just another form of I/O) can prevent other tasks from executing in a timely manner. If you are performing long computations in a handler, you should execute the computation in its own thread, again using [`rocket::tokio::task::spawn_blocking`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html):

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#async-traits "anchor")Async Traits

To support `async` methods in traits, Rocket provides the [`async_trait`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/attr.async_trait.html) attribute. The attribute _must_ be applied to all implementations of _async traits_ like [`FromRequest`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/request/trait.FromRequest.html) and [`Fairing`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/fairing/trait.Fairing.html):

All trait documentation has been updated to call out such traits with an example implementation that includes the invocation. The example implementation also serves as better documentation for trait and trait method signatures than the rustdocs. Because `async_trait` modifies these signatures, the rustdocs diverge from what is written in the source. For example, rustdoc renders:

1
2
3 fn from_request<'life0, 'async_trait>( request: &'r Request<'life0>) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Outcome<Self, Self::Error>> + Send + 'async_trait>>;

...whereas the source looks like:

1 async fn from_request(req: &'r Request<'_>) -> Outcome<Self, Self::Error>;

Unfortunately, rustdoc does not provide a mechanism to render the source as it is written. As such, we encourage all authors to use the examples as the source of truth for trait and method signatures.

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#configuration "anchor")Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket's configuration system has been entirely revamped for v0.5. The [configuration](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/) section of the guide contains a full walkthrough of the new system while the [general changes](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md#general) section of the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/CHANGELOG.md) contains further details on configuration changes. We call out the most important of these changes here. All users _must_:

* Replace the `ROCKET_ENV` environment variable with `ROCKET_PROFILE`.
* Replace the `ROCKET_LOG` environment variable with `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL`.
* Use only IP addresses for the `address` configuration parameter.
* Replace the `dev` or `development` profile with `debug`.
* Note that the `stage`, `staging`, `prod`, and `production` profiles carry no special meaning in v0.5.
* Use `0` to disable `keep_alive` instead of `false` or `off`.
* Replace uses of "extras" with [typed extraction](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/#extracting-values).

Rocket will emit warnings at launch time if use of the previous functionality is detected.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#profiles "anchor")Profiles

The new system deals with "profiles" where there were previously "environments". As opposed to environments, profiles:

* Can be arbitrarily named and any number can exist.
* Match Rust profiles in naming: `debug` and `release` are the default profiles for the respective Rust compilation profile.
* Are programmatically selectable and configurable.
* Have a `default` profile with fallback values for all profiles.
* Have a `global` profile with overrides for all profiles.

Authors should read the new [configuration](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/) section of the guide to determine the scope of changes required. This likely includes:

* Defining most configuration in the `default` profile instead.
* Using the `debug` profile where `dev` or `development` was used.
* Using the `release` profile where `prod` or `production` was used.

The "extras" configuration in v0.4 is entirely replaced by [typed extraction](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/configuration/#extracting-values), which allows any `Deserialize` structure to be derived from configuration sources. All users _should_ make use of typed extraction where "extras" were being used previously. The diff below illustrates one such example:

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#routing "anchor")Routing
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket v0.5 brings several major changes that affect routing:

1. [Default ranking](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#default-ranking) is more precise, so fewer routes need manual ranking.
2. Multi-segment route parameters (`<foo..>`) now match _zero_ or more segments.
3. Parameters are _always_ percent-decoded, so `&RawStr` no longer implements `FromParam`.
4. Query parameters parse with [`FromForm`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/form/trait.FromForm.html) instead of `FromQuery` and support arbitrarily collections, nesting, structures, etc.
5. All UTF-8 characters are allowed in static path components: `#[get("/🚀")]`.
6. The [`register()`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#method.register) method require a path to [scope catchers](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#scoping) under. Using `"/"` emulates the previous behavior.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#default-ranks "anchor")Default Ranks

Default route ranking now takes into account partially dynamic paths, increasing the range of default ranks from `[-6, -1]` to `[-12, -1]`. The net effect is that fewer routes collide by default, requiring less manual ranking. For example, the following two routes collide in v0.4 but not in v0.5:

1
2
3
4
5#[get("/foo/<_>/bar")]fn foo_bar() { }#[get("/<_..>")]fn everything() { }

See a diff of the changes from v0.4.

1
2
3
4
5
6
7- #[get("/foo/<_>/bar", rank = 1)] + #[get("/foo/<_>/bar")]  fn foo_bar() { } - #[get("/<_..>", rank = 2)] + #[get("/<_..>")]  fn everything() { }

**The recommendation** is to remove all unnecessary manual ranking parameters. For smaller applications, you may find that _all_ manual ranks can be removed. Larger applications may still require ranks to resolve ambiguities.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#kleene-multi-segments "anchor")Kleene Multi-Segments

The multi-segment route parameter `<foo..>` now matches _zero or more_ segments, a change from the previous _one_ or more segments. The implication is two-fold:

1. Where previously two routes were required to match a prefix and its suffixes, now one suffices:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8- #[get("/")] - fn index(); - #[get("/<path..>")] - fn rest(path: PathBuf); + #[get("/<path..>")] + fn all(path: PathBuf);

1. A prefix collides with a route that matches all of its suffixes. For example, `index` and `rest` above collide.

Most applications will likely benefit from this change by allowing the extra prefix-only route to be removed entirely. If the previous functionality of requiring at least one segment is desired, a route that explicitly matches the first segment can be used:

1
2#[get("/<first>/<rest..>")]fn rest(first: PathBuf, rest: PathBuf) { }

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#fewer-raw-strings "anchor")Fewer Raw Strings

Rocket v0.5 makes a concerted effort to limit the exposure to strings from the raw HTTP payload. In line with this philosophy, Rocket now percent-decodes all incoming parameters automatically as opposed to doing so on-demand. The corollary is three-fold:

1. The `&RawStr` type no longer implements [`FromParam`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/request/trait.FromParam.html).
2. The `&str` type now implements [`FromParam`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/request/trait.FromParam.html) and is fully decoded.
3. The `String` parameter type is identical to the `&str` type and should be avoided.

Most applications can simply swap uses of `&RawStr` and `String` for `&str` in routes, forms, and so on to benefit from the increased safety and performance. For instance, the front-page example becomes:

1
2
3
4
5 #[get("/<name>/<age>")] - fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String { + fn hello(name: &str, age: u8) -> String {  format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name) }

A form that previously used `String` becomes:

1
2
3
4
5
6#[derive(FromForm)] - struct MyForm { + struct MyForm<'r> { - value: String, + value: &'r str, }

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#queries-as-forms "anchor")Queries as Forms

Query strings in Rocket v0.5 are in parity with forms and support their [full breadth](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#forms). Single segment query parameters (`<foo>`) should require little to no changes, except that they now support collections, structures, and any other `FromForm` type. This implies that the majority, if not _all_ custom `FromQuery` implementations, should be derivable via `FromForm` or have a built-in equivalent like `Vec<T>`:

1
2#[post("/?<numbers>")]fn form(numbers: Vec<usize>) { }

Multi-segment query parameters (`<foo..>`) no longer require the use of a `Form<T>` guard. Instead, `T` can be used directly:

1
2
3
4
5
6#[derive(FromForm)] struct Person { /*..*/ } #[get("/hello?<person..>")] - fn hello(person: Option<Form<Person>>) + fn hello(person: Option<Person>)

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#forms "anchor")Forms
---------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket v0.5 introduces entirely revamped [forms](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#forms) with support for:

* [Multipart uploads.](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#multipart)
* [Collections: maps, vectors, and more.](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#collections)
* [Nesting.](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#nesting)
* [Ad-Hoc validation.](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#ad-hoc-validation)

Additionally, the [`FromForm` derive](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/derive.FromForm.html) has been substantially improved so that nearly all custom implementations of `FromForm` or [`FromFormField`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/form/trait.FromFormField.html), which replaces `FromFormValue` from v0.4, can be derived. Altogether, this means that any external crate dependency for form handling and most custom `FromForm` or `FromFormValue` implementations are unnecessary and should be removed.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#multipart "anchor")Multipart

If your application used an external crate to accept multipart form submissions, the dependency should be removed: Rocket v0.5 natively handles multipart. A file upload can be accepted via the [`TempFile`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/fs/enum.TempFile.html) form guard:

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#field-validation "anchor")Field Validation

In Rocket v0.4, it was encouraged and often required to implement `FromFormValue` to introduce typed field validation. In v0.5, this can be accomplished by [deriving `FromForm`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/derive.FromForm.html):

[](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#notable-new-features "anchor")Notable New Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rocket v0.5 brings an abundance of new features that enable new functionality, increase productivity, and make existing applications more robust. We encourage all users to take advantage of these new features.

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#sentinels "anchor")Sentinels

Rocket v0.5 introduces [sentinels](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html). Entirely unique to Rocket, sentinels offer an automatic last line of defense against runtime errors by enabling any type that appears in a route to abort application launch if invalid conditions are detected. For example, the [`&State<T>`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/struct.State.html) guard in v0.5 is a [`Sentinel`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/trait.Sentinel.html) that aborts launch if the type `T` is not in managed state, thus preventing associated runtime errors.

You should consider implementing `Sentinel` for your types if you have guards (request, data, form, etc.) or responders that depend on `Rocket` state to function properly. For example, consider a `MyResponder` that expects:

* An error catcher to be registered for the `400` status code.
* A specific type `T` to be in managed state.

Making `MyResponder` a sentinel that guards against these conditions is as simple as:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7 use rocket::{Rocket, Ignite, Sentinel};impl Sentinel for MyResponder { fn abort(r: &Rocket<Ignite>) -> bool { !r.catchers().any(|c| c.code == Some(400)) || r.state::<T>().is_none() }}

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#more-typed-uris "anchor")More Typed URIs

Rocket v0.5 brings a completely overhauled [`uri!()`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/macro.uri.html) macro and support for typed URIs in more APIs. Notably, the `uri!()` macro now:

* Allows URIs to be constructed from and as static values:

1
2
3 use rocket::http::uri::Absolute;const HOST: Absolute<'static> = uri!("http://localhost:8000");

* Allows static and dynamic [prefixes and suffixes](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/macro.uri.html#prefixes-and-suffixes) to route URIs to be specified:

APIs like [`Redirect`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/response/struct.Redirect.html) and [`Client`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/local/index.html) now accept typed URIs:

[URI types](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/http/uri/index.html) have been overhauled accordingly. A new [`Reference`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/http/uri/struct.Reference.html) type encodes URI-references. Additionally, all URI types are now `Serialize` and `Deserialize`, allowing URIs to be used in configuration and passed over the wire.

Rocket v0.5 introduces real-time, typed, `async`[streams](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/response/stream/index.html). The new [async streams](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/responses/#async-streams) section of the guide contains further details, and we encourage all interested parties to see the new real-time, multi-room [chat example](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/v0.5/examples/chat).

As a taste of what's possible, the following `stream` route emits a `"ping"` Server-Sent Event every `n` seconds, defaulting to `1`:

### [](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/upgrading/#websockets "anchor")WebSockets

Rocket v0.5 introduces support for HTTP connection upgrades via a new [upgrade API](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/response/struct.Response.html#upgrading). The API allows responders to take over an HTTP connection and perform raw I/O with the client. In other words, an HTTP connection can be _upgraded_ to any protocol, including HTTP WebSockets!

The newly introduced [`rocket_ws`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket_ws/) library takes advantage of the new API to implement first-class support for WebSockets entirely outside of Rocket's core. The simplest use of the library, implementing an echo server and showcasing that the incoming message stream is `async`, looks like this:

1
2
3
4#[get("/echo")]fn echo_compose(ws: ws::WebSocket) -> ws::Stream!['static] { ws.stream(|io| io)}

The simplified [async streams](https://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/responses/#async-streams) generator syntax can also be used:

1
2
3
4
5

7
8#[get("/echo")]fn echo_stream(ws: ws::WebSocket) -> ws::Stream!['static] { ws::Stream! { ws => for await message in ws { yield message?; } }}

For complete usage details, see the [`rocket_ws`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket_ws/) documentation.
