# User Roles & User Management

* **Account Owner** is a person who has registered an account or to whom [it has been transferred](https://docs.mailtrap.io/account-and-organization/management/my-profile). Account Owner can rename an account, delete it, transfer ownership, manage all projects and sandboxes, and add/edit/invite team members. Nobody can alter the permissions of an Account Owner.
  * **Note**: If the [Organization & Sub-Accounts](https://docs.mailtrap.io/account-and-organization/management/organization-and-sub-accounts) feature is enabled, this role will be called **Organization Owner**.

* **View Email Content** permission is available for all sending domains. It enables Account Owners, Account Admins, and Domain Admins to grant Viewers access to view email bodies in Email Logs. They can provide View Email Content permission for one domain and limit it for another. By default, Account Owners, Account Admins, and Domain Admins have the right to view email bodies, while Viewers don’t.

When you remove a user on the User Management page, they immediately lose access to your account, but stay in the system as Mailtrap users.

If you remove a person from a Sandbox or a Project, they remain in your account but lose access to a sandbox or a project in question.

A person can stay in your account without any permissions at all. This can happen if you remove them from all projects/sandboxes but not from the list on the User Management page. If you no longer work with a teammate, the best way to remove them is to use the User Management page. Otherwise, users with zero access who are still present on your account will be counted towards your [account limits](https://mailtrap.io/billing/dashboard).

To check your own permissions, find your user on the list and click “edit permissions” in the three dots menu. You’ll see which entities are available to you. You cannot change your own permissions.
