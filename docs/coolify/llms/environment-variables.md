# Environment Variables

You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.

> Preview Deployments could have different environment variables, so you can test your application as a staging environment for example.

## Normal View vs Developer View

Coolify provides two ways to manage environment variables: **Normal view** and **Developer view**. You can switch between them using the button at the top of the environment variables section.

### Normal View

The default view displays each environment variable as an individual form card. Each card includes editable key and value fields, along with checkboxes for options like `Build Variable`, `Multiline`, and `Literal`.

This view is best when you need to configure individual variables with specific options, or when working with multiline values and locked secrets.

### Developer View

The Developer view provides a plain-text editor where all environment variables are displayed in `.env` file format (`KEY=VALUE`, one per line). This is useful for bulk editing or pasting variables from an existing `.env` file.

When saving, Coolify parses the text and creates, updates, or removes variables accordingly. The order of variables in the text editor is preserved.

::: tip
Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored when saving.
:::

::: warning Limitations

* **Locked secrets** are displayed as `KEY=(Locked Secret, delete and add again to change)` and cannot be edited in Developer view. You must delete and re-add them.
* **Multiline variables** are displayed as `KEY=(Multiline environment variable, edit in normal view)` and must be edited in Normal view.
  :::

## Build Time vs Runtime Variables

Every environment variable has two independent flags that control **when** it is available: **Build Variable** and **Runtime Variable**. Both are enabled by default, so new variables are available in both phases unless you change this.

| Configuration | Build phase | Running container |
|---|---|---|
| Build + Runtime (default) | Available | Available |
| Build only | Available | Not available |
| Runtime only | Not available | Available |

You can toggle these checkboxes independently in the [Normal view](#normal-view).

### Build Variables

Build variables are injected during the image build process. For **Dockerfile** deployments, they are added as `ARG` instructions. For **Docker Compose** and **Nixpacks/Buildpack** deployments, they are passed via `--env-file`.

Build-time variables are stored in a separate file (`/artifacts/build-time.env`) outside the Docker build context, so they are not included in the final image.

### Runtime Variables

Runtime variables are available inside the running container. After the build completes, Coolify writes a `.env` file containing all runtime-enabled variables, which is loaded by Docker Compose via the `env_file` directive at container start.

::: tip
If you only need a variable at runtime (e.g., an API key your application reads on startup), disable `Build Variable` to keep it out of the build phase entirely.
:::

### Docker Build Secrets

By default, build variables are passed as `--build-arg` values. These values get recorded in the image metadata — anyone with access to the image can reveal them. For sensitive values like private registry tokens or API keys, you can enable **Use Docker Build Secrets** in your application's environment variable settings. This uses Docker [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/?utm_source=coolify.io) (requires Docker 18.09+) to temporarily mount secrets into build steps instead of embedding them in image layers, so they leave no trace in the final image.

When enabled, Coolify automatically rewrites your Dockerfile's `RUN` instructions to use `--mount=type=secret` — you do not need to modify your Dockerfile manually. For Docker Compose builds, Coolify adds a native `secrets:` section to the compose file instead.

When enabled, Coolify:

1. Passes build variables via `--secret id=KEY,env=KEY` instead of `--build-arg`.
2. Automatically adds a `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` directive to your Dockerfile if missing.
3. Injects `--mount=type=secret` into every `RUN` instruction, making secrets available as environment variables during that step.
4. Secrets are **never** embedded in image layers and are not visible in `docker history`.

For **Docker Compose** builds, Coolify adds a native `secrets:` section to the compose file instead.

| | Build Args (default) | Build Secrets |
|---|---|---|
| Docker flag | `--build-arg KEY=value` | `--secret id=KEY,env=KEY` |
| Visible in `docker history` | Yes | No |
| Stored in image layers | Yes | No |
| Requires BuildKit | No | Yes (Docker 18.09+) |

::: tip Build Cache
Coolify generates a `COOLIFY_BUILD_SECRETS_HASH` from all secret values. Docker build cache is preserved when your secrets haven't changed, and automatically invalidated when they have.
:::

::: warning
If BuildKit is not available on the build server, Coolify falls back to traditional `--build-arg` behavior even when this setting is enabled.
:::

## Multiline Variables

The `Multiline` checkbox in [Normal view](#normal-view) preserves line breaks and special characters in your variable's value. Enable this when your value spans multiple lines, such as:

* SSH private keys
* TLS/SSL certificates
* Multi-line configuration files or scripts

Multiline values are wrapped in single quotes during deployment, which prevents any shell interpretation. During Docker builds, multiline build variables are passed using `ARG KEY` without inline value assignment to avoid breaking Dockerfile syntax — the actual value is supplied separately via `--build-arg`.

::: tip
Multiline variables can only be edited in [Normal view](#normal-view). In [Developer view](#developer-view), they appear as `KEY=(Multiline environment variable, edit in normal view)`.
:::

## Literal Variables

The `Literal` checkbox in [Normal view](#normal-view) prevents variable interpolation. By default, Coolify expands references like `$OTHER_VAR` inside your value. Enabling `Literal` treats the entire value as plain text — dollar signs and other shell-special characters are preserved as-is.

Use this when your value contains `$` characters that should **not** be interpreted as variable references:

* Passwords containing `$` (e.g., `P@ss$word123`)
* Regex patterns (e.g., `^user\d+$`)
* Templating syntax or literal shell expressions

::: info
The `Literal` checkbox is hidden when `Multiline` is already enabled, since multiline values are always treated literally.
:::

## Shared Variables

You could have 3 types of shared variables:

1. Team Based
2. Project Based
3. Environment Based (production, staging, etc.)

You can set shared variables on their respective pages.

Then you can use these variables anywhere. For example: You defined `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

### Team Based

You can set them on the `Team` page and use it with {{team.NODE\_ENV}}. Do not replace "team" with your actual team name.

### Project Based

You can set them on the `Projects` page, under the gear icon and use it with {{project.NODE\_ENV}}. Do not replace "project" with your actual project name.

### Environment Based

You can set them on the `Environments` page (select a `Project`), under the gear icon and use it with {{environment.NODE\_ENV}} Do not replace "environment" with your actual environment name.

### Using Environment and Shared Variables in Docker Compose

Within Coolify you can configure these easily following the details found in the [Knowledge Base for Docker Compose](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#shared-environment-variables).

## Predefined Variables

Coolify predefines some variables for you, so you can use them in your application or service. All you need to do is to add an environment variable like this to your application or service.

```bash
# For example, you can use this variable in your application
MY_VARIABLE=$SOURCE_COMMIT
# You will have the commit hash of the source code in your application as an environment variable in MY_VARIABLE
```

### Application Variables

#### `COOLIFY_FQDN`

Fully qualified domain name(s) of the application.

#### `COOLIFY_URL`

URL(s) of the application.

#### `COOLIFY_BRANCH`

Branch name of the source code.

#### `COOLIFY_RESOURCE_UUID`

Unique resource identifier generated by Coolify.

#### `COOLIFY_CONTAINER_NAME`

Name of the container generated by Coolify.

#### `SOURCE_COMMIT`

Commit hash of the source code.

::: tip Build Cache
By default, `SOURCE_COMMIT` is not included in Docker builds to preserve cache. Enable "Include Source Commit in Build" in your application's General settings if your build process needs this value.
:::

#### `PORT`

If not set: it is set to the `Port Exposes`'s first port.

#### `HOST`

If not set: it is set to `0.0.0.0`

### Service Stack Variables

#### `SERVICE_NAME_<ID>`

The service name of a given service in the stack. For example, if you have a service named `web`, you can access it with `SERVICE_NAME_WEB`. Useful for preview deployments where service names will vary.

## Magic Environment Variables

For Docker Compose / Service Stack deployments, Coolify can auto-generate dynamic values using the `SERVICE_<TYPE>_<IDENTIFIER>` syntax. These let you generate URLs, FQDNs, passwords, and random strings that stay consistent across all services in a stack.

| Type | What it generates | Example output                            |
|---|---|-------------------------------------------|
| `SERVICE_URL_<ID>` | A URL based on your wildcard domain | `http://app-vgsco4o.example.com`          |
| `SERVICE_URL_<ID>_3000` | URL with proxy routing to a specific port | `http://app-vgsco4o.example.com:3000`     |
| `SERVICE_URL_<ID>=/api` | URL with a path appended | `http://app-vgsco4o.example.com/api`      |
| `SERVICE_URL_<ID>_3000=/api` | URL with both port routing and path | `http://app-vgsco4o.example.com:3000/api` |
| `SERVICE_FQDN_<ID>` | The FQDN portion of the generated URL | `app-vgsco4o.example.com`                 |
| `SERVICE_FQDN_<ID>_3000` | FQDN with proxy routing to a specific port | `app-vgsco4o.example.com:3000`            |
| `SERVICE_FQDN_<ID>=/api` | FQDN with a path appended | `app-vgsco4o.example.com/api`             |
| `SERVICE_USER_<ID>` | A random username string | `a8Kd3fR2mNpQ1xYz`                        |
| `SERVICE_PASSWORD_<ID>` | A random password (`PASSWORD_64` for 64 characters) | `G7hkL9mpQ2rT4vXw`                        |
| `SERVICE_BASE64_<ID>` | A random base64 string (`BASE64_64`, `BASE64_128` for longer) | `x9Yf2KqLm4NpR7TdWb8ZcA1eG3hJ5kM`         |

Generated values are reusable across services and persist between deployments. For full usage examples in a compose file, see [Magic Environment Variables in Docker Compose](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#coolify-s-magic-environment-variables).
