# MinIO Community Edition

![MinIO](/images/services/minio-logo.svg)

::: danger SERVICE REMOVED FROM COOLIFY
This service has been removed from Coolify’s one-click service catalog because it is no longer maintained by its original author.

The community-maintained MinIO service on Coolify was an effort by the Coolify team to automatically build Docker images and publish them to both GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub, using the official MinIO codebase on GitHub as the source.

However, since the original upstream repository is no longer actively maintained, this community service will not receive any further updates.

### Invalid login credentials

You need to run MinIO on `https` (not self-signed) to avoid this issue. MinIO doesn't support http based authentication.
