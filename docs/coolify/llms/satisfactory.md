# What is Satisfactory?

Satisfactory is a first-person, open-world factory simulation game focused on building, automation, and exploration on an alien planet. Players, as "Capital Pioneers" for FICSIT Inc., explore, gather resources, and build massive, multi-story factories interconnected by conveyor belts to automate production.

## Info

The server may run on less than 8GB of RAM, though 8GB - 16GB is still recommended per the the [official wiki](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers#Requirements?utm_source=coolify.io). You may need to increase the container's defined `--memory` restriction as you approach the late game (or if you're playing with many 4+ players)

### Updating

The game automatically updates when the container is started or restarted (unless you set `SKIPUPDATE=true`).
