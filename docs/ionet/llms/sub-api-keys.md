# Sub-API Keys

> Issue scoped API keys to teams, services, or partners — each with independent model restrictions and credit limits that roll up to your account balance.

Sub-API keys allow an account holder (the *admin*) to issue multiple child API keys, each independently controlled. Each sub-key can be restricted to specific models, given a spending cap per billing cycle, and revoked at any time — without touching the admin key or other sub-keys.

## Overview

When you create a sub-key:

* It inherits your account's credit pool — there is no separate balance to fund.
* You optionally cap how much of that pool any single sub-key can consume per billing period.
* You optionally restrict which models the sub-key can call.
* The sub-key's usage feeds back into your account's overall billing.

This is useful for:

* **Teams** — give each team or project its own key with a monthly budget.
* **Partners / customers** — provide programmatic API access with hard credit limits so a single integration can never exhaust your entire balance.
* **Services** — isolate microservices with model allow-lists so they can only call the models they need.

## Authentication

All sub-key management endpoints use your **admin API key** in the `x-api-key` header. Sub-keys themselves authenticate inference calls (chat completions, embeddings, etc.) using the same header — they are recognized automatically by the API.

```bash  theme={null}
# Admin operations (create, list, update, revoke)
-H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"

# Inference calls using a sub-key
-H "x-api-key: $SUB_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  Sub-keys cannot create further sub-keys. Only an admin key can manage the key hierarchy.
</Note>

## Creating a Sub-API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call the create endpoint with your admin key">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl -X POST "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys" \
      -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "description": "Partner integration – Acme Corp",
        "allowed_models": ["meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"],
        "credit_limit": 10.0,
        "credit_refresh_cycle": "monthly",
        "key_prefix": "acme"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store the returned key value securely">
    The response includes a `value` field with the full key string (e.g. `acme-v2-eyJhbGci...`). This is shown **only once**. Copy it to a secret manager immediately — it cannot be retrieved again.

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "status": "succeeded",
      "data": {
        "key_id": "71775d2e-fbcc-4ef4-aa30-8aaeb82062c0",
        "value": "acme-v2-eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "display": "acme-v2-eyJh...c0eQ",
        "description": "Partner integration – Acme Corp",
        "allowed_models": ["meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"],
        "credit_limit": 10.0,
        "credit_refresh_cycle": "monthly",
        "expires_at": "2026-08-20T00:00:00"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Distribute the sub-key to its intended user or service">
    The recipient uses the sub-key exactly like a regular API key — just pass it in the `x-api-key` header for inference calls.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request Parameters

| Field                  | Type                 | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`          | string               | Yes      | Human-readable label for the key.                                                                                      |
| `allowed_models`       | string\[]            | No       | List of model IDs this key may call. Omit to allow all models.                                                         |
| `credit_limit`         | number               | No       | Maximum credits per refresh cycle. Omit for no per-key cap.                                                            |
| `credit_refresh_cycle` | string               | No       | When the usage counter resets: `"8h"`, `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monthly"` (default).                                   |
| `expires_at`           | datetime / `"never"` | No       | Key expiry. Defaults to 180 days from creation.                                                                        |
| `key_prefix`           | string               | No       | 2–8 char lowercase slug prepended to the key (e.g. `"acme"` → `acme-v2-...`). Defaults to the standard `io-v2` prefix. |

## Model Restrictions

When `allowed_models` is set, any request to a model not in the list is rejected with **403 Forbidden**, even if the admin key has access to that model.

The `GET /v1/models` endpoint, when called with a sub-key, returns only the models in the sub-key's allow-list — so integrations can discover their permitted set without any extra configuration.

To remove all restrictions on an existing sub-key, pass an empty array:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X PATCH "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"allowed_models": []}'
```

## Credit Limits

### How limits are enforced

Credit limits are evaluated once per billing cycle by the settlement pipeline (which runs every \~60 seconds). When a sub-key's accumulated spend in the current period exceeds its `credit_limit`, the key is automatically blocked and inference calls return **429 Too Many Requests**.

The block clears automatically when the cycle resets (`credit_refresh_cycle`), or immediately when you raise the limit via `PATCH`.

### Blocking and unblocking

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="A sub-key is returning 429 — how do I unblock it?">
    The key has exceeded its `credit_limit` for the current period. You have two options:

    **Raise the limit immediately:**

    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl -X PATCH "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}" \
      -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"credit_limit": 50.0}'
    ```

    **Wait for the next cycle reset** — the key unblocks automatically when `credit_refresh_cycle` rolls over.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check how much a sub-key has spent?">
    Use the admin endpoint to inspect a specific key:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}/usage" \
      -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
    ```

    Or let the sub-key check itself:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/me/usage" \
      -H "x-api-key: $SUB_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my account balance when a sub-key is blocked?">
    The block applies only to that specific sub-key. Your admin key and all other sub-keys continue operating normally. The admin's overall account balance is not affected by per-key limits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credit Refresh Cycles

The `credit_refresh_cycle` determines when a sub-key's `credit_used` counter resets to zero, allowing spending up to `credit_limit` again.

| Cycle     | Resets at                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `8h`      | Every 8 hours aligned to midnight UTC (00:00, 08:00, 16:00). |
| `daily`   | Midnight UTC each day.                                       |
| `weekly`  | Monday 00:00 UTC.                                            |
| `monthly` | The 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC.                          |

## Custom Key Prefix

By default, sub-keys follow the standard `io-v2-` format. You can supply a custom `key_prefix` to make keys visually identifiable:

```json  theme={null}
{ "key_prefix": "acme" }
```

Produces: `acme-v2-eyJhbGci...`

**Prefix rules:**

* 2–8 characters, lowercase letters, digits, and internal hyphens only.
* Cannot start with `io` (reserved for platform keys).
* Cannot contain version markers like `-v2`.

The prefix does not change any functionality — it is purely cosmetic for organizational clarity.

## Managing Sub-Keys

### Listing keys

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Returns all active sub-keys with their current `credit_used` for the active billing period.

### Updating a key

All fields on a sub-key can be updated at any time. Only the fields you include in the `PATCH` body are changed:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X PATCH "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Updated label",
    "credit_limit": 25.0,
    "credit_refresh_cycle": "weekly"
  }'
```

### Revoking a key

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X DELETE "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Revocation is immediate and permanent. Any subsequent inference call with the revoked key returns **401 Unauthorized**.

## Viewing Usage

### All sub-keys (admin)

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/usage" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Returns a per-key breakdown of token consumption and credit cost, grouped by model, for today and all time — plus aggregate totals across all sub-keys.

### Single sub-key (admin)

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/{key_id}/usage" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

### Self-service (sub-key holder)

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/v1/api-keys/sub-keys/me/usage" \
  -H "x-api-key: $SUB_API_KEY"
```

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do sub-keys have their own credit balance?" icon="comment-question">
    No. Sub-keys draw from the admin's account balance. The `credit_limit` is a spending cap per cycle, not a separate balance. All usage by sub-keys is deducted from the same pool as the admin's own usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can a sub-key call any model endpoint?" icon="comment-question">
    Only the models listed in `allowed_models`. If no list is configured, the sub-key can call any model available to the admin account. The `/v1/models` endpoint filters its response to only show the permitted models when called with a sub-key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when the cycle resets?" icon="comment-question">
    The sub-key's `credit_used` counter is reset to zero at the start of each new period. If the key was blocked due to exceeding its limit, it is automatically unblocked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly does blocking take effect after the limit is exceeded?" icon="comment-question">
    The billing settlement pipeline runs approximately every 60 seconds. Once a sub-key's accumulated spend exceeds its `credit_limit`, the block is applied within the next pipeline run.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have sub-keys without a credit limit?" icon="comment-question">
    Yes. Omit `credit_limit` (or set it to `null`) when creating or updating a sub-key. The key will only be limited by the admin's overall account balance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the key prefix stored anywhere?" icon="comment-question">
    No. The prefix is encoded in the key string itself. The display value (e.g. `acme-v2-eyJh...c0eQ`) shows the prefix so you can identify it, but it is not stored separately in the database.
