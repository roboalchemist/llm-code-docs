# Device Block Reward Multiplier

> A detailed comparison of 2025 block reward multipliers by device type, with upcoming staking-related adjustments.

The io.net block reward system uses performance-based multipliers to fairly distribute rewards across a wide variety of hardware types. These multipliers are designed to reflect the relative utility, compute performance, and cost-efficiency of each device, ensuring the most effective hardware for AI workloads is appropriately incentivized.

## Network Expansion and Updated Reward Structure

On **June 4, 2025 at 3 PM UTC**, io.net significantly expanded its network with the addition of over **800 NVIDIA H200 GPUs**. This is the largest single onboarding of enterprise-grade hardware in our history and is part of our commitment to scaling infrastructure for enterprise AI workloads like training and inference.

To ensure fair distribution of rewards as the network grows, the block reward system has been updated to reflect the following changes:

* Updated device multipliers
* New reward pool categories
* Temporary staking grace period

## Reward Pool Categories

| Pool Type                  | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔴 **No longer supported** | Low-tier or outdated devices. Multiplier set to 0. **No longer earn rewards.** |
| 🟡 **Community Pool**      | Consumer and mid-range devices. **Earn 5% of block rewards.**                  |
| 🟢 **Enterprise Pool**     | High-performance processors. **Earn 95% of block rewards.**                    |

## Overview of Staking Requirements

<Warning>
  **Important changes to Staking Requirements coming July 1, 2025**

  Until **July 1, 2025**, staking requirements will continue to be calculated using the current earning multiplier.
</Warning>

To qualify for block rewards, each device must meet a minimum staking threshold calculated as follows:

* **Base Stake** **per processor**: 200 \$IO
* **Earning Multiplier**: Varies by device performance
* **Number of processors**: Total processors in the device

<Info>
  Minimum Stake = Base Stake × max(1, Earning Multiplier) × Number of processors
</Info>

Starting **July 1, 2025**, staking requirements may increase for some devices, as a new calculation logic will take effect.

For example:

* A device with **8** H100 **GPUs**, each having an earning **multiplier of 10** - Minimum Stake calculation: **200 × 10 × 8 = 16,000 \$IO**
* A device with **4** RTX 4070 **GPUs**, each having an earning **multiplier of 0.25** - Minimum Stake calculation: 200 × max(1, 0.5) × 4 = **200 × 1 × 4 = 800 \$IO**

<Info>
  Even if the earning multiplier is less than 1, the multiplier used in the calculation defaults to 1 to ensure a minimum stake of 200 \$IO per processor.
</Info>

### Upcoming Adjustments

With the integration of new H200 GPUs and the introduction of a ***Community Hardware Pool***, the following changes are anticipated:

* **Updated Multipliers:** Devices will have their earning multipliers recalibrated based on performance metrics.
* **Adjusted Staking Requirements:** As multipliers change, the corresponding staking requirements will also adjust.
* **Grace Period**: A one-month grace period will be provided before new staking requirements are enforced.

<Warning>
  **Higher multiplier** ≠ **always higher rewards.** \
  Actual rewards depend on several factors - including the number of eligible devices in a block, pool allocation (e.g., Community vs. Enterprise), and your device’s multiplier.
</Warning>

For more detailed information on staking requirements and calculations, refer to the [IO Staking Documentation](/guides/staking/io-staking).
