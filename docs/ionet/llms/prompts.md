# Overview

> The R2R Prompts API manages reusable, type-safe prompt templates that structure interactions with language models. It supports dynamic generation, version control, and centralized governance to ensure consistent, high-quality AI behavior.

A **Prompt** in R2R represents a **templated instruction or query pattern** that standardizes how the system interacts with language models and other AI components. Prompts serve as reusable blueprints for generating consistent and context-aware outputs across workflows.

Managed by **superusers**, prompts ensure governance, maintain version control, and support type-safe customization for different application contexts.

### Key Capabilities

Prompts in R2R provide:

* **Templated instruction management** for reusable prompt definitions.
* **Type-safe input handling** to ensure structured and validated parameter substitution.
* **Centralized prompt governance** for system-wide consistency and quality control.
* **Dynamic prompt generation** to adapt templates based on context or input data.
* **Version control** for tracking updates and maintaining reproducibility.
