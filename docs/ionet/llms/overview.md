# Overview

> io.net's Confidential Inference enables verifiable AI inference where you can cryptographically prove that your prompts were processed securely on trusted hardware, without storing any of your data.

## Don't Trust, Verify

Traditional AI APIs require you to trust that the provider handles your data securely. With confidential compute, you can **verify** these guarantees cryptographically:

* **Hardware attestation** proves your request ran on genuine, secure GPU hardware
* **Response signatures** prove the output came from the attested machine
* **Nonce verification** proves the attestation is fresh, not replayed

## How It Works

1. **Request attestation** with a unique nonce you generate
2. **io.net routes** your request to a confidential compute-enabled GPU machine
3. **GPU TEE** generates a hardware attestation report with a signing key
4. [**Verify**](./guides/confidential-inference/verification-guide) the attestation report proves the machine is genuine and secure
5. [**Run inference**](./guides/confidential-inference/quick-start) - responses are signed with the attested key
6. **Verify signatures** to prove responses came from the attested machine

## Key Components

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

The GPU runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment that provides:

* **Memory isolation** - your data is encrypted in memory and inaccessible to the host
* **Code integrity** - only authorized code can run inside the TEE
* **Hardware attestation** - the GPU can prove its identity and configuration

### Attestation Agent (Open Source)

The attestation agent running on GPU machines is fully open source. You can audit the code that generates attestation reports and signs responses:

**Repository:** [https://github.com/ionet-official/cc-attestation-agent-api](https://github.com/ionet-official/cc-attestation-agent-api)

This transparency allows you to:

* Verify what code is running inside the TEE
* Understand exactly what is being attested
* Build confidence in the verification process

### Attestation Reports

When you request attestation, you receive:

| Field             | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gpu`             | NVIDIA GPU attestation report proving the GPU identity and TEE state |
| `cpu`             | CPU attestation report (when available) for additional verification  |
| `image_digest`    | SHA256 hash of the container image running in the TEE                |
| `signing_address` | Public key the machine will use to sign inference responses          |
| `nonce`           | Your nonce echoed back, proving freshness                            |

### Response Signatures

Every inference response includes cryptographic signatures in the response headers:

| Header            | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`            | The content that was signed                         |
| `signature`       | Cryptographic signature of the text                 |
| `signing_address` | Public key that signed (matches attestation report) |
| `signing_algo`    | Algorithm used for signing                          |

## What You Can Prove

| Check                                 | What It Proves                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GPU attestation report is valid       | Response came from genuine NVIDIA GPU in TEE mode                        |
| `image_digest` matches release        | Running container hasn't been tampered with                              |
| `signing_address` matches attestation | Responses are signed by the attested machine                             |
| Signature verifies                    | Response was not tampered with in transit and signed on attested machine |
| Nonce matches your request            | Attestation is fresh, not replayed                                       |

## Privacy Guarantees

Confidential compute operates in **Zero Data Retention (ZDR) mode**:

* Your prompts and responses are **never stored**
* Only token counts are recorded for billing
* No logs of conversation content exist
