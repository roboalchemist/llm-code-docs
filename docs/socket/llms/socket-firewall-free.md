# Socket Firewall Free

Socket Firewall Free is a lightweight tool that protects developer machines in real time, blocking malicious dependencies before they ever reach your laptop or build system. It works out of the box — **no API key and no configuration required.**

```
$ sfw --help

Socket Firewall Free - Network security proxy for package managers

Runs any package manager command with network traffic filtering.

Usage:
  sfw <command>...
  sfw --help

  Examples:
    sfw npm install
    sfw pip install requests

Provided under the following license:
https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/blob/main/README.md#license
```

## Usage

Once installed, `sfw` should be prefixed to any supported package manager's command:

```bash
sfw npm install --save some-package@1.33.7
sfw cargo fetch
sfw uv pip install flask
```

**Supported Package Managers:**

* JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` (`sfw` might work with other package managers, but support is not guaranteed)
* Python: `pip`, `uv`
* Rust: `cargo`

**Note:** Socket Firewall Enterprise supports additional ecosystems including Go, Java, Ruby, and .NET. See the [overview](overview.md) for details.

## Installation

### npm Installation

The simplest installation method is via npm:

```bash
npm i -g sfw
# sfw can then be prefixed in front of package manager commands
sfw npm install --save dangerous-package
sfw pip install dangerous-package
```

### Manual Installation

You can also install manually by downloading the appropriate binary from the [releases](https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases) page, moving it into your `PATH`, and making it executable. Keep in mind that, if you do this, you'll need to update the binary periodically as we drop support for older versions.

**Note:** `sfw`  binaries are not currently signed. On MacOS, you may need to configure the OS to allow execution of `sfw`. You can accomplish like so:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./path/to/sfw
```

Once the `sfw` binaries are signed, this step will no longer be necessary.

#### macOS

```bash
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
curl -L -o sfw https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-darwin-arm64
chmod +x sfw
sudo mv sfw /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
curl -L -o sfw https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-linux-x86_64
chmod +x sfw
sudo mv sfw /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows

```powershell
# Download the binary (replace with actual release URL)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/releases/latest/download/sfw-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "sfw.exe"
# Move to a directory in your PATH, such as:
Move-Item sfw.exe "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\sfw.exe"
```

**Note:** Additional installation methods may be provided in the future.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

If you'd like to use `sfw` in a CI/CD environment, we've supplied a GitHub Action you can use to ensure you're always running the latest version:

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  job-id:
    # Socket Firewall supports Linux, Windows, and macOS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # add Socket Firewall to the runner environment
      - uses: socketdev/action@v1
        with:
          mode: firewall
      
      # setup your project (e.g. checkout, setup-node, etc...)
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      
      # example usage
      - run: sfw npm ci
      - run: sfw npm install lodash
      - run: sfw pip install requests
```

## Configuration

Socket Firewall Free is a **zero-configuration tool** that works immediately after installation. No API key, configuration files, or setup is required.

**Note:** Socket Firewall Enterprise offers configurable security policies, custom registry support, and organization-wide settings. See the [overview](overview.md) for details.

## Differences to Socket Firewall Enterprise

Socket Firewall Free is provided as a free tool for open source and commercial projects alike. In order for this to be sustainable, and to prevent abuse, the tool comes with a few limitations:

* **Custom registries are not supported.** Socket Firewall Free only works with public registries. Socket Firewall Enterprise supports private and custom registries.

* **AI-detected malware generates warnings, not blocks.** Socket utilizes AI scans and subsequent human review when identifying malware. Socket Firewall Free will display a warning if AI-detected potential malware is requested but will not block the network traffic. Only confirmed malware is blocked. Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure this behavior.

* **Limited ecosystem support.** Socket Firewall Free supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust. Socket Firewall Enterprise supports additional ecosystems including Go, Java, Ruby, and .NET.

* **Unknown packages are not blocked.** Unknown or unscanned versions of packages will not be blocked by Socket Firewall Free. Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure this behavior.

* **No allow-list mechanism.** Socket Firewall Free provides no way to allow-list a particular package or version. Socket Firewall Enterprise includes allow-list capabilities.

* **Wrapper mode only.** Socket Firewall Free only operates in wrapper mode (command prefix). Socket Firewall Enterprise also supports service mode for centralized deployment.

* **No dashboard integration.** Socket Firewall Free does not send data to your Socket dashboard. Socket Firewall Enterprise provides visibility into installation activity across your organization.

* **Telemetry is not configurable.** Socket Firewall Free collects anonymous telemetry (see below). Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure telemetry collection.

* **Rate limits.** Use of Socket Firewall Free is not rate-limited except in cases where abuse is detected. The limits are very large and should not be reached in normal use.

For a detailed comparison, see the [Socket Firewall Overview](overview.md).

## Telemetry

Socket Firewall Free collects anonymous telemetry. We recognize this can cause reasonable concern for some, so we want to be transparent. Here's what we collect and why:

* A [unique, non-reversible identifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-machine-id) per machine. This allows us to get a sense for usage trends.
* Information about blocked and permitted packages, e.g. name, namespace, version.
* Latency added by Socket Firewall when fetching packages. This will help us detect service degradation and meaningfully measure the improvements we make to the software.
* Errors. This is pretty bare bones; we do not include information from the local filesystem (e.g. call stacks, paths, file names, etc).
* GitHub organization name. To help us understand adoption across teams, Socket Firewall may collect the name of your GitHub organization from your configured remotes. We only collect the org name — never repository names, source code, or commit history.

Additional telemetry events may be added in future versions as we learn more about usage patterns and continue adding features. However, the information we collect will always be anonymous.

**Note:** Telemetry is configurable in Socket Firewall Enterprise.

## License

Socket Firewall Free is provided under the [PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0). You can also find the license text in the [installer repository](https://github.com/SocketDev/sfw-free/blob/main/README.md#license).

## FAQ

### What ecosystems and package managers are supported?

Socket Firewall Free supports:

* JavaScript & TypeScript: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`
* Python: `pip`, `uv`
* Rust: `cargo`

**Note:** Socket Firewall Enterprise supports additional ecosystems including Go, Java (Maven, Gradle), Ruby (gem, Bundler), and .NET (NuGet). See the [overview](overview.md) for details.

### Does Socket Firewall Free protect against transitive dependencies?

Yes. Socket Firewall Free protects against malicious packages at any depth in your dependency tree, not just top-level dependencies.

### Why am I not seeing Socket Firewall Free block a package I know is malicious?

Socket Firewall Free works by blocking network requests for package artifacts. If there are no network requests, as is the case when artifacts are cached locally, there is nothing for `sfw` to block. We recommend that you clear your package manager's cache (e.g. `npm cache clean --force`) and use `sfw` from that point onward.

Additionally, Socket Firewall Free only blocks **confirmed malware** that has been verified through human review. If a package is flagged by AI but not yet confirmed, Socket Firewall Free will display a warning but will not block it. Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure this behavior.

### How do I clear my package manager cache?

For the most up-to-date information, consult the documentation for the package manager in use. However, if you're already confident and just need a reminder:

```bash
# npm
npm cache clean --force

# yarn v1
yarn cache clean

# yarn v2
yarn cache clean --mirror

# pnpm
# TODO: there doesn't appear to be a way to truly clean the cache - only unused or specified packages

# pip
pip cache purge

# uv
uv cache clean

# cargo
cargo clean gc # clear only unused packages
rm -fr ~/.cargo/registry ~/.cargo/git # clear all cached packages
```

### Can I use Socket Firewall Free with private registries?

No. Custom and private registries are not supported by Socket Firewall Free. Socket Firewall Enterprise supports private registries.

### What's the difference between AI-detected and confirmed malware?

Socket utilizes AI scans and subsequent human review when identifying malware:

* **AI-detected malware**: Packages flagged by Socket's AI as potentially malicious but not yet verified by human review. Socket Firewall Free will display a warning but will not block these packages.
* **Confirmed malware**: Packages verified as malicious through human review. Socket Firewall Free will block these packages.

Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure how AI-detected malware is handled, including the option to block it.

### Does Socket Firewall Free work offline?

No. Socket Firewall Free requires network connectivity to check packages against Socket's security API. If you lack network connectivity, Socket Firewall Free cannot function.

### How do I report a false positive or false negative?

If you believe you have identified a malicious package, or if your package has been incorrectly flagged, please reach out to [support@socket.dev](mailto:support@socket.dev)

### Can I disable telemetry in Socket Firewall Free?

No. Telemetry is always enabled in Socket Firewall Free. Socket Firewall Enterprise allows you to configure telemetry collection.
