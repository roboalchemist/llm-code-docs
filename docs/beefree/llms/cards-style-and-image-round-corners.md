## Implementing Image Rounded Corners and Card Style Features

This guide explains how to enable the Image Rounded Corners and Cards Style features in your host application. It provides instructions for making these features available to your application's end users while they are designing emails, pages, and popups.

### Cards Style

Cards Style is a Row Property that enables you to create space between columns and round the corners of columns within a row.

The Cards Style feature allows users to transform ordinary messages into visually appealing layouts that grab their audience’s attention effortlessly. By incorporating stylish cards, users can effectively highlight product features, display customer testimonials, promote special offers, and present news updates in a structured and eye-catching manner. This not only enhances the readability and engagement of emails, pages, and popups but also ensures that important information stands out and resonates with viewers, providing significant value to the end-users and enriching their design experience within your application.

### Implementing Rounded Corners and Card Style Using Content Defaults

You can implement the image rounded corners and cards style features using content defaults in your application's configuration. The following code snippet demonstrates how to set the properties related to these features.

```json
{
  "image": {
    "borderRadius": "30px"
  },
  "row": {
    "styles": {
      "backgroundColor": "red",
      "contentAreaBackgroundColor": "green",
      "verticalAlign": "bottom",
      "columnsBorderRadius": "10px",
      "columnsSpacing": "20px",
      "columnsStackOnMobile": false,
      "columnsReverseStackOnMobile": true,
      "columnsPadding": "42px",
      "columnsBackgroundColor": "yellow"
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration:

* **Image Rounded Corners**: The `borderRadius` property under the `image` key sets the border radius to "30px".
* **Cards Style Widgets**: The `row` key contains styling properties for widgets, such as `columnsBorderRadius`, `columnsPadding`, and `columnsBackgroundColor`.

Visit the [Content Defaults](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/appearance/content-defaults#row) page to learn more about these configurations.

### Advanced Permissions for Customization

To control the permissions for the Cards Style and Image Round Corners features, use the following configuration sample.

```json
{
  ...
  "rows": {
    ...
    "columnsSpacing": {
      "show": true,
      "locked": false
    },
    "columnsBorderRadius": {
      "show": true,
      "locked": false
    }
  },
  "image": {
    ...
    "properties": {
      ...
      "borderRadius": {
        "show": true,
        "locked": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration allows you to manage whether these features are visible and editable to your application's end users.

The properties in the advanced permissions code snippet control the visibility and editability of specific interface elements related to Cards Style and Image Round Corners. By setting `"show": true`, these elements will be displayed to end users. The `"locked": false` property ensures that these settings can be modified by the end users. These configurations set the permissions for these features within your host application.

Visit the [Advanced Permissions page](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/advanced-options/advanced-permissions#rows) to learn more about these configurations.
