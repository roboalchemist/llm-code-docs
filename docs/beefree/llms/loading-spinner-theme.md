# Loading Spinner Theme

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on Beefree SDK [paid plans](https://developers.beefree.io/pricing-plans) only.
{% endhint %}

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The default Beefree SDK theme is grayscale and generally can be used with any color scheme. In v3, you can now choose between a dark and light theme for the loading animation, so it can better fit the host application’s UI. If you would like to change the loading icon and/or have more granular control of the loading theme, please view our article about [using custom CSS](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/other-customizations/appearance/custom-css).
