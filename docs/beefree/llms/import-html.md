# Import HTML

## Overview

This page discusses how to use the HTML Importer API endpoint. Follow the instructions outlined in this page to successfully perform API calls.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** Ensure you complete the [Authentication steps](https://docs.beefree.io/beefree-sdk/apis/html-importer-api/authentication) and obtain your API key prior to performing the steps on this page.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

Prior to performing an API call, ensure the HTML you are using in the body of the `POST` request meets the following requirements:

* `DOCTYPE` declaration
* Include `html` and `body` elements
* To prevent character encoding issues during the conversion, include the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag in the `head` section of your HTML before converting it.

## Steps to perform the API call

Take the following steps to perform the conversion:

1. Ensure your API method is set to `POST`
2. Enter the endpoint URL: `https://api.getbee.io/v1/conversion/html-to-json`
   * **Note:** You can do this by setting `{collection}` equal to `conversion` in the following url: `https://api.getbee.io/v1/{collection}/html-to-json`
3. Authenticate by entering your **API key** as a **Bearer Token** in the **Auth Type** field
4. Ensure your request body's `Content-Type` is set to `text/html`
5. Paste the HTML you'd like to convert into the request body field and ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites)
6. Click **Send**

Within a few seconds, you should receive a response containing the Beefree JSON.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If your imported HTML contains inline CSS, it will be converted as long as the HTML structure is valid. The importer converts from HTML to Beefree JSON but does not enhance or add new styles — only what's present in the source HTML will be mapped.
{% endhint %}

## Test the endpoint here

You can test the endpoint in the following interactive environment. Ensure you follow the steps outlined in the [Steps to perform the API call section](#steps-to-perform-the-api-call) to successfully execute the API call after clicking the **Test it** button. You can copy and paste the HTML in the **Sample HTML Template to Convert** expandable section below, or use your own HTML as a request body for experimenting with the **Test it** feature.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Required:** Ensure you manually type in `text/html` in the `Content-Type` field prior to making the API call.
