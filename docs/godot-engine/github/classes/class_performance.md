# Performance

**Inherits:** [Object<class_Object>]

Exposes performance-related data.


## Description

This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel. By using the [get_monitor()<class_Performance_method_get_monitor>] method of this class, you can access this data from your code.

You can add custom monitors using the [add_custom_monitor()<class_Performance_method_add_custom_monitor>] method. Custom monitors are available in **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel together with built-in monitors.

\ **Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return `0` when used in a project exported in release mode.

\ **Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are not updated in real-time for performance reasons, so there may be a delay of up to 1 second between changes.

\ **Note:** Custom monitors do not support negative values. Negative values are clamped to 0.

## Enumerations



enum **Monitor**: [🔗<enum_Performance_Monitor>]



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **TIME_FPS** = `0`

The number of frames rendered in the last second. This metric is only updated once per second, even if queried more often. *Higher is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **TIME_PROCESS** = `1`

Time it took to complete one frame, in seconds. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **TIME_PHYSICS_PROCESS** = `2`

Time it took to complete one physics frame, in seconds. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **TIME_NAVIGATION_PROCESS** = `3`

Time it took to complete one navigation step, in seconds. This includes navigation map updates as well as agent avoidance calculations. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **MEMORY_STATIC** = `4`

Static memory currently used, in bytes. Not available in release builds. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **MEMORY_STATIC_MAX** = `5`

Available static memory. Not available in release builds. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **MEMORY_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MAX** = `6`

Largest amount of memory the message queue buffer has used, in bytes. The message queue is used for deferred functions calls and notifications. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **OBJECT_COUNT** = `7`

Number of objects currently instantiated (including nodes). *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **OBJECT_RESOURCE_COUNT** = `8`

Number of resources currently used. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **OBJECT_NODE_COUNT** = `9`

The total number of vertices or indices rendered in the last rendered frame. This metric doesn't include primitives from culled objects (either via hiding nodes, frustum culling or occlusion culling). Due to the depth prepass and shadow passes, the number of primitives is always higher than the actual number of vertices in the scene (typically double or triple the original vertex count). *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **RENDER_TOTAL_DRAW_CALLS_IN_FRAME** = `13`

The total number of draw calls performed in the last rendered frame. This metric doesn't include culled objects (either via hiding nodes, frustum culling or occlusion culling), since they do not result in draw calls. *Lower is better.*



[Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] **RENDER_VIDEO_MEM_USED** = `14`

The amount of video memory used (texture and vertex memory combined, in bytes). Since this metric also includes miscellaneous allocations, this value is always greater than the sum of [RENDER_TEXTURE_MEM_USED<class_Performance_constant_RENDER_TEXTURE_MEM_USED>] and [RENDER_BUFFER_MEM_USED<class_Performance_constant_RENDER_BUFFER_MEM_USED>]. *Lower is better.*

## Method Descriptions



|void| **add_custom_monitor**\ (\ id\: [StringName<class_StringName>], callable\: [Callable<class_Callable>], arguments\: [Array<class_Array>] = [], type\: [MonitorType<enum_Performance_MonitorType>] = 0\ ) [🔗<class_Performance_method_add_custom_monitor>]

Adds a custom monitor with the name `id`. You can specify the category of the monitor using slash delimiters in `id` (for example: `"Game/NumberOfNPCs"`). If there is more than one slash delimiter, then the default category is used. The default category is `"Custom"`. Prints an error if given `id` is already present.


> **TABS**

    func _ready():
        var monitor_value = Callable(self, "get_monitor_value")

        # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "MyCategory".
        Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyCategory/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

        # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
        # Note: "MyCategory/MyMonitor" and "MyMonitor" have same name but different IDs, so the code is valid.
        Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyMonitor", monitor_value)

        # Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
        # Note: "MyMonitor" and "Custom/MyMonitor" have same name and same category but different IDs, so the code is valid.
        Performance.add_custom_monitor("Custom/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

        # Adds monitor with name "MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor" to category "Custom".
        Performance.add_custom_monitor("MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor", monitor_value)

    func get_monitor_value():
        return randi() % 25


    public override void _Ready()
    {
        var monitorValue = new Callable(this, MethodName.GetMonitorValue);

        // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "MyCategory".
        Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyCategory/MyMonitor", monitorValue);
        // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
        // Note: "MyCategory/MyMonitor" and "MyMonitor" have same name but different ids so the code is valid.
        Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyMonitor", monitorValue);

        // Adds monitor with name "MyName" to category "Custom".
        // Note: "MyMonitor" and "Custom/MyMonitor" have same name and same category but different ids so the code is valid.
        Performance.AddCustomMonitor("Custom/MyMonitor", monitorValue);

        // Adds monitor with name "MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor" to category "Custom".
        Performance.AddCustomMonitor("MyCategoryOne/MyCategoryTwo/MyMonitor", monitorValue);
    }

    public int GetMonitorValue()

Returns the [MonitorType<enum_Performance_MonitorType>] values of active custom monitors in an [Array<class_Array>].


----



[float<class_float>] **get_monitor**\ (\ monitor\: [Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>]\ ) |const| [🔗<class_Performance_method_get_monitor>]

Returns the value of one of the available built-in monitors. You should provide one of the [Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>] constants as the argument, like this:


> **TABS**
>

    print(Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_FPS)) # Prints the FPS to the console.


    GD.Print(Performance.GetMonitor(Performance.Monitor.TimeFps)); // Prints the FPS to the console.



See [get_custom_monitor()<class_Performance_method_get_custom_monitor>] to query custom performance monitors' values.


----



[int<class_int>] **get_monitor_modification_time**\ (\ ) [🔗<class_Performance_method_get_monitor_modification_time>]

Returns the last tick in which custom monitor was added/removed (in microseconds since the engine started). This is set to [Time.get_ticks_usec()<class_Time_method_get_ticks_usec>] when the monitor is updated.
