# Xcode

[Xcode ](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) is a free macOS-only IDE. You can
download it from the Mac App Store.

## Importing the project

- From Xcode's main screen create a new project using the **Other > External Build System** template.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Now choose a name for your project and set the path to scons executable in build tool (to find the path you can type `where scons` in a terminal).

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Open the main target from the **Targets** section and select the **Info** tab.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Fill out the form with the following settings:

  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Arguments  | See [doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem] for a full list of arguments. |
  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Directory  | A full path to the Godot root folder                                         |
  +------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Add a Command Line Tool target which will be used for indexing the project by
  choosing **File > New > Target...**.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Select **macOS > Application > Command Line Tool**.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
> **NOTE**
>
- For this target open the **Build Settings** tab and look for **Header Search Paths**.
- Set **Header Search Paths** to the absolute path to the Godot root folder. You need to
  include subdirectories as well. To achieve that, add two two asterisks (`**`) to the
  end of the path, e.g. `/Users/me/repos/godot-source/**`.

- Add the Godot source to the project by dragging and dropping it into the project file browser.
- Select **Create groups** for the **Added folders** option and check *only*
  your command line indexing target in the **Add to targets** section.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Xcode will now index the files. This may take a few minutes.
- Once Xcode is done indexing, you should have jump-to-definition,
  autocompletion, and full syntax highlighting.

## Debugging the project

To enable debugging support you need to edit the external build target's build and run schemes.

- Open the scheme editor of the external build target.
- Locate the **Build > Post Actions** section.
- Add a new script run action
- Under **Provide build settings from** select your project. This allows to reference
  the project directory within the script.
- Create a script that will give the binary a name that Xcode can recognize, e.g.:

```shell
```
  ln -f ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot.macos.tools.64 ${PROJECT_DIR}/godot/bin/godot

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Build the external build target.

- Open the scheme editor again and select **Run**.

> **FIGURE**
> :figclass: figure-w480
> :align: center
>
- Set the **Executable** to the file you linked in your post-build action script.
- Check **Debug executable**.
- You can add two arguments on the **Arguments** tab:
  the `-e` flag opens the editor instead of the Project Manager, and the `--path` argument
  tells the executable to open the specified project (must be provided as an *absolute* path
  to the project root, not the `project.godot` file).

To check that everything is working, put a breakpoint in `platform/macos/godot_main_macos.mm` and
run the project.
