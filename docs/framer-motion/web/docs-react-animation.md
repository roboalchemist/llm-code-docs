Markdown Content:
[Motion for React](https://motion.dev/) is a simple yet powerful animation library. Whether you're building hover effects, scroll-triggered animations, or complex animation sequences, this guide will provide an overview of all the ways you can animate in React with Motion.

[What you'll learn](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#what-you-ll-learn)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   How to create your first animation with the `<motion.div />` component.

*   Which values and elements you can animate.

*   How to customise your animations with transition options.

*   How to animate elements as they enter and exit the DOM.

*   How to orchestrate animations with variants.

[Animate with `<motion />`](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animate-with-motion)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most animations in Motion are created with the[](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-component)`<motion />`[component](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-component). Import it from `"motion/react"`:

import{motion}from"motion/react"

Every HTML & SVG element can be defined with a `motion` component:

<motion.div/>

<motion.a href="#"/>

<motion.circle cx={0}/>

These work identically to their HTML/SVG counterparts - same props, same behaviour - but with additional animation props like `animate`, `whileHover`, and `exit`.

The most common animation prop is `animate`. When values passed to `animate` change, the element will automatically animate to that value.

<motion.div animate={{opacity:1}}/>

### [Enter animations](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#enter-animations)

We can set initial values for an element with the `initial` prop. So an element defined like this will fade in when it enters the DOM:

<motion.article
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
/>

[Animatable values](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animatable-values)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Motion can animate any CSS value**, like `opacity`, `filter` etc.

<motion.section
  initial={{ filter: "blur(10px)" }}
  animate={{ filter: "none" }}
/>

It can even animate values that aren't normally animatable by browsers, like `background-image` or `mask-image`:

<motion.nav
  initial={{ maskImage: "linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0,0,0,1) 90%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 100%)" }}
  animate={{ maskImage: "linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0,0,0,1) 90%, rgba(0,0,0,1) 100%)" }}
/>

### [Transforms](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#transforms)

Unlike CSS, Motion can animate every transform axis independently.

<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />

It supports the following special transform values:

*   Translate: `x`, `y`, `z`

*   Scale: `scale`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`

*   Rotate: `rotate`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `rotateZ`

*   Skew: `skewX`, `skewY`

*   Perspective: `transformPerspective`

`motion` components also have enhanced `style` props, allowing you to use these shorthands statically:

<motion.section style={{ x: -20 }} />

Animating transforms independently provides great flexibility, especially when animating different transforms with gestures:

<motion.button
  initial={{ y: 10 }}
  animate={{ y: 0 }}
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
/>

Independent transforms already perform great, but Motion uniquely offers hardware acceleration when setting `transform` directly.

<motion.li
  initial={{ transform: "translateX(-100px)" }}
  animate={{ transform: "translateX(0px)" }}
  transition={{ type: "spring" }}
/>

### [Supported value types](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#supported-value-types)

Motion can animate any of the following value types:

*   Numbers: `0`, `100` etc.

*   Strings containing numbers: `"0vh"`, `"10px"` etc.

*   Colors: Hex, RGBA, HSLA.

*   Complex strings containing multiple numbers and/or colors (like `box-shadow`).

*   `display: "none"/"block"` and `visibility: "hidden"/"visible"`.

### [Value type conversion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#value-type-conversion)

In general, values can only be animated between two of the same type (i.e `"0px"` to `"100px"`).

Colors can be freely animated between hex, RGBA and HSLA types.

Additionally, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `right` and `bottom` can animate between different value types.

<motion.div
  initial={{ x: "100%" }}
  animate={{ x: "calc(100vw - 50%)" }}
/>

It's also possible to animate `width` and `height` in to/out of `"auto"`.

<motion.div
  initial={{ height: 0 }}
  animate={{ height: "auto" }}
/>

If animating `height: auto` while also animating `display` in to/out of `"none"`, replace this with `visibility``"hidden"` as elements with `display: none` can't be measured.

### [Transform origin](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#transform-origin)

`transform-origin` has three shortcut values that can be set and animated individually:

*   `originX`

*   `originY`

*   `originZ`

If set as numbers, `originX` and `Y` default to a progress value between `0` and `1`. `originZ` defaults to pixels.

<motion.div style={{ originX: 0.5 }} />

### [CSS variables](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#css-variables)

Motion for React can animate CSS variables, and also use CSS variable definitions as animation targets.

#### [Animating CSS variables](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animating-css-variables)

Sometimes it's convenient to be able to animate a CSS variable to animate many children:

<motion.ul
  initial={{ '--rotate': '0deg' }}
  animate={{ '--rotate': '360deg' }}
  transition={{ duration: 2, repeat: Infinity }}
>
  <li style={{ transform: 'rotate(var(--rotate))' }} />
  <li style={{ transform: 'rotate(var(--rotate))' }} />
  <li style={{ transform: 'rotate(var(--rotate))' }} />
</motion.ul>

### [CSS variables as animation targets](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#css-variables-as-animation-targets)

HTML `motion` components accept animation targets with CSS variables:

<motion.li animate={{ backgroundColor: "var(--action-bg)" }} />

[Transitions](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#transitions)
------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, Motion will create appropriate transitions for snappy animations based on the type of value being animated.

For instance, physical properties like `x` or `scale` are animated with spring physics, whereas values like `opacity` or `color` are animated with duration-based easing curves.

However, you can define your own animations via [the](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions)`transition`[prop](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions).

<motion.div
  animate={{ x: 100 }}
  transition={{ ease: "easeOut", duration: 2 }}
/>

A default `transition` can be set for many components with the `MotionConfig`[component](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-config):

<MotionConfig transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}>
  <motion.div animate={{ opacity: 1 }} />

Or you can set a specific `transition` on any animation prop:

<motion.div
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  whileHover={{
    opacity: 0.7,
    // Specific transitions override default transitions
    transition: { duration: 0.3 }
  }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
/>

[Enter animations](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#enter-animations-1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a `motion` component is first created, it'll automatically animate to the values in `animate` if they're different from those initially rendered, which you can either do via CSS or via [the](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-value)`initial`[prop.](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-value)

<motion.li
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
/>

You can also disable the enter animation entirely by setting `initial={false}`. This will make the element render with the values defined in `animate`.

<motion.div initial={false} animate={{ y: 100 }} />

[Exit animations](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#exit-animations)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motion for React can animate elements as they're removed from the DOM.

In React, when a component is removed, it's usually removed instantly. Motion provides [the](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animate-presence)`AnimatePresence`[component](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animate-presence) which keeps elements in the DOM while they perform an animation defined with the `exit` prop.

<AnimatePresence>
  {isVisible && (
    <motion.div
      key="modal"
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    />
  )}
</AnimatePresence>

[Keyframes](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#keyframes)
--------------------------------------------------------------

So far, we've set animation props like `animate` and `exit` to single values, like `opacity: 0`.

This is great when we want to animate from the current value to a new value. But sometimes we want to animate through a **series of values**. In animation terms, these are called **keyframes**.

All animation props can accept keyframe arrays:

<motion.div animate={{ x: [0, 100, 0] }} />

When we animate to an array of values, the element will animate through each of these values in sequence.

In the previous example, we explicitly set the initial value as `0`. But we can also say "use the current value" by setting the first value to `null`.

<motion.div animate={{ x: [null, 100, 0] }} />

This way, if a keyframe animation is interrupting another animation, the transition will feel more natural.

### [Wildcard keyframes](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#wildcard-keyframes)

This `null` keyframe is called a **wildcard keyframe**. A wildcard keyframe simply takes the value before it (or the current value, if this is the first keyframe in the array).

Wildcard keyframes can be useful for holding a value mid-animation without having to repeat values.

<motion.div
  animate={{ x: [0, 100, null, 0 ] }}
  // same as x: [0, 100, 100, 0] but easier to maintain
/>

### [Keyframe timing](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#keyframe-timing)

By default, each keyframe is spaced evenly throughout the animation. You can override this by setting [the](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions#times)`times`[option](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions#times) via `transition`.

`times` is an array of progress values between `0` and `1`, defining where in the animation each keyframe should be positioned.

<motion.circle
  cx={500}
  animate={{
    cx: [null, 100, 200],
    transition: { duration: 3, times: [0, 0.2, 1] }
  }}
/>

`0` is the start of the animation, and `1` is the end of the animation. Therefore, `0.2` places this keyframe somewhere towards the start of the animation.

[Gesture animations](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#gesture-animations)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motion for React has animation props that can define how an element animates when it [recognises a gesture](https://motion.dev/docs/react-gestures).

Supported gestures are:

*   `whileHover`

*   `whileTap`

*   `whileFocus`

*   `whileDrag`

*   `whileInView`

When a gesture starts, it animates to the values defined in `while-`, and then when the gesture ends it animates back to the values in `initial` or `animate`.

<motion.button
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  whileHover={{ backgroundColor: "rgba(220, 220, 220, 1)" }}
  whileTap={{ backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)" }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1 }}
/>

The [custom Cursor component](https://motion.dev/) available in [Motion+](https://motion.dev/plus) takes this a step further with magnetic and target-morphing effects as a user hovers clickable targets (like buttons and links):

<Cursor magnetic />

[Variants](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#variants)
------------------------------------------------------------

The `animate` prop works well for single elements, but real interfaces often need coordinated animations across parent and child components. Variants solve this by defining named animation states that propagate through the component tree.

Variants are a set of named targets. These names can be anything.

const variants = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

Variants are passed to `motion` components via the `variants` prop:

<motion.div variants={variants} />

These variants can now be referred to by a label, wherever you can define an animation target:

<motion.div
  variants={variants}
  initial="hidden"
  whileInView="visible"
  exit="hidden"
/>

You can also define multiple variants via an array:

animate={["visible", "danger"]}

### [Propagation](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#propagation)

Variants are useful for reusing and combining animation targets. But it becomes powerful for orchestrating animations throughout trees.

Variants will flow down through `motion` components. So in this example when the `ul` enters the viewport, all of its children with a "visible" variant will also animate in:

const list = {
  visible: { opacity: 1 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
}

const item = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -100 },
}

return (
  <motion.ul
    initial="hidden"
    whileInView="visible"
    variants={list}
  >
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
    <motion.li variants={item} />
  </motion.ul>
)

### [Orchestration](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#orchestration)

By default, this children animations will start simultaneously with the parent. But with variants we gain access to new `transition` props `when`[and](https://motion.dev/docs/react-transitions#orchestration)`delayChildren`.

const list = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      when: "beforeChildren",
      delayChildren: stagger(0.3), // Stagger children by .3 seconds
    },
  },
  hidden: {
    opacity: 0,
    transition: {
      when: "afterChildren",
    },
  },
}

### [Dynamic variants](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#dynamic-variants)

Each variant can be defined as a function that resolves when a variant is made active.

const variants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: (index) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { delay: index * 0.3 }
  })
}

These functions are provided a single argument, which is passed via the `custom` prop:

items.map((item, index) => <motion.div custom={index} variants={variants} />)

This way, variants can be resolved differently for each animating element.

[Animation controls](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animation-controls)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Declarative animations via `animate` and `whileHover` cover most UI interactions. For cases that need sequencing, timeline scrubbing, or triggering animations from events outside React's render cycle, the `useAnimate`[hook](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-animate) provides imperative controls:

*   Animating any HTML/SVG element (not just `motion` components).

*   Complex animation sequences.

*   Controlling animations with `time`, `speed`, `play()`, `pause()` and other playback controls.

function MyComponent() {
  const [scope, animate] = useAnimate()

  useEffect(() => {
    const controls = animate([
      [scope.current, { x: "100%" }],
      ["li", { opacity: 1 }]
    ])

    controls.speed = 0.8

    return () => controls.stop()
  }, [])

  return (
    <ul ref={scope}>
      <li />
      <li />
      <li />
    </ul>
  )
}

[Animate content](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#animate-content)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

By passing [a](https://motion.dev/docs/react-motion-value)`MotionValue` as the child of a `motion` component, it will render its latest value in the HTML.

import { useMotionValue, motion, animate } from "motion/react"

function Counter() {
  const count = useMotionValue(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    const controls = animate(count, 100, { duration: 5 })
    return () => controls.stop()
  }, [])

  return <motion.pre>{count}</motion.pre>
}

This avoids React re-renders entirely. The `motion` component updates the DOM text node directly, making it suitable for high-frequency value changes like counters or live data.

It's also possible to [animate numbers](https://motion.dev/) with a ticking counter effect using the `AnimateNumber` component in [Motion+](https://motion.dev/plus) by passing them directly to the component:

<AnimateNumber>{value}</AnimateNumber>

[Next](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#next)
----------------------------------------------------

In this guide we've covered the basic kinds of animations we can perform in Motion using its **animation props**. However, there's much more to discover.

Most of the examples on this page have used HTML elements, but Motion also has unique [SVG animation](https://motion.dev/docs/react-svg-animation) features, like its simple line drawing API.

We've also only covered time-based animations, but Motion also provides powerful [scroll animation](https://motion.dev/docs/react-scroll-animations) features like `useScroll` and `whileInView`.

It also provides a powerful [layout animation](https://motion.dev/docs/react-layout-animations) engine, that can animate between any two layouts using performant transforms.

Finally, there's also a whole [Fundamentals examples category](https://motion.dev/examples?platform=react#fundamentals) that covers all the basics of animating with Motion for React with live demos and copy-paste code.
