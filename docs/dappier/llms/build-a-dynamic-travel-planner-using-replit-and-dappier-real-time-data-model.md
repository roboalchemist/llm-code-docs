## **Introduction**

In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through building a **Dynamic Travel Planner** using **Replit** and **Dappier's Real-Time Data Model API**. This app will generate a **customized travel itinerary** based on the **user's chosen destination** and **number of days**, providing **real-time weather updates, hotel deals, and local attractions**. By leveraging **OpenAI's LLMs** and **Dappier’s enriched real-time data**, users can generate **AI-powered travel plans** within minutes.

## **Dappier Real-Time Data Model API**

The **Dappier Real-Time Data Model API** enables applications to retrieve **verified and up-to-date** information from trusted sources across multiple domains, including **weather, finance, and news**. It allows seamless integration of real-time data into AI-powered applications.

### **Usage in Python**

The API can be used to fetch real-time data with a simple function call:

```python  theme={null}
response = app.search_real_time_data(
   query="What is the stock price of Apple?",
   ai_model_id="am_01j06ytn18ejftedz6dyhz2b15"
)
```

### **Parameters**

* **query (str)**: The user-provided search query. Example queries include:

  * `"How is the weather today in Austin, TX?"`
  * `"What is the latest news for Meta?"`
  * `"What is the stock price for AAPL?"`

* **ai\_model\_id (str)**: The AI model ID to use for the query.
  * AI model IDs always start with the prefix `"am_"`.
  * Multiple AI model IDs are available at the **Dappier Marketplace**.

In our **Dynamic Travel Planner**, we will use this API to fetch **weather updates and hotel deals** dynamically.
