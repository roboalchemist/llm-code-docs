## Build a Real-Time Newsletter Agent

Now that your API keys are set and packages are installed, you're ready to build the smart content curation agent.

Start by importing the required modules:

```python Python theme={null}
import asyncio
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.tools.dappier import DappierAIRecommendationsToolSpec
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentWorkflow
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentStream, ToolCallResult
```

Initialize the OpenAI model that will power the agent:

```python Python theme={null}
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
```

Next, set up the Dappier AI recommendations tool:

```python Python theme={null}
recommend_tool_spec = DappierAIRecommendationsToolSpec()
tools = recommend_tool_spec.to_tool_list()
```

Now define the agent workflow. In this case, the agent acts as a real-time newsletter curator:

```python Python theme={null}
workflow = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    tools,
    llm=llm,
    system_prompt="""
    You are a Smart Content Curator for a newsletter.

    Your job is to:
    - Fetch real-time trending sports news, lifestyle updates, and pet care articles
    - Organize them into clear sections: Sports, Lifestyle, Pet Care
    - Include concise summaries and source links
    - Explain why each item is relevant or popular
    """,
)
```

To stream the results from the agent and display both tool interactions and the generated content, run the following:

```python Python theme={null}
async def run_newsletter_bot():
    handler = workflow.run(user_msg=user_prompt)

    seen_agent_output = False

    async for event in handler.stream_events():
        if isinstance(event, AgentStream):
            if not seen_agent_output:
                print("[🧠 Newsletter Bot]:", end="", flush=True)
                seen_agent_output = True
            print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)
        elif isinstance(event, ToolCallResult):
            seen_agent_output = False
            print(f"\n\n🔧 Tool Used: {event.tool_name}")
            print(f"➡️  Input Args: {event.tool_kwargs}")
            print(f"✅ Output: {event.tool_output}\n")
```

Finally, launch the agent:

```python Python theme={null}
user_prompt = """
Generate today's newsletter content. 
Include:
- Top 5 trending sports stories (from get_sports_news_recommendations)
- Top 5 lifestyle articles (from get_lifestyle_news_recommendations)

Organize them into sections: Sports, Lifestyle, Pet Care.
For each item, include:

- One-line explanation of why it’s relevant or interesting today
"""

await run_newsletter_bot()

Summary: "Locked" is a thriller featuring Eddie, played by Bill Skarsgard, who becomes trapped in a luxury SUV after attempting petty theft due to financial desperation. As he struggles to escape, he faces psychological torment from his captor, William, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, who observes Eddie through hidden cameras. The film shifts focus from socioeconomic themes to the psychological dynamics between the captor and the captive, emphasizing desperation and survival.

Inspired by the Argentinian film "4×4," "Locked" diverges in narrative and character development, presenting both Eddie and William as deeply flawed individuals. The film explores themes of violence and selfishness, with Eddie's ordeal leading to a newfound appreciation for life. While it draws comparisons to the "Saw" series and Steven Knight's "Locke," "Locked" offers a unique psychological experience, ultimately providing a darkly entertaining commentary on flawed humanity and the consequences of one's actions.

Summary: Anthony Duclair, currently with the New York Islanders, is taking time off from the team after receiving criticism from head coach Patrick Roy for his poor performance in a recent game. Duclair's request for time to reflect comes as the Islanders struggle to secure a playoff spot, sitting at 32-32-10 with only eight games remaining in the season. His performance has been disappointing, with just 11 points this season and a recent stretch of six games without a point.

Roy's harsh assessment highlighted Duclair's lack of effort, leading to his replacement in the lineup. Signed to a four-year, $14 million contract, Duclair's season has been marred by injury and underperformance, raising questions about his future in the league. Despite a career that includes an All-Star selection and a high-scoring season, his time with the Islanders is viewed as unsuccessful, complicating his potential moves due to a no-trade clause.
