# Configuration File

The API7 Ingress Controller uses a configuration file `config.yaml` to define core settings such as log level, leader election behavior, metrics endpoints, and sync intervals.

Configurations are defined in a Kubernetes ConfigMap and mounted into the controller pod as a file at runtime. It is recommended to manage these configurations through Helm for easier updates and version control. If you modify the ConfigMap directly, you must restart the controller Deployment to apply the changes.

Below are all available configuration options, including their default values and usage:

config.yaml

```
log_level: "info"                               # The log level of the APISIX Ingress Controller.
