### QUANTIZATION

This uses Groq's TruePoint Numerics, which reduces precision only in areas that don't affect accuracy, preserving quality while delivering significant speedup over traditional approaches. [Learn more here](https://groq.com/blog/inside-the-lpu-deconstructing-groq-speed).

### [Key Technical Specifications](#key-technical-specifications)

### Model Architecture

Built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 120B total parameters (5.1B active per forward pass). Features 36 layers with 128 MoE experts using Top-4 routing per token. Equipped with Grouped Query Attention and rotary embeddings, using RMSNorm pre-layer normalization with 2880 residual width.

### Performance Metrics

The GPT-OSS 120B model demonstrates exceptional performance across key benchmarks:

* MMLU (General Reasoning): 90.0%
* SWE-Bench Verified (Coding): 62.4%
* HealthBench Realistic (Health): 57.6%
* MMMLU (Multilingual): 81.3% average

### Use Cases

Frontier-Grade Agentic Applications

Deploy for high-capability autonomous agents with advanced reasoning, tool use, and multi-step problem solving that matches proprietary model performance.

Advanced Research & Scientific Computing

Ideal for research applications requiring robust health knowledge, biosecurity analysis, and scientific reasoning with strong safety alignment.

High-Accuracy Mathematical & Coding Tasks

Excels at competitive programming, complex mathematical reasoning, and software engineering tasks with state-of-the-art benchmark performance.

Multilingual AI Assistants

Build sophisticated multilingual applications with strong performance across 81+ languages and cultural contexts.

### Best Practices

* Utilize variable reasoning modes (low, medium, high) to balance performance and latency based on your specific use case requirements.
* Leverage the Harmony chat format with proper role hierarchy (System > Developer > User > Assistant) for optimal instruction following and safety compliance.
* Take advantage of the model's preparedness testing for biosecurity and alignment research while respecting safety boundaries.
* Use the full 131K context window for complex, multi-step workflows and comprehensive document analysis.
* Structure tool definitions clearly when using web browsing, Python execution, or function calling capabilities for best results.
