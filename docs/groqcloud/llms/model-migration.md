# Model Migration Guide

Migrating prompts from commercial models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) to open-source ones like Llama often requires explicitly including instructions that might have been implicitly handled in proprietary systems. This migration typically involves adjusting prompting techniques to be more explicit, matching generation parameters, and testing outputs to help with iteratively adjust prompts until the desired outputs are reached.

## [Migration Principles](#migration-principles)

1. **Surface hidden rules:** Proprietary model providers prepend their closed-source models with system messages that are not explicitly shared with the end user; you must create clear system messages to get consistent outputs.
2. **Start from parity, not aspiration:** Match parameters such as temperature, Top P, and max tokens first, then focus on adjusting your prompts.
3. **Automate the feedback loop:** We recommend using open-source tooling like prompt optimizers instead of manual trial-and-error.

## [Aligning System Behavior and Tone](#aligning-system-behavior-and-tone)

Closed-source models are often prepended with elaborate system prompts that enforce politeness, hedging, legal disclaimers, policies, and more, that are not shown to the end user. To ensure consistency and lead open-source models to generate desired outputs, create a comprehensive system prompt:

curl

```
You are a courteous support agent for AcmeCo.
Always greet with "Certainly: here's the information you requested:".
Refuse medical or legal advice; direct users to professionals.
```

## [Sampling / Parameter Parity](#sampling--parameter-parity)

No matter which model you're migrating from, having explicit control over temperature and other sampling parameters matters a lot. First, determine what temperature your source model defaults to (often 1.0). Then experiment to find what works best for your specific use case - many Llama deployments see better results with temperatures between 0.2-0.4\. The key is to start with parity, measure the results, then adjust deliberately:

| Parameter   | Closed-Source Models | Llama Models | Suggested Adjustments                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| temperature | 1.0                  | 0.7          | Lower for factual answers and strict schema adherence (eg. JSON) |
| top\_p      | 1.0                  | 1.0          | leave 1.0                                                        |

## [Refactoring Prompts](#refactoring-prompts)

In some cases, you'll need to refactor your prompts to use explicit [Prompt Patterns](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns) since different models have varying pre- and post-training that can affect how they function. For example:

* Some models, such as [those that can reason](https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning), might naturally break down complex problems, while others may need explicit instructions to "think step by step" using [Chain of Thought](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-thought) prompting
* Where some models automatically verify facts, others might need [Chain of Verification](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-verification-cove) to achieve similar accuracy
* When certain models explore multiple solution paths by default, you can achieve similar results with [Self-Consistency](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns#self-consistency) voting across multiple completions
  
The key is being more explicit about the reasoning process you want. Instead of:

curl

```
"Calculate the compound interest over 5 years"
```

Use:

curl

```
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, write out the compound interest formula
2. Then, plug in our values
3. Calculate each year's interest separately
4. Sum the total and verify the math"
```

This explicit guidance helps open models match the sophisticated reasoning that closed models learn through additional training.
