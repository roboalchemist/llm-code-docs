### QUANTIZATION

This uses Groq's TruePoint Numerics, which reduces precision only in areas that don't affect accuracy, preserving quality while delivering significant speedup over traditional approaches. [Learn more here](https://groq.com/blog/inside-the-lpu-deconstructing-groq-speed).

### [Key Technical Specifications](#key-technical-specifications)

### Model Architecture

Built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 20B total parameters (3.6B active per forward pass). Features 24 layers with 32 MoE experts using Top-4 routing per token. Equipped with Grouped Query Attention (8 K/V heads, 64 Q heads) with rotary embeddings and RMSNorm pre-layer normalization.

### Performance Metrics

The GPT-OSS 20B model demonstrates exceptional performance across key benchmarks:

* MMLU (General Reasoning): 85.3%
* SWE-Bench Verified (Coding): 60.7%
* AIME 2025 (Math with tools): 98.7%
* MMMLU (Multilingual): 75.7% average

### Use Cases

Low-Latency Agentic Applications

Ideal for cost-efficient deployment in agentic workflows with advanced tool calling capabilities including web browsing, Python execution, and function calling.

Affordable Reasoning & Coding

Provides strong performance in coding, reasoning, and multilingual tasks while maintaining a small memory footprint for budget-conscious deployments.

Tool-Augmented Applications

Excels at applications requiring browser integration, Python code execution, and structured function calling with variable reasoning modes.

Long-Context Processing

Supports up to 131K context length for processing large documents and maintaining conversation history in complex workflows.

### Best Practices

* Utilize variable reasoning modes (low, medium, high) to balance performance and latency based on your specific use case requirements.
* Provide clear, detailed tool and function definitions with explicit parameters, expected outputs, and constraints for optimal tool use performance.
* Structure complex tasks into clear steps to leverage the model's agentic reasoning capabilities effectively.
* Use the full 128K context window for complex, multi-step workflows and comprehensive documentation analysis.
* Leverage the model's multilingual capabilities by clearly specifying the target language and cultural context when needed.
