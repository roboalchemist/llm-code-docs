Title: Entity Properties - EF Core

URL Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties

Markdown Content:
Each entity type in your model has a set of properties, which EF Core will read and write from the database. If you're using a relational database, entity properties map to table columns.

By [convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/#built-in-conventions), all public properties with a getter and a setter will be included in the model.

Specific properties can be excluded as follows:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_1_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_1_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }

    [NotMapped]
    public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }
}
```

By convention, when using a relational database, entity properties are mapped to table columns having the same name as the property.

If you prefer to configure your columns with different names, you can do so as following code snippet:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_2_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_2_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    [Column("blog_id")]
    public int BlogId { get; set; }

    public string Url { get; set; }
}
```

When using a relational database, the database provider selects a data type based on the .NET type of the property. It also takes into account other metadata, such as the configured [maximum length](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#maximum-length), whether the property is part of a primary key, etc.

For example, the SQL Server provider maps `DateTime` properties to `datetime2(7)` columns, and `string` properties to `nvarchar(max)` columns (or to `nvarchar(450)` for properties that are used as a key).

You can also configure your columns to specify an exact data type for a column. For example, the following code configures `Url` as a non-unicode string with maximum length of `200` and `Rating` as decimal with precision of `5` and scale of `2`:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_3_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_3_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }

    [Column(TypeName = "varchar(200)")]
    public string Url { get; set; }

    [Column(TypeName = "decimal(5, 2)")]
    public decimal Rating { get; set; }
}
```

Configuring a maximum length provides a hint to the database provider about the appropriate column data type to choose for a given property. Maximum length only applies to array data types, such as `string` and `byte[]`.

Note

Entity Framework does not do any validation of maximum length before passing data to the provider. It is up to the provider or data store to validate if appropriate. For example, when targeting SQL Server, exceeding the maximum length will result in an exception as the data type of the underlying column will not allow excess data to be stored.

In the following example, configuring a maximum length of 500 will cause a column of type `nvarchar(500)` to be created on SQL Server:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_4_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_4_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }

    [MaxLength(500)]
    public string Url { get; set; }
}
```

Some relational data types support the precision and scale facets; these control what values can be stored, and how much storage is needed for the column. Which data types support precision and scale is database-dependent, but in most databases `decimal` and `DateTime` types do support these facets. For `decimal` properties, precision defines the maximum number of digits needed to express any value the column will contain, and scale defines the maximum number of decimal places needed. For `DateTime` properties, precision defines the maximum number of digits needed to express fractions of seconds, and scale is not used.

Note

Entity Framework does not do any validation of precision or scale before passing data to the provider. It is up to the provider or data store to validate as appropriate. For example, when targeting SQL Server, a column of data type `datetime` does not allow the precision to be set, whereas a `datetime2` one can have precision between 0 and 7 inclusive.

In the following example, configuring the `Score` property to have precision 14 and scale 2 will cause a column of type `decimal(14,2)` to be created on SQL Server, and configuring the `LastUpdated` property to have precision 3 will cause a column of type `datetime2(3)`:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_5_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_5_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    [Precision(14, 2)]
    public decimal Score { get; set; }
    [Precision(3)]
    public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
}
```

Scale is never defined without first defining precision, so the Data Annotation for defining the scale is `[Precision(precision, scale)]`.

In some relational databases, different types exist to represent Unicode and non-Unicode text data. For example, in SQL Server, `nvarchar(x)` is used to represent Unicode data in UTF-16, while `varchar(x)` is used to represent non-Unicode data (but see the notes on [SQL Server UTF-8 support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/sql-server/columns#unicode-and-utf-8)). For databases which don't support this concept, configuring this has no effect.

Text properties are configured as Unicode by default. You can configure a column as non-Unicode as follows:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_6_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_6_fluent-api)

```
public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Unicode(false)]
    [MaxLength(22)]
    public string Isbn { get; set; }
}
```

A property is considered optional if it is valid for it to contain `null`. If `null` is not a valid value to be assigned to a property then it is considered to be a required property. When mapping to a relational database schema, required properties are created as non-nullable columns, and optional properties are created as nullable columns.

By convention, a property whose .NET type can contain null will be configured as optional, whereas properties whose .NET type cannot contain null will be configured as required. For example, all properties with .NET value types (`int`, `decimal`, `bool`, etc.) are configured as required, and all properties with nullable .NET value types (`int?`, `decimal?`, `bool?`, etc.) are configured as optional.

C# [nullable reference types (NRT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/nullable-reference-types) allow reference types to be annotated, indicating whether it is valid for them to contain null or not. This feature is enabled by default in new project templates, but remains disabled in existing projects unless explicitly opted into. Nullable reference types affect EF Core's behavior in the following way:

*   If nullable reference types are disabled, all properties with .NET reference types are configured as optional by convention (for example, `string`).
*   If nullable reference types are enabled, properties will be configured based on the C# nullability of their .NET type: `string?` will be configured as optional, but `string` will be configured as required.

The following example shows an entity type with required and optional properties, with the nullable reference feature disabled and enabled:

*   [With NRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_7_with-nrt)
*   [Without NRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_7_without-nrt)

```
public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; } // Required by convention
    public string LastName { get; set; } // Required by convention
    public string? MiddleName { get; set; } // Optional by convention

    // Note the following use of constructor binding, which avoids compiled warnings
    // for uninitialized non-nullable properties.
    public Customer(string firstName, string lastName, string? middleName = null)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
        MiddleName = middleName;
    }
}
```

Using nullable reference types is recommended since it flows the nullability expressed in C# code to EF Core's model and to the database, and obviates the use of the Fluent API or Data Annotations to express the same concept twice.

Note

Exercise caution when enabling nullable reference types on an existing project: reference type properties which were previously configured as optional will now be configured as required, unless they are explicitly annotated to be nullable. When managing a relational database schema, this may cause migrations to be generated which alter the database column's nullability.

For more information on nullable reference types and how to use them with EF Core, [see the dedicated documentation page for this feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/nullable-reference-types).

A property that would be optional by convention can be configured to be required as follows:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_8_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_8_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string Url { get; set; }
}
```

A collation can be defined on text columns, determining how they are compared and ordered. For example, the following code snippet configures a SQL Server column to be case-insensitive:

```
modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().Property(c => c.Name)
    .UseCollation("SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS");
```

If all columns in a database need to use a certain collation, define the collation at the database level instead.

General information about EF Core support for collations can be found in the [collation documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/collations-and-case-sensitivity).

You can set an arbitrary text comment that gets set on the database column, allowing you to document your schema in the database:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_9_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_9_fluent-api)

```
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }

    [Comment("The URL of the blog")]
    public string Url { get; set; }
}
```

By default when creating a table with [Migrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/), EF Core orders primary key columns first, followed by properties of the entity type and owned types, and finally properties from base types. You can, however, specify a different column order:

*   [Data Annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_10_data-annotations)
*   [Fluent API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/entity-properties#tabpanel_10_fluent-api)

```
public class EntityBase
{
    [Column(Order = 0)]
    public int Id { get; set; }
}

public class PersonBase : EntityBase
{
    [Column(Order = 1)]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [Column(Order = 2)]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public class Employee : PersonBase
{
    public string Department { get; set; }
    public decimal AnnualSalary { get; set; }
}
```

The Fluent API can be used to override ordering made with attributes, including resolving any conflicts when attributes on different properties specify the same order number.

Note that, in the general case, most databases only support ordering columns when the table is created. This means that the column order attribute cannot be used to re-order columns in an existing table.
