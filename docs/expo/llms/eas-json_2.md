# Configure EAS Submit with eas.json

Learn how to configure your project for EAS Submit with eas.json.

**eas.json** is the configuration file for EAS CLI and services. It is generated when the [`eas build:configure` command](/build/setup#configure-the-project) runs for the first time in your project and is located next to **package.json** at the root of your project. Even though **eas.json** is not mandatory for using EAS Submit, it makes your life easier if you need to switch between different configurations.

## Production profile

Running `eas submit` without specifying a profile name will use the `production` profile if it is already defined in **eas.json** to configure the submission. If no values exist in the `production` profile, EAS CLI will prompt you to provide the values interactively.

The `production` profile shown below is required to run Android and iOS submissions in a CI/CD process, like with [EAS Workflows](/eas/workflows/introduction):

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 0.34.0"
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "track": "internal"
      },
      "ios": {
        "ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-app-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Learn more about the values you can set with the [Android specific options](/eas/json#android-specific-options-1) and the [iOS specific options](/eas/json#ios-specific-options-1). You can also learn how to submit to the [Apple App Store](/submit/ios) and the [Google Play Store](/submit/android).

## Multiple profiles

The JSON object under `submit` can contain multiple submit profiles. Each profile under `submit` can have an arbitrary name as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "SEMVER_RANGE",
    "requireCommit": boolean
  },
  "build": {
    // EAS Build configuration
    ... 
  },
  "submit": {
    "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_1": {
      "android": {
        ...ANDROID_OPTIONS
      },
      "ios": {
        ...IOS_OPTIONS
      }
    },
    "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_2": {
      "extends": "SUBMIT_PROFILE_NAME_1",
      "android": {
        ...ANDROID_OPTIONS
      }
    },
    ... 
  }
}
```

When you select a build for submission, it chooses the profile that is used for the selected build. If the profile does not exist, it selects the default `production` profile.

You can also use EAS CLI to pick up another `submit` profile by specifying it with a parameter, for example:

```sh
eas submit --platform ios --profile
```

## Share configuration between `submit` profiles

A `submit` profile can extend another profile using the `extends` key.

For example, in the `preview` profile you may have `"extends": "production"`. This makes the `preview` profile inherit the configuration of the `production` profile.

You can keep chaining profile extensions up to the depth of 5 as long as you avoid making circular dependencies.
