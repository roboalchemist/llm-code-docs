# Expo DevClient

A library that allows creating a development build and includes useful development tools.
Android, iOS, tvOS

`expo-dev-client` adds various useful development tools to your debug builds:

-   A configurable launcher UI, so you can launch updates (such as from [PR previews](/develop/development-builds/development-workflows#pr-previews)) and switch between development servers without needing to recompile the native app
-   Improved debugging tools (such as support for [inspecting network requests](/debugging/tools#inspecting-network-requests))
-   [A powerful and extensible developer menu UI](/debugging/tools#developer-menu)

Expo documentation refers to debug builds that include `expo-dev-client` as [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), start by installing [`expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the instructions from [Install `expo-dev-client` in an existing React Native project](/bare/install-dev-builds-in-bare).

## Configuration in app config

You can configure development client launcher using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-dev-client",
        {
          "launchMode": "most-recent"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen.
-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.

 |
| `addGeneratedScheme` | `true` | By default, `expo-dev-client` will register a custom URL scheme to open a project. Set this property to `false` to disable this scheme. |
| `android.launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Only for: Android. Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen on Android. Overrides the top-level `launchMode` setting for Android only.

-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.

 |
| `ios.launchMode` | `"most-recent"` | Only for: iOS. Determines whether to launch the most recently opened project or navigate to the launcher screen on iOS. Overrides the top-level `launchMode` setting for iOS only.

-   `most-recent` - Attempt to launch directly into a previously opened project and if unable to connect, fall back to the launcher screen.
-   `launcher` - Opens the launcher screen.
