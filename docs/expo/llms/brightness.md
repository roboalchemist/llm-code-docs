# Expo Brightness

A library that provides access to an API for getting and setting the screen brightness.
Android, iOS, Included in Expo Go

An API to get and set screen brightness.

On Android, there is a global system-wide brightness setting, and each app has its own brightness setting that can optionally override the global setting. It is possible to set either of these values with this API. On iOS, the system brightness setting cannot be changed programmatically; instead, any changes to the screen brightness will persist until the device is locked or powered off.

## Installation

```sh
npx expo install expo-brightness
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native **android** project manually, then you need to add the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` permission to the **AndroidManifest.xml** file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync();
      if (status === 'granted') {
        Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(1);
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Brightness Module Example</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

## API

```js
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';
```

## Hooks

### `usePermissions(options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `options`(optional) | `PermissionHookOptions<object>` |

  

Check or request permissions to modify the system brightness. This uses both `requestPermissionAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.

Returns: `[PermissionResponse | null, RequestPermissionMethod<permissionresponse>, GetPermissionMethod]</permissionresponse>`

Example

```ts
const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = Brightness.usePermissions();
```

## Methods

### `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Gets the current brightness level of the device's main screen.

Returns: `Promise<number>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Checks user's permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](#permissionresponse).

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Gets the global system screen brightness.

Returns: `Promise<number>`

A `Promise` that is resolved with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current system screen brightness.

### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessModeAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Gets the system brightness mode (e.g. whether or not the OS will automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on ambient light).

Returns: `Promise<brightnessmode>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with a [`BrightnessMode`](#brightnessmode). Requires `SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

### `Brightness.isAvailableAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Returns whether the Brightness API is enabled on the current device. This does not check the app permissions.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

Async `boolean`, indicating whether the Brightness API is available on the current device. Currently this resolves `true` on iOS and Android only.

### `Brightness.isUsingSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Returns a boolean specifying whether or not the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value.

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`

A `Promise` that fulfils with `true` when the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value, and `false` otherwise.

### `Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing system brightness.

Returns: `Promise<permissionresponse>`

A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](#permissionresponse).

### `Brightness.restoreSystemBrightnessAsync()`

Supported platforms: Android.

Resets the brightness setting of the current activity to use the system-wide brightness value rather than overriding it.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the setting has been successfully changed.

### `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brightnessValue` | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness. |

  

Sets the current screen brightness. On iOS, this setting will persist until the device is locked, after which the screen brightness will revert to the user's default setting. On Android, this setting only applies to the current activity; it will override the system brightness value whenever your app is in the foreground.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

### `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brightnessValue` | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the desired screen brightness. |

  

Sets the global system screen brightness and changes the brightness mode to `MANUAL`. Requires `SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permissions.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.

### `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessModeAsync(brightnessMode)`

Supported platforms: Android.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brightnessMode` | [BrightnessMode](#brightnessmode) | One of `BrightnessMode.MANUAL` or `BrightnessMode.AUTOMATIC`. The system brightness mode cannot be set to `BrightnessMode.UNKNOWN`. |

  

Sets the system brightness mode.

Returns: `Promise<void>`

## Event Subscriptions

### `Brightness.addBrightnessListener(listener)`

Supported platforms: iOS.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listener` | (event: [BrightnessEvent](#brightnessevent)) => void | A callback that is invoked when brightness (iOS) changes. The callback is provided a single argument that is an object with a `brightness` key. |

  

Subscribe to brightness (iOS) updates. The event fires whenever the power mode is toggled.

On web and android the event never fires.

Returns: `EventSubscription`

A `Subscription` object on which you can call `remove()` to unsubscribe from the listener.

## Types

### `BrightnessEvent`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightness | `number` | A number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current screen brightness. |

### `PermissionExpiration`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Literal Type: `union`

Permission expiration time. Currently, all permissions are granted permanently.

Acceptable values are: `'never'` | `number`

### `PermissionHookOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

Literal Type: `union`

Acceptable values are: `PermissionHookBehavior` | `Options`

### `PermissionResponse`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS.

An object obtained by permissions get and request functions.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| canAskAgain | `boolean` | Indicates if user can be asked again for specific permission. If not, one should be directed to the Settings app in order to enable/disable the permission. |
