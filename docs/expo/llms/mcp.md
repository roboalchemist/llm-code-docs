# Using Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Expo

A guide on integrating Model Context Protocol with Expo projects to enhance AI model capabilities.

> Expo MCP Server requires an [EAS paid plan](https://expo.dev/pricing).

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a standard protocol that allows AI models to integrate with external data sources, providing enhanced context for more precise responses. It enables AI-assisted tools like agents to understand your development environment more deeply, allowing them to provide better assistance with your codebase.

Expo MCP Server is a remote MCP server hosted by Expo that integrates with popular AI-assisted tools such as Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and others, enabling them to interact directly with your Expo projects.

[Introducing Expo MCP Server: for accurate, context-aware AI responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp9dpIgDxZQ) — Enhance your AI-assisted tools for building apps with Expo.

## What does Expo MCP Server do?

Expo MCP Server teaches your AI-assisted tools about the Expo SDK and lets them interact with mobile simulators and the React Native DevTools. These are three examples of the tasks Expo MCP Server enhances:

**Learn about developing with Expo.** Your AI-assisted tools can fetch the latest official Expo documentation on demand and use it to reply to prompts like:

-   "Add [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)/CLAUDE.md to my project"
-   "How do I use Expo Router?"
-   "Search the Expo docs for implementing deep linking"
-   "What is Expo CNG?"

**Manage dependencies.** Expo MCP Server guides you toward installing our recommended packages and uses `npx expo install` to install known, compatible versions.

-   "Add SQLite with basic CRUD operations"
-   "Install `expo-camera` and show me how to take photos"
-   "Add `expo-notifications` for push notifications"

**Automate visual verification and testing.** Multimodal AI-assisted tools can screenshot and interact with your running app in a simulator. Expo MCP Server includes local capabilities enabled by adding the `expo-mcp` package to your project's dependencies.

-   "Add a blue circle view and make sure it renders correctly"
-   "Add a button and tap it to verify the interaction works"
-   "Add a counter button that increments on tap and verify the state updates correctly"

Your AI-assisted tools can autonomously write the code, capture screenshots to verify the UI is correct, test interactions, and fix issues they find.

The complete table of [MCP capabilities](/eas/ai/mcp#available-mcp-capabilities) documents the tools and prompts Expo MCP Server provides to AI-assisted tools.

## Prerequisites

Before using Expo MCP Server, ensure you have:

-   An Expo account with an EAS paid plan
-   An Expo project created either with `npx create-expo-app@latest --template default@sdk-55` or has the latest `expo` package version installed
-   AI-assisted tools with remote MCP server support (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and so on)

## Installation and setup

### Install Expo MCP Server

Expo MCP Server supports integration with various AI-assisted tools. Use the general settings below or expand your specific tool for detailed instructions:

-   **Server type**: Streamable HTTP
-   **URL**: `https://mcp.expo.dev/mcp`
-   **Authentication**: OAuth

Claude Code setup

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http expo-mcp https://mcp.expo.dev/mcp
```

After installation, run `/mcp` in your Claude Code session to authenticate.

Cursor setup

Click the following link to install the MCP server for Cursor:

VS Code setup

1.  Open Command Palette (Cmd ⌘ + Shift + P or Ctrl + Shift + P)
2.  Run **MCP: Add Server**
3.  Select **HTTP**
4.  Enter the server details:
    -   **URL**: `https://mcp.expo.dev/mcp`
    -   **Name**: expo-mcp

Codex setup

```sh
codex mcp add expo-mcp --url https://mcp.expo.dev/mcp
```

The above command adds the MCP server to your Codex configuration file and prompts you to authenticate with your Expo account.

### Authenticate with Expo

After installing the MCP server, you'll need to authenticate using one of two methods:

#### Access token (recommended)

Generate a **Personal access token** from your Expo account and use it during the OAuth flow.

-   To generate an access token, open [Access tokens](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/access-tokens) settings page in EAS dashboard.
-   Under **Personal access tokens**, click **Create token**. Copy the token and use it during the OAuth flow.

#### Credentials

Use your Expo account username and password. In this case, the server will generate an access token automatically.

### Set up local capabilities (Recommended)

> Local capabilities are only available in **SDK 54 and later**.

For the full MCP experience with advanced features like taking screenshots from your iOS Simulator, opening DevTools, and automation capabilities, set up a local Expo development server:

```sh
cd /path/to/your-project
npx expo install expo-mcp --dev
npx expo whoami || npx expo login
EXPO_UNSTABLE_MCP_SERVER=1 npx expo start
```

> Whenever you start or stop the development server, you need to **reconnect or restart** your MCP server connection in your AI-assisted tool to ensure the AI-assisted tool gets refreshed capabilities.

## Server capabilities versus local capabilities

Expo MCP Server provides two types of capabilities depending on your setup:

### Server capabilities

Server capabilities are available with just the remote MCP server connection, without needing to set up a local development server. The **generate_agents_md** tool is an example of a server capability.

### Local capabilities

Local capabilities require a local Expo development server to be running and provide advanced features that interact with your local development environment:

-   **Automation tools**: Take screenshots, tap views, find elements by testID
-   **Development tools**: Open React Native DevTools
-   **Project analysis**: Generate `expo-router` sitemap

These capabilities enable more sophisticated workflows like automated testing, visual verification, and deeper project introspection. To use local capabilities, you will need to follow the [Set up local capabilities](/eas/ai/mcp#set-up-local-capabilities-recommended) section above.

## Available MCP capabilities

> The MCP capabilities are subject to change from the `expo-mcp` package updates or MCP server changes. The following list is a reference and may not be up to date.
