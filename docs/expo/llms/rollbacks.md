# Rollbacks

Rollback a branch to a previous update or the embedded update.

There are two types of rollbacks supported by EAS Update:

-   Roll back to a previously-published update.
-   Roll back to the update embedded in the build.

## Start a rollback

To start a rollback, run the following command:

```sh
eas update:rollback
```

In the terminal, an interactive guide will assist you in selecting the type of rollback and doing the rollback.

## Rolling back to a previously-published update

The above command re-publishes a previously-published update to functionally roll back clients to that update.

## Rolling back to the update embedded in the build

The above command instructs the client to run the update embedded in the build.

## Publishing after the rollback

Upon publishing again after a rollback, all clients will receive the new update.
