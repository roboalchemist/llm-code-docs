# 🔒 Private Analyses

Private file's analyses

A *Private Analysis* object represents an analysis of a private file submitted to VirusTotal. This analysis can only be seen by the user that submitted it.

## Object attributes

A Private Analysis object contains the following attributes:

* `date`: <*integer*> analysis date (UTC timestamp).
* `status`: <*string*> analysis status. Possible values are:
  * "queued" (the analysis is waiting to be analysed).
  * "in-progress" (the analysis is currently in progress).
  * "completed" (the analysis is finished).
* `pending_stages`: <*dictionary*> stages of the analysis currently running. The values of the dictionary contains an explanation of the stage name, for example:

```json
{
  "Zenbox": "Sandbox analysis from Zenbox (queued)",
  "tools": "File's tools"
}
```

* `sandbox_configuration`: <*dictionary*> sandbox parameters specified for the analysis (enable\_internet and command\_line).
* `sandbox_status`: <*dictionary*> similar to `pending_stages` but includes a detailed status of the sandboxes executions triggered by the analysis. These statuses can give more info as well about failed sandbox executions due to a missing dependency or if the file is an incompatible file type. An example of `sandbox_status` is:

```json
{
  "Zenbox": {
    "in_progress_percent": 2,
    "status": "enqueueing"
  },
  "VirusTotal Jujubox": {
    "status": "unsupported file type",
    "message": "incompatible file",
    "in_progress_percent": 100
  },
  "VirusTotal R2DBox": {
    "status": "finished",
    "in_progress_percent": 100
  }
}
```

## Meta

Additionally, once the analysis is processed you can get additional information about the enqueued file along with the analysis:

* `file_info`: <*dictionary*> it contains the following keys:
  * `size`: <*integer*> size of the file in bytes.
  * `sha256`: <*string*> file's SHA-256 hash.
  * `sha1`: <*string*> file's SHA-1 hash.
  * `md5`: <*string*> file's MD-5 hash.

## Relationships

In addition to the previously described attributes, private analyses objects contain relationships with other objects in our dataset that can be retrieved as explained in the [Relationships](https://virustotal.readme.io/reference/relationships)  section.

The following table shows a summary of available relationships.

| Relationship | Return object type                         |
