# Attack Tactics

Information about attack tactics

An attack tactic object represents a MITRE ATT\&CK's adversary tactic.\
The ID of these objects are equivalent to their corresponding ATT\&CK Tactic's ID (e.g. [TA0043](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/))

## Object attributes

An Attack Tactic object contains the following attributes:

* `creation_date`: <*integer*> creation date of the tactic (UTC timestamp).
* `description`: <*string*> tactic's description.
* `last_modification_date`: <*integer*> date when the tactic was last updated (UTC timestamp).
* `link`: <*string*>: URL of the tactic on MITRE's website.
* `name`: <*string*>: Tactic's name.
* `stix_id`: <*string*>: Tactic's STIX ID.
