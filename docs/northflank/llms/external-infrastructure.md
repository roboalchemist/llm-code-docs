# Manage external infrastructure

Northflank provides a robust mechanism for provisioning and managing external
infrastructure directly within your own cloud environment through the use of
OpenTofu modules. OpenTofu is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool,
and Northflank integrates this capability by allowing OpenTofu modules to be
embedded as template nodes within Northflank templates.

These OpenTofu nodes can be added to any existing or new Northflank template,
enabling teams to automate the deployment of external infrastructure
components—such as databases, object storage, and other cloud
services—alongside application and service configuration. This infrastructure
is created and managed within your own cloud accounts.

Once the OpenTofu module is added to a template and configured, Northflank
takes responsibility for executing the module, managing its life cycle, and
securely storing the Terraform state between runs. This allows infrastructure
management integrated directly into your Northflank workflows.

The process of creating and configuring an OpenTofu node is consistent with how
other template nodes are added in Northflank. This documentation will guide you
through a complete example that demonstrates how to use an OpenTofu module to
provision an AWS S3 bucket.

You should understand how to [create a new template](create-a-template) and
[use other cloud
providers](../bring-your-own-cloud/use-other-cloud-providers-with-northflank)
before reading this section.

## Add provider integration to Northflank

Northflank OpenTofu nodes will require credentials to access upstream
providers. These are described in detail in [use other cloud
providers](../bring-your-own-cloud/use-other-cloud-providers-with-northflank).

> [!note] 
> Northflank OpenTofu nodes currently do not support cross account roles. Make
sure to setup a provider integration with direct credentials.

1. Navigate to your Northflank account settings and open the clusters page

2. [Create a new cloud provider integration](https://app.northflank.com/s/account/cloud/clusters/integrations/new/aws)

3. Select Amazon Web Services as the provider and choose the OpenTofu feature

4. Open your
  [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home),
  open the users page and create a new user without console access.
  Skip the remaining steps and save the user.

5. In the new user click add permissions and the required
  permissions for the resources you want to create. In our case we can allow
  all actions to S3 resources.

6. Open security credentials in your new user and click create
  access key. Select the `third-party service` use case and click
  next. Enter a description that will help you recognise your key
  (e.g. `Northflank OpenTofu`) and create access key.

7. Enter the `access key` and `secret key` for the user you created into the
  Northflank integration form and create the integration.

## Add an OpenTofu node to a template

OpenTofu nodes are created as part of a template. [Create a new
template](./create-a-template) or pick an existing one to begin. Add example as
the Node reference so we can refer to this node later in our template.

Add a new OpenTofu node to your template, this node contains all of the details
for a single OpenTofu module. We recommended keeping your modules as small as
possible as larger modules take longer to apply. You can use Northflank
templating system to pass variables between OpenTofu nodes, more details in the
outputs section below.

Northflank offers a limited selection of providers and resources. Please
contact us if there is anything you would like added.

Since we want an S3 bucket, that is available under the AWS provider. Select
that and the integration credentials setup in the previous step, as well as the
aws region that your resources will be created in.

The set of required fields will vary for different providers.

The providers and resources that Northflank makes available come directly from
the upstream [OpenTofu
registry](https://search.opentofu.org/providers). Refer to that documentation at any time for any
available attributes and descriptions of each one.

## Add OpenTofu resources

The next section of the OpenTofu node is where resources are defined, the set
of resources available will be different depending on the provider selected. To
add a resource click the Add resource button then select the resource type from
the available list. Provide a name to refer to that resource later in the node.

Select `aws_s3_bucket` as the type and name it `my_bucket`.

The Spec field is for entering this resources attributes as documented in the [
upstream providers resource documentation](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#argument-reference). Refer to the upstream
documentation for details about which attributes are available for any resource
and details about those attributes. Northflank uses the JSON configuration
syntax, [
documented here](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/syntax/json/). The syntax is similar to HCL, the main
difference being that keys are quoted and the value separator is colon (:)
instead of equals (=).

There are no required attributes for the `aws_s3_bucket` resource so
we can leave the spec as an empty object, alternatively we can pass a name to
our bucket:

```json
{
  "bucket": "example-bucket-name"
}
```

> [!important] 
> OpenTofu modules use the same syntax for template strings as Northflank
templates `{"${}"}`. They will be interpreted as Northflank template
strings, to use OpenTofu template strings you need to escape them with a
backslash.
For example `${aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id}`
will need to be written as `\${aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id}`.

## Use outputs

Any output attribute can be exposed to subsequent template nodes, however they
must be declared in the output section of the OpenTofu node.

In our example we want to access the S3 bucket domain name later in our
template. To do this add a new output, give it a descriptive name, and then as
the value enter

```
${aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket_domain_name}
```

> [!important] 
> The form editor will auto escape these strings, however the code editor will
not. Make sure to escape any OpenTofu template string in the output section the
same as the resource section when using the code editor.

Any outputs declared in this way will be available on the OpenTofu node after
it has run. They can be accessed using Northflank template strings under the
refs object. If our node has a ref of example and we called the
output generated_url then the value can be referenced later in the
template with the template string
${refs.example.outputs.generated_url.value}.

> [!note] 
> Outputs are not known until after the resources have been applied. Make sure
Wait for completion is selected if you are planning on using the
outputs.

Create a new secret group node and add a new variable with any name and
${refs.example.outputs.generated_url.value} as the value. Once
this template is run you will be able to retrieve the generated url from this
secret group.

## Run template

Once you are happy with the template, save and run it. Northflank will
provision all of the resources defined in the OpenTofu node once that node is
processed.

Provisioning resources may take some time so be patient. The OpenTofu node will
remain in pending state until the resources have either been successfully
created or failed. Any error messages are displayed on the node that failed.

Once the template has fully completed, you can view the secret group we created
to confirm that the outputs have saved as expected.

> [!note] 
> Northflank currently has no way to delete resources once created. If you no
longer need these resources then it is up to you to clean them up.

Northflank can handle running multiple OpenTofu jobs simultaneously, however
only the latest run will contain accurate information. Northflank will skip
running any job for a OpenTofu node if it detects a later one has been
scheduled for the same OpenTofu node.
