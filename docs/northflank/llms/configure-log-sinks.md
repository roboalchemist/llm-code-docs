# Configure log sinks

You can integrate your preferred log aggregators and observability platforms with your Northflank account.

Log sinks allow you to forward logs from containers in specific projects, or your whole account, allowing you to unify and process logs from your entire operation. You can improve your observability with the features of your preferred log service; analyze and visualise metrics, perform searches, set up real-time alerts, and meet your log auditing requirements.

You can also integrate with your own logging solutions by sending logs to a custom HTTP endpoint or an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Supported services

Northflank currently supports the following services and endpoints for log sinks:

- [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com/)

- [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki)

- [Papertrail](https://papertrail.com/)

- [Mezmo (formerly LogDNA)](https://mezmo.com/)

- [Better Stack (formerly Logtail)](https://betterstack.com/logs)

- [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io/logs/)

- [Logz.io](https://logz.io)

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com)

- [Axiom](https://axiom.co)

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_ql_prod_st_s3)

- HTTP (custom endpoint)

## Log encoding

By default, logs will be sent as plain text, some log sinks allow you to send logs as JSON instead.

### Text

Text logs are sent as a single string containing only the log message itself in the format:

`<timestamp: [yyyy-MM-dd’T’HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSS’Z’]> <stream [stdout | stderr]> <log line>`.

For example:

```text
2022-09-12T09:21:40.817924799Z stdout F Mon Sep 12 09:21:40 UTC 2022: Log item 138051
```

### JSON

JSON logs are sent as an array of objects, with each object representing a single log entry:

```JSON
  {
    [
      {
        "entity":"<entity_id>",
        "host":"Northflank",
        "message":"<datetime with timezone> <log message>",
        "path":"/",
        "pod":"<service_name>-<pod_id>",
        "project":"<project_name>",
        "service":"<service_name>",
        "source":"Northflank",
        "source_type":"http",
        "timestamp":"<datetime with timezone>",
        "type":"<service|job|addon>"
      },
      {...},
      {...}
    ]
  }
```

## Custom label parsing

Northflank supports custom label parsing for the following services:

- [Datadog](#create-a-datadog-log-sink)

- [Better Stack](#create-a-better-stack-log-sink)

- [Logz.io](#create-a-logzio-log-sink)

- [Honeycomb](#create-a-honeycomb-log-sink)

- [Mezmo](#create-a-mezmo-log-sink)

- [New Relic](#create-a-new-relic-log-sink)

- [Axiom](#create-an-axiom-log-sink)

You can enable custom label parsing under advanced options when you create or update a log sink integration.

Custom label parsing scans JSON formatted log lines for additional non-protected keys (keys that are not `message`, `ts`, or `msg`) and supplies them to the sink with your log line. We recommend using the message key for your log line message.

You can generate these custom keys in your application and query them in your log provider to gain better insights into your services.

### A log sent without custom label parsing

```JSON
{
  message: "{"message":"my JSON log line", "custom-key":"test", "level":"INFO"}",
  timestamp: 2023-08-31T16:53:00
}

```

### A log sent with custom label parsing

```JSON
{
  message: "my JSON log line",
  timestamp: 2023-08-31T16:53:00,
  custom-key: "test",
  level: "INFO"
}
```

## Create a log sink

Log sinks can be created on your user or team account in your account settings.

> [!note] 
> [Click here](https://app.northflank.com/s/account/integrations/log-sinks) to view your account's log sinks page.
To add a new log sink, select the type of log sink you want and follow the specific instructions below for each type.

You can pause and resume your log sinks as required after they have been created, update the authentication details, and change the projects they target.

### Forward logs only from selected projects

By default, Northflank will forward logs from all running containers in all projects within your team. You can enable make log sink target selected projects under advanced options and select specific projects to forward logs from. Only containers running in the selected projects will have their logs forwarded.

If you are creating a log sink on a team account and your role is restricted to specific projects, you will only be able to create log sinks targeting the projects you have access to.

### Forward network logs

Northflank will only send runtime logs, produced by your running containers, by default.

You can choose to forward logs from CDNs and the network mesh as well in the advanced options section.

#### CDN logs

Northflank will forward logs from any [CDN services](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/domains/use-a-cdn) used in your team or selected projects.

#### Mesh logs

Northflank will forward logs from the Northflank network mesh relevant to resources in your team or selected projects.

### Validation log

When you create or update a log sink a validation log is sent to the endpoint to ensure the credentials entered are correct. This validation log will be stored in your sink and takes the following format:

```JSON
{
  "app-name": "log-forwarder",
  "host": "Northflank",
  "message": "Validating log sink credentials",
  "severity": "info",
  "date": "<datetime with timezone>"
}
```

## Create an AWS S3 or compatible API log sink

You can create an S3 sink hosted by Amazon Web Services, or another implementation of S3 storage. The following instructions are to integrate S3 hosted by AWS, for other implementations the exact details may differ.

Logs sent to S3 buckets are automatically segmented into directories to help identify and find them, by project, resource type, and resource name. For example:

| Project | Resource category | Resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| my-project/ | service/ | my-service-1/ |
| my-project/ | service/ | my-service-2/ |
| my-project/ | addon/ | mongo-db/ |
| my-project/ | job/ | db-cleanup-cron/ |

1. [Click here](https://app.northflank.com/s/account/integrations/log-sinks/new/aws_s3), or select the AWS S3 sink type in your new Northflank log sink

2. Go to your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and select S3 from the storage section in the services menu

3. Create a new bucket, or select an existing one, and enter the name of the bucket in Northflank

4. Enter the service endpoint, for example `s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` for a bucket in the `EU-West-1` region

5. Enter the region for your bucket, as indicated in the endpoint

6. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) and create a new IAM user with the necessary permissions, or a role containing the necessary permissions

7. Copy the `access key ID` and `access key secret` to Northflank directly, and/or save them somewhere secure (you will not be able to view them again)

8. Choose whether to send uncompressed plaintext logs, or logs compressed with gzip to your bucket

9. Select your project restrictions, if any, and add log sink

10. You should receive a [validation log entry](#create-a-log-sink) to confirm your credentials are valid, and logs will now be sent to the sink

> [!note] 
> 
- Northflank will create a folder to store logs each day, with the format `date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Each log file will be named with a Unix timestamp in seconds, followed by a UUID: `[timestamp]-[UUID].[file-extension]`
- Logs will have the file extension `.log` if uncompressed, or `.log.gzip` for compressed logs
- Logs will be sent in batches no greater than 32.7KB, or every second while logs are being generated

## Create a HTTP log sink

You can configure a custom HTTP endpoint to receive your logs from Northflank.

1. [Click here](https://app.northflank.com/s/account/integrations/log-sinks/new/http), or select HTTP

2. Enter the URL of your log sink

3. Select your authentication strategy: `basic authentication` or `bearer token`

- Enter your username and password to authenticate using basic authentication

- Enter your token to authenticate using bearer token

1. Choose the encoding method for the logs: `text` or `JSON`

2. Change batch options, if required

3. Select your project restrictions, if any, and add log sink

4. Your HTTPS endpoint should receive a [validation log entry](#create-a-log-sink) to confirm your credentials are valid, and logs will now be sent to the sink

### Authentication strategy

You can secure your endpoint by only accepting requests with either basic authentication or a bearer token. For security your endpoint should require HTTPS, otherwise credentials and logs will be transmitted unencrypted.

- Basic authentication: basic auth requires a password, and optionally a username. This will be encoded using base64 before being sent in the header as `Authorization: "Basic <encoded credentials>"`

- Bearer token: your bearer token will be encoded using base64 and sent in the header of the request as `Authorization: "Bearer <encoded token>"`

### Log encoding

Your endpoint will receive logs from Northflank in either [text or JSON format](#log-encoding).

Text logs will be sent with the header `Content-Type: text/plain` and the body will consist of a string containing the log line. JSON logs will be sent with the header `Content-Type: application/json` and the body will consist of a JSON object containing an array of log lines.

### Batch options

You can set a maximum size for each batch of logs to be sent to your endpoint. You can reduce or increase the size of batches depending on how much your endpoint can process in a single request.

Batches can be capped by the number of events and size in bytes. Max events will group a number of log entries together, max size will send the batch as soon as it reaches that size (based on the uncompressed size). Max size accepts values as integers (`3000000`) or with exponential notation (`3e+6`).

### Response

Your endpoint should return a 2xx response code.
