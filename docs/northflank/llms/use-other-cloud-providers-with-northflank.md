# Use other cloud providers with Northflank

You can bring your own cloud to use all the features of the Northflank platform on other cloud hosting providers.

Connect your account with Northflank to create and manage Kubernetes clusters in your own cloud account, and gain complete control of your infrastructure, data storage, security, and auditing.

You will use your existing billing relationship with your cloud provider for all resources consumed by your clusters. See [cloud provider billing](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/billing/cloud-provider-billing) for more information.

## Integrate your cloud account and a deploy cluster

After creating an integration with your chosen cloud provider you can deploy clusters into your cloud account.

You can create integrations with the following providers:

| Provider | Engine | Available Nodes and Regions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) | [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) | [View on Northflank](https://northflank.com/cloud/gcp) |
| [ Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) | [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) | [View on Northflank](https://northflank.com/cloud/aws) |
| [ Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) | [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) | [View on Northflank](https://northflank.com/cloud/azure) |
| [ Civo](https://www.civo.com) | [Civo Kubernetes](https://www.civo.com/kubernetes) | [View on Northflank](https://northflank.com/cloud/civo) |
| [ Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) | [Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-native/kubernetes-engine/) | [View on Northflank](https://northflank.com/cloud/oci) |

## Configure your cluster

Configure your cluster to handle builds and deployments according to your requirements.

- [Select your cluster's build infrastructure: Build on your cluster, on Northflank's managed cloud, or choose a separate build cluster.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/configure-your-cluster#select-build-infrastructure)
- [Manage your request modifiers: You can tune the minimum resources requested by pods deployed to your cluster to balance performance and node usage.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/configure-your-cluster#configure-resources)
- [Retain cluster volumes: Choose to keep volumes and volume backups when you delete a cluster.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/configure-your-cluster#set-volume-deletion-preferences)
- [Create custom resource plans: Create custom plans for your team to deploy workloads and build code on your own clusters.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/create-custom-resource-plans)

## Deploy and scale node pools

Deploy and scale node pools of different node types in as many availability zones as you require and configure scheduling rules and autoscaling to optimise node usage.

- [Deploy node pools: Configure and deploy node pools on a Kubernetes cluster with Northflank.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-and-scale-node-pools)
- [Scale node pools: Set your node count manually, or configure autoscaling to manage demand and optimise costs.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-and-scale-node-pools#set-node-count-and-autoscaling)
- [Create node pools with spot instances: Use spot instances to reduce costs for non-critical workloads.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-and-scale-node-pools#use-spot-instances)
- [Schedule workloads to specific node pools: Allow or disallow different types of workloads from being scheduled on a node pool.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-and-scale-node-pools#set-scheduling-rules)

## Deploy workloads to your cluster

Let Northflank automatically assign workloads to node pools with capacity, or use affinity rules to deploy workloads to specific node pools to projects deployed in your cluster.

Configure node pools to use spot instances to reduce cost, or deploy across multiple availability zones for high availability.

- [Deploy workloads to your cluster: Deploy services, jobs, and addons to your own cluster, and configure workloads to schedule on specific node pools.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-workloads-to-your-cluster)
- [Run GPU workloads: Deploy GPU workloads on Northflank for AI, machine learning, HPC workloads, and other tasks.](/v1/application/gpu-workloads/gpus-on-northflank)
- [Deploy workloads to spot instances: Tag workloads to deploy them to spot instances.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-workloads-to-your-cluster#use-spot-instances)
- [Deploy workloads with high availability: Schedule a resource with zonal redundancy for high availability applications.](/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/deploy-workloads-to-your-cluster#use-zonal-redundancy-for-high-availability)

## Monitor and manage your cluster

Monitor your cluster's usage, health, and deployed workloads.
