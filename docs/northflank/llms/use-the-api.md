# Use the API

The Northflank API allows you to interact with every Northflank feature and all your resources using HTTP requests.

The API is available at [https://api.northflank.com/v1/](https://api.northflank.com/v1/). Before using the API you'll need to [sign up](https://app.northflank.com/signup), and if you're using Northflank with others, [create a team](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/collaborate/create-a-team). You'll also need to [link a Git service](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/getting-started/link-your-git-account) (if you want to build code from your private Git repositories).

You can find the required permissions, path and object parameters, and examples requests and responses for all API endpoints, categorised by the type of resource or task, in the menu under API reference. You can also find the API parameters for your existing Northflank resources in the Northflank application by opening the options menu  in your resource header and selecting `view specification`.

Requests and responses are both in JSON. Requests should include the header:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

## API specification and schemas

You can access Northflank's OpenAPI specification and schemas via the following endpoints:

- [https://api.northflank.com/v1/swagger-json](https://api.northflank.com/v1/swagger-json)

- [https://api.northflank.com/v1/swagger-html](https://api.northflank.com/v1/swagger-html)

## Authentication

Access to most endpoints is restricted and authenticated via a bearer token. Users can [generate a personal API token](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/secure/manage-api-tokens) in their account settings in the [Northflank application](https://app.northflank.com). Team members can generate an API token in that team's settings, provided an [API role](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/secure/grant-api-access) has been created by a member with permissions.

The API token must then be included in the Authorization header for the request:

```
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR AUTH TOKEN]
```

- [Grant API access: Create API roles to grant access to the Northflank API, with granular permissions.](/v1/application/secure/grant-api-access)

## Rate limits

The Northflank API has a default rate limit of 1000 requests per hour, which resets one hour after the first request is sent. You can contact [[support@northflank.com](mailto:support@northflank.com)](mailto:support@northflank.com) to request higher API limits.

The details for your rate limit are sent in the header for each response from the Northflank API, which can be accessed with the following keys:

| Account rate limit | Requests remaining | Time to reset (seconds) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x-ratelimit-limit` | `x-ratelimit-remaining` | `x-ratelimit-reset` |

## Getting started with the API

Below are some examples, in JavaScript, of some common tasks that can be achieved using the API.

## Create a project

You can create a new project with a [POST request to the `v1/projects`](projects/create-project) endpoint.

The request body should contain the project `name`, `description`, `color`, and `region`. Alternatively, if you're deploying to [your own cluster](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/bring-your-own-cloud/use-other-cloud-providers-with-northflank), you can supply the `clusterId` instead of the region.

```javascript
const payload = {
    "name": "API example project",
    "description": "This is a new project.",
    "color": "#EF233C",
    "region": "europe-west"
}

const response = await fetch('https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response to a successful request contains the ID of the project.

You can check that your project has been created by listing all the projects on your account with a [GET request to the `v1/projects`](projects/list-projects) endpoint, or get details for the specific project by sending a [GET request to the endpoint `/v1/projects/{projectId}`](projects/get-project) with the project ID.

## Build your code

You can build code from a Git repository on Northflank by creating a combined service (which builds and deploys your code in one service), creating a job that builds and runs code, or by creating a build service.

In this example we're going to create a build service, which can then provide builds for deployments and jobs, and build a Node.js Express server from a [public Git repository](https://github.com/northflank-examples/node-express-example).

### Create a build service

You can create a new build service by sending a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/build`](services/create-build-service) endpoint, supplying the project ID you want to create the build service in.

```javascript
const payload = {
  "name": "Build service",
  "billing": {
    "deploymentPlan": "nf-compute-10"
  },
  "vcsData": {
    "projectUrl": "https://github.com/northflank-examples/node-express-example",
    "projectType": "github"
  },
  "buildSettings": {
    "dockerfile": {
      "buildEngine": "kaniko",
      "dockerFilePath": "/Dockerfile",
      "dockerWorkDir": "/"
    }
  },
  "buildConfiguration": {
    "prRestrictions": [
      "*"
    ],
    "branchRestrictions": [
      "master"
    ],
    "ciIgnoreFlags": [
      "[skip ci]",
      "[ci skip]",
      "[no ci]",
      "[skip nf]",
      "[nf skip]",
      "[northflank skip]",
      "[skip northflank]"
    ],
    "ciIgnoreFlagsEnabled": false,
    "isAllowList": false
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/services/build`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response for a successful request includes the ID of the service, and all other configuration details for the service.

You can check the configuration for your service by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceId}` endpoint](services/get-service), with the relevant project and service IDs.

### Start a build

With a build service created you can now trigger new builds with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceId}/build` endpoint](services/start-service-build), replacing the `projectId` and `serviceId` with the relevant IDs for your project and build service.

This example starts a build of the latest commit to the `master` branch of the repository linked to the service. You can also supply a `pullRequestId` instead, which will build the latest commit to the branch of the pull request. If you include the `sha` of a specific commit, the service will build that specific commit from the branch.

The `branch` and `pullRequestId` parameters can only be passed to a build service. You can use the `sha` parameter to trigger builds of specific commits for combined service and jobs, or leave the request body empty to build the latest commit to the linked branch.

You can also pass an `overrides` object to supply build arguments for that build only.

```javascript
const payload = {
  "branch": "master"
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/services/${serviceId}/build`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response for a successful request includes the ID for the build (a randomly-generated slug), the time the build was created, the status of the build, and more.

You can check the status of a build with a [GET request to the endpoint `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceId}/build/{buildId}`](services/get-service-build), using the relevant project, service, and build IDs.

## Deploy your code

You can deploy images built on Northflank or images from container registries using a deployment service. The examples below show how to create a deployment with no image deployed and then update the deployment configuration for that service. You can alternatively include the image specification in the `deployment` object (`internal` for Northflank-built images or `external` for images from a container registry) when creating the deployment service.

### Create a deployment service

You can create a new deployment service with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/deployment` endpoint](services/create-deployment-service), supplying the project ID you want to create the deployment service in.

```javascript
const payload = {
  "name": "Deployment service",
  "billing": {
    "deploymentPlan": "nf-compute-10"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "instances": 1,
    "docker": {
      "configType": "default"
    },
    "buildpack": {
      "configType": "default"
    },
    "storage": {
      "ephemeralStorage": {
        "storageSize": 1024
      }
    }
  },
  "healthChecks": [],
  "autoscaling": {}
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/services/deployment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response for a successful request includes the ID of the service, and all other configuration details for the service.

You can check the configuration for your service by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceId}` endpoint](services/get-service), with the relevant project and service IDs.

### Deploy your build

You can deploy a built image from a Northflank build service by sending a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceId}/deployment` endpoint](services/update-service-deployment) and including the `internal` object, which contains the ID of the build service to deploy from, the branch to use, and the commit SHA of the built commit to deploy. You can either provide a specific commit SHA, or use `latest` to deploy the most recent built commit.

If you supply a specific commit hash (`buildSHA`) but it has not been built by the build service, attempting to update the deployment with it will return an error. However, if you provide `latest` as the `buildSHA` and have no build available for the branch, the deployment service will be updated but no instances will be deployed until a build is available. It's recommended in your workflow to check a build exists before updating your deployment service.

You can also include a `docker` or `buildpack` object to change the runtime configuration, or only include one of these objects to update the configuration without changing the deployed image.

```javascript
const payload = {
  "internal": {
    "id": `${buildServiceId}`,
    "branch": "master",
    "buildSHA": "latest"
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/services/${serviceId}/deployment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response for a successful request will be an empty `data` object.

### Deploy an image

You can deploy an image from a Docker container registry in the same method as deploying an image built on Northflank. However, this time the payload contains an `external` object with the path of the image, as well as the ID of the [required saved credentials](integrations/add-registry) if the image is private.

The example below deploys the latest Nginx image from the DockerHub library. Northflank will default to the DockerHub library if a full path to a container registry and username is not provided. [Learn more about deploying from a container registry here](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/run/run-an-image-from-a-container-registry#image-paths).

```javascript
const payload = {
  "external": {
    "imagePath": "nginx:latest"
  },
  "docker": {
    "configType": "default"
  }
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/services/${serviceId}/deployment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json()
console.log(json)
```

The response for a successful request will be an empty `data` object.

## Run a job

You can create and trigger job runs using the API. You can create either a cron job or a manual job depending on the endpoint you use. A cron job can run on a schedule and be triggered manually, while a manual job will not run unless triggered via the application, an API call, or a template or release flow run. Job can run images from an external container registry, images build by a Northflank build service, or jobs can build and deploy images from a Git repository.

### Create a manual job

You can create a new manual job with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/jobs/manual` endpoint](jobs/create-manual-job), supplying the ID of the project you want to create the job in. The payload below deploys an example job that will produce logs for 10 seconds and return a successful exit code (`0`).

```javascript
const payload = {
  "name": "Manual job",
  "billing": {
    "deploymentPlan": "nf-compute-20"
  },
  "backoffLimit": 0,
  "runOnSourceChange": "never",
  "activeDeadlineSeconds": 600,
  "deployment": {
    "docker": {
      "configType": "default"
    },
    "buildpack": {
      "configType": "default"
    },
    "storage": {
      "ephemeralStorage": {
        "storageSize": 1024
      }
    },
    "vcs": {
      "projectUrl": "https://github.com/northflank-examples/mock-job",
      "projectType": "github",
      "projectBranch": "main"
    }
  },
  "buildSettings": {
    "dockerfile": {
      "buildEngine": "kaniko",
      "dockerFilePath": "/Dockerfile",
      "dockerWorkDir": "/"
    }
  },
  "healthChecks": []
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/jobs/manual`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json();
console.log(json);
```

The response for a successful request includes the ID of the job and other configuration details including the `jobType`, `deployment` details, and other job settings.

You can check the configuration for your job by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}` endpoint](jobs/get-job), with the relevant project and job IDs.

### Run a job

You can trigger a job run with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}/runs` endpoint](jobs/run-job).

You can send an empty payload to run a job with the existing configuration, or override the environment variables (`runtimeEnvironment`), resources (`billing`), and deployment configuration (`deployment`).

```javascript
const payload = {}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/jobs/${jobId}/runs`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json();
console.log(json);
```

The response for a successful request will be an object containing the ID of the job run, and the name of the job run.

You can retrieve details about a job run by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/jobs/{jobId}/runs/{runId}` endpoint](jobs/get-run-details), supplying the project, job, and run IDs. The response will include the status and success of the run, the time it started, and the time it concluded.

## Backup a database

You can deploy databases and other addons, and manage them using the API, including triggering backups. You can only back up a running addon.

### Create an addon

You can create a new addon with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/addons` endpoint](addons/create-addon), supplying the project ID you want to create the addon in. The addon to be created is defined by the `type`, and you can specify a `version` to be deployed, or use `latest` for the most recent available version. You can query available addons and their versions with a [GET request to the list addon types endpoint](addons/list-addon-types).

```javascript
const payload = {
    "name": "database",
    "description": "",
    "type": "mongodb",
    "version": "latest",
    "billing": {
        "deploymentPlan": "nf-compute-50",
        "storageClass": "ssd",
        "storage": 4096,
        "replicas": 1
    },
    "tlsEnabled": false,
    "externalAccessEnabled": false,
    "ipPolicies": [],
    "pitrEnabled": false,
    "typeSpecificSettings": {}
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/addons`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json();
console.log(json);
```

The response for a successful request includes the ID of the service, and other configuration details for the addon, including the `type` and `version`.

You can check the configuration for your service by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/addons/{addonId}` endpoint](addons/get-addon), with the relevant project and service IDs.

### Run a backup

You can trigger a backup for an addon with a [POST request to the `/v1/projects/${projectId}/addons/${addonId}/backups` endpoint](addons/backup-addon). If the addon isn't running, the backup will be scheduled and will begin as soon as the addon is restarted and in the running state.

You can include a name for the backup and specify the backup type, either `snapshot` or `dump`. The `dump` native backup method is not available on all addons, [you can check which addons support the native backup dump method here](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/databases-and-persistence/deploy-a-database#available-databases). You can also leave the payload empty and a default name will be generated for the backup, and `snapshot` will be used as the default backup method.

```javascript
const payload = {
    "name": `Example backup ${Date.now()}`,
    "backupType": "snapshot"
}

const response = await fetch(`https://api.northflank.com/v1/projects/${projectId}/addons/${addonId}/backups`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${NORTHFLANK_API_TOKEN}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
})

const json = await response.json();
console.log(json);
```

The response for a successful request will be an object containing the backup ID, status, and time it was created, as well as other details.

You can retrieve details about a backup by sending a [GET request to the `/v1/projects/{projectId}/addons/{addonId}/backups/{backupId}` endpoint](addons/get-addon-backup), supplying the project, addon, and backup IDs. The response will include the status, and, if completed, the completion time and size. If the backup has been used to restore the addon, it will also include a `lastRestore` object containing the details.
