# Deploy a database

To deploy a new database in your project, create a new addon and select the type and version you require. Please note that while you can increase the storage size or replica count of databases after creation, you cannot decrease them.

After creating your addon it may take a few minutes to provision resources and set up a default configuration, after which its status will change to running.

Your database will be accessible by workloads within the same project using the provided [connection details](./connect-database-secrets-to-workloads).

You can configure advanced options for addons, such as [backup schedules](backup-restore-and-import-data#schedule-backups) and custom database names. You can also fork databases from addons with existing backups.

See the [deployment guides](#next-steps) for addon-specific configuration options.
