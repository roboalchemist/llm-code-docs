# Databricks setup [Preview](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles "Go to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles")

You can configure the Databricks adapter by running `dbt init` in your CLI or manually providing the `profiles.yml` file with the fields configured for your authentication type.

The Databricks adapter for Fusion supports the following [authentication methods](#supported-authentication-types):

* Personal access token (for individual users)
* Service Principal token (for service users)
* OAuth

## Databricks configuration details[​](#databricks-configuration-details "Direct link to Databricks configuration details")

The dbt Fusion engine `dbt-databricks` adapter is the only supported connection method for Databricks.

`dbt-databricks` can connect to Databricks SQL Warehouses. These warehouses are the recommended way to get started with Databricks.

Refer to the [Databricks docs](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/dbt.html#) for more info on how to obtain the credentials for configuring your profile.

## Configure Fusion[​](#configure-fusion "Direct link to Configure Fusion")

Executing `dbt init` in your CLI will prompt for the following fields:

* **Host:** Databricks instance hostname (excluding the `http` or `https` prefix)
* **HTTP Path:** Path to your SQL server or cluster
* **Schema:** The development/staging/deployment schema for the project
* **Catalog (Optional):** The Databricks catalog containing your schemas and tables

Alternatively, you can manually create the `profiles.yml` file and configure the fields. See examples in [authentication](#supported-authentication-types) section for formatting. If there is an existing `profiles.yml` file, you are given the option to retain the existing fields or overwrite them.

Next, select your authentication method. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the required information.

## Supported authentication types[​](#supported-authentication-types "Direct link to Supported authentication types")

* Personal access token
* Service Principal token
* OAuth (Recommended)

Enter your personal access token (PAT) for the Databricks environment. For more information about obtaining a PAT, refer to the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/pat). This is considered a legacy feature by Databricks and OAuth is recommended over PATs.

#### Example personal access token configuration[​](#example-personal-access-token-configuration "Direct link to Example personal access token configuration")

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: databricks
      database: TRANSFORMING
      schema: JANE_SMITH
      host: YOUR.HOST.COM
      http_path: YOUR/PATH/HERE
      token: ABC123
      auth_type: databricks_cli
      threads: 16
```

Enter your Service Principal token for the Databricks environment. For more information about obtaining a Service Principal token, refer to the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/users-groups/service-principals).

#### Example Service Principal token configuration[​](#example-service-principal-token-configuration "Direct link to Example Service Principal token configuration")

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: databricks
      database: TRANSFORMING
      schema: JANE_SMITH
      host: YOUR.HOST.COM
      http_path: YOUR/PATH/HERE
      token: ABC123
      auth_type: databricks_cli
      threads: 16
```

Selecting the OAuth option will create a connection to your Databricks environment and open a web browser so you can complete the authentication. Users will be prompted to re-authenticate with each new dbt session they initiate.

#### Example OAuth configuration[​](#example-oauth-configuration "Direct link to Example OAuth configuration")

profiles.yml

```yml
default:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: databricks
      database: TRANSFORMING
      schema: JANE_SMITH
      host: YOUR.HOST.COM
      http_path: YOUR/PATH/HERE
      auth_type: oauth
      threads: 16
```
