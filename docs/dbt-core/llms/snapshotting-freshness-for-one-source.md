# How do I snapshot freshness for one source only?

Use the `--select` flag to snapshot freshness for specific sources. Eg:

```shell
# Snapshot freshness for all Jaffle Shop tables:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop

# Snapshot freshness for a particular source <Term id="table" />:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop.orders

# Snapshot freshness for multiple particular source tables:
$ dbt source freshness --select source:jaffle_shop.orders source:jaffle_shop.customers
```

See the [`source freshness` command reference](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/source.md) for more information.
