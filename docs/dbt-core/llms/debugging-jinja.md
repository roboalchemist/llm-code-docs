# How do I debug my Jinja?

You should get familiar with checking the compiled SQL in `target/compiled/<your_project>/` and the logs in `logs/dbt.log` to see what dbt is running behind the scenes.

You can also use the [log](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/log.md) function to debug Jinja by printing objects to the command line.
