Title: Sendmail transport | Nodemailer

URL Source: https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail

Markdown Content:
The **Sendmail transport** delivers email by passing the generated RFC 822 message to the local **sendmail** command (or a compatible mail transfer agent such as Postfix or Exim). The message is piped directly to the program's standard input. This is the same mechanism used by PHP's `mail()` function.

Usage[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#usage "Direct link to Usage")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`// CommonJSconst nodemailer = require("nodemailer");const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({  sendmail: true, // enable Sendmail transport});`

Setting `sendmail: true` activates the Sendmail transport. Nodemailer looks for a `sendmail` executable in your system's `PATH` by default. If your sendmail binary is located elsewhere, you can specify the full path using the `path` option described below.

### Transport options[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#transport-options "Direct link to Transport options")

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `String` | `'sendmail'` | Path to the **sendmail** binary. Can be an absolute path (e.g., `/usr/sbin/sendmail`) or just the executable name if it is in your `PATH`. |
| `newline` | `'unix'` / `'windows'` | `'unix'` | Line ending style for the generated message. Use `'unix'` for `\n` (LF) or `'windows'` for `\r\n` (CRLF). Most systems work fine with the default `'unix'` setting. |
| `args` | `String[]` | _none_ | Custom command-line arguments for the sendmail binary. When you provide this array, it replaces Nodemailer's default arguments **except** for `-i` (which is always included) and the recipient addresses (which are always appended). See the examples below for common use cases. |

When no custom `args` array is provided, Nodemailer executes the following command:

`sendmail -i -f <from> <to...>`

When you provide a custom `args` array, the command becomes:

`sendmail -i <args...> <to...>`

Note that the `-i` flag (which prevents a single dot on a line from being treated as the end of the message) and the recipient list are always included automatically.

### Response[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#response "Direct link to Response")

After successfully sending a message, `transporter.sendMail()` resolves with an `info` object containing the following properties:

* `envelope` - An object with `from` (string) and `to` (array of strings) properties representing the message [envelope](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/envelope)
* `messageId` - The generated Message-ID header value for the sent message
* `response` - The string `'Messages queued for delivery'`

Note that the sendmail command does not produce output, so the `response` is a static confirmation message from Nodemailer.

### Troubleshooting[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

If Nodemailer cannot find the sendmail binary, you will receive an error with exit code 127. To resolve this:

1. Verify that sendmail (or a compatible MTA like Postfix) is installed on your system
2. Check that the binary is accessible via your `PATH`, or specify the full path using the `path` option
3. Common locations include `/usr/sbin/sendmail` and `/usr/lib/sendmail`

For installation instructions, consult your operating system's documentation or the [Computer Hope sendmail reference](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/usendmai.htm).

### Examples[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#examples "Direct link to Examples")

#### Specifying a custom binary path[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#specifying-a-custom-binary-path "Direct link to Specifying a custom binary path")

Use the `path` option when the sendmail binary is not in your `PATH` or you want to use a specific location:

`const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({  sendmail: true,  newline: "unix",  path: "/usr/sbin/sendmail",});transporter.sendMail(  {    from: "sender@example.com",    to: "recipient@example.com",    subject: "Test message",    text: "I hope this message gets delivered!",  },  (err, info) => {    if (err) {      console.error(err);      return;    }    console.log(info.envelope);    console.log(info.messageId);  });`

#### Passing custom command-line arguments[​](https://nodemailer.com/transports/sendmail#passing-custom-command-line-arguments "Direct link to Passing custom command-line arguments")

Use the `args` option to pass additional flags to the sendmail binary. For example, to override the [envelope](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/envelope) sender address (useful for setting a custom bounce address):

`const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({  sendmail: true,  args: ["-f", "bounce@example.com"],});`

When using `args`, remember that you are replacing Nodemailer's default arguments. If you need the `-f` flag for the envelope sender, you must include it explicitly as shown above.
