Whether you're protecting your home, buying a new one, or just want peace of mind — **FlameGuard AI™ turns a photo into a plan**.

## ⚙️ How it works

### The FlameGuard AI™ Process

1. **📸 Upload**: User uploads a photo of their property
2. **👁️ AI Vision Analysis**: OpenAI Vision API identifies specific vulnerabilities (e.g., flammable roof, dry brush nearby)
3. **🔍 Deep Research**: For each risk, we generate a **custom research plan** and run **iterative agentic-style calls** to Perplexity Sonar
4. **📄 Report Generation**: Research is **aggregated, organized, and formatted** into an actionable HTML report — complete with citations, links, and visual guidance
5. **📧 Delivery**: Detailed report sent via email with DIY solutions and professional recommendations

### 🔍 Deep Research with Perplexity Sonar API

The real innovation is how we use the **Perplexity Sonar API**:

* We treat it like a research assistant gathering the best available information
* Each vulnerability triggers multiple queries covering severity, mitigation strategies, and localized insights
* Results include regional fire codes, weather patterns, and local contractor availability

This kind of **structured, trustworthy, AI-powered research would not be possible without Perplexity**.

### Technical Stack

FlameGuard AI™ is powered by a modern GenAI stack and built to scale:

* **Frontend**: Lightweight HTML dashboard with user account control, photo upload, and report access
* **Backend**: Python (Flask) with RESTful APIs
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (local) with **Azure SQL-ready** schema
* **AI Integration**: OpenAI Vision API + Perplexity Sonar API
* **Cloud-ready**: Built for **Azure App Service** with Dockerized deployment

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Successfully used **OpenAI Vision + Perplexity Sonar API** together in a meaningful, real-world workflow
* Built a functioning **MCP server** that integrates seamlessly with Claude for desktop users
* Created a product that is **genuinely useful for homeowners today** — not just a demo
* Kept the experience simple, affordable, and scalable from the ground up
* Made structured deep research feel accessible and trustworthy

## 📚 What we learned

* The **Perplexity Sonar API** is incredibly powerful when used agentically — not just for answers, but for reasoning.
* Combining **multimodal AI (image + research)** opens up powerful decision-support tools.
* Users want **actionable insights**, not just data — pairing research with guidance makes all the difference.
* Trust and clarity are key: our design had to communicate complex information simply and helpfully.

## 🚀 What's next for FlameGuard AI™ - Prevention is Better Than Cure

We're just getting started.

### Next Steps:

* 🌐 Deploy to **Azure App Services** with production-ready database
* 📱 Launch mobile version with location-based scanning
* 🏡 Partner with **home inspection services** and **homeowners associations**
* 💬 Enhance Claude/MCP integration with voice-activated AI reporting
* 💸 Introduce B2B plans for real estate firms and home safety consultants
* 🛡️ Expand database of **local contractor networks** and regional fire codes

We're proud to stand with homeowners — not just to raise awareness, but to enable action.

**FlameGuard AI™ – Because some homes survive when others don't.**
