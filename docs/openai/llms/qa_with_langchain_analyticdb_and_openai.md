# Question Answering with Langchain, AnalyticDB and OpenAI
This notebook presents how to implement a Question Answering system with Langchain, AnalyticDB as a knowledge based and OpenAI embeddings. If you are not familiar with AnalyticDB, it’s better to check out the [Getting_started_with_AnalyticDB_and_OpenAI.ipynb](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/vector_databases/analyticdb/Getting_started_with_AnalyticDB_and_OpenAI.ipynb) notebook.

This notebook presents an end-to-end process of:
- Calculating the embeddings with OpenAI API.
- Storing the embeddings in an AnalyticDB instance to build a knowledge base.
- Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.
- Using AnalyticDB to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection to find some context.
- Asking LLM to find the answer in a given context.

All the steps will be simplified to calling some corresponding Langchain methods.

## Prerequisites
For the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:
[AnalyticDB cloud instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/analyticdb-for-postgresql/latest/product-introduction-overview).
[Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) as a framework.
An OpenAI API key.

### Install requirements
This notebook requires the following Python packages: `openai`, `tiktoken`, `langchain` and `psycopg2cffi`.
- `openai` provides convenient access to the OpenAI API.
- `tiktoken` is a fast BPE tokeniser for use with OpenAI's models.
- `langchain` helps us to build applications with LLM more easily.
- `psycopg2cffi` library is used to interact with the vector database, but any other PostgreSQL client library is also acceptable.

```python
! pip install openai tiktoken langchain psycopg2cffi
```

```python
! export OPENAI_API_KEY="your API key"
```

```python
# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")
```

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY is ready
```

### Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys ).

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as `OPENAI_API_KEY` by running following command:

### Prepare your AnalyticDB connection string
To build the AnalyticDB connection string, you need to have the following parameters: `PG_HOST`, `PG_PORT`, `PG_DATABASE`, `PG_USER`, and `PG_PASSWORD`. You need to export them first to set correct connect string. Then build the connection string.

```python
! export PG_HOST="your AnalyticDB host url"
! export PG_PORT=5432 # Optional, default value is 5432
! export PG_DATABASE=postgres # Optional, default value is postgres
! export PG_USER="your username"
! export PG_PASSWORD="your password"
```

```python
import os
from langchain.vectorstores.analyticdb import AnalyticDB

CONNECTION_STRING = AnalyticDB.connection_string_from_db_params(
    driver=os.environ.get("PG_DRIVER", "psycopg2cffi"),
    host=os.environ.get("PG_HOST", "localhost"),
    port=int(os.environ.get("PG_PORT", "5432")),
    database=os.environ.get("PG_DATABASE", "postgres"),
    user=os.environ.get("PG_USER", "postgres"),
    password=os.environ.get("PG_PASSWORD", "postgres"),
)
```

```python
import json

with open("questions.json", "r") as fp:
    questions = json.load(fp)

with open("answers.json", "r") as fp:
    answers = json.load(fp)
```

## Load data
In this section we are going to load the data containing some natural questions and answers to them. All the data will be used to create a Langchain application with AnalyticDB being the knowledge base.

```python
print(questions[0])
```

```text

# further processing.

## Chain definition

Langchain is already integrated with AnalyticDB and performs all the indexing for given list of documents. In our case we are going to store the set of answers we have.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import AnalyticDB
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain import VectorDBQA, OpenAI

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
doc_store = AnalyticDB.from_texts(
    texts=answers, embedding=embeddings, connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,
    pre_delete_collection=True,
)
```

At this stage all the possible answers are already stored in  AnalyticDB, so we can define the whole QA chain.

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

llm = OpenAI()
qa = VectorDBQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    vectorstore=doc_store,
    return_source_documents=False,
)
```

## Search data

Once the data is put into AnalyticDB we can start asking some questions. A question will be automatically vectorized by OpenAI model, and the created vector will be used to find some possibly matching answers in AnalyticDB. Once retrieved, the most similar answers will be incorporated into the prompt sent to OpenAI Large Language Model.


```python
import random

random.seed(52)
selected_questions = random.choices(questions, k=5)
```

```python
for question in selected_questions:
    print(">", question)
    print(qa.run(question), end="\n\n")
```

```text
> where do frankenstein and the monster first meet
 Victor retreats into the mountains, and that is where the Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.

> who are the actors in fast and furious
 The main cast of Fast & Furious includes Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, and Ludacris as Tej Parker.

> properties of red black tree in data structure
 The properties of a red-black tree in data structure are that each node is either red or black, the root is black, all leaves (NIL) are black, and if a node is red, then both its children are black. Additionally, every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes.

> who designed the national coat of arms of south africa
 Iaan Bekker

> caravaggio's death of the virgin pamela askew
 I don't know.
```

### Custom prompt templates

The `stuff` chain type in Langchain uses a specific prompt with question and context documents incorporated. This is what the default prompt looks like:

```text
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
{context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:
```

We can, however, provide our prompt template and change the behaviour of the OpenAI LLM, while still using the `stuff` chain type. It is important to keep `{context}` and `{question}` as placeholders.

#### Experimenting with custom prompts

We can try using a different prompt template, so the model:
1. Responds with a single-sentence answer if it knows it.
2. Suggests a random song title if it doesn't know the answer to our question.

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
custom_prompt = """
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. Please provide
a short single-sentence summary answer only. If you don't know the answer or if it's
not present in given context, don't try to make up an answer, but suggest me a random
unrelated song title I could listen to.
Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:
"""

custom_prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    template=custom_prompt, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)
```

```python
custom_qa = VectorDBQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    vectorstore=doc_store,
    return_source_documents=False,
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": custom_prompt_template},
)
```

```python
random.seed(41)
for question in random.choices(questions, k=5):
    print(">", question)
    print(custom_qa.run(question), end="\n\n")
```
