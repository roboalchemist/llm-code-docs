# Merge Multiple Login Types

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

If you have multiple organizations across different source code managers (e.g. GitHub and GitLab), you can link these different login types which allows for easily swapping between organizations using the org-switcher at the **top left of the screen**. This allows you to not always having to go through the login hassle when you are changing login types.

### How to link 3 or more accounts <a href="#how-to-link-3-or-more-accounts" id="how-to-link-3-or-more-accounts"></a>

It is possible to link more than 2 accounts, which is a bit more complex to set up. All workspaces will need to be linked to each other, in order to have all workspaces in the sidebar visible at all times.

**Example.**

If you have already linked a GitLab and a Bitbucket workspace, and you want to add a third GitHub workspace you will need to

* Link the GitLab and GitHub workspaces
* Link the Bitbucket and GitHub workspaces

In order to link these, visit the merge logins screen directly via [this link](https://app.aikido.dev/merge-logins).
