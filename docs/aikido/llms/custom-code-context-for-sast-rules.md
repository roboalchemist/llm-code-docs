# Custom Code Context for SAST Rules

Custom Code Context lets you add plain-language guidance to a specific SAST rule. Aikido uses that guidance during [AutoTriage](https://help.aikido.dev/code-scanning/scanning-practices/sast-autotriage) to make better true and false positive decisions. You can add context globally or at the repository level.

It does **not** change what the rule detects. It helps Aikido interpret findings more accurately.

### Use cases

Use Custom Code Context when a rule needs codebase-specific knowledge, such as:

* trusted sanitization libraries
* internal safe wrappers around risky APIs
* validation helpers that mark data as trusted
* patterns that are safe only in one repository
* Scripts running on isolated machines with trusted input

<details>

<summary>Show specific examples</summary>

#### Trusted sanitization library

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
We often use the public library <L> for sanitization. Every variable returned by a function from this library is considered trusted.
```

{% endcode %}

#### Internal validation helper

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
For this rule, values returned by validateAndNormalizeUserInput() are considered sanitized. This helper rejects invalid characters and enforces a strict allowlist.
```

{% endcode %}

#### Safe wrapper around a risky API

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
For this rule, calls made through safeRedirect() are expected. This wrapper only allows redirects to URLs from our approved domain allowlist.
```

{% endcode %}

### How to add context

{% hint style="info" %}
Custom Code Context is only available for SAST rules that support AutoTriage.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1.** Open the Repositories Checks page and select '[View SAST Rules](https://app.aikido.dev/repositories/sast)'.

**Step 2.** Find the relevant SAST rule & open the action menu and select **Custom Code Context**.<br>

**Step 3.** Add your context in plain language.

**Step 4.** Choose whether the context applies globally or only to that repository. Save the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
A manual rescan is needed before the new context is applied.
{% endhint %}

### Writing tips

Keep the context narrow and concrete.

Do:

* name the exact library, function, wrapper, or folder
* explain why the data is trusted or sanitized
* keep it specific to the selected rule

Avoid:

* broad claims like “inputs are usually sanitized”
* vague statements without function names
* exceptions that apply to everything

<summary>Show good vs weak example</summary>

#### Good example

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
For this SQL injection rule, values returned by buildSafeQuery() are trusted. That helper only creates parameterized queries and never concatenates raw user input.
```

{% endcode %}

#### Weak example

{% code overflow="wrap" %}

```
Our team is careful with SQL queries, so these findings are often false positives.
```

{% endcode %}

### Custom Code Context vs custom SAST rules

Use Custom Code Context when you want to improve triage for an existing rule.

Use [custom SAST rules](https://help.aikido.dev/getting-started/general-information/add-custom-sast-iac-rules) when you need to detect a new pattern in your codebase.

In short:

* **Custom Code Context** refines interpretation
* **Custom SAST rules** expand detection
