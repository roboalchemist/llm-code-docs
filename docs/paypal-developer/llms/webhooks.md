# Invoicing webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP callback that receives notification messages for events. See [configure webhooks](/docs/integration/direct/webhooks/rest-webhooks/) for more details.

PayPal APIs use webhooks for event notification. Most invoice-related actions, including invoice payments, trigger invoicing webhook events:

| Event | Trigger | Related method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.CANCELLED | A merchant or customer cancels an invoice. | [Cancel invoice](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_get) |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.CREATED | An invoice is created. | [Create draft invoice](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_create) |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.PAID | An invoice is paid, partially paid, or payment is made and is pending. | [Mark invoice as paid](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_record-payment) |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.REFUNDED | An invoice is refunded or partially refunded. | [Mark invoice as refunded](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_record-refund) |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.SCHEDULED | An invoice is scheduled. | [Schedule invoice](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_schedule) |
| INVOICING.INVOICE.UPDATED | An invoice is updated. | [Update invoice](/docs/api/invoicing/v1/#invoices_update) |
