# Migrating from WordPress

> Migrate from WordPress and import your content to Ghost with this guide

You can easily migrate your posts and pages from WordPress site to Ghost in just a few clicks, using the WordPress migrator in Ghost Admin.

## **Run the migration**

The WordPress migrator allows you to quickly import content from your WordPress site to your Ghost publication. You can access the migrator tool from the **Settings → Advanced →** **Import/Export** area of Ghost Admin.

It's helpful to log in to your WordPress site before running the migration in Ghost Admin.

### **1. Enter your WordPress URL**

To start the migration process, enter the public URL to your WordPress site, and click **Continue**.

### **2. Export content**

Next, click **Open WordPress Settings.** If already logged into WordPress, this will take you directly to the location of your WordPress site where an export can be generated.

Select **All content,** click **Download Export File**, which will download an XML file with your content in it.

### **3. Upload content**

Once your export has been downloaded, return to the migrator window in Ghost Admin, and select **Click or drag file here to upload**, and navigate to the XML file you downloaded from WordPress, once uploaded click **Continue**.

If you're unsure of where the file was saved, check your Downloads folder.

### **4. Review**

Ghost will confirm the number of posts and pages that will be imported to your publication. If satisfied, click **Import content** to begin the import of your data.
