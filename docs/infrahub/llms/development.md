## Publishing a release[​](#publishing-a-release "Direct link to Publishing a release")

This section documents how to publish new releases of `infrahub-sync` to PyPI.

### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The project uses an automated release system powered by GitHub Actions. There are three ways to publish a release:

1. **Automated release** (recommended for regular releases)
2. **Manual GitHub release** (for controlled releases)
3. **Manual workflow dispatch** (for emergency or custom releases)

### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites-1 "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before publishing, ensure:

* You have write access to the repository
* The `PYPI_TOKEN` secret is configured in repository settings
* The `GH_INFRAHUB_BOT_TOKEN` secret is configured (for automated releases)

### Method 1: Automated release (recommended)[​](#method-1-automated-release-recommended "Direct link to Method 1: Automated release (recommended)")

This is the standard release flow. Releases are triggered automatically when PRs are merged to `main` or `stable` branches.

#### Step 1: Label your pull requests[​](#step-1-label-your-pull-requests "Direct link to Step 1: Label your pull requests")

Apply appropriate labels to PRs before merging. Labels determine the version bump:

| Label                                                                  | Version Bump          | Use When                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `changes/major`, `type/breaking-change`                                | Major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | Breaking API changes         |
| `changes/minor`, `type/feature`, `type/refactoring`                    | Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) | New features, refactoring    |
| `changes/patch`, `type/bug`, `type/housekeeping`, `type/documentation` | Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) | Bug fixes, docs, maintenance |

Auto-labeling rules are configured in `.github/release-drafter.yml` but require a separate workflow trigger to activate. For now, apply labels manually:

| PR Title Pattern                         | Recommended Label   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Contains `fix`                           | `type/bug`          |
| Contains `enhance`, `improve`, `feature` | `type/feature`      |
| Contains `chore`                         | `ci/skip-changelog` |
| Contains `deprecat`                      | `type/deprecated`   |

#### Step 2: Merge to main[​](#step-2-merge-to-main "Direct link to Step 2: Merge to main")

Merge your labeled PR to the `main` branch. The automation will:

1. Calculate the next version based on PR labels
2. Update `pyproject.toml` with the new version (and regenerate `uv.lock`)
3. Commit changes as `chore(release): v{VERSION} [skip ci]`
4. Create/update a draft GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes

#### Step 3: Publish the GitHub release[​](#step-3-publish-the-github-release "Direct link to Step 3: Publish the GitHub release")

1. Navigate to the repository's **Releases** page
2. Find the draft release created by Release Drafter
3. Review the auto-generated release notes
4. Edit if needed (add context, highlights, migration notes)
5. Click **Publish release**

Publishing the release triggers the PyPI upload automatically.

### Method 2: Manual GitHub release[​](#method-2-manual-github-release "Direct link to Method 2: Manual GitHub release")

Use this method when you want full control over the release timing and notes.

#### Step 1: Update the version[​](#step-1-update-the-version "Direct link to Step 1: Update the version")

Update the version in `pyproject.toml`:

```
# Edit pyproject.toml and update the version field
uv lock
```

Commit and push the changes:

```
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create a GitHub release[​](#step-2-create-a-github-release "Direct link to Step 2: Create a GitHub release")

1. Go to **Releases** → **Draft a new release**
2. Click **Choose a tag** and create a new tag matching your version (for example, `1.6.0`)
3. Set the target to `main` branch
4. Add a release title (for example, `1.6.0`)
5. Write release notes describing the changes
6. Click **Publish release**

This triggers the `trigger-release.yml` workflow, which publishes to PyPI.

### Method 3: Manual workflow dispatch[​](#method-3-manual-workflow-dispatch "Direct link to Method 3: Manual workflow dispatch")

Use this for emergency releases or when you need to bypass the standard flow.

#### Using the GitHub UI[​](#using-the-github-ui "Direct link to Using the GitHub UI")

1. Go to **Actions** → **Publish Infrahub Sync Package**

2. Click **Run workflow**

3. Configure the inputs:

   <!-- -->

   * `version`: The version string (for example, `1.6.0`) - optional, for labeling
   * `publish`: Set to `true` to publish to PyPI (default: `false`)
   * `runs-on`: OS for the runner (default: `ubuntu-22.04`)

4. Click **Run workflow**

#### Using the GitHub CLI[​](#using-the-github-cli "Direct link to Using the GitHub CLI")

```
gh workflow run workflow-publish.yml \
  --field version="1.6.0" \
  --field publish=true
```

**Important:** When using workflow dispatch, ensure `pyproject.toml` already has the correct version, as this method builds from the current code state.

### Release notes[​](#release-notes "Direct link to Release notes")

Release notes are auto-generated based on merged PRs and their labels:

| Category             | Labels                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Breaking Changes     | `changes/major`                                     |
| Minor Changes        | `changes/minor`, `type/feature`, `type/refactoring` |
| Patch & Bug Fixes    | `type/bug`, `changes/patch`                         |
| Documentation Change | `type/documentation`                                |

PRs with these labels are excluded from release notes:

* `ci/skip-changelog`
* `type/duplicate`

### Verifying a release[​](#verifying-a-release "Direct link to Verifying a release")

After publishing:

1. **Check PyPI**: Visit [pypi.org/project/infrahub-sync](https://pypi.org/project/infrahub-sync/) to confirm the new version is available
2. **Check GitHub Actions**: Ensure the publish workflow completed successfully
3. **Test Installation**:

```
pip install infrahub-sync==<new-version>
infrahub-sync --version
```

### Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

#### Release workflow skipped[​](#release-workflow-skipped "Direct link to Release workflow skipped")

The automated release is skipped when:

* The commit author is `opsmill-bot` with a `chore` prefix (prevents recursive releases)
* No version bump is detected (no labeled PRs since last release)
* Changes are only in the `docs/` directory

#### The PyPI upload failed[​](#the-pypi-upload-failed "Direct link to The PyPI upload failed")

Common causes:

* `PYPI_TOKEN` secret is missing or invalid
* Version already exists on PyPI (versions cannot be overwritten)
* Network issues during upload

To retry, use the manual workflow dispatch method.

#### Version not bumped correctly[​](#version-not-bumped-correctly "Direct link to Version not bumped correctly")

Ensure PRs have appropriate labels before merging. If labels are missing, the version drafter may not calculate a new version.

### Workflow files reference[​](#workflow-files-reference "Direct link to Workflow files reference")

| Workflow                       | Type                           | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger-push-stable.yml`      | Push to `main`/`stable`        | Calculates version, bumps `pyproject.toml`, triggers release draft     |
| `workflow-release-drafter.yml` | Reusable (`workflow_call`)     | Creates/updates GitHub Release draft; invoked by `trigger-release.yml` |
| `trigger-release.yml`          | GitHub Release published       | Orchestrates release: invokes release drafter and publish workflows    |
| `workflow-publish.yml`         | Reusable (`workflow_dispatch`) | Builds and publishes package to PyPI; invoked by `trigger-release.yml` |
