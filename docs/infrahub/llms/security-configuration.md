# Security Configuration and Best Practices

This document covers security considerations, TLS configuration, API token management, and best practices when using the Infrahub VSCode extension across different environments.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Infrahub VSCode extension handles connections to Infrahub servers which may contain sensitive infrastructure data. Proper security configuration ensures your connections are encrypted and authenticated appropriately for your environment.

## TLS certificate configuration[​](#tls-certificate-configuration "Direct link to TLS certificate configuration")

### Understanding TLS in the extension[​](#understanding-tls-in-the-extension "Direct link to Understanding TLS in the extension")

The extension connects to Infrahub servers over HTTPS using TLS encryption. By default, the extension verifies server certificates to ensure secure connections. However, development environments often use self-signed certificates that fail standard verification.

### Production environment (default secure settings)[​](#production-environment-default-secure-settings "Direct link to Production environment (default secure settings)")

For production environments, always use properly signed certificates:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.company.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
      // <!-- vale off -->tls_insecure<!-- vale on --> defaults to false - secure mode
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security Benefits:**

* Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
* Ensures server identity verification
* Maintains encryption integrity
* Complies with enterprise security policies

### Development environment (insecure mode)[​](#development-environment-insecure-mode "Direct link to Development environment (insecure mode)")

For development environments with self-signed certificates:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "https://dev.infrahub.local",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}",
      "<!-- vale off -->tls_insecure<!-- vale on -->": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**When to Use `<!-- vale off -->tls_insecure<!-- vale on -->: true`:**

* Local development servers with self-signed certificates
* Docker containers with self-generated certificates
* Internal testing environments with custom CA certificates
* Development environments where proper certificates aren't feasible

**Security Implications:**

* Disables certificate verification
* Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
* Should never be used in production
* Affects all HTTPS connections in the VSCode process

### Mixed environment configuration[​](#mixed-environment-configuration "Direct link to Mixed environment configuration")

You can configure different TLS settings for different environments:

```
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "address": "https://infrahub.company.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN}"
      // Secure by default
    },
    {
      "name": "Staging",
      "address": "https://staging.infrahub.company.com",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN}"
      // Uses proper certificates
    },
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "address": "https://dev.infrahub.local:8000",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN}",
      "<!-- vale off -->tls_insecure<!-- vale on -->": true
      // Allows self-signed certificates
    }
  ]
}
```

### How TLS configuration works internally[​](#how-tls-configuration-works-internally "Direct link to How TLS configuration works internally")

When any server has `<!-- vale off -->tls_insecure<!-- vale on -->: true`:

1. **Environment Variable**: Sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0'`
2. **Global Effect**: Affects all HTTPS connections in the VSCode process
3. **Restoration**: Original setting restored when extension deactivates
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes apply immediately when configuration updates

This approach was chosen to ensure compatibility with the Infrahub SDK and provide reliable certificate bypassing when needed.

## API token security[​](#api-token-security "Direct link to API token security")

### Token storage best practices[​](#token-storage-best-practices "Direct link to Token storage best practices")

#### ❌ Don't store tokens directly[​](#-dont-store-tokens-directly "Direct link to ❌ Don't store tokens directly")

```
// NEVER do this - tokens visible in settings
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "api_token": "inf_1234567890abcdef"  // Visible in settings!
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ✅ Use Environment Variables[​](#-use-environment-variables "Direct link to ✅ Use Environment Variables")

```
// Secure approach - tokens in environment variables
{
  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN}"  // References environment
    }
  ]
}
```

### Setting up environment variables[​](#setting-up-environment-variables "Direct link to Setting up environment variables")

#### macOS and Linux[​](#macos-and-linux "Direct link to macOS and Linux")

Add to your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```
# Development environment
export INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN="inf_dev_1234567890abcdef"

# Staging environment  
export INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN="inf_staging_1234567890abcdef"

# Production environment
export INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN="inf_prod_1234567890abcdef"
```

#### Windows[​](#windows "Direct link to Windows")

Using PowerShell:

```
# Set user-level environment variables
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_DEV_TOKEN', 'inf_dev_1234567890abcdef', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_STAGING_TOKEN', 'inf_staging_1234567890abcdef', 'User')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN', 'inf_prod_1234567890abcdef', 'User')
```

### Token management best practices[​](#token-management-best-practices "Direct link to Token management best practices")

#### Token rotation[​](#token-rotation "Direct link to Token rotation")

Regularly rotate API tokens:

```
# Example rotation script
#!/bin/bash
# Generate new token via Infrahub API or web interface
NEW_TOKEN="inf_new_token_here"

# Update environment variable
export INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN="$NEW_TOKEN"

# Update your shell configuration
echo "export INFRAHUB_PROD_TOKEN=\"$NEW_TOKEN\"" >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### Minimal permissions[​](#minimal-permissions "Direct link to Minimal permissions")

Create tokens with minimal required permissions:

* **Read-only tokens** for query execution
* **Limited scope tokens** for specific resources
* **Separate tokens** for each environment
* **Short-lived tokens** for temporary access

#### Token security checklist[​](#token-security-checklist "Direct link to Token security checklist")

* <!-- -->
  Tokens stored in environment variables, not settings files
* <!-- -->
  Different tokens for each environment (dev, staging, prod)
* <!-- -->
  Tokens have minimal required permissions
* <!-- -->
  Regular token rotation schedule established
* <!-- -->
  Tokens excluded from version control (`.env` files in `.gitignore`)
* <!-- -->
  Access to tokens limited to authorized personnel

### Firewall and proxy configuration[​](#firewall-and-proxy-configuration "Direct link to Firewall and proxy configuration")

#### Corporate proxy settings[​](#corporate-proxy-settings "Direct link to Corporate proxy settings")

If behind a corporate proxy, VSCode inherits system proxy settings. For manual configuration:

```
{
  "http.proxy": "http://proxy.company.com:8080",
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": true,
  "http.proxyAuthorization": null
}
```

#### Network access requirements[​](#network-access-requirements "Direct link to Network access requirements")

  "infrahub-vscode.servers": [
    {
      "name": "Internal Production",
      "address": "https://internal.infrahub.corp",
      "api_token": "${env:INFRAHUB_INTERNAL_TOKEN}"
      // Ensure VPN is connected before use
    }
  ]
}
```
