# Cisco ACI adapter

## What is Cisco ACI?[​](#what-is-cisco-aci "Direct link to What is Cisco ACI?")

The *Cisco ACI* is a software-defined networking (SDN) solution that provides a policy-based, application-centric approach to managing and orchestrating network infrastructure. It is commonly used in data centers for scalable, policy-driven networking.

## Sync direction[​](#sync-direction "Direct link to Sync direction")

Cisco ACI → Infrahub

note

Currently, the Cisco ACI adapter supports only **one-way synchronization** from ACI to Infrahub. Syncing data back into ACI is not yet supported.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

The adapter reads connection settings from the synchronization configuration and can be overridden by environment variables. Credentials should be provided via a secret manager or environment variables in production.

### Configuration parameters[​](#configuration-parameters "Direct link to Configuration parameters")

```
---
name: from-cisco-aci
source:
  name: aci
  settings:
    url: "https://<APIC_CONTROLLER>"
    username: "<USER>"
    password: "<PASSWORD>"
    api_endpoint: "api"   # optional, default: api
    verify: true          # boolean or string ("false","0") accepted
```

### Environment variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment variables")

* CISCO\_APIC\_URL: overrides settings.url
* CISCO\_APIC\_USERNAME: overrides settings.username
* CISCO\_APIC\_PASSWORD: overrides settings.password
* CISCO\_APIC\_VERIFY: overrides settings.verify; accepts true/false/0/1 (strings are normalized)

Notes:

* Credentials must come from environment variables or a secret manager in production. Never commit secrets.
* The adapter normalizes verify to a boolean (strings like false, 0, no are treated as False).
* The adapter records login timestamps in UTC to avoid timezone related issues and ensure correct token refresh behavior.

### Schema mapping examples[​](#schema-mapping-examples "Direct link to Schema mapping examples")

#### Basic device mapping[​](#basic-device-mapping "Direct link to Basic device mapping")

```
- name: DcimPhysicalDevice
  mapping: "class/fabricNode.json"
  identifiers: ["name"]
  fields:
    - name: name
      mapping: "fabricNode.attributes.name"
    - name: serial
      mapping: "fabricNode.attributes.serial"
    - name: role
      mapping: "fabricNode.attributes.role"
  filters:
    - field: "fabricNode.attributes.fabricSt"
      operation: "=="
      value: "active"
```

#### Interface mapping with ACI Jinja filter[​](#interface-mapping-with-aci-jinja-filter "Direct link to Interface mapping with ACI Jinja filter")

```
- name: DcimPhysicalInterface
  mapping: "class/l1PhysIf.json"
  identifiers: ["device", "name"]
  fields:
    - name: name
      mapping: "l1PhysIf.attributes.id"
    - name: device
      mapping: "l1PhysIf.attributes.dn"
      reference: DcimPhysicalDevice
    - name: description
      mapping: "l1PhysIf.attributes.descr"
  transforms:
    - field: device
      expression: "{{ l1PhysIf.attributes.dn.split('/')[2].replace('node-', '') | aci_device_name }}"
    - field: status
      expression: "{{ 'active' if l1PhysIf.attributes.adminSt == 'up' else 'free' }}"
  filters:
    - field: "l1PhysIf.attributes.id"
      operation: "contains"
      value: "eth"
```

## ACI-specific Jinja filters[​](#aci-specific-jinja-filters "Direct link to ACI-specific Jinja filters")

The ACI adapter provides custom Jinja filters for data transformation:

### `aci_device_name` filter[​](#aci_device_name-filter "Direct link to aci_device_name-filter")

The `aci_device_name` filter resolves ACI node IDs to device names automatically. This is particularly useful when mapping physical interfaces to their parent devices.

**Usage:**

```
{{ node_id | aci_device_name }}
```

**Example:**

* Input: `"102"` (ACI node ID)
* Output: `"spine-102"` (actual device name from ACI)

**Common use case in transforms:**

```
transforms:
  - field: device
    expression: "{{ l1PhysIf.attributes.dn.split('/')[2].replace('node-', '') | aci_device_name }}"
```

This transform:

1. Extracts the node ID from the ACI Distinguished Name (DN)
2. Removes the `"node-"` prefix (for example: `"node-102"` → `"102"`)
3. Uses the `aci_device_name` filter to resolve the node ID to the actual device name

**How it works:**

* The adapter automatically queries the ACI `fabricNode` class during initialization
* Builds a mapping of node IDs to device names
* The filter performs a lookup with a fallback to the original node ID if not found

## Generating the models[​](#generating-the-models "Direct link to Generating the models")

Use the generate command to produce models from the schema mapping and examples:

```
poetry run infrahub-sync generate --name from-cisco-aci --directory examples/
```

## Common issues and troubleshooting[​](#common-issues-and-troubleshooting "Direct link to Common issues and troubleshooting")

### Authentication and connectivity[​](#authentication-and-connectivity "Direct link to Authentication and connectivity")

* If you see token refresh errors, ensure the APIC response includes refreshTimeoutSeconds; the adapter forces re-login when refresh data is unavailable.
* For TLS verification problems, set CISCO\_APIC\_VERIFY to false in a secure environment (use with caution).

### Device reference resolution[​](#device-reference-resolution "Direct link to Device reference resolution")

* **Interface-device relationship errors**: If you see "Unable to locate the node device" errors, ensure:

  <!-- -->

  * The `DcimPhysicalDevice` mapping runs before `DcimPhysicalInterface` in the `order` configuration
  * The device transform uses the `aci_device_name` filter correctly: `{{ node_id | aci_device_name }}`
  * The ACI fabric node query succeeds (check logs for "Built ACI device mapping" messages)

### Jinja filter issues[​](#jinja-filter-issues "Direct link to Jinja filter issues")

* **`aci_device_name` filter not found**: Ensure you're using the ACI adapter and the filter is correctly spelled

* **Filter returns node ID instead of device name**: Check that the fabric node query succeeded during adapter initialization

* **Transform expression errors**: Verify the DN parsing logic extracts the correct node ID:

  ```
  expression: "{{ l1PhysIf.attributes.dn.split('/')[2].replace('node-', '') | aci_device_name }}"
  ```

### General debugging[​](#general-debugging "Direct link to General debugging")

* Enable DEBUG logging for the adapter to see raw fetched objects and mapping decisions. Logs will not include secrets.
* Check the device mapping build process in logs: look for "Built ACI device mapping with X entries"
