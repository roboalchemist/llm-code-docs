# Infrahub adapter

## What is Infrahub?[​](#what-is-infrahub "Direct link to What is Infrahub?")

Infrahub is an open-source infrastructure management platform that combines a version-controlled database with a schema-driven data model. It serves as the central hub for network automation, providing a single source of truth for infrastructure data.

## Requirements[​](#requirements "Direct link to Requirements")

This adapter uses the [Infrahub SDK](https://pypi.org/project/infrahub-sdk), which is included as a dependency of infrahub-sync.

## Sync directions supported[​](#sync-directions-supported "Direct link to Sync directions supported")

* Source: Infrahub can be used as a data source
* Destination: Infrahub is the primary destination for most sync configurations

info

The Infrahub adapter supports **bidirectional synchronization**. Most commonly, Infrahub is used as the destination, receiving data from other systems like NetBox, Nautobot, or IP Fabric.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

The adapter reads connection settings from the synchronization configuration and can be overridden by environment variables.

\*Can be provided via environment variables instead.

## Schema mapping[​](#schema-mapping "Direct link to Schema mapping")

When Infrahub is used as a destination, the schema mapping defines how source data maps to Infrahub node types. The `name` field in schema\_mapping corresponds to the Infrahub schema kind.

### Basic example[​](#basic-example "Direct link to Basic example")

```
schema_mapping:
  - name: InfraDevice
    mapping: dcim.devices
    identifiers: ["name"]
    fields:
      - name: name
        mapping: name
      - name: description
        mapping: description
      - name: status
        mapping: status.value

  - name: InfraInterface
    mapping: dcim.interfaces
    identifiers: ["device", "name"]
    fields:
      - name: name
        mapping: name
      - name: device
        mapping: device.name
        reference: InfraDevice
```

### Relationship handling[​](#relationship-handling "Direct link to Relationship handling")

The Infrahub adapter automatically resolves relationships based on the schema:

* **One-to-one relationships**: Resolved using the unique identifier of the related node
* **One-to-many relationships**: Resolved as a list of unique identifiers

```
fields:
  # One-to-one relationship
  - name: site
    mapping: site.name
    reference: LocationSite

  # One-to-many relationship
  - name: tags
    mapping: tags
    reference: BuiltinTag
```

## Lineage tracking[​](#lineage-tracking "Direct link to Lineage tracking")

When syncing data into Infrahub, the adapter tracks the source and owner of each record using Infrahub's lineage system. This enables:

* Tracking which system created each record
* Protecting source-managed attributes from manual edits
* Assigning ownership to teams or groups

### Default behavior[​](#default-behavior "Direct link to Default behavior")

By default, the adapter looks for a `CoreAccount` with a name matching the source adapter name. This account is used as both the source and owner for all synced attributes.

### Using account groups[​](#using-account-groups "Direct link to Using account groups")

You can override the default behavior by specifying `source` and/or `owner` in the destination settings. When specified, these values are used to look up a `CoreAccountGroup` by name:

```
destination:
  name: infrahub
  settings:
    url: "http://localhost:8000"
    token: "<TOKEN>"
    source: "data-sync"      # Uses CoreAccountGroup "data-sync" as source
    owner: "network-team"    # Uses CoreAccountGroup "network-team" as owner
```

This allows you to:

* Use different groups for source and owner
* Override only one while keeping the default account for the other
* Assign ownership to a team rather than an individual account

| Configuration           | Source                    | Owner                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Neither specified       | CoreAccount (source name) | CoreAccount (source name) |
| Only `source` specified | CoreAccountGroup          | CoreAccount (source name) |
| Only `owner` specified  | CoreAccount (source name) | CoreAccountGroup          |
| Both specified          | CoreAccountGroup          | CoreAccountGroup          |

## Generating the models[​](#generating-the-models "Direct link to Generating the models")

Use the generate command to produce Python models from your configuration:

```
poetry run infrahub-sync generate --name from-netbox --directory examples/
```

## Common issues and troubleshooting[​](#common-issues-and-troubleshooting "Direct link to Common issues and troubleshooting")

### Authentication errors[​](#authentication-errors "Direct link to Authentication errors")

* Verify `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN` is set correctly
* Ensure the token has appropriate permissions for the target branch
* Check that `INFRAHUB_ADDRESS` points to the correct server

### Schema mismatch errors[​](#schema-mismatch-errors "Direct link to Schema mismatch errors")

* Ensure your Infrahub schema matches the expected node types in schema\_mapping
* Run `infrahubctl schema load` to update the schema if needed
* Verify field names match the Infrahub schema attribute names

### Relationship resolution failures[​](#relationship-resolution-failures "Direct link to Relationship resolution failures")

* Ensure referenced objects are synced before objects that reference them (check `order` in configuration)
* Verify the unique identifier used in references matches the target object's identifier
* Check logs for "Unable to find ... in the Store" messages

### Branch operations[​](#branch-operations "Direct link to Branch operations")

* Verify the target branch exists in Infrahub
* Use `infrahubctl branch list` to see available branches
* Create branches with `infrahubctl branch create <name>` if needed

### SSL certificate issues[​](#ssl-certificate-issues "Direct link to SSL certificate issues")

* Set `verify_ssl: false` in settings for self-signed certificates (development only)
* For production, ensure proper CA certificates are installed
