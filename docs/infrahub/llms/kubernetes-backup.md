# How to backup Infrahub on Kubernetes

This guide walks you through backing up your Infrahub instance running on Kubernetes using the `infrahub-backup` Helm chart. If you deploy Infrahub through GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux and don't have direct kubectl access, this approach lets you manage backups declaratively through Helm values.

## Why use the Helm chart for backups[​](#why-use-the-helm-chart-for-backups "Direct link to Why use the Helm chart for backups")

The Helm chart approach offers several advantages over running `infrahub-backup` directly:

* **No kubectl access required** - Deploy backups through your existing GitOps pipeline
* **Declarative configuration** - Backup settings are version-controlled alongside your Infrahub deployment
* **Scheduled backups** - Built-in CronJob support for automated periodic backups
* **S3 integration** - Push backups directly to S3-compatible storage without manual transfers

## High availability (CloudNativePG)[​](#high-availability-cloudnativepg "Direct link to High availability (CloudNativePG)")

For Kubernetes deployments using HA PostgreSQL, `infrahub-backup` supports [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) clusters. CloudNativePG is the only supported HA PostgreSQL operator.

When multiple `task-manager-db` pods are detected, the tool automatically identifies the primary instance using the `cnpg.io/instanceRole` pod label and targets it for backup and restore operations. No additional configuration is required — HA detection is transparent.

info

If you are using a different PostgreSQL HA operator, you must ensure a single `task-manager-db` pod is available during backup and restore operations.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before configuring backups:

* Infrahub is deployed on Kubernetes via the Infrahub Helm chart
* You have access to modify Helm values (directly or through GitOps)
* For S3 storage: An S3-compatible bucket and credentials

## Installation methods[​](#installation-methods "Direct link to Installation methods")

* Via Infrahub Helm Chart (Recommended)
* Standalone Chart

The recommended approach is to enable the backup functionality as a subchart within your existing Infrahub Helm deployment:

```
# values.yaml for Infrahub Helm chart
infrahub-backup:
  enabled: true

  backup:
    enabled: true
    mode: "cronjob"
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"

    storage:
      type: "s3"
      s3:
        bucket: "my-infrahub-backups"
        endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
        region: "us-east-1"
        secretName: "backup-s3-credentials"
```

This method ensures the backup job runs in the same namespace as your Infrahub deployment and automatically has access to the correct service names.

For advanced use cases, you can install the `infrahub-backup` chart separately:

```
# Install the backup chart
helm install infrahub-backup oci://registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/chart/infrahub-backup \
  --namespace infrahub \
  --values backup-values.yaml
```

When using the standalone chart, ensure it's deployed in the same namespace as your Infrahub instance.

## Step 1: Configure backup settings[​](#step-1-configure-backup-settings "Direct link to Step 1: Configure backup settings")

Choose between one-shot backups or scheduled backups based on your needs.

### One-shot backup (Job)[​](#one-shot-backup-job "Direct link to One-shot backup (Job)")

For a single backup operation, use `mode: "job"`:

```
infrahub-backup:
  enabled: true

  backup:
    enabled: true
    mode: "job"

    storage:
      type: "s3"
      s3:
        bucket: "my-infrahub-backups"
        endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
        region: "us-east-1"
        secretName: "backup-s3-credentials"
```

The Job runs once when deployed and creates a single backup.

### Scheduled backup (CronJob)[​](#scheduled-backup-cronjob "Direct link to Scheduled backup (CronJob)")

For automated periodic backups, use `mode: "cronjob"` with a schedule:

```
infrahub-backup:
  enabled: true

  backup:
    enabled: true
    mode: "cronjob"
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM

    storage:
      type: "s3"
      s3:
        bucket: "my-infrahub-backups"
        endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
        region: "us-east-1"
        secretName: "backup-s3-credentials"
```

Common schedule examples:

| Schedule      | Description                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `0 2 * * *`   | Daily at 2:00 AM              |
| `0 */6 * * *` | Every 6 hours                 |
| `0 2 * * 0`   | Weekly on Sunday at 2:00 AM   |
| `0 2 1 * *`   | Monthly on the 1st at 2:00 AM |

### Backup options[​](#backup-options "Direct link to Backup options")

Fine-tune the backup behavior with additional options:

```
infrahub-backup:
  backup:
    options:
      force: false              # Proceed even if tasks are running
      excludeTaskmanager: false # Skip PostgreSQL backup
      neo4jMetadata: "all"      # Options: all, none, users, roles
```

## Step 2: Configure storage[​](#step-2-configure-storage "Direct link to Step 2: Configure storage")

* S3-Compatible Storage (Recommended)
* Local Storage

For production deployments, store backups in S3-compatible storage:

### Create the S3 credentials secret[​](#create-the-s3-credentials-secret "Direct link to Create the S3 credentials secret")

```
kubectl create secret generic backup-s3-credentials \
  --namespace infrahub \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Configure S3 storage in values[​](#configure-s3-storage-in-values "Direct link to Configure S3 storage in values")

```
infrahub-backup:
  backup:
    storage:
      type: "s3"
      s3:
        bucket: "my-infrahub-backups"
        endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
        region: "us-east-1"
        secretName: "backup-s3-credentials"
```

### S3-compatible providers[​](#s3-compatible-providers "Direct link to S3-compatible providers")

The chart works with any S3-compatible storage:

| Provider | Endpoint Example            |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| AWS S3   | `https://s3.amazonaws.com`  |
| MinIO    | `https://minio.example.com` |

For testing or simple setups, store backups locally in the pod:

```
infrahub-backup:
  backup:
    storage:
      type: "local"
      path: "/infrahub_backups"
```

warning

With local storage, backups are stored in an `emptyDir` volume and lost when the pod terminates. You must manually copy the backup file from the pod before it completes.

### Retrieve backup from pod[​](#retrieve-backup-from-pod "Direct link to Retrieve backup from pod")

```
# Find the backup pod
kubectl get pods -n infrahub -l app.kubernetes.io/name=infrahub-backup

# Copy the backup file
kubectl cp infrahub/infrahub-backup-xxxxx:/infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250120_020000.tar.gz ./backup.tar.gz
```

## Step 3: Deploy the backup[​](#step-3-deploy-the-backup "Direct link to Step 3: Deploy the backup")

* Via Infrahub Helm Chart
* Standalone Chart

Update your Infrahub Helm release with the backup configuration:

```
helm upgrade infrahub oci://registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/chart/infrahub \
  --namespace infrahub \
  --values values.yaml
```

Or if using GitOps, commit the values changes and let ArgoCD/Flux sync.

Install or upgrade the standalone backup chart:

```
helm upgrade --install infrahub-backup oci://registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/chart/infrahub-backup \
  --namespace infrahub \
  --values backup-values.yaml
```

## Step 4: Monitor backup progress[​](#step-4-monitor-backup-progress "Direct link to Step 4: Monitor backup progress")

### Check backup status[​](#check-backup-status "Direct link to Check backup status")

```
# For CronJob - list recent jobs
kubectl get jobs -n infrahub -l app.kubernetes.io/name=infrahub-backup

# For one-shot Job
kubectl get job infrahub-backup -n infrahub
```

### View backup logs[​](#view-backup-logs "Direct link to View backup logs")

```
# Get the pod name
kubectl get pods -n infrahub -l app.kubernetes.io/name=infrahub-backup

# View logs
kubectl logs -n infrahub -l app.kubernetes.io/name=infrahub-backup --tail=100 -f
```

Expected output for a successful backup:

```
INFO[0000] Starting backup process...
INFO[0000] Checking for running tasks...
INFO[0001] No running tasks found
INFO[0001] Creating backup ID: 20250120_020000
INFO[0002] Backing up Neo4j database...
INFO[0015] Neo4j backup completed (1.2GB)
INFO[0015] Backing up PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0018] PostgreSQL backup completed (256MB)
INFO[0020] Creating compressed archive...
INFO[0025] Uploading to S3: s3://my-infrahub-backups/infrahub_backup_20250120_020000.tar.gz
INFO[0030] Upload completed successfully
INFO[0030] Backup completed successfully
```

## Step 5: Verify the backup[​](#step-5-verify-the-backup "Direct link to Step 5: Verify the backup")

### For S3 storage[​](#for-s3-storage "Direct link to For S3 storage")

Verify the backup exists in your S3 bucket:

```
# Using AWS CLI
aws s3 ls s3://my-infrahub-backups/

# Using MinIO client
mc ls myminio/my-infrahub-backups/
```

### Validate backup integrity[​](#validate-backup-integrity "Direct link to Validate backup integrity")

Download and verify a backup:

```
# Download
aws s3 cp s3://my-infrahub-backups/infrahub_backup_20250120_020000.tar.gz ./

# Verify archive
tar -tzf infrahub_backup_20250120_020000.tar.gz > /dev/null && echo "Archive is valid"

# View metadata
tar -xzOf infrahub_backup_20250120_020000.tar.gz backup_information.json | jq '.'
```

## Understanding permissions[​](#understanding-permissions "Direct link to Understanding permissions")

The Helm chart creates a ServiceAccount with the required RBAC permissions to perform backups.

### Default behavior[​](#default-behavior "Direct link to Default behavior")

By default, the chart creates:

* A ServiceAccount named `infrahub-backup`
* A Role with required permissions
* A RoleBinding linking the ServiceAccount to the Role

### Required permissions[​](#required-permissions "Direct link to Required permissions")

The backup process needs these Kubernetes permissions:

| Resource       | Verbs      | Purpose                         |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `pods`         | list, get  | Discover Infrahub pods          |
| `pods/exec`    | create     | Execute backup commands in pods |
| `deployments`  | get, patch | Scale down/up during backup     |
| `statefulsets` | get, patch | Scale down/up during backup     |
| `pods/log`     | get        | Monitor backup progress         |

### Using an existing ServiceAccount[​](#using-an-existing-serviceaccount "Direct link to Using an existing ServiceAccount")

If your security policy requires using a pre-existing ServiceAccount:

```
infrahub-backup:
  serviceAccount:
    create: false
    name: "my-existing-serviceaccount"

  rbac:
    create: false  # Assumes permissions already exist
```

### Cloud provider integration[​](#cloud-provider-integration "Direct link to Cloud provider integration")

Add annotations for cloud provider IAM integration:

```
infrahub-backup:
  serviceAccount:
    annotations:
      # AWS IRSA
      eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/infrahub-backup"
      # GCP Workload Identity
      iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: "infrahub-backup@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

## Validation[​](#validation "Direct link to Validation")

Confirm your backup configuration works:

* <!-- -->
  Backup Job/CronJob is created in the correct namespace
* <!-- -->
  ServiceAccount has required RBAC permissions
* <!-- -->
  S3 credentials secret exists and is correctly referenced
* <!-- -->
  Backup completes without errors in logs
* <!-- -->
  Backup file appears in S3 bucket (or can be retrieved from pod for local storage)
* <!-- -->
  Backup archive passes integrity check
* <!-- -->
  Backup metadata contains expected components
