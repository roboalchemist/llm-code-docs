_class_ kafka.KafkaProducer[_**configs_]([source)](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer "Link to this definition")
A Kafka client that publishes records to the Kafka cluster.

The producer is thread safe and sharing a single producer instance across threads will generally be faster than having multiple instances.

The producer consists of a RecordAccumulator which holds records that haven’t yet been transmitted to the server, and a Sender background I/O thread that is responsible for turning these records into requests and transmitting them to the cluster.

[`send()`](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.send "kafka.KafkaProducer.send") is asynchronous. When called it adds the record to a buffer of pending record sends and immediately returns. This allows the producer to batch together individual records for efficiency.

The ‘acks’ config controls the criteria under which requests are considered complete. The “all” setting will result in blocking on the full commit of the record, the slowest but most durable setting.

If the request fails, the producer can automatically retry, unless ‘retries’ is configured to 0. Enabling retries also opens up the possibility of duplicates (see the documentation on message delivery semantics for details: [https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#semantics](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#semantics) ).

The producer maintains buffers of unsent records for each partition. These buffers are of a size specified by the ‘batch_size’ config. Making this larger can result in more batching, but requires more memory (since we will generally have one of these buffers for each active partition).

By default a buffer is available to send immediately even if there is additional unused space in the buffer. However if you want to reduce the number of requests you can set ‘linger_ms’ to something greater than 0. This will instruct the producer to wait up to that number of milliseconds before sending a request in hope that more records will arrive to fill up the same batch. This is analogous to Nagle’s algorithm in TCP. Note that records that arrive close together in time will generally batch together even with linger_ms=0 so under heavy load batching will occur regardless of the linger configuration; however setting this to something larger than 0 can lead to fewer, more efficient requests when not under maximal load at the cost of a small amount of latency.

The key_serializer and value_serializer instruct how to turn the key and value objects the user provides into bytes.

From Kafka 0.11, the KafkaProducer supports two additional modes: the idempotent producer and the transactional producer. The idempotent producer strengthens Kafka’s delivery semantics from at least once to exactly once delivery. In particular, producer retries will no longer introduce duplicates. The transactional producer allows an application to send messages to multiple partitions (and topics!) atomically.

To enable idempotence, the enable_idempotence configuration must be set to True. If set, the retries config will default to float(‘inf’) and the acks config will default to ‘all’. There are no API changes for the idempotent producer, so existing applications will not need to be modified to take advantage of this feature.

To take advantage of the idempotent producer, it is imperative to avoid application level re-sends since these cannot be de-duplicated. As such, if an application enables idempotence, it is recommended to leave the retries config unset, as it will be defaulted to float(‘inf’). Additionally, if a [`send()`](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.send "kafka.KafkaProducer.send") returns an error even with infinite retries (for instance if the message expires in the buffer before being sent), then it is recommended to shut down the producer and check the contents of the last produced message to ensure that it is not duplicated. Finally, the producer can only guarantee idempotence for messages sent within a single session.

To use the transactional producer and the attendant APIs, you must set the transactional_id configuration property. If the transactional_id is set, idempotence is automatically enabled along with the producer configs which idempotence depends on. Further, topics which are included in transactions should be configured for durability. In particular, the replication.factor should be at least 3, and the min.insync.replicas for these topics should be set to 2. Finally, in order for transactional guarantees to be realized from end-to-end, the consumers must be configured to read only committed messages as well.

The purpose of the transactional_id is to enable transaction recovery across multiple sessions of a single producer instance. It would typically be derived from the shard identifier in a partitioned, stateful, application. As such, it should be unique to each producer instance running within a partitioned application.

Keyword Arguments:

* **bootstrap_servers** – ‘host[:port]’ string (or list of ‘host[:port]’ strings) that the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata. This does not have to be the full node list. It just needs to have at least one broker that will respond to a Metadata API Request. Default port is 9092. If no servers are specified, will default to localhost:9092.

* **client_id** (_str_) – a name for this client. This string is passed in each request to servers and can be used to identify specific server-side log entries that correspond to this client. Default: ‘kafka-python-producer-#’ (appended with a unique number per instance)

* **key_serializer** (_callable_) – used to convert user-supplied keys to bytes If not None, called as f(key), should return bytes. Default: None.

* **value_serializer** (_callable_) – used to convert user-supplied message values to bytes. If not None, called as f(value), should return bytes. Default: None.

* **transactional_id** (_str_) – Enable transactional producer with a unique identifier. This will be used to identify the same producer instance across process restarts. Default: None.

* **enable_idempotence** (_bool_) –

When set to True, the producer will ensure that exactly one copy of each message is written in the stream. If False, producer retries due to broker failures, etc., may write duplicates of the retried message in the stream. Default: True if transactional_id is provided, otherwise False.

Note that enabling idempotence requires max_in_flight_requests_per_connection to be set to 1 and retries cannot be zero. Additionally, acks must be set to ‘all’. If these values are left at their defaults, the producer will override the defaults to be suitable. If the values are set to something incompatible with the idempotent producer, a KafkaConfigurationError will be raised.

* **delivery_timeout_ms** (_float_) – An upper bound on the time to report success or failure after producer.send() returns. This limits the total time that a record will be delayed prior to sending, the time to await acknowledgement from the broker (if expected), and the time allowed for retriable send failures. The producer may report failure to send a record earlier than this config if either an unrecoverable error is encountered, the retries have been exhausted, or the record is added to a batch which reached an earlier delivery expiration deadline. The value of this config should be greater than or equal to the sum of (request_timeout_ms + linger_ms). Default: 120000.

* **acks** (_0_ _,_ _1_ _,_ _'all'_) –

The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are common:

0: Producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server.
The message will immediately be added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won’t generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.

1: Wait for leader to write the record to its local log only.
Broker will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.

all: Wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to write the record.
This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee.

If unset, defaults to acks=1.

* **compression_type** (_str_) – The compression type for all data generated by the producer. Valid values are ‘gzip’, ‘snappy’, ‘lz4’, ‘zstd’ or None. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression). Default: None.

* **retries** (_numeric_) – Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting max_in_flight_requests_per_connection to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. Note additionally that produce requests will be failed before the number of retries has been exhausted if the timeout configured by delivery_timeout_ms expires first before successful acknowledgement. Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use delivery_timeout_ms to control retry behavior. Default: float(‘inf’) (infinite)

* **batch_size** (_int_) – Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent. A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). Default: 16384

* **linger_ms** (_int_) – The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay; that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle’s algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get batch_size worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will ‘linger’ for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting linger_ms=5 would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absence of load. Default: 0.

* **partitioner** (_callable_) – Callable used to determine which partition each message is assigned to. Called (after key serialization): partitioner(key_bytes, all_partitions, available_partitions). The default partitioner implementation hashes each non-None key using the same murmur2 algorithm as the java client so that messages with the same key are assigned to the same partition. When a key is None, the message is delivered to a random partition (filtered to partitions with available leaders only, if possible).

* **connections_max_idle_ms** – Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config. The broker closes idle connections after connections.max.idle.ms, so this avoids hitting unexpected socket disconnected errors on the client. Default: 540000

* **max_block_ms** (_int_) – Number of milliseconds to block during [`send()`](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.send "kafka.KafkaProducer.send") and [`partitions_for()`](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.partitions_for "kafka.KafkaProducer.partitions_for"). These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata unavailable. Blocking in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner will not be counted against this timeout. Default: 60000.

* **max_request_size** (_int_) – The maximum size of a request. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server has its own cap on record size which may be different from this. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. Default: 1048576.

* **allow_auto_create_topics** (_bool_) – Enable/disable auto topic creation on metadata request. Only available with api_version >= (0, 11). Default: True

* **metadata_max_age_ms** (_int_) – The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven’t seen any partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or partitions. Default: 300000

* **retry_backoff_ms** (_int_) – Milliseconds to backoff when retrying on errors. Default: 100.

* **request_timeout_ms** (_int_) – Client request timeout in milliseconds. Default: 30000.

* **receive_buffer_bytes** (_int_) – The size of the TCP receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to use when reading data. Default: None (relies on system defaults). Java client defaults to 32768.

* **send_buffer_bytes** (_int_) – The size of the TCP send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) to use when sending data. Default: None (relies on system defaults). Java client defaults to 131072.

* **socket_options** (_list_) – List of tuple-arguments to socket.setsockopt to apply to broker connection sockets. Default: [(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)]

* **reconnect_backoff_ms** (_int_) – The amount of time in milliseconds to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host. Default: 50.

* **reconnect_backoff_max_ms** (_int_) – The maximum amount of time in milliseconds to backoff/wait when reconnecting to a broker that has repeatedly failed to connect. If provided, the backoff per host will increase exponentially for each consecutive connection failure, up to this maximum. Once the maximum is reached, reconnection attempts will continue periodically with this fixed rate. To avoid connection storms, a randomization factor of 0.2 will be applied to the backoff resulting in a random range between 20% below and 20% above the computed value. Default: 30000.

* **max_in_flight_requests_per_connection** (_int_) – Requests are pipelined to kafka brokers up to this number of maximum requests per broker connection. Note that if this setting is set to be greater than 1 and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled). Default: 5.

* **security_protocol** (_str_) – Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL. Default: PLAINTEXT.

* **ssl_context** (_ssl.SSLContext_) – pre-configured SSLContext for wrapping socket connections. If provided, all other ssl_* configurations will be ignored. Default: None.

* **ssl_check_hostname** (_bool_) – flag to configure whether ssl handshake should verify that the certificate matches the brokers hostname. Default: True.

* **ssl_cafile** (_str_) – optional filename of ca file to use in certificate verification. Default: None.

* **ssl_certfile** (_str_) – optional filename of file in pem format containing the client certificate, as well as any ca certificates needed to establish the certificate’s authenticity. Default: None.

* **ssl_keyfile** (_str_) – optional filename containing the client private key. Default: None.

* **ssl_password** (_str_) – optional password to be used when loading the certificate chain. Default: None.

* **ssl_crlfile** (_str_) – optional filename containing the CRL to check for certificate expiration. By default, no CRL check is done. When providing a file, only the leaf certificate will be checked against this CRL. Default: None.

* **ssl_ciphers** (_str_) – optionally set the available ciphers for ssl connections. It should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format. If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an ssl.SSLError will be raised. See ssl.SSLContext.set_ciphers

* **api_version** (_tuple_) –

Specify which Kafka API version to use. If set to None, the client will attempt to determine the broker version via ApiVersionsRequest API or, for brokers earlier than 0.10, probing various known APIs. Dynamic version checking is performed eagerly during **init** and can raise NoBrokersAvailableError if no connection was made before timeout (see api_version_auto_timeout_ms below). Different versions enable different functionality.

Examples

(3, 9) most recent broker release, enable all supported features (0, 11) enables message format v2 (internal) (0, 10, 0) enables sasl authentication and message format v1 (0, 8, 0) enables basic functionality only

Default: None

* **api_version_auto_timeout_ms** (_int_) – number of milliseconds to throw a timeout exception from the constructor when checking the broker api version. Only applies if api_version set to None. Default: 2000

* **metric_reporters** (_list_) – A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the AbstractMetricsReporter interface allows plugging in classes that will be notified of new metric creation. Default: []

* **metrics_enabled** (_bool_) – Whether to track metrics on this instance. Default True.

* **metrics_num_samples** (_int_) – The number of samples maintained to compute metrics. Default: 2

* **sasl_plain_username** (_str_) – username for sasl PLAIN and SCRAM authentication. Required if sasl_mechanism is PLAIN or one of the SCRAM mechanisms.

* **sasl_plain_password** (_str_) – password for sasl PLAIN and SCRAM authentication. Required if sasl_mechanism is PLAIN or one of the SCRAM mechanisms.

* **sasl_kerberos_name** (_str_ _or_ _gssapi.Name_) – Constructed gssapi.Name for use with sasl mechanism handshake. If provided, sasl_kerberos_service_name and sasl_kerberos_domain name are ignored. Default: None.

* **sasl_kerberos_service_name** (_str_) – Service name to include in GSSAPI sasl mechanism handshake. Default: ‘kafka’

* **sasl_kerberos_domain_name** (_str_) – kerberos domain name to use in GSSAPI sasl mechanism handshake. Default: one of bootstrap servers

abort_transaction()[[source]](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.abort_transaction)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.abort_transaction "Link to this definition")
Aborts the ongoing transaction.

Raises: ProducerFencedError if another producer with the same
transactional_id is active.

begin_transaction()[[source]](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.begin_transaction)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.begin_transaction "Link to this definition")
Should be called before the start of each new transaction.

Note that prior to the first invocation of this method, you must invoke init_transactions() exactly one time.

Raises:
**ProducerFencedError if another producer is with the same** – transactional_id is active.

bootstrap_connected()[[source]](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.bootstrap_connected)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.bootstrap_connected "Link to this definition")
Return True if the bootstrap is connected.

close[_timeout=None_, _null\_logger=False_]([source)](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.close)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.close "Link to this definition")
Close this producer.

Parameters:
**timeout** (_float_ _,_ _optional_) – timeout in seconds to wait for completion.

commit_transaction()[[source]](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.commit_transaction)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.commit_transaction "Link to this definition")
Commits the ongoing transaction.

Raises: ProducerFencedError if another producer with the same
transactional_id is active.

flush[_timeout=None_]([source)](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.flush)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.flush "Link to this definition")
Invoking this method makes all buffered records immediately available to send (even if linger_ms is greater than 0) and blocks on the completion of the requests associated with these records. The post-condition of [`flush()`](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.flush "kafka.KafkaProducer.flush") is that any previously sent record will have completed (e.g. Future.is_done() == True). A request is considered completed when either it is successfully acknowledged according to the ‘acks’ configuration for the producer, or it results in an error.

Other threads can continue sending messages while one thread is blocked waiting for a flush call to complete; however, no guarantee is made about the completion of messages sent after the flush call begins.

Parameters:
**timeout** (_float_ _,_ _optional_) – timeout in seconds to wait for completion.

Raises:
**KafkaTimeoutError** – failure to flush buffered records within the provided timeout

init_transactions()[[source]](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.init_transactions)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.init_transactions "Link to this definition")
Needs to be called before any other methods when the transactional.id is set in the configuration.

This method does the following:

1. Ensures any transactions initiated by previous instances of the producer with the same transactional_id are completed. If the previous instance had failed with a transaction in progress, it will be aborted. If the last transaction had begun completion, but not yet finished, this method awaits its completion.

2. Gets the internal producer id and epoch, used in all future transactional messages issued by the producer.

Note that this method will raise KafkaTimeoutError if the transactional state cannot be initialized before expiration of max_block_ms.

Retrying after a KafkaTimeoutError will continue to wait for the prior request to succeed or fail. Retrying after any other exception will start a new initialization attempt. Retrying after a successful initialization will do nothing.

Raises:

* **IllegalStateError** – if no transactional_id has been configured

* **AuthorizationError** – fatal error indicating that the configured transactional_id is not authorized.

* **KafkaError** – if the producer has encountered a previous fatal error or for any other unexpected error

* **KafkaTimeoutError** – if the time taken for initialize the transaction has surpassed max.block.ms.

send[_topic_, _value=None_, _key=None_, _headers=None_, _partition=None_, _timestamp\_ms=None_]([source)](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/kafka/producer/kafka.html#KafkaProducer.send)[](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html#kafka.KafkaProducer.send "Link to this definition")
Publish a message to a topic.

Parameters:

* **topic** (_str_) – topic where the message will be published

* **value** (_optional_) – message value. Must be type bytes, or be serializable to bytes via configured value_serializer. If value is None, key is required and message acts as a ‘delete’. See kafka compaction documentation for more details: [https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) (compaction requires kafka >= 0.8.1)

* **partition** (_int_ _,_ _optional_) – optionally specify a partition. If not set, the partition will be selected using the configured ‘partitioner’.

* **key** (_optional_) – a key to associate with the message. Can be used to determine which partition to send the message to. If partition is None (and producer’s partitioner config is left as default), then messages with the same key will be delivered to the same partition (but if key is None, partition is chosen randomly). Must be type bytes, or be serializable to bytes via configured key_serializer.

* **headers** (_optional_) – a list of header key value pairs. List items are tuples of str key and bytes value.

* **timestamp_ms** (_int_ _,_ _optional_) – epoch milliseconds (from Jan 1 1970 UTC) to use as the message timestamp. Defaults to current time.

Returns:
resolves to RecordMetadata

Return type:
FutureRecordMetadata

Raises:

* **KafkaTimeoutError** – if unable to fetch topic metadata, or unable to obtain memory buffer prior to configured max_block_ms

* **TypeError** – if topic is not a string

* **ValueError** – if topic is invalid: must be chars (a-zA-Z0-9._-), and less than 250 length

* **AssertionError** – if KafkaProducer is closed, or key and value are both None

Sends a list of consumed offsets to the consumer group coordinator, and also marks those offsets as part of the current transaction. These offsets will be considered consumed only if the transaction is committed successfully.

This method should be used when you need to batch consumed and produced messages together, typically in a consume-transform-produce pattern.

Parameters:

* **(****{TopicPartition** (_offsets_) – OffsetAndMetadata}): map of topic-partition -> offsets to commit as part of current transaction.

* **consumer_group_id** (_str_) – Name of consumer group for offsets commit.

Raises:

* **IllegalStateError** – if no transactional_id, or transaction has not been started.

* **ProducerFencedError** – fatal error indicating another producer with the same transactional_id is active.

* **UnsupportedVersionError** – fatal error indicating the broker does not support transactions (i.e. if < 0.11).

* **UnsupportedForMessageFormatError** – fatal error indicating the message format used for the offsets topic on the broker does not support transactions.

* **AuthorizationError** – fatal error indicating that the configured transactional_id is not authorized.

* **KafkaErro** – r if the producer has encountered a previous fatal or abortable error, or for any other unexpected error
