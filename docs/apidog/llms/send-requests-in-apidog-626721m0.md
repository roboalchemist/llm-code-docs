# Send Requests in Apidog

Apidog enables you to send API requests for development, testing, and integration purposes. Whether you're building your own API or integrating with external services, you can fetch, add, or remove data while transmitting parameters and authorization information.

For example, when developing a shop application, you might send a login request, retrieve a product list, and create an order—all through Apidog's request interface.
