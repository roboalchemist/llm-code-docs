# Basic Concepts in Apidog

This article introduces the core concepts in Apidog, an API-first tool designed for efficient API design, testing, and collaboration. Many concepts differ from similar products like Postman. Understanding these will help you navigate Apidog's workflow effectively.


## Project

A **Project** in Apidog is the primary unit of collaboration, containing modules, environments, test scenarios, and more. It serves as a container for all API-related work within a team.

### Key Components of a Project
- **Modules**: Logical groupings of endpoints and related components.
- **Environments**: Variable sets for different deployment stages (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Test Scenarios**: Collections of requests for automated testing.
- **Endpoint Specifications**: API documentation based on OpenAPI/Swagger standards.

### Comparison with Postman

| Apidog Concept | Equivalent in Postman | Description |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Project | Workspace | Top-level organizational unit for collaboration. |
| Module | Collection Folder | Groups related endpoints. |
| Team | Team | Shared access and collaboration features. |

:::tip[]
Projects enable seamless collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on APIs simultaneously while maintaining version control and access permissions.
:::

## Module

A **[Module](https://docs.apidog.com/module-1261913m0.md)** organizes endpoints logically within a project, similar to a "service" in microservices architecture. Each module represents a standalone OpenAPI specification file.

### Features of a Module
- Contains related endpoints, schemas, responses, and security schemes.
- Configured with a **Base URL** per environment for automatic URL generation.
- Supports import/export operations at the module level for better standards compliance.


### When to Use Modules
- For microservices: Each service as a separate module.
- For multiple APIs: Group endpoints by functionality or domain.
- Default: New projects start with one module; add more as needed for multiple base URLs.

:::info[]
Modules align with OpenAPI Specification (OAS), facilitating integration with other tools and maintaining clean API boundaries.
:::

## Endpoint

An **Endpoint** is the core element in Apidog's API-first approach, representing a specific API operation (e.g., `GET /users/{id}`).

### Endpoint Management
- Grouped in directory structures for organization.
- Supports [definition editing](https://docs.apidog.com/endpoint-basics-533932m0.md), preview, request sending, and save as [endpoint cases](https://docs.apidog.com/debugging-cases-541771m0.md).
- Linked to **endpoint cases** for saved request examples.

### Differences from Postman

| Aspect | Apidog (Endpoint-based) | Postman (Request-based) |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Basic Unit | Endpoint (API spec) | Request (individual call) |
| Spec Changes | Auto-updates cases and tests | Manual rewrite required |
| Structure | OAS extension with debugging | Separate specs and requests |

:::warning[]
In Apidog, changes to endpoint specs propagate automatically to all dependent cases, reducing maintenance overhead through this specification-driven approach.
:::

## Environment

An **[Environment](https://docs.apidog.com/environments-variables-in-apidog-577823m0.md)** manages variables and base URLs for different deployment contexts, enabling seamless switching between dev, staging, and production.

### Key Features
- Contains environment variables for dynamic values.
- Supports multiple **[Base URLs](https://docs.apidog.com/environment-management-584758m0.md)** per environment for microservices.
- Automatic URL construction: Base URL + Endpoint Path.

### Base URL Example

Suppose a project with three services:

| Service | Base URL (Prod) | Endpoint Path | Full URL |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| User | `https://user.example.com` | `GET /user/{id}` | `https://user.example.com/user/{id}` |
| Order | `https://order.example.com` | `GET /order/{id}` | `https://order.example.com/order/{id}` |
| Product | `https://product.example.com` | `GET /product/{id}` | `https://product.example.com/product/{id}` |

<Background>

</Background>

:::tip[]
No need for manual `{{BaseUrl}}` placeholders; Apidog detects the module and applies the correct base URL automatically.
:::

## Request

A **Request** is a standalone API call, not tied to endpoint specs, similar to Postman's requests.

### Request Capabilities
- [Create](https://docs.apidog.com/send-requests-in-apidog-626721m0.md) independent of specs.
- [Parse](https://docs.apidog.com/saving-requests-as-endpoints-629856m0.md) successful requests into endpoint specs.
- Use for ad-hoc testing or undocumented APIs.

:::info[]
Requests provide flexibility for scenarios where API specs aren't predefined, bridging the gap between design-first and request-first workflows.
:::

## Test Scenario

A **Test Scenario** executes batches of requests, akin to Postman Collections, with advanced automation features.

### Features
- Series of requests from [endpoint specs or cases](https://docs.apidog.com/create-a-test-scenario-599311m0.md) that can [auto-sync](https://docs.apidog.com/sync-data-from-endpoints-and-endpoint-cases-603709m0.md) as API spec changes.
- [Logic components](https://docs.apidog.com/flow-control-conditions-599419m0.md): `If`, `For`, `ForEach`.
- Data [passing](https://docs.apidog.com/pass-data-between-requests-601617m0.md) between requests.
- [Dynamic parameter generation](https://docs.apidog.com/dynamic-values-541766m0.md).

### Advanced Capabilities
- Test reports and performance testing.
- Data-driven testing.
- CI/CD integration.

:::tip[]
Test scenarios auto-sync with API spec changes, ensuring tests remain valid as APIs evolve.
:::

## Design-first Mode & Request-first Mode

Apidog's APIs module features two modes that can be switched at the bottom left corner of the interface: `Design-first Mode` and `Request-first Mode`.

</p>
</Background>


Both modes provide similar functionalities but with different interfaces, catering to different team workflows.

### Design-first Mode
- **Recommended** for teams practicing API-design first.
- Define API specs before development and testing.
- Ideal for planned, specification-driven projects.

### Request-first Mode
- Suitable for teams focusing on backend development first.
- Create requests, then generate specs from successful calls.
- Perfect for undocumented APIs or third-party integrations.

## Summary

Understanding these core concepts will help you leverage Apidog's API-first approach for efficient design, testing, and collaboration. Start with creating a project, organize endpoints into modules, define environments for different stages, and build test scenarios for automation.
