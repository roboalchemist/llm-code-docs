# Publishing Documentation Sites

Publishing a documentation site creates a permanent, fully customized home for your API documentation—distinct from the Quick Share feature, which is designed for temporary collaboration. While Quick Share generates shareable links for rapid internal and external communication, Publish Docs Sites provides comprehensive customization options including custom domains, branded design, navigation control, and advanced features. This makes it ideal for creating professional, public-facing API documentation that represents your brand.

## Prerequisites

Before publishing a documentation site, ensure you have:

- An Apidog account with a project containing API documentation
- Admin permissions for the project
- (Optional) A custom domain if you plan to use branded URLs

## Preliminary Configurations
### Publishing Your Documentation Site

To publish your documentation site, navigate to the Publish Docs module and click on the default main site, then click the `Publish` button.
