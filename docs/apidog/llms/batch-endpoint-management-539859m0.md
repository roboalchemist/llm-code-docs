# Batch Endpoint Management

The batch endpoint management feature offers a streamlined way to manage multiple endpoints simultaneously, saving time and enhancing efficiency.

On the `APIs` module, you can access all endpoints within a particular directory and execute batch operations, such as **bulk deletion** and **bulk movement**.

## Browsing Endpoints

To view all endpoints within the current project, click the **Endpoints** tab located under the **Root Directory**. To explore endpoints under a specific directory, select the respective directory.

You can filter and sort the data table to suit your needs. It's possible to apply multiple sorting criteria.

The Endpoints tab features a search function that allows for locating endpoints by name or path.

You can then proceed with batch operations to suit your needs, including:

- **Bulk deletion**
- **Bulk modification** of endpoint statuses
- **Bulk addition and deletion** of tags
- **Bulk modification** of responsible personnel
- **Bulk export**
- **Bulk movement** of directories

## FAQ

**Q: How can I bulk delete folders?**

A: Currently, there is no option for bulk deleting folders. Each directory must be deleted individually.

**Q: How can I bulk add/remove prefixes to the path of endpoints?**

A: It is not possible to process path changes through bulk operations. You can export the file in Apidog format from settings, perform text-based batch find-and-replace, and then re-import the file back into Apidog.
