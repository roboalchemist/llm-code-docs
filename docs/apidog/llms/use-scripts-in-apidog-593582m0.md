# Use Scripts in Apidog

Apidog includes a powerful JavaScript-based scripting engine that allows you to add dynamic behavior to your API requests and tests. This engine is fully compatible with Postman scripts.

## Capabilities

With custom scripts, you can:
1.  **Validate Responses**: Write assertions to verify status codes, headers, and body content (Post-processor).
2.  **Modify Requests**: Dynamically set URL parameters, headers, or body data (Pre-processor).
3.  **Manage Variables**: Pass data between requests by setting and retrieving variables.
4.  **External Integration**: Call programs written in other languages (Java, Python, PHP, Go, etc.).

## Usage

Scripts can be executed at two stages of the request lifecycle:

*   **Pre Processors**: Executed *before* the request is sent.
*   **Post Processors**: Executed *after* the response is received.

## Debugging

You can print messages to the **Console** using `pm.console.log()` or `console.log()` for debugging purposes.

```javascript
pm.console.log("This works");
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does Apidog support `pm.nextRequest()`?**

A: No. Apidog uses **Test Scenarios** for workflow orchestration instead of the "Run Collection" feature found in Postman. In a Test Scenario, you can use **Condition** steps (If-Else) to control the flow of execution based on logic, removing the need for `pm.nextRequest()`.
