# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Eden AI V3 API.

## General

### What is Eden AI V3?

Eden AI V3 is a unified AI API platform that provides:

* **Universal AI Endpoint** - Single endpoint for all non-LLM features (text, OCR, image, translation)
* **OpenAI-Compatible LLM** - Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's chat completions API
* **Multi-Provider Support** - Access 50+ AI providers through one interface
* **Persistent File Storage** - Upload files once, use in multiple requests

### Which endpoint should I use?

Choose based on your use case:

**Use `/v3/llm/chat/completions` for:**

* Conversational AI and chatbots
* Text generation and completion
* Vision/multimodal AI (analyzing images with LLMs)
* Tool/function calling
* Any use case requiring OpenAI-compatible format

**Use `/v3/universal-ai` for:**

* Text analysis (sentiment, moderation, AI detection)
* OCR and document parsing
* Image generation and analysis
* Text embeddings
* Translation

See [Getting Started](./introduction) for detailed endpoint comparison.

### How does the model string format work?

V3 uses a **model string** to specify what feature and provider to use:

**Universal AI format:**

```
feature/subfeature/provider[/model]
```

Examples:

* `text/moderation/openai`
* `ocr/financial_parser/google`
* `image/generation/openai/dall-e-3`

**LLM format (simplified):**

```
provider/model
```

Examples:

* `openai/gpt-4`
* `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
* `google/gemini-2.5-flash`

See [Universal AI Getting Started](../how-to/universal-ai/getting-started) and [Chat Completions](../how-to/llm/chat-completions) for details.

## Authentication & Access

### How do I get an API key?

1. Sign up at [app.edenai.run](https://app.edenai.run/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate an API token under "API Keys"
4. Use it in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

See [Authentication Guide](../how-to/authentication/bearer-token-auth) for details.

### Can I use my own provider API keys?

Yes! You can bypass Eden AI billing by providing your own provider API keys. This is useful for:

* Using existing provider credits
* Testing specific provider features
* Cost optimization

Contact support or check your dashboard for instructions on adding custom provider keys.

### What are the rate limits?

Rate limits vary by:

* Your account tier
* Provider being used
* Specific feature

Default limits are displayed in your dashboard. Rate limit headers are included in API responses:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Total requests allowed
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining
* `X-RateLimit-Reset` - Time when limit resets

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### How much does it cost?

Pricing is **pay-as-you-go** based on:

* Provider used
* Feature/model called
* Volume of data processed

Every API response includes a `cost` field showing the charge in USD for that request:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "status": "success",
  "cost": 0.0015,
  "output": { ... }
}
```

See [Monitor Usage and Costs](../how-to/cost-management/monitor-usage) for tracking and optimization.

## File Handling

### What file input methods are supported?

V3 supports three methods:

**1. File Upload (recommended for reuse):**

```python  theme={null}
import requests

# Upload once
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.edenai.run/v3/upload",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
    files={"file": open("document.pdf", "rb")}
)
file_id = response.json()["file_id"]

# Use multiple times
payload = {"model": "ocr/financial_parser/google", "input": {"file": file_id}}
```

**2. File URL:**

```python  theme={null}
payload = {
    "model": "ocr/financial_parser/google",
    "input": {"file": "https://example.com/document.pdf"}
}
```

**3. Base64 (inline):**

```python  theme={null}
payload = {
    "model": "text/moderation/openai",
    "input": {"text": "Sample text"}
}
```

See [Upload Files](../how-to/upload/upload-files) for detailed guide.

### How long are uploaded files stored?

Files uploaded to `/v3/upload` are stored for **7 days** by default. After expiration:

* Files are automatically deleted
* File IDs become invalid
* You'll need to re-upload

The `expires_at` timestamp is included in upload responses:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "file_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "bytes": 123456,
  "created_at": "2025-12-26T10:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-01-02T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### What are the file size limits?

Limits vary by feature and provider:

| Feature Type         | Typical Limit | Notes                               |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| OCR                  | 100 MB        | Some providers support larger files |
| Image Analysis       | 20 MB         | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF                |
| LLM Vision           | 20 MB         | Provider-dependent                  |
| Document Translation | 50 MB         | PDF, DOCX, TXT                      |

Exceeding limits returns a `413 Payload Too Large` error with specific limit information.

### Which file formats are supported?

**Images:**

* JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
* TIFF (OCR only)

**Documents:**

* PDF
* DOCX, DOC
* TXT, RTF

**Audio:**

* MP3, WAV (provider-dependent)

Format support varies by provider. Check provider-specific documentation or use the [API Discovery](../how-to/discovery/explore-api) endpoint for details.

## LLM Features

### How does streaming work in V3?

Streaming is optional in V3. When you enable streaming (`stream: true`), LLM responses use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to provide:

* Reduced perceived latency
* Real-time token generation
* OpenAI-compatible API behavior
* Better UX for chat applications

You can also use V3 without streaming by setting `stream: false`. See [Streaming Responses](../how-to/llm/streaming) for implementation guide.

### How do I send images to LLMs?

V3 LLM supports multimodal inputs via message content arrays:

```python  theme={null}
payload = {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Supports:

* Image URLs
* Base64 data URLs (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`)
* Uploaded file UUIDs

See [Working with Media Files](../how-to/llm/working-with-media) for complete guide.

### Which providers support vision/multimodal?

| Provider  | Models                             | Image Support | File Support |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| OpenAI    | gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo                | ✓             | ✓            |
| Anthropic | claude-opus-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5 | ✓             | ✓            |
| Google    | gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash   | ✓             | ✓            |
| Mistral   | pixtral-12b                        | ✓             | -            |

See [Vision Capabilities](../how-to/llm/vision-capabilities) for provider comparison.

### Does V3 support tool/function calling?

Yes! V3 supports OpenAI-compatible tool calling:

```python  theme={null}
payload = {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
    "messages": [...],
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "description": "Get current weather",
                "parameters": { ... }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Tool calling support varies by provider:

* ✓ OpenAI (all GPT-4+ models)
* ✓ Anthropic (Claude 3+)
* ✓ Google (Gemini 1.5+)
* ✓ Mistral (Large models)

## Universal AI

### How do I discover available features?

Use the built-in API discovery endpoints:

```python  theme={null}
import requests

# List all features
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.edenai.run/v3/info",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

# Get feature details
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.edenai.run/v3/info/text/moderation",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
# Returns: providers, input schema, output schema
```

See [Explore the API](../how-to/discovery/explore-api) for details.

### Can I use fallback providers?

Not directly in V3's simplified model string format. However, you can implement fallback logic in your application:

```python  theme={null}
def call_with_fallback(primary_model, fallback_model, input_data):
    try:
        return call_universal_ai(primary_model, input_data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Primary failed: {e}, trying fallback...")
        return call_universal_ai(fallback_model, input_data)

result = call_with_fallback(
    "text/moderation/openai",
    "text/moderation/google",
    {"text": "Sample text"}
)
```

### How do I optimize costs?

**Best practices:**

1. **Choose cost-effective providers:**
   * Compare pricing in dashboard
   * Check `cost` field in responses

2. **Cache results when possible:**
   * Many features (embeddings, moderation) have deterministic outputs
   * Store results for identical inputs

3. **Use appropriate models:**
   * Don't use premium models for simple tasks
   * Match model capability to task complexity

4. **Batch processing:**
   * Process multiple items in fewer API calls when supported

5. **Monitor usage:**
   * Track costs via [Monitor Usage](../how-to/cost-management/monitor-usage)
   * Set up alerts in dashboard

### I've been an Eden AI user for some time. Is the previous version going to disappear?

Not yet. We'll continue supporting the previous version until the end of 2026. You can
find everything here [https://old-app.edenai.run](https://old-app.edenai.run)

Also, you can find the documentation [here](https://old-docs.edenai.co)

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Invalid or missing API token

**Solutions:**

* Verify token is correct
* Check `Authorization` header format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
* Ensure token hasn't been revoked
* Generate new token in dashboard

```python  theme={null}
# Correct format
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### 402 Payment Required - Insufficient Credits

**Cause:** Account has insufficient credits

**Solutions:**

* Add credits in dashboard
* Check current balance
* Review cost per request in responses

### 404 Not Found

**Cause:** Invalid endpoint or model string

**Solutions:**

* Verify endpoint URL is correct
* Check model string format matches pattern
* Use `/v3/info` to discover available features
* Ensure provider supports requested feature

```
# Wrong
"model": "openai/text-moderation"  # ❌ Invalid format

# Correct
"model": "text/moderation/openai"  # ✓
```

### 422 Validation Error

**Cause:** Invalid request body or parameters

**Common issues:**

* Missing required fields
* Invalid parameter types
* File format not supported
* Model string malformed

**Solution:** Check error response for specific field errors:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["body", "input", "text"],
      "msg": "field required",
      "type": "value_error.missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded

**Solutions:**

* Implement exponential backoff
* Check `X-RateLimit-Reset` header
* Upgrade account tier for higher limits
* Distribute requests over time

```python  theme={null}
import time
import requests

headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}

def call_with_retry(url, payload, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            continue

        return response.json()

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### Invalid model string format

**Cause:** Model string doesn't match expected pattern

**For LLM:** Must be `provider/model`

```python  theme={null}
# Wrong
"gpt-4"  # ❌
"openai"  # ❌

# Correct
"openai/gpt-4"  # ✓
```

### Provider temporarily unavailable

**Cause:** Upstream provider experiencing issues

**Solutions:**

* Check [Eden AI Status Page](https://app-edenai.instatus.com/)
* Try alternative provider for same feature
* Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
* Use error response for specific provider error details
