Dedicated IP addresses in Gatling Enterprise Edition are static IPv4 addresses that can be provisioned in the region(s) of your choice. Once provisioned for your organization, these addresses can be assigned to your simulations, ensuring all load generation traffic originates from consistent, dedicated IPs. During test execution, Gatling Enterprise Edition automatically allocates one of your unused dedicated IPsâprovided it matches both the location and availability of your load generatorsâso you can maintain precise control over whitelisting, firewall configurations, and traffic analysis.

## Managing

To access the dedicated IP addresses section, click on **Dedicated IP Addresses** in the navigation bar.

{{< alert tip >}}
You can request dedicated IP addresses through [technical support](https://gatlingcorp.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/8/group/12/create/91).

Please provide:

- Organization slug,
- Desired number of dedicated IP addresses per location ([available locations]({{< ref "reference/run-tests/simulations/test-as-code#locations-configuration" >}})),
- Contact Email,
- GitHub username.

A sales person will contact you.

The Dedicated IP addresses table shows your available dedicated IP addresses. Each one belongs to a specific location.

## Usage

### User Interface
To enable dedicated IP addresses, activate the `Use Dedicated IPs` option while [configuring simulation locations]({{< ref "simulations#step-2-locations-configuration" >}}).

When starting a simulation run with dedicated IP addresses:

- Gatling Enterprise Edition checks whether you have enough available dedicated IP addresses to cover all configured locations.
- If enough IPs are available, they are reserved for the duration of the run.
- If insufficient IPs are available, the run cannot start.

### Config-as-code
You can also enable dedicated IP addresses programmatically through [config-as-code]({{< ref "configuration-as-code" >}}). Simply set the `useDedicatedIps` property to `true` in your [simulation configuration]({{< ref "/reference/run-tests/sources/configuration-as-code" >}}). This instructs Gatling Enterprise Edition to automatically assign your dedicated IPs to all load generators for that simulation.
