## Generating packages for Gatling Enterprise

Gatling Enterprise deploys packages containing your compiled simulations and resources. Those packages have to be generated
upstream, using one of the methods below, before you can run them with Gatling Enterprise.

Gatling Enterprise is compatible with Gatling version from 3.5 to {{< var gatlingVersion >}} included, however, these instructions are aligned with the new Maven-based bundle released in Gatling 3.11.

{{< alert tip >}}
You can download sample projects for all the options below by going to the [Simulations page]({{< ref "/reference/run-tests/simulations/intro" >}}) in the Gatling Enterprise app and clicking on "Don't know where to start?" in the Test as code tab.

### Maven, Gradle, sbt, or JavaScript/TypeScript project

To set up your project, and to learn how to use your preferred build tool to upload simulations to Gatling Enterprise
Cloud, please refer to respective build tool plugin documentation:

- [Gatling plugin for Maven]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/maven-plugin" >}}) (for Java, Kotlin and Scala)
- [Gatling plugin for Gradle]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/gradle-plugin" >}}) (for Java, Kotlin and Scala)
- [Gatling plugin for sbt]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/sbt-plugin" >}}) (for Scala)
- [Gatling CLI for JavaScript/TypeScript]({{< ref "/integrations/build-tools/js-cli" >}}) (for JavaScript and TypeScript)

{{< alert warning >}}
The Gatling build plugins now include everything you need to work with Gatling Enterprise. Previous versions required an
additional plugin to work with Gatling Enterprise. If you have one of the old "FrontLine" plugins
(`io.gatling.frontline:frontline-maven-plugin`, `io.gatling.frontline:frontline-gradle-plugin` or
`io.gatling.frontline:sbt-frontline`) in your build, we recommend removing it and updating to the latest version of the
Gatling plugin instead.

### Gatling bundle

Once you have created a simulation you want to upload, you can use the `enterpriseDeploy` command to upload your package and simulation with the default configuration. To customize your package and simulation configuration, see the [Configuration as code documentation]({{< ref "configuration-as-code" >}}). 

To use the `enterpriseDeploy` command:

1. Create an [API token]({{< ref "/reference/administration/api-tokens" >}}) in Gatling Enterprise. 
2. Set the API token in your local environment using either:
    - the `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` environment variable,
    - the `gatling.enterprise.apiToken` [Java System property](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html).
3. Run the `enterpriseDeploy` command:

{{< platform-toggle >}}
Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:enterpriseDeploy
Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:enterpriseDeploy
{{</ platform-toggle >}}

{{< alert info >}}
Learn how to work with environment variables, Java system properties, and JavaScript parameters in the
[Configuration documentation]({{< ref "/concepts/configuration#manage-configuration-values" >}}). 
{{< /alert >}}

Alternatively, you can package your simulation and then upload it using the Gatling Enterprise UI. To package and upload your simulation:

1. Run the command `enterprisePackage` in your local terminal:

    {{< platform-toggle >}}
    Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:enterprisePackage
    Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:enterprisePackage
    {{</ platform-toggle >}}

2. Log in to Gatling Enterprise and go to the **Packages** page from the left-side navigation menu.
3. Click **+ Create**. 
4. Use the upload modal to name the package and assign it to a team.
5. Upload the `.jar` file created in step 1 from your project's `target` folder.
6. Click **Save**.

Finally, you can get the list of all the available options with the `help` command:

{{< platform-toggle >}}
Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw gatling:help
Windows: mvnw.cmd gatling:help
{{</ platform-toggle >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
These commands are only available since Gatling `3.11`. If you're using an older version, you have to upgrade.

## Note on feeders

A typical mistake with Gatling and Gatling Enterprise is to rely on having an exploded Maven/Gradle/sbt project structure, and to try to load files from the project filesystem.

This filesystem structure will not be accessible once your project has been packaged and deployed to Gatling Enterprise.

If your feeder files are packaged with your test sources, you must resolve them from the classpath. This will work both
when you run simulations locally and when you deploy them to Gatling Enterprise.

```scala
// incorrect
val feeder = csv("src/test/resources/foo.csv")

// correct
val feeder = csv("foo.csv")
```
