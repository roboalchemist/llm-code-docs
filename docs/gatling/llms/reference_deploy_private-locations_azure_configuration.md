## Instance specifications

We recommend that you use for your own load generator instances with at least 4 cores.

As a result, we recommend using `Standard_A4_v2` instances or larger.

You might want to tune the `Xmx` JVM options to half of the physical memory.
See `jvm-options` configuration below.
If you don't, the JVM will use a max heap size of 1/4th of the physical memory.

{{</alert>}}

{{<alert tip >}}
We recommend against using Spot Virtual Machines for your load generators.
They can be reclaimed while the test is ongoing, which would break it with no further indication that the load generator has stopped sending stats.

## Permissions

Azure private locations require the control plane to have credentials configured in order to instantiate virtual machines and associated resources.

Those can be set through environment variables in your control plane or via [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview). Select the most appropriated method depending on your infrastructure, or check our [installation guide]({{< ref "installation" >}})  for deployment with [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps).

### Environment variables

| name                  | value             |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| AZURE_CLIENT_ID       | Client UUID       |
| AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET   | Client secret key |
| AZURE_TENANT_ID       | Tenant UUID       |

Check Azure documentation pages to find these values:
* [Tenant id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-to-find-tenant)
* [Client id and secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/834401/hi-i-want-my-client-id-and-client-secret-key)
* [Subscription id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id)

## System requirements

Azure private locations rely on some dependencies.

So when using a custom image, make sure following are available:

- [cloud-init](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/custom-data) integration.
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
- [Java runtime environment](https://openjdk.org/install/): OpenJDK 64bits LTS versions: 11 through 25 (see [Gatling prerequisites]({{< ref "/tutorials/test-as-code/java-jvm/installation-guide/#requirements" >}}))

### Engine

The engine specified for a location determines the compatible package formats (JavaScript or JVM) for Gatling packages.

Each engine (`classic` or `javascript`) supports specific Java versions, where `latest` is defaulted.

The table below outlines the supported Java versions for certified Gatling images:

| Engine      | Supported Java Versions |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| classic     | 25 or latest            |
| javascript  | latest                  |

{{< alert info >}}
For the `javascript` engine, only the latest Java version is supported, which corresponds to the GraalVM version used to run Gatling with JavaScript.
