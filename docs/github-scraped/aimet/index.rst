The AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) is a software toolkit for quantizing trained ML models. 

AIMET improves the runtime performance of deep learning models by reducing compute load and memory footprint.

Models quantized with AIMET facilitate its deployment on edge devices like mobile phones or laptops by reducing memory footprint 

AIMET employs post-training and fine-tuning techniques to minimize accuracy loss during quantization and compression.

AIMET supports models from the ONNX and PyTorch frameworks.
