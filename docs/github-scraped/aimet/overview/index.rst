What is AIMET?
#####################

AIMET (AI Model Efficiency Toolkit) is a quantization tool that works on deep learning models such as PyTorch and ONNX.

AIMET enables developer to:

#. Simulate Quantization
#. Quantize models with Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques
#. Quantization Aware Training (QAT) on PyTorch models with aimet-torch
#. Visualize and experiment with model accuracy with various precision on activations and weights
#. Create mixed-precision models
#. Export Quantized model to deployable ONNX model format

With AIMET, developers can rapidly iterate on model to find best quantization profile to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and latency.
Developers can compile and run quantized model exported from AIMET to QNN or run directly via ONNX-Runtime.

AIMET provides two python packages:

1. AIMET-ONNX: Quantize ONNX model with PTQ techniques
2. AIMET-Torch: Quantize PyTorch model with QAT

We recommend to start with AIMET-ONNX PTQ techniques, which has fastest turn-around time for quantization and experimentation.
Defer to QAT with AIMET-Torch only if you have tried AIMET-ONNX mixed precision and advanced techniques for optimizing weights.
