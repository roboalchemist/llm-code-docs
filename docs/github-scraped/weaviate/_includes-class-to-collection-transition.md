# Source: https://github.com/weaviate/docs/blob/main/_includes/class-to-collection-transition.mdx

Weaviate client APIs are transitioning from the term "class" to "collection."

Older Weaviate documentation refers to "classes." Newer documentation uses "collections." Expect to see both terms during the transition period.
