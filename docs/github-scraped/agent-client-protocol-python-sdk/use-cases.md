# Use Cases

This page mirrors the quick-read style of the README/index: skim the tables, copy links, and see how others apply the SDK. For the protocol overview itself, visit the official [agent](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/agents) and [client](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/clients) guides.

## Agents

## Clients

| Project | What it showcases |
| --- | --- |
| [wiki3-ai/agent-client-kernel](https://github.com/wiki3-ai/agent-client-kernel) | A Jupyter kernel that speaks ACP so notebooks can chat with external agents. Great reference if you’re embedding ACP in notebook tooling. |
| [OhadRubin/simple-acp-client](https://github.com/OhadRubin/simple-acp-client) | A Claude Agent SDK–style Python client that wraps ACP executables with a friendly API. Use it as a starting point for bespoke clients. |
