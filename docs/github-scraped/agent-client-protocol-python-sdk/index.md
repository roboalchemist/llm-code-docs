# Agent Client Protocol SDK (Python)

Ship ACP-compatible agents and clients in Python without rebuilding JSON-RPC transports or schema models. This SDK mirrors each ACP release so your integrations stay interoperable with editors, CLIs, and hosted clients.

## Install & verify

```bash
pip install agent-client-protocol
# or
uv add agent-client-protocol
```

Next steps live in the [Quickstart](quickstart.md): launch the echo agent, wire it to Zed (or another ACP client), and exercise the programmatic spawn helpers.

## ACP at a glance

- ACP is the stdio protocol that lets “clients” (editors, shells, CLIs) orchestrate AI “agents.”
- Sessions exchange structured payloads (`session/update`, permission prompts, tool calls) defined in the upstream schema.
- Matching the schema version keeps your Python integrations compatible with tools such as Zed, Gemini CLI, or kimi-cli.

## SDK building blocks

- `acp.schema`: generated Pydantic models that validate every payload against the canonical specification.
- `acp.agent` / `acp.client`: async base classes, JSON-RPC supervision, and lifecycle orchestration.
- `acp.helpers`: builders for content blocks, tool calls, permissions, and notifications.
- `acp.contrib`: experimental utilities (session accumulators, permission brokers, tool call trackers) harvested from production deployments.
- `examples/`: runnable agents, clients, duet demos, and the Gemini CLI bridge.

## Choose a path

- **Just exploring?** Skim [use-cases.md](use-cases.md) to see how kimi-cli, agent-client-kernel, and others use the SDK.
- **Building agents?** Copy `examples/echo_agent.py` or `examples/agent.py`, then layer in `acp.helpers` for tool calls and permissions.
- **Embedding clients?** Start with `examples/client.py` or the `spawn_agent_process` / `spawn_client_process` helpers in the [Quickstart](quickstart.md#programmatic-launch).
