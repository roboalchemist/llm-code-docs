# LightmapProbe

**Inherits:** [Node3D<class_Node3D>] **<** [Node<class_Node>] **<** [Object<class_Object>]

Represents a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with [LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>].


## Description

**LightmapProbe** represents the position of a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with [LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>]. Lightmap probes affect the lighting of [GeometryInstance3D<class_GeometryInstance3D>]-derived nodes that have their [GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode<class_GeometryInstance3D_property_gi_mode>] set to [GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DYNAMIC<class_GeometryInstance3D_constant_GI_MODE_DYNAMIC>].

Typically, [LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>] probes are placed automatically by setting [LightmapGI.generate_probes_subdiv<class_LightmapGI_property_generate_probes_subdiv>] to a value other than [LightmapGI.GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED<class_LightmapGI_constant_GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED>]. By creating **LightmapProbe** nodes before baking lightmaps, you can add more probes in specific areas for greater detail, or disable automatic generation and rely only on manually placed probes instead.

\ **Note:** **LightmapProbe** nodes that are placed after baking lightmaps are ignored by dynamic objects. You must bake lightmaps again after creating or modifying **LightmapProbe**\ s for the probes to be effective.
