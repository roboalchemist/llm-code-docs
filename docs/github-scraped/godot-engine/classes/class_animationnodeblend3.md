# AnimationNodeBlend3

**Inherits:** [AnimationNodeSync<class_AnimationNodeSync>] **<** [AnimationNode<class_AnimationNode>] **<** [Resource<class_Resource>] **<** [RefCounted<class_RefCounted>] **<** [Object<class_Object>]

Blends two of three animations linearly inside of an [AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>].


## Description

A resource to add to an [AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>]. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.

This animation node has three inputs:

- The base animation to blend with

- A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value

- A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value

In general, the blend value should be in the `[-1.0, 1.0]` range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, [AnimationNodeAdd3<class_AnimationNodeAdd3>] works better for this purpose.
