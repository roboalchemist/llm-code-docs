# JetBrains Rider

[JetBrains Rider ](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is a commercial
[JetBrains ](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDE for C++, C# and GDScript that uses the same solution system as Visual Studio.

> **NOTE**
>
> This documentation is for contributing to the game engine, not for using
> JetBrains Rider as a C# or GDScript editor. To code C# or GDScript in an external editor, see
> :ref:`the C# guide to configure an external editor <doc_c_sharp_setup_external_editor>`.
>
## Importing the project

> **TIP**
> Rider and Visual Studio use the same solution format, so you can switch between the two IDEs without rebuilding the solution file.
> Debug configurations need to be changed when going from one IDE to another.
>
If you are starting from the scratch, please follow [instructions<doc_compiling_index>], specifically:

- Install all the dependencies.
- Figure out the scons command for compiling to target a specific platform.

Provide scons with additional arguments to request a solution file generation:

- Add `vsproj=yes dev_build=yes` to the scons command

The `vsproj` parameter signals that you want Visual Studio solution generated.
The `dev_build` parameter ensures the debug symbols are included, allowing to e.g. step through code using breakpoints.

- Open the generated `godot.sln` in Rider.

> **NOTE**
> Rider toolbar. It affects resolve of the SDKs, code analysis, build, run,
> etc.

## Compiling and debugging the project
Rider comes with a built-in debugger that can be used to debug the Godot project. You can launch the debugger
by pressing the **Debug** icon at the top of the screen, this only works for the Project Manager,
if you want to debug the editor, you need to configure the debugger first.

> **FIGURE**
> :align: center
>
- Click on the **Godot > Edit Configurations** option at the top of the screen.

> **FIGURE**
> :align: center
>
- Ensure the following values for the C++ Project Run Configuration:

    - Exe Path : `$(LocalDebuggerCommand)`
    - Program Arguments: `-e --path <path to the Godot project>`
    - Working Directory: `$(LocalDebuggerWorkingDirectory)`
    - Before Launch has a value of "Build Project"

This will tell the executable to debug the specified project without opening the Project Manager.
Use the root path to the project folder, not `project.godot` file path.

> **FIGURE**
> :align: center
>
- Finally click on "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.

- When you press the **Debug** icon at the top of the screen, JetBrains Rider will launch the Godot editor with the debugger attached.

Alternatively you can use **Run > Attach to Process** to attach the debugger to a running Godot instance.

> **FIGURE**
> :align: center
>
- You can find the Godot instance by searching for `godot.editor` and then clicking `Attach with LLDB`

> **FIGURE**
> :align: center
>

## Debug visualizers
Debug visualizers customize how complex data structures are displayed during debugging.
For Windows "natvis" (short for "Native Visualization") built-in with Godot are automatically used.
For other operating systems, similar functionality can be setup manually.
