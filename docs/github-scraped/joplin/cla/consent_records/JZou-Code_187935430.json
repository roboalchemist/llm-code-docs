I think it just means there's not test to validate this change and as a result I'm not very confident to merge this.\r\n\r\nYes—I’ve looked through the test suite, and I don’t see anything that verifies insertion order. I tried writing my own tests, but I couldn’t get them to behave as expected—the way the code jumps between helpers and methods is a bit complicated for me to follow.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I’ve simply reversed the for-loop inside commandAttachFileToBody. Alternatively, I could leave the existing source untouched and just call filePaths.reverse() before the loop, which also fixes the images-in-reverse issue. Would either of these solutions put your mind at ease? If so, I’ll go ahead and update my PR.\r\n",

After applying sort, all files selected in a single upload end up being fixed to name-based order (just like the situation you mentioned), even if the original selection was sorted by size or creation date. That may not match expectations. By the same token, doing a different fixed sort before the for loop would also fail to preserve the user’s chosen ordering. Adding a configuration object just to pick an ordering feels a bit heavy.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my logs show the root cause of the reversed image order: when adding multiple files in one go, options.position doesn’t advance with each inserted link, so every insertion happens at the same index. That produces reversed effect.",

			"body": "@laurent22 \r\n\r\nHello, I investigated further and found that when adding multiple files in a single action, the insertion position (options.position) stays unchanged. As a result, the earlier a file is processed in the loop, the farther back it appears in the note—the actual attachment order ends up reversed from the intended order.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, my earlier fix was to iterate the for loop in reverse, which cancels out this reversal.\r\n\r\nI also tried two alternative approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Call filePaths.reverse() before the loop, so the array order counteracts the original reversal.\r\n\r\n2. Advance the insertion position by the length of each inserted link after every insertion, so subsequent inserts are appended after the previous one:\r\n```ts\r\n\t// NewLine: record the initial position\r\n\tlet pos = options.position ?? 0; \r\n\r\n\tfor (let i = 0; i < filePaths.length; i++) {\r\n\t\tconst filePath = filePaths[i];\r\n\r\n\t\t// NewLine: record the body length before new file insertion\r\n  \t\tconst beforeLen = body.length; \r\n\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tlogger.info(`Attaching ${filePath}`);\r\n\t\t\tconst newBody = await shim.attachFileToNoteBody(body, filePath, pos, {\r\n\t\t\t\tcreateFileURL: options.createFileURL,\r\n\t\t\t\tresizeLargeImages: Setting.value('imageResizing'),\r\n\t\t\t\tmarkupLanguage: options.markupLanguage,\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// Modification: insert a white space at the start point if this isn't the first file\r\n\t\t\t\tresourcePrefix: i > 0 ? ' ' : '', \r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (!newBody) {\r\n\t\t\t\tlogger.info('File attachment was cancelled');\r\n\t\t\t\treturn null;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// NewLine: move the position with the length of the length of new file link\r\n\t\t\tpos += newBody.length - beforeLen; \r\n\r\n\t\t\tbody = newBody;\r\n\t\t\tlogger.info('File was attached.');\r\n\t\t} catch (error) {\r\n\t\t\tlogger.error(error);\r\n\t\t\tbridge().showErrorMessageBox(error.message);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested all three approaches with selections sorted by name, file size, and creation time, and with different file types; they all behaved as expected. If you have a preference among these approaches, please let me know and I’ll update the code accordingly.",

Glad I could be of help.\r\n\r\nI think your current approach or calling .reverse explicitly are likely ok, as long as you add a comment in the code to explain why it needs to be reversed. Your other alternative is more explicit about the problem without a comment, and is possibly the best choice",
