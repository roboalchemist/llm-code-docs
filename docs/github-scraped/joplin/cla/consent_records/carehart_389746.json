		"body": "I have proposed just adding two links to this page. \r\n\r\nJustification:\r\n\r\nThe page is pointed to from the rich text editor within the UI of joplin itself, with a warning, \"_This Rich Text editor has a number of limitations and it is recommended to be aware of them before using it_\", followed by a link to this doc page. \r\n\r\nSince someone coming to this page by that means might not readily recognize what \"plugins\" are being referred to here, I thought it reasonable to link at least the first reference here (in the TLDR) to the doc page on plugins, so as to clarify that it was joplin plugins specifically being referred to.\r\n\r\nThen for the second reference (a couple of paragraphs later), I opted to link instead to the repo of plugins. By then a reader may well wonder, \"_what kind of 'markdown plugins' even exist, that I may need to worry about?_\".\r\n\r\nI hope you find these modest tweaks to be helpful. I realize it's a rather subjective \"opportunity for improvement\".",
