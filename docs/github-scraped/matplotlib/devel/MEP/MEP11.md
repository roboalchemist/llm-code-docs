## Abstract

One of the goals of matplotlib has been to keep it as easy to install as
possible. To that end, some third-party dependencies are included in the
source tree and, under certain circumstances, installed alongside
matplotlib. This MEP aims to resolve some problems with that approach,
bring some consistency, while continuing to make installation
convenient.

At the time that was initially done,
[setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/),
[easy_install](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/easy_install.html)
and [PyPI](https://pypi.org) were not mature enough to be relied on.
However, at present, we should be able to safely leverage the \"modern\"
versions of those tools,
[distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

While matplotlib has dependencies on both Python libraries and C/C++
libraries, this MEP addresses only the Python libraries so as to not
confuse the issue. C libraries represent a larger and mostly orthogonal
set of problems.

## Detailed description

matplotlib depends on the following third-party Python libraries:

-   Numpy
-   dateutil (pure Python)
-   pytz (pure Python)
-   six \-- required by dateutil (pure Python)
-   pyparsing (pure Python)
-   PIL (optional)
-   GUI frameworks: pygtk, gobject, tkinter, PySide, PyQt4, wx (all
    optional, but one is required for an interactive GUI)

### Current behavior

When installing from source, a `git`{.interpreted-text role="program"}
checkout or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

-   `setup.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"} attempts to
    `import numpy`. If this fails, the installation fails.
-   For each of [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/),
    [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and
    [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/), `setup.py`{.interpreted-text
    role="file"} attempts to import them (from the top-level namespace).
    If that fails, matplotlib installs its local copy of the library
    into the top-level namespace.
-   [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is always installed
    inside of the matplotlib namespace.

This behavior is most surprising when used with
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), because no
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) dependency resolution is performed,
even though it is likely to work for all of these packages.

The fact that [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is
installed in the matplotlib namespace has reportedly (#1290) confused
some users into thinking it is a matplotlib-related module and import it
from there rather than the top-level.

When installing using the Windows installer,
[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/),
[pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and
[six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) are installed at the top-level
*always*, potentially overwriting already installed copies of those
libraries.

TODO: Describe behavior with the OS-X installer.

When installing using a package manager (Debian, RedHat, MacPorts etc.),
this behavior actually does the right thing, and there are no special
patches in the matplotlib packages to deal with the fact that we handle
[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/),
[pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and
[six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) in this way. However, care should
be taken that whatever approach we move to continues to work in that
context.

Maintaining these packages in the matplotlib tree and making sure they
are up-to-date is a maintenance burden. Advanced new features that may
require a third-party pure Python library have a higher barrier to
inclusion because of this burden.

### Desired behavior

Third-party dependencies are downloaded and installed from their
canonical locations by leveraging [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/),
[distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and
[PyPI](https://pypi.org).

[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/),
[pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/), and
[pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) should be made into
optional dependencies \-- though obviously some features would fail if
they aren\'t installed. This will allow the user to decide whether they
want to bother installing a particular feature.

## Implementation

For installing from source, and assuming the user has all of the C-level
compilers and dependencies, this can be accomplished fairly easily using
[distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and following the
instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/). The only
anticipated change to the matplotlib library code will be to import
[pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) from the top-level
namespace rather than from within matplotlib. Note that
[distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) will also allow us to
remove the direct dependency on [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/),
since it is, strictly speaking, only a direct dependency of
[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/).

For binary installations, there are a number of alternatives (here
ordered from best/hardest to worst/easiest):

1.  The distutils wininst installer allows a post-install script to run.
    It might be possible to get this script to run
    [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the other
    dependencies. (See [this
    thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2010-September/016857.html)
    for someone who has trod that ground before).
2.  Continue to ship
    [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/),
    [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/),
    [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) and
    [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) in our installer,
    but use the post-install-script to install them *only* if they
    cannot already be found.
3.  Move all of these packages inside a (new) `matplotlib.extern`
    namespace so it is clear for outside users that these are external
    packages. Add some conditional imports in the core matplotlib
    codebase so [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/)
    (at the top-level) is tried first, and failing that
    `matplotlib.extern.dateutil` is used.

2 and 3 are undesirable as they still require maintaining copies of
these packages in our tree \-- and this is exacerbated by the fact that
they are used less \-- only in the binary installers. None of these 3
approaches address Numpy, which will still have to be manually installed
using an installer.

TODO: How does this relate to the Mac OS-X installer?

## Backward compatibility

At present, matplotlib can be installed from source on a machine without
the third party dependencies and without an internet connection. After
this change, an internet connection (and a working PyPI) will be
required to install matplotlib for the first time. (Subsequent
matplotlib updates or development work will run without accessing the
network).

## Alternatives

Distributing binary eggs doesn\'t feel like a usable solution. That
requires getting
[easy_install](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/easy_install.html)
installed first, and Windows users generally prefer the well known
`.exe` or `.msi` installer that works out of the box.
