# Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals

Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals (MEP), inspired by cpython\'s
[PEP\'s](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) but less formal, are design
documents for large or controversial changes to Matplotilb. These
documents should provide a discussion of both why and how the changes
should be made.

To create a new MEP open a pull request (PR) adding a file based on
`the template <MEP-template>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to this the
MEP directory. For the initial PR only a rough description is required
and it should be merged quickly. Further detailed discussion can happen
in follow on PRs.
