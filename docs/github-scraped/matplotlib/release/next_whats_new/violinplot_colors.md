# `violinplot` now accepts color arguments

[\~.Axes.violinplot]{.title-ref} and [\~.Axes.violin]{.title-ref} now
accept `facecolor` and `linecolor` as input arguments. This means that
users can set the color of violinplots as they make them, rather than
setting the color of individual objects afterwards. It is possible to
pass a single color to be used for all violins, or pass a sequence of
colors.
