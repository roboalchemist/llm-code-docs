# `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1`

`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} provides a
framework of helper classes to adjust the positioning of multiple
fixed-aspect Axes (e.g., displaying images). It can be contrasted with
the `aspect` property of Matplotlib Axes, which adjusts the position of
a single Axes.

See `axes_grid1_users-guide-index`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for a
guide on the usage of axes_grid1.
