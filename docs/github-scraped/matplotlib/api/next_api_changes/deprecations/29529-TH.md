# Capitalization of None in matplotlibrc

In `matplotlibrc`{.interpreted-text role="file"} config files every
capitalization of None was accepted for denoting the Python constant
[None]{.title-ref}. This is deprecated. The only accepted capitalization
is now None, i.e. starting with a capital letter and all other letters
in lowercase.
