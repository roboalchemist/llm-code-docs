# *alpha* parameter handling on images

When passing and array to `imshow(..., alpha=...)`, the parameter was
silently ignored if the image data was a RGB or RBGA image or if
`interpolation_state`{.interpreted-text role="rc"} resolved to \"rbga\".

This is now fixed, and the alpha array overwrites any previous
transparency information.
