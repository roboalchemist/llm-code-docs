# Dependencies

## Runtime dependencies {#runtime_dependencies}

### Required

When installing through a package manager like `pip` or `conda`, the
mandatory dependencies are automatically installed. This list is mainly
for reference.

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (\>= 3.11)
-   [contourpy](https://pypi.org/project/contourpy/) (\>= 1.0.1)
-   [cycler](https://matplotlib.org/cycler/) (\>= 0.10.0)
-   [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) (\>= 2.7)

-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org) (\>= 1.25)
-   [packaging](https://pypi.org/project/packaging/) (\>= 20.0)
-   [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 9.0)
-   [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) (\>= 3)

### Optional {#optional_dependencies}

The following packages and tools are not required but extend the
capabilities of Matplotlib.

#### Backends {#backend_dependencies}

Matplotlib figures can be rendered to various user interfaces. See
`what-is-a-backend`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more details on
the optional Matplotlib backends and the capabilities they provide.

-   [Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) (\>= 8.5, != 8.6.0
    or 8.6.1): for the Tk-based backends. Tk is part of most standard
    Python installations, but it\'s not part of Python itself and thus
    may not be present in rare cases.
-   [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) (\>= 6.1),
    [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/),
    [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) (\>= 5.12), or
    [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/): for the Qt-based
    backends.
-   [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
    [pycairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 1.14.0):
    for the GTK-based backends. If using pip (but not conda or system
    package manager) PyGObject must be built from source; see [pygobject
    documentation](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devguide/dev_environ.html).
-   [pycairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 1.14.0) or
    [cairocffi](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/cairocffi/stable/) (\>=
    0.8): for cairo-based backends.
-   [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/) (\>= 4): for the wx-based
    backends. If using pip (but not conda or system package manager) on
    Linux wxPython wheels must be manually downloaded from
    <https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/>.
-   [Tornado](https://pypi.org/project/tornado/) (\>= 5): for the WebAgg
    backend.
-   [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/): for the nbagg
    backend.
-   macOS (\>= 10.12): for the macosx backend.

#### Animations

-   [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): for saving movies.
-   [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php): for
    saving animated gifs.

#### Font handling and rendering

-   [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (with
    [cm-super](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-super) and
    [underscore](https://ctan.org/pkg/underscore)) and [GhostScript (\>=
    9.0)](https://ghostscript.com/releases/): for rendering text with
    LaTeX.
-   [fontconfig](https://www.fontconfig.org) (\>= 2.7): for detection of
    system fonts on Linux.

### C libraries

Matplotlib brings its own copies of the following libraries:

-   `Agg`: the Anti-Grain Geometry C++ rendering engine
-   `ttconv`: a TrueType font utility

Additionally, Matplotlib depends on:

-   [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/) (\>= 2.3): a font rendering
    library
-   [QHull](http://www.qhull.org/) (\>= 8.0.2): a library for computing
    triangulations (note that this version is also known as 2020.2)

#### Download during install

By default, Matplotlib downloads and builds its own copies of Qhull and
FreeType. The vendored version of FreeType is necessary to run the test
suite, because different versions of FreeType rasterize characters
differently.

#### Use system libraries

To force Matplotlib to use a copy of FreeType or Qhull already installed
in your system, you must [pass configuration settings to Meson via
meson-python](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to-guides/config-settings.html):

``` sh
python -m pip install \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dsystem-freetype=true" \
  --config-settings=setup-args="-Dsystem-qhull=true" \
  .
```

In this case, you need to install the FreeType and Qhull library and
headers. This can be achieved using a package manager, e.g. for
FreeType:

``` sh
# Pick ONE of the following:
sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install freetype-devel    # Fedora
brew install freetype              # macOS with Homebrew
conda install freetype             # conda, any OS
```

(adapt accordingly for Qhull).

On Linux and macOS, it is also recommended to install
[pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/), a
helper tool for locating FreeType:

``` sh
# Pick ONE of the following:
sudo apt install pkg-config  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install pkgconf     # Fedora
brew install pkg-config      # macOS with Homebrew
conda install pkg-config     # conda
# Or point the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the path to pkg-config:
export PKG_CONFIG=...
```

If not using pkg-config (in particular on Windows), you may need to set
the include path (to the library headers) and link path (to the
libraries) explicitly, if they are not in standard locations. This can
be done using standard environment variables \-- on Linux and macOS:

``` sh
export CFLAGS='-I/directory/containing/ft2build.h'
export LDFLAGS='-L/directory/containing/libfreetype.so'
```

and on Windows:

``` bat
set CL=/IC:\directory\containing\ft2build.h
set LINK=/LIBPATH:C:\directory\containing\freetype.lib
```

If you go this route but need to reset and rebuild to change your
settings, remember to clear your artifacts before re-building:

    git clean -xfd

#### From source files

If the automatic download does not work (for example, on air-gapped
systems) it is preferable to instead use system libraries. However you
can manually download the tarballs into
`subprojects/packagecache`{.interpreted-text role="file"} at the top
level of the checkout repository. The expected SHA256 hashes of the
downloaded tarballs are in `subprojects/*.wrap`{.interpreted-text
role="file"} if you wish to verify them, but they will also be checked
by the build system before unpacking.

### Minimum pip / manylinux support (linux)

Matplotlib publishes [manylinux
wheels](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) which have a minimum version
of pip which will recognize the wheels

-   Python 3.9+: `manylinux2014` / pip \>= 19.3

In all cases the required version of pip is embedded in the CPython
source.

## Build dependencies {#development-dependencies}

### Python {#setup-dependencies}

`pip` normally builds packages using
`build isolation <reference/build-system>`{.interpreted-text
role="external+pip:doc"}, which means that `pip` installs the
dependencies listed here for the duration of the build process. However,
build isolation is disabled via the the
`--no-build-isolation <install_--no-build-isolation>`{.interpreted-text
role="external+pip:ref"} flag when
`installing Matplotlib for development <development-install>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which means that the dependencies must be explicitly
installed, either by
`creating a virtual environment <dev-environment>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} (recommended) or by manually installing the following
packages:

-   [meson-python](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/) (\>= 0.13.1).
-   [PyBind11](https://pypi.org/project/pybind11/) (\>= 2.13.2). Used to
    connect C/C++ code with Python.
-   [setuptools_scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) (\>= 7).
    Used to update the reported `mpl.__version__` based on the current
    git commit. Also a runtime dependency for editable installs.
-   [NumPy]() (\>= 1.22). Also a runtime dependency.

### Compilers and external build tools {#compile-build-dependencies}

When setting up a virtual environment for development,
[ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (\>= 1.8.2) may need to be installed
separately. This may be available as a [pre-built
binary](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) or from a
[package
manager](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages)
or bundled with Meson. Ninja may also be installed via `pip` if
otherwise not available.

#### Compilers {#compile-dependencies}

Matplotlib requires a C++ compiler that supports C++17, and each
platform has a development environment that must be installed before a
compiler can be installed. You may also need to install headers for
various libraries used in the compiled extension source files.

We highly recommend that you install a compiler using your platform
tool, i.e., Xcode, VS Code or Linux package manager. Choose **one**
compiler from this list:
