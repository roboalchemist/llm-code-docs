# Welcome to CAMEL\'s documentation!

| **Finding the Scaling Law of Agents: The First and the Best
  Multi-Agent Framework.**

| **CAMEL** emerges as the earliest [LLM-based multi-agent
  framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17760.pdf), and is now a generic
  framework to build and use LLM-based agents for real-world task
  solving. We believe that studying these agents on a large scale offers
  valuable insights into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential
  risks. To facilitate research in this field, we implement and support
  various types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated
  environments.
