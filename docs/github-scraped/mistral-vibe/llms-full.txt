**Mistral's open-source CLI coding assistant.**

Mistral Vibe is a command-line coding assistant powered by Mistral's models. It provides a conversational interface to your codebase, allowing you to use natural language to explore, modify, and interact with your projects through a powerful set of tools.

> [!WARNING]
> Mistral Vibe works on Windows, but we officially support and target UNIX environments.

### One-line install (recommended)

**Linux and macOS**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://mistral.ai/vibe/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**

First, install uv
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then, use uv command below.

### Using uv

```bash
uv tool install mistral-vibe
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install mistral-vibe
```

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: A conversational AI agent that understands your requests and breaks down complex tasks.
- **Powerful Toolset**: A suite of tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution, right from the chat prompt.
  - Read, write, and patch files (`read_file`, `write_file`, `search_replace`).
  - Execute shell commands in a stateful terminal (`bash`).
  - Recursively search code with `grep` (with `ripgrep` support).
  - Manage a `todo` list to track the agent's work.
- **Project-Aware Context**: Vibe automatically scans your project's file structure and Git status to provide relevant context to the agent, improving its understanding of your codebase.
- **Advanced CLI Experience**: Built with modern libraries for a smooth and efficient workflow.
  - Autocompletion for slash commands (`/`) and file paths (`@`).
  - Persistent command history.
  - Beautiful Themes.
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize models, providers, tool permissions, and UI preferences through a simple `config.toml` file.
- **Safety First**: Features tool execution approval.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Run Vibe:

   ```bash
   vibe
   ```

3. If this is your first time running Vibe, it will:

   - Create a default configuration file at `~/.vibe/config.toml`
   - Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured
   - Save your API key to `~/.vibe/.env` for future use

4. Start interacting with the agent!

   ```
   > Can you find all instances of the word "TODO" in the project?

   🤖 The user wants to find all instances of "TODO". The `grep` tool is perfect for this. I will use it to search the current directory.

   > grep(pattern="TODO", path=".")

   ... (grep tool output) ...

   🤖 I found the following "TODO" comments in your project.
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `vibe` to enter the interactive chat loop.

- **Multi-line Input**: Press `Ctrl+J` or `Shift+Enter` for select terminals to insert a newline.
- **File Paths**: Reference files in your prompt using the `@` symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., `> Read the file @src/agent.py`).
- **Shell Commands**: Prefix any command with `!` to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., `> !ls -l`).

You can start Vibe with a prompt with the following command:

```bash
vibe "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

**Note**: The `--auto-approve` flag automatically approves all tool executions without prompting. In interactive mode, you can also toggle auto-approve on/off using `Shift+Tab`.

### Programmatic Mode

You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the `--prompt` flag. This is useful for scripting.

```bash
vibe --prompt "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular."
```

by default it will use `auto-approve` mode.

### Slash Commands

Use slash commands for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session.

## Configuration

Vibe is configured via a `config.toml` file. It looks for this file first in `./.vibe/config.toml` and then falls back to `~/.vibe/config.toml`.

### API Key Configuration

Vibe supports multiple ways to configure your API keys:

1. **Interactive Setup (Recommended for first-time users)**: When you run Vibe for the first time or if your API key is missing, Vibe will prompt you to enter it. The key will be securely saved to `~/.vibe/.env` for future sessions.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set your API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_mistral_api_key"
   ```

3. **`.env` File**: Create a `.env` file in `~/.vibe/` and add your API keys:

   ```bash
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   ```

   Vibe automatically loads API keys from `~/.vibe/.env` on startup. Environment variables take precedence over the `.env` file if both are set.

**Note**: The `.env` file is specifically for API keys and other provider credentials. General Vibe configuration should be done in `config.toml`.

### Custom System Prompts

You can create custom system prompts to replace the default one (`prompts/cli.md`). Create a markdown file in the `~/.vibe/prompts/` directory with your custom prompt content.

To use a custom system prompt, set the `system_prompt_id` in your configuration to match the filename (without the `.md` extension):

```toml
# Use a custom system prompt
system_prompt_id = "my_custom_prompt"
```

This will load the prompt from `~/.vibe/prompts/my_custom_prompt.md`.

### Custom Agent Configurations

You can create custom agent configurations for specific use cases (e.g., red-teaming, specialized tasks) by adding agent-specific TOML files in the `~/.vibe/agents/` directory.

To use a custom agent, run Vibe with the `--agent` flag:

```bash
vibe --agent my_custom_agent
```

Vibe will look for a file named `my_custom_agent.toml` in the agents directory and apply its configuration.

Example custom agent configuration (`~/.vibe/agents/redteam.toml`):

```toml
# Custom agent configuration for red-teaming
active_model = "devstral-2"
system_prompt_id = "redteam"

# Disable some tools for this agent
disabled_tools = ["search_replace", "write_file"]

# Override tool permissions for this agent
[tools.bash]
permission = "always"

[tools.read_file]
permission = "always"
```

Note: this implies that you have setup a redteam prompt names `~/.vibe/prompts/redteam.md`

### MCP Server Configuration

You can configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Vibe's capabilities. Add MCP server configurations under the `mcp_servers` section:

```toml
# Example MCP server configurations
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_http_server"
transport = "http"
url = "http://localhost:8000"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer my_token" }
api_key_env = "MY_API_KEY_ENV_VAR"
api_key_header = "Authorization"
api_key_format = "Bearer {token}"

[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_streamable_server"
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "http://localhost:8001"
headers = { "X-API-Key" = "my_api_key" }

[[mcp_servers]]
name = "fetch_server"
transport = "stdio"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-fetch"]
```

Supported transports:

- `http`: Standard HTTP transport
- `streamable-http`: HTTP transport with streaming support
- `stdio`: Standard input/output transport (for local processes)

Key fields:

- `name`: A short alias for the server (used in tool names)
- `transport`: The transport type
- `url`: Base URL for HTTP transports
- `headers`: Additional HTTP headers
- `api_key_env`: Environment variable containing the API key
- `command`: Command to run for stdio transport
- `args`: Additional arguments for stdio transport

MCP tools are named using the pattern `{server_name}_{tool_name}` and can be configured with permissions like built-in tools:

```toml
# Configure permissions for specific MCP tools
[tools.fetch_server_get]
permission = "always"

[tools.my_http_server_query]
permission = "ask"
```

### Enable/disable tools with patterns

You can control which tools are active using `enabled_tools` and `disabled_tools`.
These fields support exact names, glob patterns, and regular expressions.

Examples:

```toml
# Only enable tools that start with "serena_" (glob)
enabled_tools = ["serena_*"]

# Regex (prefix with re:) — matches full tool name (case-insensitive)
enabled_tools = ["re:^serena_.*$"]

# Heuristic regex support (patterns like `serena.*` are treated as regex)
enabled_tools = ["serena.*"]

# Disable a group with glob; everything else stays enabled
disabled_tools = ["mcp_*", "grep"]
```

Notes:

- MCP tool names use underscores, e.g., `serena_list` not `serena.list`.
- Regex patterns are matched against the full tool name using fullmatch.

### Custom Vibe Home Directory

By default, Vibe stores its configuration in `~/.vibe/`. You can override this by setting the `VIBE_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
export VIBE_HOME="/path/to/custom/vibe/home"
```

This affects where Vibe looks for:

- `config.toml` - Main configuration
- `.env` - API keys
- `agents/` - Custom agent configurations
- `prompts/` - Custom system prompts
- `tools/` - Custom tools
- `logs/` - Session logsRetryTo run code, enable code execution and file creation in Settings > Capabilities.

# python312.rule
# Rule for enforcing modern Python 3.12+ best practices.
# Applies to all Python files (*.py) in the project.
#
# Guidelines covered:
# - Use match-case syntax instead of if/elif/else for pattern matching.
# - Use the walrus operator (:=) when it simplifies assignments and tests.
# - Favor a "never nester" approach by avoiding deep nesting with early returns or guard clauses.
# - Employ modern type hints using built-in generics (list, dict) and the union pipe (|) operator,
#   rather than deprecated types from the typing module (e.g., Optional, Union, Dict, List).
# - Ensure code adheres to strong static typing practices compatible with static analyzers like pyright.
# - Favor pathlib.Path methods for file system operations over older os.path functions.
# - Write code in a declarative and minimalist style that clearly expresses its intent.
# - Additional best practices including f-string formatting, comprehensions, context managers, and overall PEP 8 compliance.

description: "Modern Python 3.12+ best practices and style guidelines for coding."
files: "**/*.py"

guidelines:
  - title: "Match-Case Syntax"
    description: >
      Prefer using the match-case construct over traditional if/elif/else chains when pattern matching
      is applicable. This leads to clearer, more concise, and more maintainable code.

  - title: "Walrus Operator"
    description: >
      Utilize the walrus operator (:=) to streamline code where assignment and conditional testing can be combined.
      Use it judiciously when it improves readability and reduces redundancy.

  - title: "Never Nester"
    description: >
      Aim to keep code flat by avoiding deep nesting. Use early returns, guard clauses, and refactoring to
      minimize nested structures, making your code more readable and maintainable.

  - title: "Modern Type Hints"
    description: >
      Adopt modern type hinting by using built-in generics like list and dict, along with the pipe (|) operator
      for union types (e.g., int | None). Avoid older, deprecated constructs such as Optional, Union, Dict, and List
      from the typing module.

  - title: "Strong Static Typing"
    description: >
      Write code with explicit and robust type annotations that are fully compatible with static type checkers
      like pyright. This ensures higher code reliability and easier maintenance.

  - title: "Pydantic-First Parsing"
    description: >
      Prefer Pydantic v2's native validation over ad-hoc parsing. Use `model_validate`,
      `field_validator`, `from_attributes`, and field aliases to coerce external SDK/DTO objects.
      Avoid manual `getattr`/`hasattr` flows and custom constructors like `from_sdk` unless they are
      thin wrappers over `model_validate`. Keep normalization logic inside model validators so call sites
      remain declarative and typed.

  - title: "Pathlib for File Operations"
    description: >
      Favor the use of pathlib.Path methods for file system operations. This approach offers a more
      readable, object-oriented way to handle file paths and enhances cross-platform compatibility,
      reducing reliance on legacy os.path functions.

  - title: "Declarative and Minimalist Code"
    description: >
      Write code that is declarative—clearly expressing its intentions rather than focusing on implementation details.
      Strive to keep your code minimalist by removing unnecessary complexity and boilerplate. This approach improves
      readability, maintainability, and aligns with modern Python practices.

  - title: "Additional Best Practices"
    description: >
      Embrace other modern Python idioms such as:
      - Using f-strings for string formatting.
      - Favoring comprehensions for building lists and dictionaries.
      - Employing context managers (with statements) for resource management.
      - Following PEP 8 guidelines to maintain overall code style consistency.

  - title: "Exception Documentation"
    description: >
      Document exceptions accurately and minimally in docstrings:
      - Only document exceptions that are explicitly raised in the function implementation
      - Remove Raises entries for exceptions that are not directly raised
      - Include all possible exceptions from explicit raise statements
      - For public APIs, document exceptions from called functions if they are allowed to propagate
      - Avoid documenting built-in exceptions that are obvious (like TypeError from type hints)
      This ensures documentation stays accurate and maintainable, avoiding the common pitfall
      of listing every possible exception that could theoretically occur.

  - title: "Modern Enum Usage"
    description: >
      Leverage Python's enum module effectively following modern practices:
      - Use StrEnum for string-based enums that need string comparison
      - Use IntEnum/IntFlag for performance-critical integer-based enums
      - Use auto() for automatic value assignment to maintain clean code
      - Always use UPPERCASE for enum members to avoid name clashes
      - Add methods to enums when behavior needs to be associated with values
      - Use @property for computed attributes rather than storing values
      - For type mixing, ensure mix-in types appear before Enum in base class sequence
      - Consider Flag/IntFlag for bit field operations
      - Use _generate_next_value_ for custom value generation
      - Implement __bool__ when enum boolean evaluation should depend on value
      This promotes type-safe constants, self-documenting code, and maintainable value sets.

  - title: "No Inline Ignores"
    description: >
      Do not use inline suppressions like `# type: ignore[...]` or `# noqa[...]` in production code.
      Instead, fix types and lint warnings at the source by:
      - Refining signatures with generics (TypeVar), Protocols, or precise return types
      - Guarding with `isinstance` checks before attribute access
      - Using `typing.cast` when control flow guarantees the type
      - Extracting small helpers to create clearer, typed boundaries
      If a suppression is truly unavoidable at an external boundary, prefer a narrow, well-typed wrapper
      over in-line ignores, and document the rationale in code comments.

  - title: "Pydantic Discriminated Unions"
    description: >
      When modeling variants with a discriminated union (e.g., on a `transport` field), do not narrow a
      field type in a subclass (e.g., overriding `transport: Literal['http']` with `Literal['streamable-http']`).
      This violates Liskov substitution and triggers type checker errors due to invariance of class attributes.
      Prefer sibling classes plus a shared mixin for common fields and helpers, and compose the union with
      `Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator='transport')]`.
      Example pattern:
      - Create a base with shared non-discriminator fields (e.g., `_MCPBase`).
      - Create a mixin with protocol-specific fields/methods (e.g., `_MCPHttpFields`), without a `transport`.
      - Define sibling final classes per variant (e.g., `MCPHttp`, `MCPStreamableHttp`, `MCPStdio`) that set
        `transport: Literal[...]` once in each final class.
      - Use `match` on the discriminator to narrow types at call sites.

  - title: "Use uv for All Commands"
    description: >
      We use uv to manage our python environment. You should nevery try to run a bare python commands.
      Always run commands using `uv` instead of invoking `python` or `pip` directly.
      For example, use `uv add package` and `uv run script.py` rather than `pip install package` or `python script.py`.
      This practice helps avoid environment drift and leverages modern Python packaging best practices.
      Useful uv commands are:
      - uv add/remove <package> to manage dependencies
      - uv sync to install dependencies declared in pyproject.toml and uv.lock
      - uv run script.py to run a script within the uv environment
      - uv run pytest (or any other python tool) to run the tool within the uv environment
