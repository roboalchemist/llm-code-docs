DCO

Testing
=======

With `tox <https:///tox.wiki>`_ the whole test suite can be executed in
a separate *virtual environment* for each supported Python version available on
the system. ``tuf`` and its dependencies are installed automatically for each
tox run.

::

     tox

Below, you will see more details about each step managed by ``tox``, in case
you need debug/run outside ``tox``.

Unit tests
----------

test suite can be executed directly as well (in this case the environment managed by tox is
not used):
::

     python3 -m unittest


Individual tests can also be executed. Optional ``-v`` flags can be added to
increase log level up to DEBUG (``-vvvv``).
::

     python3 tests/test_updater_ng.py -v


Coverage
--------

To run the tests and measure their code coverage, the aggregation script can be
invoked with the ``coverage`` tool (requires installation of ``coverage``, e.g.
via PyPI).
::

     coverage run -m unittest


Auto-formatting
---------------

The linter in CI/CD will check that new TUF code is formatted with
`ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_. Auto-formatting can be done on the
command line:
::

     tox -e fix
