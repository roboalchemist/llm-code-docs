Since launching the **GraphQL Local Initiative** last year, communities around
the world have been gathering to share knowledge, collaborate, and strengthen
their local GraphQL ecosystems. Over the past year, we’ve seen:

- **GraphQL London** hosting three or four events a year — with another due in November
- **GraphQL Sydney** diving into hot topics like GraphQL nullability
- **GraphQL Berlin** meeting the day after GraphQLConf 2025 concluded in Amsterdam,
  requiring quick travel for Stephen and Michael!
- **GraphQL Hyderabad** celebrating a fantastic first meetup
- **GraphQL Austin** forming over ramen to plan a new series of events
- **GraphQL Paris** and **GraphQL Oslo** preparing to meet later this month

We also have local organizers working to bring people together in **Białystok**,
**Philadelphia**, **Chennai**, **Belgium**, and more locations!

## We’ve heard you

Feedback from organizers and attendees has been clear: you love the Locals
initiative but there are still things that we can improve; so we're launching
our 2025 refresh:

- **Simpler applications:** Videos are no longer required — photos can substitute
  where needed
- **More flexible events:** Locals can now host more than just talks —
  discussions, workshops, hackathons, Q&As, live recordings, and more are now
  eligible for support
- **Increased sponsorship:** Support per event has doubled, from **USD $200** to
  **USD $400**, to help with food, drinks, and venue costs
- **Clearer TSC oversight:** Independent meetups often die when the organizer
  steps down; by appointing a GraphQL TSC member as an admin, we can help ensure
  the continuity of the community over the long term

These updates come directly from your feedback. You’re building something
amazing, and we want to support you!

## Get involved

Find your nearest group in [GraphQL Events & Meetups](/community/events), or get
help setting one up via the [GraphQL Local
Initiative](/community/foundation/local-initiative).

Together, we’re building a global network of local communities — sharing ideas,
growing connections, and keeping GraphQL vibrant everywhere.
