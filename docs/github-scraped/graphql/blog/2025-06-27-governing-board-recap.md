# 📣 GraphQL Foundation May 2025 Board Meeting Recap

The GraphQL Foundation Governing Board met for its monthly board meeting on May 15 to share updates across community, technical, and operational committee initiatives. Here's a quick look at what was covered:

## 🌐 Community & Website Updates

Work continues on the redesign of [graphql.org](https://graphql.org), led by the Community Working Group. The new site will feature refreshed messaging, community-focused sections, and improved support for case studies. Community input is welcome via GitHub and monthly working group meetings. It’s looking great!

## 📅 GraphQL Conf 2025 Planning

Preparations for GraphQLConf 2025 are fully underway! The Call for Proposals has closed, and submissions are under review with support from 16 subject matter experts from the community and the TSC. Sponsorships are coming in from members like **Apollo**, **Grafbase**, and **Meta**, and attendance targets are on track. Two new local GraphQL meetup groups have launched in India, and discussions about a potential ambassador program are in development.

## 💸 Budget & Strategy

The Foundation is considering shifting its fiscal planning to align with the conference, which would simplify planning and help center GraphQLConf as a key milestone each year. Grant-funded projects are progressing well, including improvements to GraphiQL and documentation.

## 🔧 Technical Progress

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) shared updates on several fronts:

- A release candidate for the new **GraphQL over HTTP specification** is nearly ready.
- Key proposals like **Input Unions** and updated **deprecation rules** have been accepted into the spec.
- Legacy versions of **graphql-js** have been formally deprecated, with a new versioning policy now in place.
- A new **OpenTelemetry Working Group** has launched to improve observability support for GraphQL.

## 📣 Get Involved

The Foundation is looking for help organizing the conference schedule, gathering community case studies, and contributing to ongoing spec work. If you're interested in supporting the ecosystem, now’s a great time to jump in!
