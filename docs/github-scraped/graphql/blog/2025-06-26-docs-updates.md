## About the project

The [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) library is the reference implementation of the GraphQL specification
in JavaScript, and it's widely used both directly and indirectly by many GraphQL tools and servers. While the implementation
itself is robust and actively maintained, the supporting documentation had room to grow—especially when it came to helping
developers understand _how_ GraphQL.js reflects the spec and _how_ to use its APIs in real projects.

With that in mind, I applied for a GraphQL Foundation Community Grant to work on improving the GraphQL.js documentation.
My goal was to make the guides more approachable for newcomers, more accurate for advanced users, and more aligned with the
specification for everyone.

## What I worked on

This project involved a full audit of the existing GraphQL.js guides, followed by targeted updates to improve clarity,
structure, and completeness. I focused on areas that were either under-documented or potentially confusing, and worked to
ensure the guides explained not just _what_ GraphQL.js does, but _why_ and _how_ it does it.

Some key improvements include:

- Clearer explanations of schema construction and how types are defined in GraphQL.js
- Improved guidance on how execution and validation flow maps to the spec
- Expanded sections on custom scalars and other advanced patterns
- New guides on testing and production-readiness

All updates are live on the [GraphQL.js docs site](https://www.graphql-js.org/docs/).

## What's next

I hope these updates help more developers learn and use GraphQL.js effectively, and serve as a foundation for future improvements
to the reference documentation. There’s still more we can do and I’d love to see others in the community build on this work.

This project was a rewarding chance to contribute meaningfully to the GraphQL ecosystem, and I’m thankful to the maintainers
who reviewed, discussed, and supported the updates throughout the process. If you’re considering a documentation or
community contribution, I encourage you to explore the [GraphQL Foundation’s Community Grant Program](https://graphql.org/foundation/community-grant/). It’s a great way to go deep, give back, and help others along the way.

Feel free to reach out if you’re thinking about submitting a proposal. I’m happy to share what I learned! You can
