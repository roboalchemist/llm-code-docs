_Note: The GraphQL Foundation Governing Board will be authoring monthly blog post summaries of their meetings. This is the first approved post, with more to come!_

GraphQL Foundation’s Governing Board gathered on March 20 for a productive meeting focused on transparency, community growth, and continued technical progress. One key highlight was the board’s support for hosting **biannual public “Town Hall”–style meetings**, inspired by the first such meeting at GraphQLConf 2024. These events—one of which will be held during GraphQLConf 2025 in September—aim to bring more visibility to the Foundation’s work and encourage community participation and input.

On the technical front, the **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** shared updates on nullability, upcoming changes to graphql-js, and ongoing work on the incremental delivery specification. The team also encouraged feedback from Board Members and the community on behalf of GraphQL over HTTP.

The new [**Community Working Group**](https://github.com/graphql/community-wg), under the TSC, reported strong early engagement, including work on a refreshed GraphQL.org landing page and an open, async collaboration model based on GitHub issues.

The **Marketing & Content Committee** reported that efforts are underway to produce a series of case studies and better support industry-specific adoption stories. The team is also exploring more tailored messaging and additional social media campaigns to promote the conference, Local initiatives, and GraphQL-related news.

Preparations for GraphQLConf 2025 in Amsterdam are well underway. The CFP has seen increased submissions compared to last year, and new voting tools will enable more inclusive talk selection. Ticket sales are tracking to plan, and the Foundation is actively seeking additional sponsors to support the event.

Finally, the **Budget Committee** presented a draft of a new membership pitch deck designed to better communicate the impact and benefits of joining the GraphQL Foundation. The committee is continuing to refine this deck and will solicit ongoing feedback on the messaging.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue working together to support the GraphQL ecosystem and community. If your organization is interested in sponsoring GraphQL Conf or contributing a case study, we’d love to hear from you!
