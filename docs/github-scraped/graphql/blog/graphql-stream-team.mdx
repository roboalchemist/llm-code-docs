We're excited to announce that this year, alongside GraphQLConf 2025 in Amsterdam, we’re diving into something a little different. This is your once in a lifetime opportunity to swim in the Amsterdam canals and craft some fin-tastic puns. We've created a team to participate in the [Amsterdam City Swim](https://www.amsterdamcityswim.nl/), and we’d love for you to join the [GraphQL Stream Team](https://www.amsterdamcityswim.nl/teams/graphql-stream-team) on Sunday, September 7th!

**Why We're Swimming**

The Amsterdam City Swim isn’t just a unique athletic event—it’s a powerful fundraiser supporting research into ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), a devastating neurological disease that still has no cure. Every stroke we take helps raise money and awareness, and contributes to the ongoing fight against ALS.

As developers, technologists, and open source enthusiasts, we often work together to solve complex problems. Now, we’re channeling that same energy into something beyond our everyday work—supporting a cause that impacts lives around the world. Our goal is to raise €2,500.

**Who Can Join?**

Anyone is welcome, even if you aren’t able to attend GraphQLConf! All you need is a swimsuit/wetsuit and goggles. Whether you're a seasoned swimmer or just in it for the adventure, we want you. **There are two different distance options - 750m + 2.25 km.**

**Not a Fish?**

We love a fan club! We’ll arrange a meetup spot for spectators and a post-swim soiree.
