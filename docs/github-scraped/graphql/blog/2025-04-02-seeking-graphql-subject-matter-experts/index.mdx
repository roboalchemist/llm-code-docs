## The Talk Selection Process

There are three groups involved in the talk selection process: 

* The Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
* The new Subject Matter Experts initiative (SMEs) ← This is YOU!
* The Program Committee

After the submission period ends, the TSC will have a short period of time to assess the viability of proposed talks and discount any which fall short of the selection criteria: talks which are vendor pitches or off-topic will be rejected at this early stage. The TSC will then have a week to use a star rating system to rate the talks based on their quality and originality, as well as their importance to the GraphQL ecosystem. 

In parallel, the SMEs will be given a selection of the talk proposals based on their subject matter areas. They will rate the talks using a comparison method, where groups of three talks are compared to each other. This will help identify which talks are the strongest fit for the conference based on subject relevance, originality, and potential audience engagement.


After these two rating methods, each talk will have two scores: a star rating from the TSC based on conference fit, and a rating from the SMEs reflecting subject content. The Program Committee will then start with the most highly rated talks and work to produce the schedule. Whilst the aim is to produce a schedule reflecting the TSC and SME ratings, the Program Committee will also act as a curator: making sure there is a good balance of talks from across different industries and affiliations, as well as looking at speaker diversity in terms of demographics and a balance between experienced and new speakers.
