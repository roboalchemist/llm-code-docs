We’re excited to share the launch of a new **AI Working Group** to explore how GraphQL can best support the growing needs of generative artificial intelligence and machine learning.

As AI adoption accelerates, developers are using GraphQL to power everything from MCP tools to vector search (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and embeddings to streaming model responses. The AI Working Group will bring the community together to share use cases and challenges in AI + GraphQL and document common practices for using GraphQL with AI tooling.

We anticipate that the group will propose spec improvements and extensions to benefit both human and AI consumers, and raise opportunities to coordinate across organizations to support interoperability and compatibility.


**Our first meeting is coming up on October 23** - grab the calendar invite at [calendar.graphql.org](https://calendar.graphql.org)!
To join, open [PR against the agenda](https://github.com/graphql/ai-wg/tree/main/agendas) and add yourself, then follow the prompts to sign the EasyCLA. 

Like all GraphQL working groups, this one is **open to everyone**. Whether you’re building AI APIs, researching integrations, or just curious about the possibilities, you’re welcome to join. If you can't make it, you can always catch up via the [GraphQL Foundation Working Groups YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GraphQLFoundation).

👉 Get involved:

* Follow updates on the [GraphQL GitHub](https://github.com/graphql)
* [Subscribe](https://calendar.graphql.org) for community calendar invites 
* Bring your ideas and feedback to help shape the group’s work 

AI is transforming software development, and GraphQL is uniquely suited to make AI systems more accessible and connected. We can’t wait to see what we’ll build together.
