After ten years of continuous growth and evolution, we're excited to announce the complete redesign of GraphQL.org!

What started as a simple query language has transformed into the backbone of modern API development at companies like Meta, Netflix, GitHub, and thousands of others worldwide.

## Why Now?

GraphQL has come a long way since its inception. As the ecosystem has matured and adoption has scaled globally, our website needed to evolve too. The previous design served us well as we expanded, but it was time for a refresh that truly reflects where GraphQL stands today and where it's heading.

## What's New

Our redesigned homepage now clearly communicates not just what GraphQL is, but why it matters for modern development:

**Clear Value Propositions:** We've highlighted GraphQL's three core benefits: delivering the best user experience, ensuring security and stability, and enabling efficient distributed development.

**Proven at Scale:** See how leading companies leverage GraphQL in production environments.

**Use Case Guidance:** Whether you're building a mobile app, managing microservices, or developing AI-powered applications, discover if GraphQL is right for your project.

**Enhanced Resources:** From the five pillars of GraphQL to data colocation patterns, we've organized our content to help you succeed at every stage of your GraphQL journey.

**Community Focus:** Stronger connections to our vibrant community resources and contribution opportunities.

## Behind the Scenes: Technical Craftsmanship

Beyond the visual refresh, this redesign showcases some interesting technical details that our community might appreciate:

**Creative Problem-Solving:** That smooth rotation animation you'll see? It's not just for aesthetics. [It's actually the only way to animate the element without breaking the highlight effects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74085350/backdrop-filter-doesnt-apply-if-parents-opacity-is-less-than-1) from the underlying wire graphics. Sometimes constraints lead to the most elegant solutions.

**Developer Experience:** We discovered it's faster to iterate on syntax highlighting themes in VSCode than in our Nextra-shiki setup. This led us to publish a [syntax highlighting theme](https://github.com/hasparus/k-colorable) as a side effect of the redesign process.

## Explore the New Experience

The redesigned GraphQL.org better reflects the maturity and sophistication of both the specification and its ecosystem. We've maintained our commitment to clear documentation while adding the context and guidance that today's developers need.
