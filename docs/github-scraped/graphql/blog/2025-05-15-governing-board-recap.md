The GraphQL Foundation Governing Board met April 17 to discuss ongoing community efforts, technical progress, and upcoming events—read on for the highlights:

### **🖥️ Website Redesign Underway**

The first version of the new GraphQL.org design is live for community feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql/community-wg/issues/21#issuecomment-2766734209)! Championed by The Guild, the new site focuses on communicating GraphQL’s value to different types of users. Check it out on GitHub and [Figma](http://figma.com/proto/aPUvZDSxJfYDJtPd7GF2sB/GraphQL.org?page-id=10%3A13019&node-id=649-3367&viewport=-2607%2C336%2C0.13&t=eZKIRpRkrWRATgQb-9&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=649%3A3367&show-proto-sidebar=1)—your feedback is welcome.

### **🌍 Planning GraphQL All-Hands**

We had fabulous input and a great turn out for our first public board meeting, which was held at GraphQLConf 2024. We’re building on that idea with a plan to host twice-a-year **GraphQL All-Hands** sessions. These gatherings will celebrate progress, share strategic updates, and foster open discussion. The next one will take place at [GraphQLConf 2025](https://graphql.org/conf/2025/) this fall!

### **📊 Community Survey Discussion**

Several Board and community members are exploring a user survey to help shape technical priorities, improve documentation, and inform event content. The Board discussed options to help the effort start small and release iteratively—stay tuned!

### **💸 Budget & Membership**

We're exploring aligning our fiscal planning with GraphQLConf to better match our annual rhythm. We also celebrated progress on new community grants! 🎉

### **🎤 GraphQLConf 2025**

We’re expanding community involvement in the CFP process by becoming a **Subject Matter Expert**—we’re looking for volunteers to help rank talks for the conference program. Also, we're proud to support an [ALS charity swim team](https://graphql.org/blog/graphql-stream-team/) happening before the conference. The CFP closed **May 12**.
