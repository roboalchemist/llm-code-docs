The GraphQL Foundation is happy to announce the next cohort of GraphQL Ambassadors! 
Ambassadors are nominated and represent a diverse range of geographies, backgrounds, and use cases — from maintainers of popular libraries, to meetup organizers, to educators writing guides and tutorials. Join us in welcoming these 12 incredible individuals to the team!

## News from the Ambassadors

Our Ambassadors hit the ground running, with new local meetup groups being organized in Philadelphia and Poland. We look forward to those first meetups in 2026! 

Ambassadors Erik and An were also busy representing GraphQL at API Days Paris. Alongside TSC member Martin, they staffed an API Standards booth promoting GraphQL, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema. The booth was well received and busy throughout the three-day event, helped in no small part by a 3D printer organised by Martin that produced magnets for all four standards.

Four of our ambassadors (Erik, An, Aurélien, and Michael) joined five TSC members
to give talks during the APIDays event, also attending the dedicated [GraphQL.Day](https://graphql.day) track.

## How to Get Involved

## What’s Next

The Ambassadors program is part of our broader effort to strengthen community engagement and education around GraphQL. Look forward to spotlights on our Ambassador team, upcoming blogs and speaking opportunities, and ways you can collaborate with these leaders.

Together, we’re building not just technology, but a thriving, global GraphQL community.
