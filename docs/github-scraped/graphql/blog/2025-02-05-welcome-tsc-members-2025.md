The GraphQL Technical Steering Committee is the body responsible for the technical oversight of all our open source projects and management of our open source community. Every year we vote on self-nominees to rotate up to half of TSC members, and we've just concluded the most recent vote.

### Our new TSC elections...

I’m excited to share that we have elected two new members to the GraphQL Technical Steering Committee (TSC), [Martin Bonnin](https://github.com/martinbonnin) and [Pascal Senn](https://github.com/PascalSenn), technical leads at Apollo and ChilliCream respectively. They have been consistent contributors to the GraphQL open source project over the last few years and I'm thrilled to have their help in and commitment to guiding and advancing the GraphQL technical project and broader ecosystem.

In addition, we also re-elected three existing members, [Kewei Qu](https://github.com/Keweiqu) a technical lead at Meta working on the original GraphQL deployment, [Rob Richard](https://github.com/robrichard) an engineer at 1stDibs and the lead of the Streaming GraphQL project, and [Uri Goldshtein](https://github.com/urigo) founder of The Guild. These all join our existing [TSC members](https://github.com/orgs/graphql/teams/tsc/members).

### Open working groups and the role of the TSC

GraphQL is an open project. All are welcome to join our [working group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/) meetings, champion proposals for project-wide improvements, or contribute directly across our open source projects.

It has been critical to keep access to these working groups open, but it does mean a rotating cast of contributors over time. The primary role of the TSC is to provide continuity as the stewards of this group and our processes, and co-owners of our technical projects.

While the TSC is a closed group, our focus is always on strengthening the work that happens in our open Working Group meetings—that is where technical work moves forward.

### Our processes

To learn more about the TSC and how we work, check out these resources:

- **[2025 TSC Elections](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1612)** — we use Github issues for most things across the Working Group and TSC, and this one tracked the TSC election itself. Anyone could self-nominate via a Google Form, and we held a vote via OpaVote.
- **[TSC Charter](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md)** — this lists out in detail how the TSC is governed, which contains more detail about when and how we take votes, and what we're accountable for.
- **[GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/)** — this is where we organize meetings and contribution across the Working Group, where you'll find past and upcoming agendas and can join an upcoming meeting simply by adding yourself to the next agenda file in a PR.

I'm beyond lucky to get to work with such a talented group of volunteers both directly on the TSC and across the GraphQL community.

Welcome, Martin and Pascal!
