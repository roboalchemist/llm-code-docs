Dear Community,

We're excited to share a milestone in the GraphQL-JS journey, one that puts our community at the center of everything we do.

For years, GraphQL-JS documentation lived under the broader graphql.org umbrella at `/graphql-js`. While this made sense back then, we want to serve y'all better, we want upgrade guides and everything graphql-js specific to live in one easy to navigate place.

We're thrilled to announce that GraphQL-JS has moved to its dedicated home at [**graphql-js.org**](https://www.graphql-js.org).

This isn't simply a change of address, it's a commitment to the community that has made GraphQL-JS what it is today. This new home represents the first step in a larger mission: giving you the comprehensive documentation, clear upgrade paths, and responsive support that a project of this scale deserves.

What This Means for You

- **Easier discovery**: No more hunting through nested documentation structures
- **Focused experience**: Everything GraphQL-JS related in one dedicated space
- **Better navigation**: Documentation organized around your workflow, not our internal structure

Coming soon:

- **Comprehensive upgrade guides**: Clear, step-by-step paths between major versions, GraphQL V17 will be our first attempt at this
- **Enhanced reference documentation**: Every API documented with real-world examples

## An Inflection Point

We see this move as an inflection point, a moment where we recommit to being the reference implementation the community deserves. GraphQL-JS isn't just code; it's the foundation that teams around the world build upon. Whether you're implementing a new GraphQL server, debugging a complex schema, or upgrading between major versions, you deserve documentation and tooling that makes your job easier, not harder.

This is our promise: we're not just maintaining GraphQL-JS, we're investing in its future and yours.
