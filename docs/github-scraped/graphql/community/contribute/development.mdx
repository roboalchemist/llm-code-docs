# Participating in Development

GraphQL is developed in the open, through [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql) and working group meetings that are open for anyone to attend (so long as they are covered under the [free membership agreement](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/HEAD/membership)). In addition, anybody is welcome to view the [recordings of our meetings on YouTube](https://youtube.graphql.org)

## Getting up to speed

All of our work [happens in the open](https://github.com/graphql). In addition, we record our workgroups' meetings on [YouTube](https://youtube.graphql.org). If you are interested in quickly getting up to speed on what's happening in a working group, the meeting minutes (`notes` folder in the relevant repository) and [replays](https://youtube.graphql.org) are a great place to begin.

## Asking questions

The best place to ask a development-related question is in a working group meeting, or by opening a GitHub issue. Please note that if you have an implementation question, you may get a faster answer by [asking in one of the channels more geared toward users](/community/resources/official-channels/).

If you want to get involved in GraphQL, add yourself to the meeting agenda for one of our [working groups or implementations](./project-meetings/#quick-guide-how-to-join), sign the document if you haven't already, and show up! Or, if you prefer, just open a PR against our projects as this will also initiate the spec membership signature process.

We welcome your participation!
