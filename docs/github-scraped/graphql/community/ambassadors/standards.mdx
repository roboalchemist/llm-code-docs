# GraphQL Ambassador Program Standards of Excellence

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the
[contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), a
stronger set of standards is used for the Ambassador Program. This is because
the Foundation endorses Ambassadors as representatives and leaders; the
Standards of Excellence are designed to provide a set of guidelines and best
practices for engaging with the GraphQL Foundation and broader community. This
makes it easier for Ambassadors to contribute to a positive culture by providing
clarity around what and how we create a safe and collaborative environment.

## Scope

If you are a GraphQL Ambassador, these Standards apply to you. This means they
apply to your statements and actions in your capacity as a GraphQL Foundation
representative, whether they occur online or offline, and whether they occur
within community spaces or outside of community spaces.

In addition to complying with these Standards of Excellence, GraphQL Ambassadors
are also required to comply with the [GraphQL Code of Conduct](https://graphql.org/) and the [Linux
Foundation Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and all other applicable GraphQL Foundation
policies, rules, or guidelines.

## Be Kind, Welcoming, and Inclusive

- Be kind to others.
- Promote a friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions,
  participating in discussions, and making contributions.
- Show gratitude and appreciation for others. Look for opportunities to say
  “thank you” and recognize people when they are being helpful or making
  contributions.
- Make a conscious effort to welcome and be inclusive of newcomers and people
  who are different from you.
- Show empathy, care, and concern for others’ feelings, perspectives, and
  experiences.

## Be Respectful and Professional

- At all times, conduct yourself in a manner that is appropriate for a
  professional environment.
- Always treat others with courtesy and respect. Rude, insulting, offensive,
  disparaging, or threatening statements or behaviors are not permitted.

## Handle Disagreements Respectfully

We want to encourage the candid exchange of ideas and feedback and foster an
environment in which people can openly agree or disagree with each other, so
long as they do so respectfully. Disagreements are not an excuse for bad
behavior. As a GraphQL Ambassador, you are expected to:

- Respond to differences of opinion in a respectful manner.
- Make a conscious effort to understand other people’s perspectives and learn
  the facts before you publicly take a stand on any highly controversial issue.
- Seek to resolve conflict and disagreement in a respectful and collaborative
  manner and encourage others to do the same.

## Promote and Enhance the GraphQL Brand

As a GraphQL Ambassador, part of your role is to promote and enhance the GraphQL
brand and contribute to goodwill and positive relations among the Foundation and
others in GraphQL ecosystem. Nonetheless, you can be honest and candid with
constructive criticism, holding others accountable, identifying opportunities
for improvement, and discussing potential challenges. However, always express
yourself in a manner that is respectful and professional, and strive to also be
tactful and sensitive to how your words may impact others. See the “Be Graceful
With Feedback” section below for suggestions on how to deliver feedback
constructively and kindly.

As a GraphQL Ambassador, your actions can reflect either positively or poorly on
the GraphQL community, Foundation, and brand. Therefore, engaging in activity
that is illegal, immoral, fraudulent, deceptive, or is otherwise likely to
damage the reputation of the GraphQL community, Foundation, or Ambassador
Program, is grounds for immediate suspension or removal from the GraphQL
Ambassador Program.

## Don’t use GraphQL community spaces or your role as an Ambassador to promote political causes

Your role as a GraphQL Ambassador is to be used for the purpose of evangelizing
GraphQL and otherwise contributing to the GraphQL community and ecosystem. Both
the GraphQL Code of Conduct and these Standards of Excellence prohibit use of
GraphQL community spaces for political campaigning or promotion of political
causes that are unrelated to the advancement of GraphQL technology.

Outside of GraphQL community spaces, you are free to engage in political
activities and support causes you choose. However, when you discuss political
causes that are unrelated to GraphQL, please keep those discussions separate
from your engagement in GraphQL and separate from your role as a GraphQL
Ambassador. For example, if you choose to promote a political cause unrelated to
technology on X or LinkedIn in your personal time, please do so in posts and
discussion threads that are separate from GraphQL-related discussions.

## Be Graceful With Feedback

- Giving others kudos and recognition is a great way to contribute to a positive
  environment. Therefore, feel free to share positive feedback in both public
  and private forums.
- When it comes to negative feedback or criticism, remember that none of us are
  perfect. We all make mistakes. Most people are good people who are trying to
  do good things. Therefore, when others make mistakes, strive to be
  understanding. When you make a mistake, take responsibility and do your best
  to learn and improve.
- Always share feedback or criticism in a respectful, courteous, and
  professional manner. Additionally, always strive to present negative feedback
  or criticism in a constructive manner (e.g. as suggestions for improvement)
  rather than a destructive manner (e.g. insults or degrading language).
- When you have negative feedback or criticism about an individual (other than a
  public figure), please share it privately to help the individual learn and
  grow. Please avoid sharing negative feedback or criticism about an individual
  (other than a public figure) publicly, because this could cause unnecessary
  shame, embarrassment, or humiliation.
- When you have negative feedback or criticism about an organization or public
  figure, you may share it publicly or privately, so long as you do so in a
  respectful, courteous, and professional manner.

## Consequences for Violation

If the GraphQL Foundation determines that a GraphQL Ambassador has violated
these Standards of Excellence, or if a GraphQL Ambassador has been found in
violation of the GraphQL Code of Conduct or the Linux Foundation Events Code of
Conduct, the GraphQL Foundation, at its sole discretion, may take any action
that it deems appropriate under the circumstances, including asking the GraphQL
Ambassador to remove offending content from community spaces or public spaces,
or suspending or removing the individual from the GraphQL Ambassador Program.

## Questions and Reporting

If you have questions about these Standards of Excellence, or if you would like
to report a potential violation, please send an email to [insert email address]
and the current community manager will contact you. We will respond promptly to
all questions and reports.

## Updates

The GraphQL Foundation reserves the right to modify these Standards of
Excellence at any time, at its sole discretion. The GraphQL Foundation will
notify GraphQL Ambassadors of major changes to the guidelines by email [and via
the GraphQL Ambassador Discord channel]. However, any changes to these
guidelines will not apply retroactively. If these guidelines are updated and a
GraphQL Ambassador does not wish to agree, their participation in the GraphQL
Ambassador Program will cease until such time as they do agree.
