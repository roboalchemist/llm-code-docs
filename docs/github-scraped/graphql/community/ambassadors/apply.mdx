## Ambassador Code of Conduct

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the
[contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), a
stronger set of standards is used for the Ambassador Program. This is because
the Foundation endorses Ambassadors as representatives and leaders; the
Standards of Excellence are designed to provide a set of guidelines and best
practices for engaging with the GraphQL Foundation and broader community. This
makes it easier for Ambassadors to contribute to a positive culture by providing
clarity around what and how we create a safe and collaborative environment. See
[Standards of Excellence](./standards-of-excellence.md).

## Application Process

Applications are open year-round and are received by a panel of Foundation
and TSC members. Foundation representatives, TSC members and current Ambassadors will be
invited to review applications on a quarterly basis.

The Ambassador term is a year long, Ambassadors who continue to meet the expectations will be
invited to join again at the end of their term.

Applications can be from the applicant themselves, or a nomination from another
community member.
