# Installation

Requirements

:   **Python 3.x \>= 3.10**

To install the latest released version of Gunicorn:

``` bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```

## From Source

You can install Gunicorn from source just as you would install any other
Python package:

``` bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn.git
```

This will allow you to keep up to date with development on GitHub:

``` bash
$ pip install -U git+https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn.git
```

## Async Workers

You may also want to install [Eventlet](http://eventlet.net) or
[Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) if you expect that your application
code may need to pause for extended periods of time during request
processing. Check out the [design docs](design.html) for more
information on when you\'ll want to consider one of the alternate worker
types.

``` bash
$ pip install greenlet            # Required for both
$ pip install eventlet            # For eventlet workers
$ pip install gunicorn[eventlet]  # Or, using extra
$ pip install gevent              # For gevent workers
$ pip install gunicorn[gevent]    # Or, using extra
```

Note
:::

Both require `greenlet`, which should get installed automatically. If
its installation fails, you probably need to install the Python headers.
These headers are available in most package managers. On Ubuntu the
package name for `apt-get` is `python-dev`.

[Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) also requires that `libevent` 1.4.x or
2.0.4 is installed. This could be a more recent version than what is
available in your package manager. If [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/)
fails to build even with [libevent](http://libevent.org/) installed,
this is the most likely reason.

## Extra Packages

Some Gunicorn options require additional packages. You can use the
`[extra]` syntax to install these at the same time as Gunicorn.

Most extra packages are needed for alternate worker types. See the
[design docs](design.html) for more information on when you\'ll want to
consider an alternate worker type.

-   `gunicorn[eventlet]` - Eventlet-based greenlets workers
-   `gunicorn[gevent]` - Gevent-based greenlets workers
-   `gunicorn[gthread]` - Threaded workers
-   `gunicorn[tornado]` - Tornado-based workers, not recommended

If you are running more than one instance of Gunicorn, the
`proc-name`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting will help distinguish
between them in tools like `ps` and `top`.

-   `gunicorn[setproctitle]` - Enables setting the process name

Multiple extras can be combined, like
`pip install gunicorn[gevent,setproctitle]`.

## Debian GNU/Linux

If you are using Debian GNU/Linux it is recommended that you use system
packages to install Gunicorn except maybe when you want to use different
versions of Gunicorn with virtualenv. This has a number of advantages:

-   Zero-effort installation: Automatically starts multiple Gunicorn
    instances based on configurations defined in `/etc/gunicorn.d`.
-   Sensible default locations for logs (`/var/log/gunicorn`). Logs can
    be automatically rotated and compressed using `logrotate`.
-   Improved security: Can easily run each Gunicorn instance with a
    dedicated UNIX user/group.
-   Sensible upgrade path: Upgrades to newer versions result in less
    downtime, handle conflicting changes in configuration options, and
    can be quickly rolled back in case of incompatibility. The package
    can also be purged entirely from the system in seconds.

### stable (\"buster\")

The version of Gunicorn in the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
\"stable\" distribution is 19.9.0 (December 2020). You can install it
using:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
```

You can also use the most recent version 20.0.4 (December 2020) by using
[Debian Backports](https://backports.debian.org/). First, copy the
following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

``` bash
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
```

Then, update your local package lists:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

You can then install the latest version using:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get -t buster-backports install gunicorn
```

### oldstable (\"stretch\")

While Debian releases newer than Stretch will give you gunicorn with
Python 3 support no matter if you install the gunicorn or gunicorn3
package for Stretch you specifically have to install gunicorn3 to get
Python 3 support.

The version of Gunicorn in the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
\"oldstable\" distribution is 19.6.0 (December 2020). You can install it
using:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
```

You can also use the most recent version 19.7.1 (December 2020) by using
[Debian Backports](https://backports.debian.org/). First, copy the
following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

``` bash
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main
```

Then, update your local package lists:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

You can then install the latest version using:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install gunicorn3
```

### Testing (\"bullseye\") / Unstable (\"sid\")

\"bullseye\" and \"sid\" contain the latest released version of Gunicorn
20.0.4 (December 2020). You can install it in the usual way:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install gunicorn
```

## Ubuntu

[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) or later
contains the Gunicorn package by default 20.0.4 (December 2020) so that
you can install it in the usual way:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gunicorn
```
