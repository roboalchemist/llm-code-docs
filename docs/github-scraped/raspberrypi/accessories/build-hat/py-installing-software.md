## Use the Build HAT from Python

### Install the Build HAT Python Library

To install the Build HAT Python library, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```console
$ sudo apt install python3-build-hat 
```

Raspberry Pi OS versions prior to *Bookworm* do not have access to the library with `apt`. Instead, run the following command to install the library using `pip`:

```console
$ sudo pip3 install buildhat
```
