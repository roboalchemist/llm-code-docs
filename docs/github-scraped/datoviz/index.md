# Datoviz: high-performance rendering for scientific data visualization

**⚡️ Datoviz** is an open-source, cross-platform, **high-performance rendering library for scientific data visualization** making extensive use of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

Up to **10,000x faster than matplotlib**, it delivers highly efficient **high-quality GPU rendering** of 2D and 3D graphical primitives—markers, paths, images, text, meshes, volumes, and more—that scale to millions of elements. Datoviz also supports **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** for interactive visualization.

Built from the ground up with performance in mind, Datoviz is written primarily in **C** and **C++**, leveraging the [**Khronos Vulkan graphics API**](https://www.vulkan.org/). It offers a C API, low-level Python bindings via `ctypes`, and a higher-level, idiomatic **Python API 🐍**.

Written by one of the original creators of [VisPy](https://vispy.org), a GPU-based Python scientific visualization library, Datoviz aims to serve as the default backend for the upcoming **VisPy 2.0**.

The library is lightweight with minimal dependencies: mostly Vulkan, [**GLFW**](https://www.glfw.org/) for windowing, and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/) for GUIs.

!!! warning

    Datoviz is a young library. The API is stabilizing, but breaking changes may still occur as the project evolves with broader usage.

## ✨ Current features

* **📊 2D visuals**: antialiased points, markers, line segments, paths, text, images
* **📈 2D axes**
* **🌐 3D visuals**: meshes, volumes, volume slices
* **🌈 150 colormaps** included (from matplotlib, colorcet, MATLAB)
* **🖱️ High-level interactivity**: pan & zoom for 2D, arcball for 3D (more later)
* **🎥 Manual control of cameras**: custom interactivity
* **𓈈 Figure subplots** (aka "panels")
* **🖥️ GUIs** using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/)

## 🧩 API philosophy

Datoviz does **not** use high-level plotting functions like `plot()`, `scatter()`, or `imshow()`. Instead, it exposes flexible visual primitives—markers, images, meshes, and more—that can be added to a scene and customized directly with data. This approach offers fine-grained control and high performance, while remaining concise enough for quick plots.

A [higher-level plotting interface is under development as part of **VisPy 2.0**](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/discussions/2661), which will use Datoviz as its rendering backend. An intermediate layer called **GSP** (Graphics Specification Protocol) will provide a backend-agnostic API for declarative plotting.

## 🔍 Comparison with other libraries

### 🐍 Matplotlib

**Matplotlib** is the gold standard for static, publication-quality figures, with a mature, feature-rich API. But it's not optimized for interactivity or large datasets.

**Datoviz**, in contrast, is a younger, GPU-based library designed for fast, interactive visualization. It lacks Matplotlib’s high-level API but excels at rendering millions of points in real time.

Use **Matplotlib** for polished static plots, **Datoviz** for responsive data exploration.

#### Preliminary performance benchmark

The figure below shows a preliminary [**performance benchmark**](https://github.com/datoviz/datoviz/blob/main/examples/benchmarks/benchmark_mpl.py) comparing Datoviz and Matplotlib on an interactive 2D scatter plot, with increasing numbers of points and a simulated zoom interaction:

</p>

In this benchmark, **Datoviz outperforms Matplotlib by a factor of up to 10,000×**, maintaining interactive framerates even with millions of points. Matplotlib, in contrast, becomes sluggish or fails entirely as the dataset size increases.

### 🧊 VTK

Datoviz is lighter, simpler, and easier to install than VTK. It compiles in seconds, has minimal dependencies, and focuses exclusively on real-time rendering of visual primitives. Unlike VTK, it does not include data file I/O (except minimal test loaders like `.obj`), computational geometry, or data processing.

VTK is a powerful, heavyweight toolkit for 3D visualization, simulation, and scientific computing workflows. In contrast, Datoviz is designed for fast, high-quality 2D and 3D rendering.
