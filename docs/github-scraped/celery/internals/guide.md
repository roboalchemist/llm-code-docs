## Philosophy

### The API\>RCP Precedence Rule

-   The API is more important than Readability

-   Readability is more important than Convention

-   

    Convention is more important than Performance

    :   -   ...unless the code is a proven hot-spot.

More important than anything else is the end-user API. Conventions must
step aside, and any suffering is always alleviated if the end result is
a better API.

## Conventions and Idioms Used

### Classes

#### Naming

-   Follows `8`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}.

-   Class names must be [CamelCase]{.title-ref}.

-   but not if they\'re verbs, verbs shall be \`lower_case\`:

    > ``` python
    > # - test case for a class
    > class TestMyClass(Case):                # BAD
    >     pass
    >
    > class test_MyClass(Case):               # GOOD
    >     pass
    >
    > # - test case for a function
    > class TestMyFunction(Case):             # BAD
    >     pass
    >
    > class test_my_function(Case):           # GOOD
    >     pass
    >
    > # - "action" class (verb)
    > class UpdateTwitterStatus:    # BAD
    >     pass
    >
    > class update_twitter_status:    # GOOD
    >     pass
    > ```

-   Factory functions and methods must be [CamelCase]{.title-ref}
    (excluding verbs):

    > ``` python
    > class Celery:
    >
    >     def consumer_factory(self):     # BAD
    >         ...
    >
    >     def Consumer(self):             # GOOD
    >         ...
    > ```

#### Default values

Class attributes serve as default values for the instance, as this means
that they can be set by either instantiation or inheritance.

**Example:**

``` python
class Producer:
    active = True
    serializer = 'json'

    def __init__(self, serializer=None, active=None):
        self.serializer = serializer or self.serializer

        # must check for None when value can be false-y
        self.active = active if active is not None else self.active
```

A subclass can change the default value:

``` python
TaskProducer(Producer):
    serializer = 'pickle'
```

and the value can be set at instantiation:

``` pycon
>>> producer = TaskProducer(serializer='msgpack')
```

#### Exceptions

Custom exceptions raised by an objects methods and properties should be
available as an attribute and documented in the method/property that
throw.

This way a user doesn\'t have to find out where to import the exception
from, but rather use `help(obj)` and access the exception class from the
instance directly.

**Example**:

``` python
class Empty(Exception):
    pass

class Queue:
    Empty = Empty

    def get(self):
        """Get the next item from the queue.

        :raises Queue.Empty: if there are no more items left.

        """
        try:
            return self.queue.popleft()
        except IndexError:
            raise self.Empty()
```

#### Composites

Similarly to exceptions, composite classes should be override-able by
inheritance and/or instantiation. Common sense can be used when
selecting what classes to include, but often it\'s better to add one too
many: predicting what users need to override is hard (this has saved us
from many a monkey patch).

**Example**:

``` python
class Worker:
    Consumer = Consumer

    def __init__(self, connection, consumer_cls=None):
        self.Consumer = consumer_cls or self.Consumer

    def do_work(self):
        with self.Consumer(self.connection) as consumer:
            self.connection.drain_events()
```

## Applications vs. \"single mode\"

In the beginning Celery was developed for Django, simply because this
enabled us get the project started quickly, while also having a large
potential user base.

In Django there\'s a global settings object, so multiple Django projects
can\'t co-exist in the same process space, this later posed a problem
for using Celery with frameworks that don\'t have this limitation.

Therefore the app concept was introduced. When using apps you use
\'celery\' objects instead of importing things from Celery sub-modules,
this (unfortunately) also means that Celery essentially has two API\'s.

Here\'s an example using Celery in single-mode:

``` python
from celery import task
from celery.task.control import inspect

from .models import CeleryStats

@task
def write_stats_to_db():
    stats = inspect().stats(timeout=1)
    for node_name, reply in stats:
        CeleryStats.objects.update_stat(node_name, stats)
```

and here\'s the same using Celery app objects:

``` python
from .celery import celery
from .models import CeleryStats

@app.task
def write_stats_to_db():
    stats = celery.control.inspect().stats(timeout=1)
    for node_name, reply in stats:
        CeleryStats.objects.update_stat(node_name, stats)
```

In the example above the actual application instance is imported from a
module in the project, this module could look something like this:

``` python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery(broker='amqp://')
```

## Module Overview

-   celery.app

    > This is the core of Celery: the entry-point for all functionality.

-   celery.loaders

    > Every app must have a loader. The loader decides how configuration
    > is read; what happens when the worker starts; when a task starts
    > and ends; and so on.
    >
    > The loaders included are:
    >
    > > -   app
    > >
    > >     > Custom Celery app instances uses this loader by default.
    > >
    > > -   default
    > >
    > >     > \"single-mode\" uses this loader by default.
    >
    > Extension loaders also exist, for example
    > `celery-pylons`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"}.

-   celery.worker

    > This is the worker implementation.

-   celery.backends

    > Task result backends live here.

-   celery.apps

    > Major user applications: worker and beat. The command-line
    > wrappers for these are in celery.bin (see below)

-   celery.bin

    > Command-line applications. `setup.py`{.interpreted-text
    > role="file"} creates setuptools entry-points for these.

-   celery.concurrency

    > Execution pool implementations (prefork, eventlet, gevent, solo,
    > thread).

-   celery.db

    > Database models for the SQLAlchemy database result backend.
    > (should be moved into `celery.backends.database`{.interpreted-text
    > role="mod"})

-   celery.events

    > Sending and consuming monitoring events, also includes curses
    > monitor, event dumper and utilities to work with in-memory cluster
    > state.

-   celery.execute.trace

    > How tasks are executed and traced by the worker, and in eager
    > mode.

-   celery.security

    > Security related functionality, currently a serializer using
    > cryptographic digests.

-   celery.task

    > single-mode interface to creating tasks, and controlling workers.

-   t.unit (int distribution)

    > The unit test suite.

-   celery.utils

    > Utility functions used by the Celery code base. Much of it is
    > there to be compatible across Python versions.

-   celery.contrib

    > Additional public code that doesn\'t fit into any other
    > name-space.

## Worker overview

-   [celery.bin.worker:Worker]{.title-ref}

    > This is the command-line interface to the worker.
    >
    > Responsibilities:
    >
    > :   -   Daemonization when
    >         `--detach <celery worker --detach>`{.interpreted-text
    >         role="option"} set,
    >     -   dropping privileges when using
    >         `--uid <celery worker --uid>`{.interpreted-text
    >         role="option"}/
    >         `--gid <celery worker --gid>`{.interpreted-text
    >         role="option"} arguments
    >     -   Installs \"concurrency patches\" (eventlet/gevent monkey
    >         patches).

    `app.worker_main(argv)` calls
    `instantiate('celery.bin.worker:Worker')(app).execute_from_commandline(argv)`

-   [app.Worker]{.title-ref} -\> [celery.apps.worker:Worker]{.title-ref}

    > Responsibilities:
    > -   sets up logging and redirects standard outs
    > -   installs signal handlers
    >     ([TERM]{.title-ref}/[HUP]{.title-ref}/[STOP]{.title-ref}/[USR1]{.title-ref}
    >     (cry)/[USR2]{.title-ref} (rdb))
    > -   prints banner and warnings (e.g., pickle warning)
    > -   handles the `celery worker --purge`{.interpreted-text
    >     role="option"} argument

-   [app.WorkController]{.title-ref} -\>
    [celery.worker.WorkController]{.title-ref}

    > This is the real worker, built up around bootsteps.
