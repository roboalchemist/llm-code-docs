## Broker Overview

This is comparison table of the different transports supports, more
information can be found in the documentation for each individual
transport (see `broker_toc`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

  --------------- -------------- ---------------- --------------------
  **Name**        **Status**     **Monitoring**   **Remote Control**

  *RabbitMQ*      Stable         Yes              Yes

  *Redis*         Stable         Yes              Yes

  *Amazon SQS*    Stable         No               No

  *Zookeeper*     Experimental   No               No

  *Kafka*         Experimental   No               No

  *GC PubSub*     Experimental   Yes              Yes
  --------------- -------------- ---------------- --------------------

Experimental brokers may be functional but they don\'t have dedicated
maintainers.

Missing monitor support means that the transport doesn\'t implement
events, and as such Flower, [celery events]{.title-ref},
[celerymon]{.title-ref} and other event-based monitoring tools won\'t
work.

Remote control means the ability to inspect and manage workers at
runtime using the [celery inspect]{.title-ref} and [celery
control]{.title-ref} commands (and other tools using the remote control
API).

## Summaries

*Note: This section is not comprehensive of backends and brokers.*

Celery has the ability to communicate and store with many different
backends (Result Stores) and brokers (Message Transports).

### Redis

Redis can be both a backend and a broker.

**As a Broker:** Redis works well for rapid transport of small messages.
Large messages can congest the system.

`See documentation for details <broker-redis>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

**As a Backend:** Redis is a super fast K/V store, making it very
efficient for fetching the results of a task call. As with the design of
Redis, you do have to consider the limit memory available to store your
data, and how you handle data persistence. If result persistence is
important, consider using another DB for your backend.

### RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a broker.

**As a Broker:** RabbitMQ handles larger messages better than Redis,
however if many messages are coming in very quickly, scaling can become
a concern and Redis or SQS should be considered unless RabbitMQ is
running at very large scale.

`See documentation for details <broker-rabbitmq>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

**As a Backend:** RabbitMQ can store results via `rpc://` backend. This
backend creates separate temporary queue for each client.

*Note: RabbitMQ (as the broker) and Redis (as the backend) are very
commonly used together. If more guaranteed long-term persistence is
needed from the result store, consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL
(through SQLAlchemy), Cassandra, or a custom defined backend.*

### SQS

SQS is a broker.

If you already integrate tightly with AWS, and are familiar with SQS, it
presents a great option as a broker. It is extremely scalable and
completely managed, and manages task delegation similarly to RabbitMQ.
It does lack some of the features of the RabbitMQ broker such as
`worker remote control commands`.

`See documentation for details <broker-sqs>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a backend.

It allows Celery to interface with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQlite, and more.
It is an ORM, and is the way Celery can use a SQL DB as a result
backend.

`See documentation for details <conf-database-result-backend>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}

### GCPubSub

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a broker.

If you already integrate tightly with Google Cloud, and are familiar
with Pub/Sub, it presents a great option as a broker. It is extremely
scalable and completely managed, and manages task delegation similarly
to RabbitMQ.

`See documentation for details <broker-gcpubsub>`{.interpreted-text
