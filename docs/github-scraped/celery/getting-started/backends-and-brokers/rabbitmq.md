## Installation & Configuration

RabbitMQ is the default broker so it doesn\'t require any additional
dependencies or initial configuration, other than the URL location of
the broker instance you want to use:

``` python
broker_url = 'amqp://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5672/myvhost'
```

For a description of broker URLs and a full list of the various broker
configuration options available to Celery, see
`conf-broker-settings`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and see below for
setting up the username, password and vhost.

## Installing the RabbitMQ Server {#installing-rabbitmq}

See [Downloading and Installing
RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) over at RabbitMQ\'s

### Setting up RabbitMQ {#rabbitmq-configuration}

To use Celery we need to create a RabbitMQ user, a virtual host and
allow that user access to that virtual host:

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user myuser mypassword
```

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost myvhost
```

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags myuser mytag
```

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p myvhost myuser ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

Substitute in appropriate values for `myuser`, `mypassword` and
`myvhost` above.

See the RabbitMQ [Admin
Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html) for more information
about [access control](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html).

### Installing RabbitMQ on macOS {#rabbitmq-macOS-installation}

The easiest way to install RabbitMQ on macOS is using
[Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/) the new and shiny package
management system for macOS.

First, install Homebrew using the one-line command provided by the
[Homebrew
documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Installation):

``` console
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Finally, we can install RabbitMQ using `brew`{.interpreted-text
role="command"}:

``` console
$ brew install rabbitmq
```

::: {#rabbitmq-macOS-system-hostname}
After you\'ve installed RabbitMQ with `brew`{.interpreted-text
role="command"} you need to add the following to your path to be able to
start and stop the broker: add it to the start-up file for your shell
(e.g., `.bash_profile`{.interpreted-text role="file"} or
`.profile`{.interpreted-text role="file"}).
:::

``` bash
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
```

#### Configuring the system host name

If you\'re using a DHCP server that\'s giving you a random host name,
you need to permanently configure the host name. This is because
RabbitMQ uses the host name to communicate with nodes.

Use the `scutil`{.interpreted-text role="command"} command to
permanently set your host name:

``` console
$ sudo scutil --set HostName myhost.local
```

Then add that host name to `/etc/hosts`{.interpreted-text role="file"}
so it\'s possible to resolve it back into an IP address:

    127.0.0.1       localhost myhost myhost.local

If you start the `rabbitmq-server`{.interpreted-text role="command"},
your rabbit node should now be [rabbit@myhost]{.title-ref}, as verified
by `rabbitmqctl`{.interpreted-text role="command"}:

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl status
Status of node rabbit@myhost ...
[{running_applications,[{rabbit,"RabbitMQ","1.7.1"},
                    {mnesia,"MNESIA  CXC 138 12","4.4.12"},
                    {os_mon,"CPO  CXC 138 46","2.2.4"},
                    {sasl,"SASL  CXC 138 11","2.1.8"},
                    {stdlib,"ERTS  CXC 138 10","1.16.4"},
                    {kernel,"ERTS  CXC 138 10","2.13.4"}]},
{nodes,[rabbit@myhost]},
{running_nodes,[rabbit@myhost]}]
...done.
```

This is especially important if your DHCP server gives you a host name
starting with an IP address, (e.g.,
[23.10.112.31.comcast.net]{.title-ref}). In this case RabbitMQ will try
to use \`<rabbit@23>\`: an illegal host name.

#### Starting/Stopping the RabbitMQ server {#rabbitmq-macOS-start-stop}

To start the server:

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmq-server
```

you can also run it in the background by adding the `-detached` option
(note: only one dash):

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmq-server -detached
```

Never use `kill`{.interpreted-text role="command"}
(`kill(1)`{.interpreted-text role="manpage"}) to stop the RabbitMQ
server, but rather use the `rabbitmqctl`{.interpreted-text
role="command"} command:

``` console
$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop
```

When the server is running, you can continue reading [Setting up
RabbitMQ](#setting-up-rabbitmq).

## Using Quorum Queues

::: versionadded
5.5
:::

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Quorum Queues require disabling global QoS which means some features
won\'t work as expected. See [limitations](#limitations) for details.
:::

Celery supports [Quorum
Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues) by setting the
`x-queue-type` header to `quorum` like so:

``` python
from kombu import Queue

task_queues = [Queue('my-queue', queue_arguments={'x-queue-type': 'quorum'})]
broker_transport_options = {"confirm_publish": True}
```

If you\'d like to change the type of the default queue, set the
`task_default_queue_type`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting to
`quorum`.

Another way to configure [Quorum
Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues) is by relying on
default settings and using `task_routes`:

``` python
task_default_queue_type = "quorum"
task_default_exchange_type = "topic"
task_default_queue = "my-queue"
broker_transport_options = {"confirm_publish": True}

task_routes = {
    "*": {
        "routing_key": "my-queue",
    },
}
```

Celery automatically detects if quorum queues are used using the
`worker_detect_quorum_queues`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.
We recommend to keep the default behavior turned on.

To migrate from classic mirrored queues to quorum queues, please refer
to RabbitMQ\'s
[documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2023/03/02/quorum-queues-migration)
on the subject.

### Limitations

Disabling global QoS means that the the per-channel QoS is now static.
This means that some Celery features won\'t work when using Quorum
Queues.

Autoscaling relies on increasing and decreasing the prefetch count
whenever a new process is instantiated or terminated so it won\'t work
when Quorum Queues are detected.

Similarly, the
`worker_enable_prefetch_count_reduction`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} setting will be a no-op even when set to `True` when
Quorum Queues are detected.

In addition, `ETA/Countdown <calling-eta>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
will block the worker when received until the ETA arrives since we can
no longer increase the prefetch count and fetch another task from the
queue.

In order to properly schedule ETA/Countdown tasks we automatically
detect if quorum queues are used and in case they are, Celery
automatically enables
`Native Delayed Delivery <native-delayed-delivery>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

### Native Delayed Delivery

Since tasks with ETA/Countdown will block the worker until they are
scheduled for execution, we need to use RabbitMQ\'s native capabilities
to schedule the execution of tasks.

The design is borrowed from NServiceBus. If you are interested in the
implementation details, refer to their
[documentation](https://docs.particular.net/transports/rabbitmq/delayed-delivery).

Native Delayed Delivery is automatically enabled when quorum queues are
detected.

By default the Native Delayed Delivery queues are quorum queues. If
you\'d like to change them to classic queues you can set the
`broker_native_delayed_delivery_queue_type`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} to classic.
