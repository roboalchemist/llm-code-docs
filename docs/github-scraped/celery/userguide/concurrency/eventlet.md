# Concurrency with Eventlet {#concurrency-eventlet}

## Introduction {#eventlet-introduction}

The [Eventlet](http://eventlet.net) homepage describes it as a
concurrent networking library for Python that allows you to change how
you run your code, not how you write it.

> -   It uses [epoll(4)](http://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll) or
>     [libevent](http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/) for [highly
>     scalable non-blocking
>     I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O#Select.28.2Fpoll.29_loops).
> -   [Coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) ensure that
>     the developer uses a blocking style of programming that\'s similar
>     to threading, but provide the benefits of non-blocking I/O.
> -   The event dispatch is implicit: meaning you can easily use
>     Eventlet from the Python interpreter, or as a small part of a
>     larger application.

Celery supports Eventlet as an alternative execution pool implementation
and in some cases superior to prefork. However, you need to ensure one
task doesn\'t block the event loop too long. Generally, CPU-bound
operations don\'t go well with Eventlet. Also note that some libraries,
usually with C extensions, cannot be monkeypatched and therefore cannot
benefit from using Eventlet. Please refer to their documentation if you
are not sure. For example, pylibmc does not allow cooperation with
Eventlet but psycopg2 does when both of them are libraries with C
extensions.

The prefork pool can take use of multiple processes, but how many is
often limited to a few processes per CPU. With Eventlet you can
efficiently spawn hundreds, or thousands of green threads. In an
informal test with a feed hub system the Eventlet pool could fetch and
process hundreds of feeds every second, while the prefork pool spent 14
seconds processing 100 feeds. Note that this is one of the applications
async I/O is especially good at (asynchronous HTTP requests). You may
want a mix of both Eventlet and prefork workers, and route tasks
according to compatibility or what works best.

## Enabling Eventlet

You can enable the Eventlet pool by using the
`celery worker -P`{.interpreted-text role="option"} worker option.

``` console
$ celery -A proj worker -P eventlet -c 1000
```

## Examples {#eventlet-examples}

See the [Eventlet
examples](https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/main/examples/eventlet)
directory in the Celery distribution for some examples taking use of
Eventlet support.
