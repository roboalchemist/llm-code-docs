## Custom Message Consumers {#extending-custom-consumers}

You may want to embed custom Kombu consumers to manually process your
messages.

For that purpose a special
`~celery.bootstep.ConsumerStep`{.interpreted-text role="class"} bootstep
class exists, where you only need to define the `get_consumers` method,
that must return a list of `kombu.Consumer`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} objects to start whenever the connection is established:

``` python
from celery import Celery
from celery import bootsteps
from kombu import Consumer, Exchange, Queue

my_queue = Queue('custom', Exchange('custom'), 'routing_key')

app = Celery(broker='amqp://')


class MyConsumerStep(bootsteps.ConsumerStep):

    def get_consumers(self, channel):
        return [Consumer(channel,
                         queues=[my_queue],
                         callbacks=[self.handle_message],
                         accept=['json'])]

    def handle_message(self, body, message):
        print('Received message: {0!r}'.format(body))
        message.ack()
app.steps['consumer'].add(MyConsumerStep)

def send_me_a_message(who, producer=None):
    with app.producer_or_acquire(producer) as producer:
        producer.publish(
            {'hello': who},
            serializer='json',
            exchange=my_queue.exchange,
            routing_key='routing_key',
            declare=[my_queue],
            retry=True,
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    send_me_a_message('world!')
```

Note
:::

Kombu Consumers can take use of two different message callback
dispatching mechanisms. The first one is the `callbacks` argument that
accepts a list of callbacks with a `(body, message)` signature, the
second one is the `on_message` argument that takes a single callback
with a `(message,)` signature. The latter won\'t automatically decode
and deserialize the payload.

``` python
def get_consumers(self, channel):
    return [Consumer(channel, queues=[my_queue],
                     on_message=self.on_message)]


def on_message(self, message):
    payload = message.decode()
    print(
        'Received message: {0!r} {props!r} rawlen={s}'.format(
        payload, props=message.properties, s=len(message.body),
    ))
    message.ack()
```

## Blueprints {#extending-blueprints}

Bootsteps is a technique to add functionality to the workers. A bootstep
is a custom class that defines hooks to do custom actions at different
stages in the worker. Every bootstep belongs to a blueprint, and the
worker currently defines two blueprints: **Worker**, and **Consumer**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Figure A:** Bootsteps in the Worker and Consumer blueprints. Starting

:   from the bottom up the first step in the worker blueprint is the
    Timer, and the last step is to start the Consumer blueprint, that
    then establishes the broker connection and starts consuming
    messages.

![](../images/worker_graph_full.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Worker {#extending-worker_blueprint}

The Worker is the first blueprint to start, and with it starts major
components like the event loop, processing pool, and the timer used for
ETA tasks and other timed events.

When the worker is fully started it continues with the Consumer
blueprint, that sets up how tasks are executed, connects to the broker
and starts the message consumers.

The `~celery.worker.WorkController`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is
the core worker implementation, and contains several methods and
attributes that you can use in your bootstep.

### Attributes {#extending-worker_blueprint-attributes}

::: {#extending-worker-app}
::: attribute
app

The current app instance.
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-hostname}
::: attribute
hostname

The workers node name (e.g., [worker1@example.com]{.title-ref})
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-blueprint}
::: attribute
blueprint

This is the worker `~celery.bootsteps.Blueprint`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}.
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-hub}
::: attribute
hub

Event loop object (`~kombu.asynchronous.Hub`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}). You can use this to register callbacks in the event
loop.

This is only supported by async I/O enabled transports (amqp, redis), in
which case the [worker.use_eventloop]{.title-ref} attribute should be
set.

Your worker bootstep must require the Hub bootstep to use this:

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Hub'}
```
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-pool}
::: attribute
pool

The current process/eventlet/gevent/thread pool. See
`celery.concurrency.base.BasePool`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

Your worker bootstep must require the Pool bootstep to use this:

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Pool'}
```
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-timer}
::: attribute
timer

`~kombu.asynchronous.timer.Timer`{.interpreted-text role="class"} used
to schedule functions.

Your worker bootstep must require the Timer bootstep to use this:

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Timer'}
```
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-statedb}
::: attribute
statedb

`Database <celery.worker.state.Persistent>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"}\` to persist state between worker restarts.

This is only defined if the `statedb` argument is enabled.

Your worker bootstep must require the `Statedb` bootstep to use this:

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Statedb'}
```
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-autoscaler}
::: attribute
autoscaler

`~celery.worker.autoscaler.Autoscaler`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
used to automatically grow and shrink the number of processes in the
pool.

This is only defined if the `autoscale` argument is enabled.

Your worker bootstep must require the [Autoscaler]{.title-ref} bootstep
to use this:

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = ('celery.worker.autoscaler:Autoscaler',)
```
:::
:::

::: {#extending-worker-autoreloader}
::: attribute
autoreloader

`~celery.worker.autoreloder.Autoreloader`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} used to automatically reload use code when the file-system
changes.

This is only defined if the `autoreload` argument is enabled. Your
worker bootstep must require the [Autoreloader]{.title-ref} bootstep to
use this;

``` python
class WorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = ('celery.worker.autoreloader:Autoreloader',)
```
:::
:::

### Example worker bootstep

An example Worker bootstep could be:

``` python
from celery import bootsteps

class ExampleWorkerStep(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Pool'}

    def __init__(self, worker, **kwargs):
        print('Called when the WorkController instance is constructed')
        print('Arguments to WorkController: {0!r}'.format(kwargs))

    def create(self, worker):
        # this method can be used to delegate the action methods
        # to another object that implements ``start`` and ``stop``.
        return self

    def start(self, worker):
        print('Called when the worker is started.')

    def stop(self, worker):
        print('Called when the worker shuts down.')

    def terminate(self, worker):
        print('Called when the worker terminates')
```

Every method is passed the current `WorkController` instance as the
first argument.

Another example could use the timer to wake up at regular intervals:

``` python
from celery import bootsteps


class DeadlockDetection(bootsteps.StartStopStep):
    requires = {'celery.worker.components:Timer'}

    def __init__(self, worker, deadlock_timeout=3600):
        self.timeout = deadlock_timeout
        self.requests = []
        self.tref = None

    def start(self, worker):
        # run every 30 seconds.
        self.tref = worker.timer.call_repeatedly(
            30.0, self.detect, (worker,), priority=10,
        )

    def stop(self, worker):
        if self.tref:
            self.tref.cancel()
            self.tref = None

    def detect(self, worker):
        # update active requests
        for req in worker.active_requests:
            if req.time_start and time() - req.time_start > self.timeout:
                raise SystemExit()
```

### Customizing Task Handling Logs

The Celery worker emits messages to the Python logging subsystem for
various events throughout the lifecycle of a task. These messages can be
customized by overriding the `LOG_<TYPE>` format strings which are
defined in `celery/app/trace.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}. For
example:

``` python
import celery.app.trace

celery.app.trace.LOG_SUCCESS = "This is a custom message"
```

The various format strings are all provided with the task name and ID
for `%` formatting, and some of them receive extra fields like the
return value or the exception which caused a task to fail. These fields
can be used in custom format strings like so:

``` python
import celery.app.trace

celery.app.trace.LOG_REJECTED = "%(name)r is cursed and I won't run it: %(exc)s"
```

## Consumer {#extending-consumer_blueprint}

The Consumer blueprint establishes a connection to the broker, and is
restarted every time this connection is lost. Consumer bootsteps include
the worker heartbeat, the remote control command consumer, and
importantly, the task consumer.

When you create consumer bootsteps you must take into account that it
must be possible to restart your blueprint. An additional \'shutdown\'
method is defined for consumer bootsteps, this method is called when the
worker is shutdown.

## Installing Bootsteps {#extending-bootsteps}

`app.steps['worker']` and `app.steps['consumer']` can be modified to add
new bootsteps:

``` pycon
>>> app = Celery()
>>> app.steps['worker'].add(MyWorkerStep)  # < add class, don't instantiate
>>> app.steps['consumer'].add(MyConsumerStep)

>>> app.steps['consumer'].update([StepA, StepB])

>>> app.steps['consumer']
{step:proj.StepB{()}, step:proj.MyConsumerStep{()}, step:proj.StepA{()}
```

The order of steps isn\'t important here as the order is decided by the
resulting dependency graph (`Step.requires`).

To illustrate how you can install bootsteps and how they work, this is
an example step that prints some useless debugging information. It can
be added both as a worker and consumer bootstep:

``` python
from celery import Celery
from celery import bootsteps

class InfoStep(bootsteps.Step):

    def __init__(self, parent, **kwargs):
        # here we can prepare the Worker/Consumer object
        # in any way we want, set attribute defaults, and so on.
        print('{0!r} is in init'.format(parent))

    def start(self, parent):
        # our step is started together with all other Worker/Consumer
        # bootsteps.
        print('{0!r} is starting'.format(parent))

    def stop(self, parent):
        # the Consumer calls stop every time the consumer is
        # restarted (i.e., connection is lost) and also at shutdown.
        # The Worker will call stop at shutdown only.
        print('{0!r} is stopping'.format(parent))

    def shutdown(self, parent):
        # shutdown is called by the Consumer at shutdown, it's not
        # called by Worker.
        print('{0!r} is shutting down'.format(parent))

    app = Celery(broker='amqp://')
    app.steps['worker'].add(InfoStep)
    app.steps['consumer'].add(InfoStep)
```

Starting the worker with this step installed will give us the following
logs:

``` text
<Worker: w@example.com (initializing)> is in init
<Consumer: w@example.com (initializing)> is in init
[2013-05-29 16:18:20,544: WARNING/MainProcess]
    <Worker: w@example.com (running)> is starting
[2013-05-29 16:18:21,577: WARNING/MainProcess]
    <Consumer: w@example.com (running)> is starting
<Consumer: w@example.com (closing)> is stopping
<Worker: w@example.com (closing)> is stopping
<Consumer: w@example.com (terminating)> is shutting down
```

The `print` statements will be redirected to the logging subsystem after
the worker has been initialized, so the \"is starting\" lines are
time-stamped. You may notice that this does no longer happen at
shutdown, this is because the `stop` and `shutdown` methods are called
inside a *signal handler*, and it\'s not safe to use logging inside such
a handler. Logging with the Python logging module isn\'t
`reentrant`{.interpreted-text role="term"}: meaning you cannot interrupt
the function then call it again later. It\'s important that the `stop`
and `shutdown` methods you write is also `reentrant`{.interpreted-text
role="term"}.

Starting the worker with
`--loglevel=debug <celery worker --loglevel>`{.interpreted-text
role="option"} will show us more information about the boot process:

## Command-line programs {#extending-programs}

### Adding new command-line options {#extending-commandoptions}

#### Command-specific options {#extending-command-options}

You can add additional command-line options to the `worker`, `beat`, and
`events` commands by modifying the `~@user_options`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"} attribute of the application instance.

Celery commands uses the `click`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module to
parse command-line arguments, and so to add custom arguments you need to
add `click.Option`{.interpreted-text role="class"} instances to the
relevant set.

Example adding a custom option to the `celery worker`{.interpreted-text
role="program"} command:

``` python
from celery import Celery
from click import Option

app = Celery(broker='amqp://')

app.user_options['worker'].add(Option(('--enable-my-option',),
                                      is_flag=True,
                                      help='Enable custom option.'))
```

All bootsteps will now receive this argument as a keyword argument to
`Bootstep.__init__`:

``` python
from celery import bootsteps

class MyBootstep(bootsteps.Step):

    def __init__(self, parent, enable_my_option=False, **options):
        super().__init__(parent, **options)
        if enable_my_option:
            party()

app.steps['worker'].add(MyBootstep)
```

#### Preload options {#extending-preload_options}

The `celery`{.interpreted-text role="program"} umbrella command supports
the concept of \'preload options\'. These are special options passed to
all sub-commands.

You can add new preload options, for example to specify a configuration
template:

``` python
from celery import Celery
from celery import signals
from click import Option

app = Celery()

app.user_options['preload'].add(Option(('-Z', '--template'),
                                       default='default',
                                       help='Configuration template to use.'))

@signals.user_preload_options.connect
def on_preload_parsed(options, **kwargs):
    use_template(options['template'])
```

### Adding new `celery`{.interpreted-text role="program"} sub-commands {#extending-subcommands}

New commands can be added to the `celery`{.interpreted-text
role="program"} umbrella command by using [setuptools
entry-points](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/01/06/zest-releaser-entry-points.html).

Entry-points is special meta-data that can be added to your packages
`setup.py` program, and then after installation, read from the system
using the `importlib`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module.

Celery recognizes `celery.commands` entry-points to install additional
sub-commands, where the value of the entry-point must point to a valid
click command.

This is how the `Flower`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"} monitoring
extension may add the `celery flower`{.interpreted-text role="program"}
command, by adding an entry-point in `setup.py`{.interpreted-text
role="file"}:

``` python
setup(
    name='flower',
    entry_points={
        'celery.commands': [
           'flower = flower.command:flower',
        ],
    }
)
```

The command definition is in two parts separated by the equal sign,
where the first part is the name of the sub-command (flower), then the
second part is the fully qualified symbol path to the function that
implements the command:

``` text
flower.command:flower
```

The module path and the name of the attribute should be separated by
colon as above.

In the module `flower/command.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}, the
command function may be defined as the following:

``` python
import click

@click.command()
@click.option('--port', default=8888, type=int, help='Webserver port')
@click.option('--debug', is_flag=True)
def flower(port, debug):
    print('Running our command')
```

## Worker API

### `~kombu.asynchronous.Hub`{.interpreted-text role="class"} - The workers async event loop

supported transports

:   amqp, redis

::: versionadded
3.0
:::

The worker uses asynchronous I/O when the amqp or redis broker
transports are used. The eventual goal is for all transports to use the
event-loop, but that will take some time so other transports still use a
threading-based solution.

::: method
hub.add(fd, callback, flags)
:::

::: method
hub.add_reader(fd, callback, \*args)

Add callback to be called when `fd` is readable.

The callback will stay registered until explicitly removed using
`hub.remove(fd) <hub.remove>`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, or the
file descriptor is automatically discarded because it\'s no longer
valid.

Note that only one callback can be registered for any given file
descriptor at a time, so calling `add` a second time will remove any
callback that was previously registered for that file descriptor.

A file descriptor is any file-like object that supports the `fileno`
method, or it can be the file descriptor number (int).
:::

::: method
hub.add_writer(fd, callback, \*args)

Add callback to be called when `fd` is writable. See also notes for
`hub.add_reader`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} above.
:::

::: method
hub.remove(fd)

Remove all callbacks for file descriptor `fd` from the loop.
:::

### Timer - Scheduling events

::: method
timer.call_after(secs, callback, args=(), kwargs=(), priority=0)
:::

::: method
timer.call_repeatedly(secs, callback, args=(), kwargs=(), priority=0)
:::

::: method
timer.call_at(eta, callback, args=(), kwargs=(), priority=0)
