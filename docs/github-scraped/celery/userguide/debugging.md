## Debugging Tasks Remotely (using pdb) {#tut-remote_debug}

### Basics

`celery.contrib.rdb`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} is an extended
version of `pdb`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} that enables remote
debugging of processes that doesn\'t have terminal access.

Example usage:

``` python
from celery import task
from celery.contrib import rdb

@task()
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    rdb.set_trace()  # <- set break-point
    return result
```

`~celery.contrib.rdb.set_trace`{.interpreted-text role="func"} sets a
break-point at the current location and creates a socket you can telnet
into to remotely debug your task.

The debugger may be started by multiple processes at the same time, so
rather than using a fixed port the debugger will search for an available
port, starting from the base port (6900 by default). The base port can
be changed using the environment variable
`CELERY_RDB_PORT`{.interpreted-text role="envvar"}.

By default the debugger will only be available from the local host, to
enable access from the outside you have to set the environment variable
`CELERY_RDB_HOST`{.interpreted-text role="envvar"}.

When the worker encounters your break-point it\'ll log the following
information:

``` text
[INFO/MainProcess] Received task:
    tasks.add[d7261c71-4962-47e5-b342-2448bedd20e8]
[WARNING/PoolWorker-1] Remote Debugger:6900:
    Please telnet 127.0.0.1 6900.  Type `exit` in session to continue.
[2011-01-18 14:25:44,119: WARNING/PoolWorker-1] Remote Debugger:6900:
    Waiting for client...
```

If you telnet the port specified you\'ll be presented with a
[pdb]{.title-ref} shell:

``` console
$ telnet localhost 6900
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
> /opt/devel/demoapp/tasks.py(128)add()
-> return result
(Pdb)
```

Enter `help` to get a list of available commands, It may be a good idea
to read the [Python Debugger
Manual](http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html) if you have never used
[pdb]{.title-ref} before.

To demonstrate, we\'ll read the value of the `result` variable, change
it and continue execution of the task:

``` text
(Pdb) result
4
(Pdb) result = 'hello from rdb'
(Pdb) continue
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

The result of our vandalism can be seen in the worker logs:

``` text
[2011-01-18 14:35:36,599: INFO/MainProcess] Task
    tasks.add[d7261c71-4962-47e5-b342-2448bedd20e8] succeeded
    in 61.481s: 'hello from rdb'
```

### Tips

#### Enabling the break-point signal {#breakpoint_signal}

If the environment variable `CELERY_RDBSIG`{.interpreted-text
role="envvar"} is set, the worker will open up an rdb instance whenever
the [SIGUSR2]{.title-ref} signal is sent. This is the case for both main
and worker processes.

For example starting the worker with:

``` console
$ CELERY_RDBSIG=1 celery worker -l INFO
```

You can start an rdb session for any of the worker processes by
executing:

``` console
$ kill -USR2 <pid>
```
