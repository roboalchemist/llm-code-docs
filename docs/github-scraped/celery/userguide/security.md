## Introduction

While Celery is written with security in mind, it should be treated as
an unsafe component.

Depending on your [Security
Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_policy), there are
various steps you can take to make your Celery installation more secure.

## Areas of Concern

### Broker

It\'s imperative that the broker is guarded from unwanted access,
especially if accessible to the public. By default, workers trust that
the data they get from the broker hasn\'t been tampered with. See
[Message Signing](#message-signing) for information on how to make the
broker connection more trustworthy.

The first line of defense should be to put a firewall in front of the
broker, allowing only white-listed machines to access it.

Keep in mind that both firewall misconfiguration, and temporarily
disabling the firewall, is common in the real world. Solid security
policy includes monitoring of firewall equipment to detect if they\'ve
been disabled, be it accidentally or on purpose.

In other words, one shouldn\'t blindly trust the firewall either.

If your broker supports fine-grained access control, like RabbitMQ, this
is something you should look at enabling. See for example
<http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html>.

If supported by your broker backend, you can enable end-to-end SSL
encryption and authentication using `broker_use_ssl`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"}.

### Client

In Celery, \"client\" refers to anything that sends messages to the
broker, for example web-servers that apply tasks.

Having the broker properly secured doesn\'t matter if arbitrary messages
can be sent through a client.

### Worker

The default permissions of tasks running inside a worker are the same
ones as the privileges of the worker itself. This applies to resources,
such as; memory, file-systems, and devices.

An exception to this rule is when using the multiprocessing based task
pool, which is currently the default. In this case, the task will have
access to any memory copied as a result of the `fork`{.interpreted-text
role="func"} call, and access to memory contents written by parent tasks
in the same worker child process.

Limiting access to memory contents can be done by launching every task
in a subprocess (`fork`{.interpreted-text role="func"} +
`execve`{.interpreted-text role="func"}).

Limiting file-system and device access can be accomplished by using
[chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot),
[jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail),
[sandboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)),
virtual machines, or other mechanisms as enabled by the platform or
additional software.

Note also that any task executed in the worker will have the same
network access as the machine on which it\'s running. If the worker is
located on an internal network it\'s recommended to add firewall rules
for outbound traffic.

## Serializers {#security-serializers}

The default serializer is JSON since version 4.0, but since it has only
support for a restricted set of types you may want to consider using
pickle for serialization instead.

The [pickle]{.title-ref} serializer is convenient as it can serialize
almost any Python object, even functions with some work, but for the
same reasons [pickle]{.title-ref} is inherently insecure[^1], and should
be avoided whenever clients are untrusted or unauthenticated.

You can disable untrusted content by specifying a white-list of accepted
content-types in the `accept_content`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}
setting:

::: versionadded
3.0.18
:::

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This setting was first supported in version 3.0.18. If you\'re running
an earlier version it will simply be ignored, so make sure you\'re
running a version that supports it.
:::

``` python
accept_content = ['json']
```

This accepts a list of serializer names and content-types, so you could
also specify the content type for json:

``` python
accept_content = ['application/json']
```

Celery also comes with a special [auth]{.title-ref} serializer that
validates communication between Celery clients and workers, making sure
that messages originates from trusted sources. Using [Public-key
cryptography]{.title-ref} the [auth]{.title-ref} serializer can verify
the authenticity of senders, to enable this read
`message-signing`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more information.

## Message Signing

Celery can use the `cryptography`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"} library
to sign message using [Public-key cryptography]{.title-ref}, where
messages sent by clients are signed using a private key and then later
verified by the worker using a public certificate.

Optimally certificates should be signed by an official [Certificate
Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), but
they can also be self-signed.

To enable this you should configure the
`task_serializer`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting to use the
[auth]{.title-ref} serializer. Enforcing the workers to only accept
signed messages, you should set [accept_content]{.title-ref} to
[\[\'auth\'\]]{.title-ref}. For additional signing of the event
protocol, set [event_serializer]{.title-ref} to [auth]{.title-ref}. Also
required is configuring the paths used to locate private keys and
certificates on the file-system: the `security_key`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"}, `security_certificate`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"}, and `security_cert_store`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} settings respectively. You can tweak the signing
algorithm with `security_digest`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}. If
using an encrypted private key, the password can be configured with
`security_key_password`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}.

With these configured it\'s also necessary to call the
`celery.setup_security`{.interpreted-text role="func"} function. Note
that this will also disable all insecure serializers so that the worker
won\'t accept messages with untrusted content types.

This is an example configuration using the [auth]{.title-ref}
serializer, with the private key and certificate files located in
[/etc/ssl]{.title-ref}.

``` python
app = Celery()
app.conf.update(
    security_key='/etc/ssl/private/worker.key'
    security_certificate='/etc/ssl/certs/worker.pem'
    security_cert_store='/etc/ssl/certs/*.pem',
    security_digest='sha256',
    task_serializer='auth',
    event_serializer='auth',
    accept_content=['auth']
)
app.setup_security()
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

While relative paths aren\'t disallowed, using absolute paths is
recommended for these files.

Also note that the [auth]{.title-ref} serializer won\'t encrypt the
contents of a message, so if needed this will have to be enabled
separately.

## Intrusion Detection

The most important part when defending your systems against intruders is
being able to detect if the system has been compromised.

### Logs

Logs are usually the first place to look for evidence of security
breaches, but they\'re useless if they can be tampered with.

A good solution is to set up centralized logging with a dedicated
logging server. Access to it should be restricted. In addition to having
all of the logs in a single place, if configured correctly, it can make
it harder for intruders to tamper with your logs.

This should be fairly easy to setup using syslog (see also
[syslog-ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog-ng) and
[rsyslog](http://www.rsyslog.com/)). Celery uses the
`logging`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} library, and already has support
for using syslog.

A tip for the paranoid is to send logs using UDP and cut the transmit
part of the logging server\'s network cable :-)

### Tripwire

[Tripwire](http://tripwire.com/) is a (now commercial) data integrity
tool, with several open source implementations, used to keep
cryptographic hashes of files in the file-system, so that administrators
can be alerted when they change. This way when the damage is done and
your system has been compromised you can tell exactly what files
intruders have changed (password files, logs, back-doors, root-kits, and
so on). Often this is the only way you\'ll be able to detect an
intrusion.

Some open source implementations include:

-   [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/)
-   [Samhain](http://la-samhna.de/samhain/index.html)
-   [Open Source
    Tripwire](https://github.com/Tripwire/tripwire-open-source)
-   [AIDE](http://aide.sourceforge.net/)

Also, the [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) file-system comes
with built-in integrity checks that can be used.
