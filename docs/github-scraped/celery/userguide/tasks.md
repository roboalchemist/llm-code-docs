# Tasks {#guide-tasks}

Tasks are the building blocks of Celery applications.

A task is a class that can be created out of any callable. It performs
dual roles in that it defines both what happens when a task is called
(sends a message), and what happens when a worker receives that message.

Every task class has a unique name, and this name is referenced in
messages so the worker can find the right function to execute.

A task message is not removed from the queue until that message has been
`acknowledged`{.interpreted-text role="term"} by a worker. A worker can
reserve many messages in advance and even if the worker is killed \-- by
power failure or some other reason \-- the message will be redelivered
to another worker.

Ideally task functions should be `idempotent`{.interpreted-text
role="term"}: meaning the function won\'t cause unintended effects even
if called multiple times with the same arguments. Since the worker
cannot detect if your tasks are idempotent, the default behavior is to
acknowledge the message in advance, just before it\'s executed, so that
a task invocation that already started is never executed again.

If your task is idempotent you can set the
`~Task.acks_late`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} option to have the
worker acknowledge the message *after* the task returns instead. See
also the FAQ entry `faq-acks_late-vs-retry`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Note that the worker will acknowledge the message if the child process
executing the task is terminated (either by the task calling
`sys.exit`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, or by signal) even when
`~Task.acks_late`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is enabled. This
behavior is intentional as\...

1.  We don\'t want to rerun tasks that forces the kernel to send a
    `SIGSEGV`{.interpreted-text role="sig"} (segmentation fault) or
    similar signals to the process.
2.  We assume that a system administrator deliberately killing the task
    does not want it to automatically restart.
3.  A task that allocates too much memory is in danger of triggering the
    kernel OOM killer, the same may happen again.
4.  A task that always fails when redelivered may cause a high-frequency
    message loop taking down the system.

If you really want a task to be redelivered in these scenarios you
should consider enabling the
`task_reject_on_worker_lost`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

A task that blocks indefinitely may eventually stop the worker instance
from doing any other work.

If your task does I/O then make sure you add timeouts to these
operations, like adding a timeout to a web request using the
`requests`{.interpreted-text role="pypi"} library:

``` python
connect_timeout, read_timeout = 5.0, 30.0
response = requests.get(URL, timeout=(connect_timeout, read_timeout))
```

`Time limits <worker-time-limits>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
convenient for making sure all tasks return in a timely manner, but a
time limit event will actually kill the process by force so only use
them to detect cases where you haven\'t used manual timeouts yet.

In previous versions, the default prefork pool scheduler was not
friendly to long-running tasks, so if you had tasks that ran for
minutes/hours, it was advised to enable the
`-Ofair <celery worker -O>`{.interpreted-text role="option"}
command-line argument to the `celery worker`{.interpreted-text
role="program"}. However, as of version 4.0, -Ofair is now the default
scheduling strategy. See `optimizing-prefetch-limit`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for more information, and for the best performance route
long-running and short-running tasks to dedicated workers
(`routing-automatic`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

If your worker hangs then please investigate what tasks are running
before submitting an issue, as most likely the hanging is caused by one
or more tasks hanging on a network operation.

In this chapter you\'ll learn all about defining tasks, and this is the
**table of contents**:

::: {.contents local="" depth="1"}
:::

## Basics {#task-basics}

You can easily create a task from any callable by using the
`@task`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} decorator:

``` python
from .models import User

@app.task
def create_user(username, password):
    User.objects.create(username=username, password=password)
```

There are also many `options <task-options>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} that can be set for the task, these can be specified as
arguments to the decorator:

``` python
@app.task(serializer='json')
def create_user(username, password):
    User.objects.create(username=username, password=password)
```

### How do I import the task decorator?

> The task decorator is available on your `@Celery`{.interpreted-text
> role="class"} application instance, if you don\'t know what this is
> then please read `first-steps`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
>
> If you\'re using Django (see `django-first-steps`{.interpreted-text
> role="ref"}), or you\'re the author of a library then you probably
> want to use the `@shared_task`{.interpreted-text role="func"}
> decorator:
>
> ``` python
> from celery import shared_task
>
> @shared_task
> def add(x, y):
>     return x + y
> ```

### Multiple decorators

> When using multiple decorators in combination with the task decorator
> you must make sure that the [task]{.title-ref} decorator is applied
> last (oddly, in Python this means it must be first in the list):
>
> ``` python
> @app.task
> @decorator2
> @decorator1
> def add(x, y):
>     return x + y
> ```

### Bound tasks

A task being bound means the first argument to the task will always be
the task instance (`self`), just like Python bound methods:

``` python
logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task(bind=True)
def add(self, x, y):
    logger.info(self.request.id)
```

Bound tasks are needed for retries (using
`Task.retry() <@Task.retry>`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}), for
accessing information about the current task request, and for any
additional functionality you add to custom task base classes.

### Task inheritance

The `base` argument to the task decorator specifies the base class of
the task:

``` python
import celery

class MyTask(celery.Task):

    def on_failure(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        print('{0!r} failed: {1!r}'.format(task_id, exc))

@app.task(base=MyTask)
def add(x, y):
    raise KeyError()
```

## Names {#task-names}

Every task must have a unique name.

If no explicit name is provided the task decorator will generate one for
you, and this name will be based on 1) the module the task is defined
in, and 2) the name of the task function.

Example setting explicit name:

``` pycon
>>> @app.task(name='sum-of-two-numbers')
>>> def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

>>> add.name
'sum-of-two-numbers'
```

A best practice is to use the module name as a name-space, this way
names won\'t collide if there\'s already a task with that name defined
in another module.

``` pycon
>>> @app.task(name='tasks.add')
>>> def add(x, y):
...     return x + y
```

You can tell the name of the task by investigating its `.name`
attribute:

``` pycon
>>> add.name
'tasks.add'
```

The name we specified here (`tasks.add`) is exactly the name that
would\'ve been automatically generated for us if the task was defined in
a module named `tasks.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

`tasks.py`{.interpreted-text role="file"}:

``` python
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

``` pycon
>>> from tasks import add
>>> add.name
'tasks.add'
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You can use the [inspect]{.title-ref} command in a worker to view the
names of all registered tasks. See the [inspect registered]{.title-ref}
command in the `monitoring-control`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
section of the User Guide.
:::

### Changing the automatic naming behavior {#task-name-generator-info}

::: versionadded
4.0
:::

There are some cases when the default automatic naming isn\'t suitable.
Consider having many tasks within many different modules:

    project/
           /__init__.py
           /celery.py
           /moduleA/
                   /__init__.py
                   /tasks.py
           /moduleB/
                   /__init__.py
                   /tasks.py

Using the default automatic naming, each task will have a generated name
like [moduleA.tasks.taskA]{.title-ref},
[moduleA.tasks.taskB]{.title-ref}, [moduleB.tasks.test]{.title-ref}, and
so on. You may want to get rid of having [tasks]{.title-ref} in all task
names. As pointed above, you can explicitly give names for all tasks, or
you can change the automatic naming behavior by overriding
`@gen_task_name`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}. Continuing with the
example, [celery.py]{.title-ref} may contain:

``` python
from celery import Celery

class MyCelery(Celery):

    def gen_task_name(self, name, module):
        if module.endswith('.tasks'):
            module = module[:-6]
        return super().gen_task_name(name, module)

app = MyCelery('main')
```

So each task will have a name like [moduleA.taskA]{.title-ref},
[moduleA.taskB]{.title-ref} and [moduleB.test]{.title-ref}.

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Make sure that your `@gen_task_name`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} is a
pure function: meaning that for the same input it must always return the
same output.
:::

## Task Request {#task-request-info}

`Task.request <@Task.request>`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} contains
information and state related to the currently executing task.

The request defines the following attributes:

id

:   The unique id of the executing task.

group

:   The unique id of the task\'s
    `group <canvas-group>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, if this task
    is a member.

chord

:   The unique id of the chord this task belongs to (if the task is part
    of the header).

correlation_id

:   Custom ID used for things like de-duplication.

args

:   Positional arguments.

kwargs

:   Keyword arguments.

origin

:   Name of host that sent this task.

retries

:   How many times the current task has been retried. An integer
    starting at [0]{.title-ref}.

is_eager

:   Set to `True`{.interpreted-text role="const"} if the task is
    executed locally in the client, not by a worker.

eta

:   The original ETA of the task (if any). This is in UTC time
    (depending on the `enable_utc`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}
    setting).

expires

:   The original expiry time of the task (if any). This is in UTC time
    (depending on the `enable_utc`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}
    setting).

hostname

:   Node name of the worker instance executing the task.

delivery_info

:   Additional message delivery information. This is a mapping
    containing the exchange and routing key used to deliver this task.
    Used by for example `Task.retry() <@Task.retry>`{.interpreted-text
    role="meth"} to resend the task to the same destination queue.
    Availability of keys in this dict depends on the message broker
    used.

reply-to

:   Name of queue to send replies back to (used with RPC result backend
    for example).

called_directly

:   This flag is set to true if the task wasn\'t executed by the worker.

timelimit

:   A tuple of the current `(soft, hard)` time limits active for this
    task (if any).

callbacks

:   A list of signatures to be called if this task returns successfully.

errbacks

:   A list of signatures to be called if this task fails.

utc

:   Set to true the caller has UTC enabled
    (`enable_utc`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}).

::: versionadded
3.1
:::

headers

:   Mapping of message headers sent with this task message (may be
    `None`{.interpreted-text role="const"}).

reply_to

:   Where to send reply to (queue name).

correlation_id

:   Usually the same as the task id, often used in amqp to keep track of
    what a reply is for.

::: versionadded
4.0
:::

root_id

:   The unique id of the first task in the workflow this task is part of
    (if any).

parent_id

:   The unique id of the task that called this task (if any).

chain

:   Reversed list of tasks that form a chain (if any). The last item in
    this list will be the next task to succeed the current task. If
    using version one of the task protocol the chain tasks will be in
    `request.callbacks` instead.

::: versionadded
5.2
:::

properties

:   Mapping of message properties received with this task message (may
    be `None`{.interpreted-text role="const"} or `{}`{.interpreted-text
    role="const"})

replaced_task_nesting

:   How many times the task was replaced, if at all. (may be
    `0`{.interpreted-text role="const"})

### Example

An example task accessing information in the context is:

``` python
@app.task(bind=True)
def dump_context(self, x, y):
    print('Executing task id {0.id}, args: {0.args!r} kwargs: {0.kwargs!r}'.format(
            self.request))
```

The `bind` argument means that the function will be a \"bound method\"
so that you can access attributes and methods on the task type instance.

## Logging {#task-logging}

The worker will automatically set up logging for you, or you can
configure logging manually.

A special logger is available named \"celery.task\", you can inherit
from this logger to automatically get the task name and unique id as
part of the logs.

The best practice is to create a common logger for all of your tasks at
the top of your module:

``` python
from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger

logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    logger.info('Adding {0} + {1}'.format(x, y))
    return x + y
```

Celery uses the standard Python logger library, and the documentation
can be found `here <logging>`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}.

You can also use `print`{.interpreted-text role="func"}, as anything
written to standard out/-err will be redirected to the logging system
(you can disable this, see `worker_redirect_stdouts`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"}).

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The worker won\'t update the redirection if you create a logger instance
somewhere in your task or task module.

If you want to redirect `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to a custom logger
you have to enable this manually, for example:

``` python
import sys

logger = get_task_logger(__name__)

@app.task(bind=True)
def add(self, x, y):
    old_outs = sys.stdout, sys.stderr
    rlevel = self.app.conf.worker_redirect_stdouts_level
    try:
        self.app.log.redirect_stdouts_to_logger(logger, rlevel)
        print('Adding {0} + {1}'.format(x, y))
        return x + y
    finally:
        sys.stdout, sys.stderr = old_outs
```
:::

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If a specific Celery logger you need is not emitting logs, you should
check that the logger is propagating properly. In this example
\"celery.app.trace\" is enabled so that \"succeeded in\" logs are
emitted:

``` python
import celery
import logging

@celery.signals.after_setup_logger.connect
def on_after_setup_logger(**kwargs):
    logger = logging.getLogger('celery')
    logger.propagate = True
    logger = logging.getLogger('celery.app.trace')
    logger.propagate = True
```
:::

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

If you want to completely disable Celery logging configuration, use the
`setup_logging`{.interpreted-text role="signal"} signal:

``` python
import celery

@celery.signals.setup_logging.connect
def on_setup_logging(**kwargs):
    pass
```
:::

### Argument checking {#task-argument-checking}

::: versionadded
4.0
:::

Celery will verify the arguments passed when you call the task, just
like Python does when calling a normal function:

``` pycon
>>> @app.task
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

# Calling the task with two arguments works:
>>> add.delay(8, 8)
<AsyncResult: f59d71ca-1549-43e0-be41-4e8821a83c0c>

# Calling the task with only one argument fails:
>>> add.delay(8)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 376, in delay
    return self.apply_async(args, kwargs)
  File "celery/app/task.py", line 485, in apply_async
    check_arguments(*(args or ()), **(kwargs or {}))
TypeError: add() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```

You can disable the argument checking for any task by setting its
`~@Task.typing`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute to
`False`{.interpreted-text role="const"}:

``` pycon
>>> @app.task(typing=False)
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y

# Works locally, but the worker receiving the task will raise an error.
>>> add.delay(8)
<AsyncResult: f59d71ca-1549-43e0-be41-4e8821a83c0c>
```

### Hiding sensitive information in arguments {#task-hiding-sensitive-information}

::: versionadded
4.0
:::

When using `task_protocol`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} 2 or higher
(default since 4.0), you can override how positional arguments and
keyword arguments are represented in logs and monitoring events using
the `argsrepr` and `kwargsrepr` calling arguments:

``` pycon
>>> add.apply_async((2, 3), argsrepr='(<secret-x>, <secret-y>)')

>>> charge.s(account, card='1234 5678 1234 5678').set(
...     kwargsrepr=repr({'card': '**** **** **** 5678'})
... ).delay()
```

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Sensitive information will still be accessible to anyone able to read
your task message from the broker, or otherwise able intercept it.

For this reason you should probably encrypt your message if it contains
sensitive information, or in this example with a credit card number the
actual number could be stored encrypted in a secure store that you
retrieve and decrypt in the task itself.
:::

## Retrying {#task-retry}

`Task.retry() <@Task.retry>`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} can be used
to re-execute the task, for example in the event of recoverable errors.

When you call `retry` it\'ll send a new message, using the same task-id,
and it\'ll take care to make sure the message is delivered to the same
queue as the originating task.

When a task is retried this is also recorded as a task state, so that
you can track the progress of the task using the result instance (see
`task-states`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

Here\'s an example using `retry`:

``` python
@app.task(bind=True)
def send_twitter_status(self, oauth, tweet):
    try:
        twitter = Twitter(oauth)
        twitter.update_status(tweet)
    except (Twitter.FailWhaleError, Twitter.LoginError) as exc:
        raise self.retry(exc=exc)
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

The `Task.retry() <@Task.retry>`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} call
will raise an exception so any code after the retry won\'t be reached.
This is the `~@Retry`{.interpreted-text role="exc"} exception, it isn\'t
handled as an error but rather as a semi-predicate to signify to the
worker that the task is to be retried, so that it can store the correct
state when a result backend is enabled.

This is normal operation and always happens unless the `throw` argument
to retry is set to `False`{.interpreted-text role="const"}.
:::

The bind argument to the task decorator will give access to `self` (the
task type instance).

The `exc` argument is used to pass exception information that\'s used in
logs, and when storing task results. Both the exception and the
traceback will be available in the task state (if a result backend is
enabled).

If the task has a `max_retries` value the current exception will be
re-raised if the max number of retries has been exceeded, but this
won\'t happen if:

-   An `exc` argument wasn\'t given.

    > In this case the `~@MaxRetriesExceededError`{.interpreted-text
    > role="exc"} exception will be raised.

-   There\'s no current exception

    > If there\'s no original exception to re-raise the `exc` argument
    > will be used instead, so:
    >
    > ``` python
    > self.retry(exc=Twitter.LoginError())
    > ```
    >
    > will raise the `exc` argument given.

### Using a custom retry delay {#task-retry-custom-delay}

When a task is to be retried, it can wait for a given amount of time
before doing so, and the default delay is defined by the
`~@Task.default_retry_delay`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute.
By default this is set to 3 minutes. Note that the unit for setting the
delay is in seconds (int or float).

You can also provide the [countdown]{.title-ref} argument to
`~@Task.retry`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} to override this default.

``` python
@app.task(bind=True, default_retry_delay=30 * 60)  # retry in 30 minutes.
def add(self, x, y):
    try:
        something_raising()
    except Exception as exc:
        # overrides the default delay to retry after 1 minute
        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=60)
```

### Automatic retry for known exceptions {#task-autoretry}

::: versionadded
4.0
:::

Sometimes you just want to retry a task whenever a particular exception
is raised.

Fortunately, you can tell Celery to automatically retry a task using
[autoretry_for]{.title-ref} argument in the `@task`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} decorator:

``` python
from twitter.exceptions import FailWhaleError

@app.task(autoretry_for=(FailWhaleError,))
def refresh_timeline(user):
    return twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
```

If you want to specify custom arguments for an internal
`~@Task.retry`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} call, pass
[retry_kwargs]{.title-ref} argument to `@task`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} decorator:

``` python
@app.task(autoretry_for=(FailWhaleError,),
          retry_kwargs={'max_retries': 5})
def refresh_timeline(user):
    return twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
```

This is provided as an alternative to manually handling the exceptions,
and the example above will do the same as wrapping the task body in a
`try`{.interpreted-text role="keyword"} \... `except`{.interpreted-text
role="keyword"} statement:

``` python
@app.task
def refresh_timeline(user):
    try:
        twitter.refresh_timeline(user)
    except FailWhaleError as exc:
        raise refresh_timeline.retry(exc=exc, max_retries=5)
```

If you want to automatically retry on any error, simply use:

``` python
@app.task(autoretry_for=(Exception,))
def x():
    ...
```

::: versionadded
4.2
:::

If your tasks depend on another service, like making a request to an
API, then it\'s a good idea to use [exponential
backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) to avoid
overwhelming the service with your requests. Fortunately, Celery\'s
automatic retry support makes it easy. Just specify the
`~Task.retry_backoff`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} argument, like
this:

``` python
from requests.exceptions import RequestException

@app.task(autoretry_for=(RequestException,), retry_backoff=True)
def x():
    ...
```

By default, this exponential backoff will also introduce random
[jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter) to avoid having all the
tasks run at the same moment. It will also cap the maximum backoff delay
to 10 minutes. All these settings can be customized via options
documented below.

::: versionadded
4.4
:::

You can also set [autoretry_for]{.title-ref}, [max_retries]{.title-ref},
[retry_backoff]{.title-ref}, [retry_backoff_max]{.title-ref} and
[retry_jitter]{.title-ref} options in class-based tasks:

``` python
class BaseTaskWithRetry(Task):
    autoretry_for = (TypeError,)
    max_retries = 5
    retry_backoff = True
    retry_backoff_max = 700
    retry_jitter = False
```

::: attribute
Task.autoretry_for

A list/tuple of exception classes. If any of these exceptions are raised
during the execution of the task, the task will automatically be
retried. By default, no exceptions will be autoretried.
:::

::: attribute
Task.max_retries

A number. Maximum number of retries before giving up. A value of `None`
means task will retry forever. By default, this option is set to `3`.
:::

::: attribute
Task.retry_backoff

A boolean, or a number. If this option is set to `True`, autoretries
will be delayed following the rules of [exponential
backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff). The first
retry will have a delay of 1 second, the second retry will have a delay
of 2 seconds, the third will delay 4 seconds, the fourth will delay 8
seconds, and so on. (However, this delay value is modified by
`~Task.retry_jitter`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}, if it is enabled.)
If this option is set to a number, it is used as a delay factor. For
example, if this option is set to `3`, the first retry will delay 3
seconds, the second will delay 6 seconds, the third will delay 12
seconds, the fourth will delay 24 seconds, and so on. By default, this
option is set to `False`, and autoretries will not be delayed.
:::

::: attribute
Task.retry_backoff_max

A number. If `retry_backoff` is enabled, this option will set a maximum
delay in seconds between task autoretries. By default, this option is
set to `600`, which is 10 minutes.
:::

::: attribute
Task.retry_jitter

A boolean. [Jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter) is used to
introduce randomness into exponential backoff delays, to prevent all
tasks in the queue from being executed simultaneously. If this option is
set to `True`, the delay value calculated by
`~Task.retry_backoff`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is treated as a
maximum, and the actual delay value will be a random number between zero
and that maximum. By default, this option is set to `True`.

Task.dont_autoretry_for

Argument validation only covers arguments/return values on the task
side. You still have serialize arguments yourself when invoking a task
with `delay()` or `apply_async()`.
:::

For example:

``` python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ArgModel(BaseModel):
    value: int

class ReturnModel(BaseModel):
    value: str

@app.task(pydantic=True)
def x(arg: ArgModel) -> ReturnModel:
    # args/kwargs type hinted as Pydantic model will be converted
    assert isinstance(arg, ArgModel)

    # The returned model will be converted to a dict automatically
    return ReturnModel(value=f"example: {arg.value}")
```

The task can then be called using a dict matching the model, and you\'ll
receive the returned model \"dumped\" (serialized using
`BaseModel.model_dump()`):

``` python
>>> result = x.delay({'value': 1})
>>> result.get(timeout=1)
{'value': 'example: 1'}
```

### Union types, arguments to generics

Union types (e.g. `Union[SomeModel, OtherModel]`) or arguments to
generics (e.g. `list[SomeModel]`) are **not** supported.

In case you want to support a list or similar types, it is recommended
to use `pydantic.RootModel`.

### Optional parameters/return values

Optional parameters or return values are also handled properly. For
example, given this task:

``` python
from typing import Optional

# models are the same as above

@app.task(pydantic=True)
def x(arg: Optional[ArgModel] = None) -> Optional[ReturnModel]:
    if arg is None:
        return None
    return ReturnModel(value=f"example: {arg.value}")
```

You\'ll get the following behavior:

``` python
>>> result = x.delay()
>>> result.get(timeout=1) is None
True
>>> result = x.delay({'value': 1})
>>> result.get(timeout=1)
{'value': 'example: 1'}
```

### Return value handling

Return values will only be serialized if the returned model matches the
annotation. If you pass a model instance of a different type, it will
*not* be serialized. `mypy` should already catch such errors and you
should fix your typehints then.

### Pydantic parameters

There are a few more options influencing Pydantic behavior:

::: attribute
Task.pydantic_strict

By default, [strict
mode](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev/concepts/strict_mode/) is disabled.
You can pass `True` to enable strict model validation.
:::

::: attribute
Task.pydantic_context

Pass [additional validation
context](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev/concepts/validators/#validation-context)
during Pydantic model validation. The context already includes the
application object as `celery_app` and the task name as
`celery_task_name` by default.
:::

::: attribute
Task.pydantic_dump_kwargs

When serializing a result, pass these additional arguments to
`dump_kwargs()`. By default, only `mode='json'` is passed.
:::

## List of Options {#task-options}

The task decorator can take a number of options that change the way the
task behaves, for example you can set the rate limit for a task using
the `rate_limit`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} option.

Any keyword argument passed to the task decorator will actually be set
as an attribute of the resulting task class, and this is a list of the
built-in attributes.

### General

::: {#task-general-options}
::: attribute
Task.name

The name the task is registered as.

You can set this name manually, or a name will be automatically
generated using the module and class name.

See also `task-names`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::
:::

::: attribute
Task.request

If the task is being executed this will contain information about the
current request. Thread local storage is used.

See `task-request-info`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
:::

::: attribute
Task.max_retries

Only applies if the task calls `self.retry` or if the task is decorated
with the `autoretry_for <task-autoretry>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
argument.

The maximum number of attempted retries before giving up. If the number
of retries exceeds this value a
`~@MaxRetriesExceededError`{.interpreted-text role="exc"} exception will
be raised.

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

You have to call `~@Task.retry`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} manually,
as it won\'t automatically retry on exception..
:::

The default is `3`. A value of `None`{.interpreted-text role="const"}
will disable the retry limit and the task will retry forever until it
succeeds.
:::

::: attribute
Task.throws

Optional tuple of expected error classes that shouldn\'t be regarded as
an actual error.

Errors in this list will be reported as a failure to the result backend,
but the worker won\'t log the event as an error, and no traceback will
be included.

Example:

``` python
@task(throws=(KeyError, HttpNotFound)):
def get_foo():
    something()
```

Error types:

-   Expected errors (in `Task.throws`)

    > Logged with severity `INFO`, traceback excluded.

-   Unexpected errors

    > Logged with severity `ERROR`, with traceback included.
:::

::: attribute
Task.default_retry_delay

Default time in seconds before a retry of the task should be executed.
Can be either `int`{.interpreted-text role="class"} or
`float`{.interpreted-text role="class"}. Default is a three minute
delay.
:::

::: attribute
Task.rate_limit

Set the rate limit for this task type (limits the number of tasks that
can be run in a given time frame). Tasks will still complete when a rate
limit is in effect, but it may take some time before it\'s allowed to
start.

If this is `None`{.interpreted-text role="const"} no rate limit is in
effect. If it is an integer or float, it is interpreted as \"tasks per
second\".

The rate limits can be specified in seconds, minutes or hours by
appending [\"/s\"]{.title-ref}, [\"/m\"]{.title-ref} or
[\"/h\"]{.title-ref} to the value. Tasks will be evenly distributed over
the specified time frame.

Example: [\"100/m\"]{.title-ref} (hundred tasks a minute). This will
enforce a minimum delay of 600ms between starting two tasks on the same
worker instance.

Default is the `task_default_rate_limit`{.interpreted-text
role="setting"} setting: if not specified means rate limiting for tasks
is disabled by default.

Note that this is a *per worker instance* rate limit, and not a global
rate limit. To enforce a global rate limit (e.g., for an API with a
maximum number of requests per second), you must restrict to a given
queue.
:::

::: attribute
Task.time_limit

The hard time limit, in seconds, for this task. When not set the workers
default is used.
:::

::: attribute
Task.soft_time_limit

The soft time limit for this task. When not set the workers default is
used.
:::

::: attribute
Task.ignore_result

Don\'t store task state. Note that this means you can\'t use
`~celery.result.AsyncResult`{.interpreted-text role="class"} to check if
the task is ready, or get its return value.

Note: Certain features will not work if task results are disabled. For
more details check the Canvas documentation.
:::

::: attribute
Task.store_errors_even_if_ignored

If `True`{.interpreted-text role="const"}, errors will be stored even if
the task is configured to ignore results.
:::

::: attribute
Task.serializer

A string identifying the default serialization method to use. Defaults
to the `task_serializer`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting. Can
be [pickle]{.title-ref}, [json]{.title-ref}, [yaml]{.title-ref}, or any
custom serialization methods that have been registered with
`kombu.serialization.registry`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}.

Please see `calling-serializers`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
information.
:::

::: attribute
Task.compression

A string identifying the default compression scheme to use.

Defaults to the `task_compression`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}
setting. Can be [gzip]{.title-ref}, or [bzip2]{.title-ref}, or any
custom compression schemes that have been registered with the
`kombu.compression`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} registry.

Please see `calling-compression`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more
information.
:::

::: attribute
Task.backend

The result store backend to use for this task. An instance of one of the
backend classes in [celery.backends]{.title-ref}. Defaults to
[app.backend]{.title-ref}, defined by the
`result_backend`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.
:::

::: attribute
Task.acks_late

If set to `True`{.interpreted-text role="const"} messages for this task
will be acknowledged **after** the task has been executed, not *just
before* (the default behavior).

Note: This means the task may be executed multiple times should the
worker crash in the middle of execution. Make sure your tasks are
`idempotent`{.interpreted-text role="term"}.

The global default can be overridden by the
`task_acks_late`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.
:::

::: {#task-track-started}
::: attribute
Task.track_started

If `True`{.interpreted-text role="const"} the task will report its
status as \"started\" when the task is executed by a worker. The default
value is `False`{.interpreted-text role="const"} as the normal behavior
is to not report that level of granularity. Tasks are either pending,
finished, or waiting to be retried. Having a \"started\" status can be
useful for when there are long running tasks and there\'s a need to
report what task is currently running.

The host name and process id of the worker executing the task will be
available in the state meta-data (e.g.,
[result.info\[\'pid\'\]]{.title-ref})

The global default can be overridden by the
`task_track_started`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.

## States {#task-states}

Celery can keep track of the tasks current state. The state also
contains the result of a successful task, or the exception and traceback
information of a failed task.

There are several *result backends* to choose from, and they all have
different strengths and weaknesses (see
`task-result-backends`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}).

During its lifetime a task will transition through several possible
states, and each state may have arbitrary meta-data attached to it. When
a task moves into a new state the previous state is forgotten about, but
some transitions can be deduced, (e.g., a task now in the
`FAILED`{.interpreted-text role="state"} state, is implied to have been
in the `STARTED`{.interpreted-text role="state"} state at some point).

There are also sets of states, like the set of
`FAILURE_STATES`{.interpreted-text role="state"}, and the set of
`READY_STATES`{.interpreted-text role="state"}.

The client uses the membership of these sets to decide whether the
exception should be re-raised (`PROPAGATE_STATES`{.interpreted-text
role="state"}), or whether the state can be cached (it can if the task
is ready).

You can also define `custom-states`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Result Backends {#task-result-backends}

If you want to keep track of tasks or need the return values, then
Celery must store or send the states somewhere so that they can be
retrieved later. There are several built-in result backends to choose
from: SQLAlchemy/Django ORM, Memcached, RabbitMQ/QPid (`rpc`), and Redis
\-- or you can define your own.

No backend works well for every use case. You should read about the
strengths and weaknesses of each backend, and choose the most
appropriate for your needs.

::: warning
::: title
Warning
:::

Backends use resources to store and transmit results. To ensure that
resources are released, you must eventually call
`~@AsyncResult.get`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} or
`~@AsyncResult.forget`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} on EVERY
`~@AsyncResult`{.interpreted-text role="class"} instance returned after
calling a task.
:::

::: seealso
`conf-result-backend`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
:::

#### RPC Result Backend (RabbitMQ/QPid)

The RPC result backend ([rpc://]{.title-ref}) is special as it doesn\'t
actually *store* the states, but rather sends them as messages. This is
an important difference as it means that a result *can only be retrieved
once*, and *only by the client that initiated the task*. Two different
processes can\'t wait for the same result.

Even with that limitation, it is an excellent choice if you need to
receive state changes in real-time. Using messaging means the client
doesn\'t have to poll for new states.

The messages are transient (non-persistent) by default, so the results
will disappear if the broker restarts. You can configure the result
backend to send persistent messages using the
`result_persistent`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.

#### Database Result Backend

Keeping state in the database can be convenient for many, especially for
web applications with a database already in place, but it also comes
with limitations.

-   Polling the database for new states is expensive, and so you should
    increase the polling intervals of operations, such as
    [result.get()]{.title-ref}.

-   Some databases use a default transaction isolation level that isn\'t
    suitable for polling tables for changes.

    In MySQL the default transaction isolation level is
    \`REPEATABLE-READ\`: meaning the transaction won\'t see changes made
    by other transactions until the current transaction is committed.

    Changing that to the [READ-COMMITTED]{.title-ref} isolation level is
    recommended.

### Built-in States {#task-builtin-states}

::: state
PENDING
:::

#### PENDING

Task is waiting for execution or unknown. Any task id that\'s not known
is implied to be in the pending state.

::: state
STARTED
:::

#### STARTED

Task has been started. Not reported by default, to enable please see
`@Task.track_started`{.interpreted-text role="attr"}.

meta-data

:   [pid]{.title-ref} and [hostname]{.title-ref} of the worker process
    executing the task.

::: state
SUCCESS
:::

#### SUCCESS

Task has been successfully executed.

meta-data

:   [result]{.title-ref} contains the return value of the task.

propagates

:   Yes

ready

:   Yes

::: state
FAILURE
:::

#### FAILURE

Task execution resulted in failure.

meta-data

:   [result]{.title-ref} contains the exception occurred, and
    [traceback]{.title-ref} contains the backtrace of the stack at the
    point when the exception was raised.

propagates

:   Yes

::: state
RETRY
:::

#### RETRY

Task is being retried.

meta-data

:   [result]{.title-ref} contains the exception that caused the retry,
    and [traceback]{.title-ref} contains the backtrace of the stack at
    the point when the exceptions was raised.

propagates

:   No

::: state
REVOKED
:::

#### REVOKED

Task has been revoked.

propagates

:   Yes

### Custom states

You can easily define your own states, all you need is a unique name.
The name of the state is usually an uppercase string. As an example you
could have a look at the
`abortable tasks <~celery.contrib.abortable>`{.interpreted-text
role="mod"} which defines a custom `ABORTED`{.interpreted-text
role="state"} state.

Use `~@Task.update_state`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} to update a
task\'s state:.

``` python
@app.task(bind=True)
def upload_files(self, filenames):
    for i, file in enumerate(filenames):
        if not self.request.called_directly:
            self.update_state(state='PROGRESS',
                meta={'current': i, 'total': len(filenames)})
```

Here I created the state [\"PROGRESS\"]{.title-ref}, telling any
application aware of this state that the task is currently in progress,
and also where it is in the process by having [current]{.title-ref} and
[total]{.title-ref} counts as part of the state meta-data. This can then
be used to create progress bars for example.

### Creating pickleable exceptions {#pickling_exceptions}

A rarely known Python fact is that exceptions must conform to some
simple rules to support being serialized by the pickle module.

Tasks that raise exceptions that aren\'t pickleable won\'t work properly
when Pickle is used as the serializer.

To make sure that your exceptions are pickleable the exception *MUST*
provide the original arguments it was instantiated with in its `.args`
attribute. The simplest way to ensure this is to have the exception call
`Exception.__init__`.

Let\'s look at some examples that work, and one that doesn\'t:

``` python
# OK:
class HttpError(Exception):
    pass

# BAD:
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code):
        self.status_code = status_code

# OK:
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code):
        self.status_code = status_code
        Exception.__init__(self, status_code)  # <-- REQUIRED
```

So the rule is: For any exception that supports custom arguments
`*args`, `Exception.__init__(self, *args)` must be used.

There\'s no special support for *keyword arguments*, so if you want to
preserve keyword arguments when the exception is unpickled you have to
pass them as regular args:

``` python
class HttpError(Exception):

    def __init__(self, status_code, headers=None, body=None):
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.headers = headers
        self.body = body

        super(HttpError, self).__init__(status_code, headers, body)
```

## Semipredicates {#task-semipredicates}

The worker wraps the task in a tracing function that records the final
state of the task. There are a number of exceptions that can be used to
signal this function to change how it treats the return of the task.

### Ignore {#task-semipred-ignore}

The task may raise `~@Ignore`{.interpreted-text role="exc"} to force the
worker to ignore the task. This means that no state will be recorded for
the task, but the message is still acknowledged (removed from queue).

This can be used if you want to implement custom revoke-like
functionality, or manually store the result of a task.

Example keeping revoked tasks in a Redis set:

``` python
from celery.exceptions import Ignore

@app.task(bind=True)
def some_task(self):
    if redis.ismember('tasks.revoked', self.request.id):
        raise Ignore()
```

Example that stores results manually:

``` python
from celery import states
from celery.exceptions import Ignore

@app.task(bind=True)
def get_tweets(self, user):
    timeline = twitter.get_timeline(user)
    if not self.request.called_directly:
        self.update_state(state=states.SUCCESS, meta=timeline)
    raise Ignore()
```

### Reject {#task-semipred-reject}

The task may raise `~@Reject`{.interpreted-text role="exc"} to reject
the task message using AMQPs `basic_reject` method. This won\'t have any
effect unless `Task.acks_late`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} is
enabled.

Rejecting a message has the same effect as acking it, but some brokers
may implement additional functionality that can be used. For example
RabbitMQ supports the concept of [Dead Letter
Exchanges](http://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html) where a queue can be
configured to use a dead letter exchange that rejected messages are
redelivered to.

Reject can also be used to re-queue messages, but please be very careful
when using this as it can easily result in an infinite message loop.

Example using reject when a task causes an out of memory condition:

``` python
import errno
from celery.exceptions import Reject

@app.task(bind=True, acks_late=True)
def render_scene(self, path):
    file = get_file(path)
    try:
        renderer.render_scene(file)

    # if the file is too big to fit in memory
    # we reject it so that it's redelivered to the dead letter exchange
    # and we can manually inspect the situation.
    except MemoryError as exc:
        raise Reject(exc, requeue=False)
    except OSError as exc:
        if exc.errno == errno.ENOMEM:
            raise Reject(exc, requeue=False)

    # For any other error we retry after 10 seconds.
    except Exception as exc:
        raise self.retry(exc, countdown=10)
```

Example re-queuing the message:

``` python
from celery.exceptions import Reject

@app.task(bind=True, acks_late=True)
def requeues(self):
    if not self.request.delivery_info['redelivered']:
        raise Reject('no reason', requeue=True)
    print('received two times')
```

Consult your broker documentation for more details about the
`basic_reject` method.

### Retry {#task-semipred-retry}

The `~@Retry`{.interpreted-text role="exc"} exception is raised by the
`Task.retry` method to tell the worker that the task is being retried.

## Custom task classes {#task-custom-classes}

All tasks inherit from the `@Task`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
class. The `~@Task.run`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method becomes
the task body.

As an example, the following code,

``` python
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

will do roughly this behind the scenes:

``` python
class _AddTask(app.Task):

    def run(self, x, y):
        return x + y
add = app.tasks[_AddTask.name]
```

### Instantiation

A task is **not** instantiated for every request, but is registered in
the task registry as a global instance.

This means that the `__init__` constructor will only be called once per
process, and that the task class is semantically closer to an Actor.

If you have a task,

``` python
from celery import Task

class NaiveAuthenticateServer(Task):

    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {'george': 'password'}

    def run(self, username, password):
        try:
            return self.users[username] == password
        except KeyError:
            return False
```

And you route every request to the same process, then it will keep state
between requests.

This can also be useful to cache resources, For example, a base Task
class that caches a database connection:

``` python
from celery import Task

class DatabaseTask(Task):
    _db = None

    @property
    def db(self):
        if self._db is None:
            self._db = Database.connect()
        return self._db
```

#### Per task usage

The above can be added to each task like this:

``` python
from celery.app import task

@app.task(base=DatabaseTask, bind=True)
def process_rows(self: task):
    for row in self.db.table.all():
        process_row(row)
```

The `db` attribute of the `process_rows` task will then always stay the
same in each process.

#### App-wide usage {#custom-task-cls-app-wide}

You can also use your custom class in your whole Celery app by passing
it as the `task_cls` argument when instantiating the app. This argument
should be either a string giving the python path to your Task class or
the class itself:

``` python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', task_cls='your.module.path:DatabaseTask')
```

This will make all your tasks declared using the decorator syntax within
your app to use your `DatabaseTask` class and will all have a `db`
attribute.

The default value is the class provided by Celery:
`'celery.app.task:Task'`.

### Handlers

Task handlers are methods that execute at specific points in a task\'s
lifecycle. All handlers run **synchronously** within the same worker
process and thread that executes the task.

#### Execution timeline

The following diagram shows the exact order of execution:

``` text
Worker Process Timeline
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. before_start()      ← Blocks until complete               │
│  2. run()               ← Your task function                  │
│  3. [Result Backend]    ← State + return value persisted      │
│  4. on_success() OR     ← Outcome-specific handler            │
│     on_retry() OR       │                                     │
│     on_failure()        │                                     │
│  5. after_return()      ← Always runs last                    │

### Requests and custom requests {#task-requests-and-custom-requests}

Upon receiving a message to run a task, the
`worker <guide-workers>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} creates a
`request <celery.worker.request.Request>`{.interpreted-text
role="class"} to represent such demand.

Custom task classes may override which request class to use by changing
the attribute `celery.app.task.Task.Request`{.interpreted-text
role="attr"}. You may either assign the custom request class itself, or
its fully qualified name.

The request has several responsibilities. Custom request classes should
cover them all \-- they are responsible to actually run and trace the
task. We strongly recommend to inherit from
`celery.worker.request.Request`{.interpreted-text role="class"}.

When using the
`pre-forking worker <worker-concurrency>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
the methods
`~celery.worker.request.Request.on_timeout`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} and
`~celery.worker.request.Request.on_failure`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} are executed in the main worker process. An application may
leverage such facility to detect failures which are not detected using
`celery.app.task.Task.on_failure`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}.

As an example, the following custom request detects and logs hard time
limits, and other failures.

``` python
import logging
from celery import Task
from celery.worker.request import Request

logger = logging.getLogger('my.package')

class MyRequest(Request):
    'A minimal custom request to log failures and hard time limits.'

    def on_timeout(self, soft, timeout):
        super(MyRequest, self).on_timeout(soft, timeout)
        if not soft:
           logger.warning(
               'A hard timeout was enforced for task %s',
               self.task.name
           )

    def on_failure(self, exc_info, send_failed_event=True, return_ok=False):
        super().on_failure(
            exc_info,
            send_failed_event=send_failed_event,
            return_ok=return_ok
        )
        logger.warning(
            'Failure detected for task %s',
            self.task.name
        )

class MyTask(Task):
    Request = MyRequest  # you can use a FQN 'my.package:MyRequest'

@app.task(base=MyTask)
def some_longrunning_task():
    # use your imagination
```

## How it works {#task-how-they-work}

Here come the technical details. This part isn\'t something you need to
know, but you may be interested.

All defined tasks are listed in a registry. The registry contains a list
of task names and their task classes. You can investigate this registry
yourself:

``` pycon
>>> from proj.celery import app
>>> app.tasks
{'celery.chord_unlock':
    <@task: celery.chord_unlock>,
 'celery.backend_cleanup':
    <@task: celery.backend_cleanup>,
 'celery.chord':
    <@task: celery.chord>}
```

This is the list of tasks built into Celery. Note that tasks will only
be registered when the module they\'re defined in is imported.

The default loader imports any modules listed in the
`imports`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.

The `@task`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} decorator is responsible for
registering your task in the applications task registry.

When tasks are sent, no actual function code is sent with it, just the
name of the task to execute. When the worker then receives the message
it can look up the name in its task registry to find the execution code.

This means that your workers should always be updated with the same
software as the client. This is a drawback, but the alternative is a
technical challenge that\'s yet to be solved.

## Tips and Best Practices {#task-best-practices}

### Ignore results you don\'t want {#task-ignore_results}

If you don\'t care about the results of a task, be sure to set the
`~@Task.ignore_result`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} option, as storing
results wastes time and resources.

``` python
@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def mytask():
    something()
```

Results can even be disabled globally using the
`task_ignore_result`{.interpreted-text role="setting"} setting.

::: versionadded
4.2
:::

Results can be enabled/disabled on a per-execution basis, by passing the
`ignore_result` boolean parameter, when calling `apply_async`.

``` python
@app.task
def mytask(x, y):
    return x + y

# No result will be stored
result = mytask.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=True)
print(result.get()) # -> None

# Result will be stored
result = mytask.apply_async((1, 2), ignore_result=False)
print(result.get()) # -> 3
```

By default tasks will *not ignore results* (`ignore_result=False`) when
a result backend is configured.

The option precedence order is the following:

1.  Global `task_ignore_result`{.interpreted-text role="setting"}
2.  `~@Task.ignore_result`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} option
3.  Task execution option `ignore_result`

### More optimization tips

You find additional optimization tips in the
`Optimizing Guide <guide-optimizing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

### Avoid launching synchronous subtasks {#task-synchronous-subtasks}

Having a task wait for the result of another task is really inefficient,
and may even cause a deadlock if the worker pool is exhausted.

Make your design asynchronous instead, for example by using *callbacks*.

**Bad**:

``` python
@app.task
def update_page_info(url):
    page = fetch_page.delay(url).get()
    info = parse_page.delay(page).get()
    store_page_info.delay(url, info)

@app.task
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task
def store_page_info(url, info):
    return PageInfo.objects.create(url, info)
```

**Good**:

``` python
def update_page_info(url):
    # fetch_page -> parse_page -> store_page
    chain = fetch_page.s(url) | parse_page.s() | store_page_info.s(url)
    chain()

@app.task()
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task()
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task(ignore_result=True)
def store_page_info(info, url):
    PageInfo.objects.create(url=url, info=info)
```

Here I instead created a chain of tasks by linking together different
`~celery.signature`{.interpreted-text role="func"}\'s. You can read
about chains and other powerful constructs at
`designing-workflows`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

By default Celery will not allow you to run subtasks synchronously
within a task, but in rare or extreme cases you might need to do so.
**WARNING**: enabling subtasks to run synchronously is not recommended!

``` python
@app.task
def update_page_info(url):
    page = fetch_page.delay(url).get(disable_sync_subtasks=False)
    info = parse_page.delay(page).get(disable_sync_subtasks=False)
    store_page_info.delay(url, info)

@app.task
def fetch_page(url):
    return myhttplib.get(url)

@app.task
def parse_page(page):
    return myparser.parse_document(page)

@app.task
def store_page_info(url, info):
    return PageInfo.objects.create(url, info)
```

## Performance and Strategies {#task-performance-and-strategies}

### Granularity {#task-granularity}

The task granularity is the amount of computation needed by each
subtask. In general it is better to split the problem up into many small
tasks rather than have a few long running tasks.

With smaller tasks you can process more tasks in parallel and the tasks
won\'t run long enough to block the worker from processing other waiting
tasks.

However, executing a task does have overhead. A message needs to be
sent, data may not be local, etc. So if the tasks are too fine-grained
the overhead added probably removes any benefit.

::: seealso
The book [Art of Concurrency](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521547)
has a section dedicated to the topic of task granularity
[\[AOC1\]](#AOC1){.citation}.
:::

### Data locality {#task-data-locality}

The worker processing the task should be as close to the data as
possible. The best would be to have a copy in memory, the worst would be
a full transfer from another continent.

If the data is far away, you could try to run another worker at
location, or if that\'s not possible - cache often used data, or preload
data you know is going to be used.

The easiest way to share data between workers is to use a distributed
cache system, like [memcached](http://memcached.org/).

::: seealso
The paper [Distributed Computing
Economics](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/70001/tr-2003-24.pdf) by
Jim Gray is an excellent introduction to the topic of data locality.
:::

### State {#task-state}

Since Celery is a distributed system, you can\'t know which process, or
on what machine the task will be executed. You can\'t even know if the
task will run in a timely manner.

The ancient async sayings tells us that "asserting the world is the
responsibility of the task". What this means is that the world view may
have changed since the task was requested, so the task is responsible
for making sure the world is how it should be; If you have a task that
re-indexes a search engine, and the search engine should only be
re-indexed at maximum every 5 minutes, then it must be the tasks
responsibility to assert that, not the callers.

Another gotcha is Django model objects. They shouldn\'t be passed on as
arguments to tasks. It\'s almost always better to re-fetch the object
from the database when the task is running instead, as using old data
may lead to race conditions.

Imagine the following scenario where you have an article and a task that
automatically expands some abbreviations in it:

``` python
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    body = models.TextField()

@app.task
def expand_abbreviations(article):
    article.body.replace('MyCorp', 'My Corporation')
    article.save()
```

First, an author creates an article and saves it, then the author clicks
on a button that initiates the abbreviation task:

``` pycon
>>> article = Article.objects.get(id=102)
>>> expand_abbreviations.delay(article)
```

Now, the queue is very busy, so the task won\'t be run for another 2
minutes. In the meantime another author makes changes to the article, so
when the task is finally run, the body of the article is reverted to the
old version because the task had the old body in its argument.

Fixing the race condition is easy, just use the article id instead, and
re-fetch the article in the task body:

``` python
@app.task
def expand_abbreviations(article_id):
    article = Article.objects.get(id=article_id)
    article.body.replace('MyCorp', 'My Corporation')
    article.save()
```

``` pycon
>>> expand_abbreviations.delay(article_id)
```

There might even be performance benefits to this approach, as sending
large messages may be expensive.

### Database transactions {#task-database-transactions}

Let\'s have a look at another example:

``` python
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    expand_abbreviations.delay(article.pk)
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

This is a Django view creating an article object in the database, then
passing the primary key to a task. It uses the
[transaction.atomic]{.title-ref} decorator, that will commit the
transaction when the view returns, or roll back if the view raises an
exception.

There is a race condition because transactions are atomic. This means
the article object is not persisted to the database until after the view
function returns a response. If the asynchronous task starts executing
before the transaction is committed, it may attempt to query the article
object before it exists. To prevent this, we need to ensure that the
transaction is committed before triggering the task.

The solution is to use
`~celery.contrib.django.task.DjangoTask.delay_on_commit`{.interpreted-text
role="meth"} instead:

``` python
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    expand_abbreviations.delay_on_commit(article.pk)
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

This method was added in Celery 5.4. It\'s a shortcut that uses
Django\'s `on_commit` callback to launch your Celery task once all
transactions have been committed successfully.

#### With Celery \<5.4

If you\'re using an older version of Celery, you can replicate this
behaviour using the Django callback directly as follows:

``` python
import functools
from django.db import transaction
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

@transaction.atomic
def create_article(request):
    article = Article.objects.create()
    transaction.on_commit(
        functools.partial(expand_abbreviations.delay, article.pk)
    )
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/articles/')
```

::: note
::: title
Note
:::

`on_commit` is available in Django 1.9 and above, if you are using a
version prior to that then the
[django-transaction-hooks](https://github.com/carljm/django-transaction-hooks)
library adds support for this.
:::

## Example {#task-example}

Let\'s take a real world example: a blog where comments posted need to
be filtered for spam. When the comment is created, the spam filter runs
in the background, so the user doesn\'t have to wait for it to finish.

I have a Django blog application allowing comments on blog posts. I\'ll
describe parts of the models/views and tasks for this application.

### `blog/models.py`

The comment model looks like this:

``` python
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _


class Comment(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(_('name'), max_length=64)
    email_address = models.EmailField(_('email address'))
    homepage = models.URLField(_('home page'),
                               blank=True, verify_exists=False)
    comment = models.TextField(_('comment'))
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField(_('Published date'),
                                    editable=False, auto_add_now=True)
    is_spam = models.BooleanField(_('spam?'),
                                  default=False, editable=False)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = _('comment')
        verbose_name_plural = _('comments')
```

In the view where the comment is posted, I first write the comment to
the database, then I launch the spam filter task in the background.

### `blog/views.py` {#task-example-blog-views}

``` python
from django import forms
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.template.context import RequestContext
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render_to_response

from blog import tasks
from blog.models import Comment


class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm):

    class Meta:
        model = Comment


def add_comment(request, slug, template_name='comments/create.html'):
    post = get_object_or_404(Entry, slug=slug)
    remote_addr = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')

    if request.method == 'post':
        form = CommentForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            comment = form.save()
            # Check spam asynchronously.
            tasks.spam_filter.delay(comment_id=comment.id,
                                    remote_addr=remote_addr)
            return HttpResponseRedirect(post.get_absolute_url())
    else:
        form = CommentForm()

    context = RequestContext(request, {'form': form})
    return render_to_response(template_name, context_instance=context)
```

To filter spam in comments I use [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/), the
service used to filter spam in comments posted to the free blog platform
[Wordpress]{.title-ref}. [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/) is free for
personal use, but for commercial use you need to pay. You have to sign
up to their service to get an API key.

To make API calls to [Akismet](http://akismet.com/faq/) I use the
[akismet.py](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/akismet.py) library
written by [Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/).

### `blog/tasks.py` {#task-example-blog-tasks}

``` python
from celery import Celery

from akismet import Akismet

from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured
from django.contrib.sites.models import Site

from blog.models import Comment


app = Celery(broker='amqp://')


@app.task
def spam_filter(comment_id, remote_addr=None):
    logger = spam_filter.get_logger()
    logger.info('Running spam filter for comment %s', comment_id)

    comment = Comment.objects.get(pk=comment_id)
    current_domain = Site.objects.get_current().domain
    akismet = Akismet(settings.AKISMET_KEY, 'http://{0}'.format(domain))
    if not akismet.verify_key():
        raise ImproperlyConfigured('Invalid AKISMET_KEY')


    is_spam = akismet.comment_check(user_ip=remote_addr,
                        comment_content=comment.comment,
                        comment_author=comment.name,
                        comment_author_email=comment.email_address)
    if is_spam:
        comment.is_spam = True
        comment.save()

    return is_spam
```
