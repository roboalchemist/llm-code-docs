python test_mqtt.py        # MQTT functionality
python test_cloud_api.py   # Cloud API calls
python test_ftp.py         # FTP uploads
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add support for XYZ endpoint"

- Reference any related issues
- Wait for review and address feedback

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Use 4 spaces for indentation

### Documentation

- **API_*.md**: Endpoint documentation with examples

## API Discovery Process

When documenting new endpoints:

- Include full request/response examples
- Document all known parameters
- Note any version-specific behavior
- Sanitize all personal identifiers
