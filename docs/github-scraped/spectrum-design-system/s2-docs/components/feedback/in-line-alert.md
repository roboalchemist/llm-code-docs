## External links

In-line alerts display non-modal messages connected to elements in a view. They’re often used in forms to show validation feedback across multiple fields.

These options are used in Spectrum’s design data JSON. There may be additional or slightly different options that are available for this component in Figma and in Spectrum implementations. This is being continuously updated.

An in-line alert can have up to one button. This label should be kept concise, and it should only be used when there’s a direct action available that is related to the in-line alert text.

Heading is optional for in-line alerts.

The outline style is the default for in-line alerts.

"There are five semantic variants:"

When the title of an in-line alert is too long for the available horizontal space, it wraps to form another line. The optional icon in the top-right corner stays aligned to the top.
