An avatar group displays a set of related avatars together. It’s typically used to represent a collection of people or entities.

These options are used in Spectrum’s design data JSON. There may be additional or slightly different options that are available for this component in Figma and in Spectrum implementations. This is being continuously updated.

Avatar sizes scale exponentially, based on the Spectrum type scale. Avatar has preset sizes to flex across all surfaces and can also be customized to fit appropriately for your context.

An Avatar group can have an optional text label that clearly describes the group or number of users that it represents.

Individual avatars inside Avatar group can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state adds a focus ring around the avatar.

Each individual avatar has a stroke applied to better show distinction between individual users in the group. By default, the outline color is a neutral gray, but the stroke color should be adjusted manually to match the background where the avatar group is placed.

When using a colored background the avatar stroke color should remain set as default for both light and dark themes.
