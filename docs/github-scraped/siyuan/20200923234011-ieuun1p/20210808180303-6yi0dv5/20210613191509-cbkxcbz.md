# Content Block Attribute

## Overview

Attributes exist in the form of key-value pairs. We can enrich the connotation of the content block by setting attributes on the content block. Attributes are divided into built-in attributes and custom attributes.

## Built-in attributes

| Property name | Description |
|---|---|
| name | Name of the content block |
| alias | Alias of content block |
| memo | Memo of the content block |
| bookmark | Bookmark of content block |

## Custom attributes

The user-defined attributes are set by the user through the `Block icon menu` -`Attribute`, and only English letters and Arabic numerals are allowed in the attribute name (such as `doing`, `7days`). After setting, SiYuan will automatically prefix the attribute name with `custom-` to distinguish built-in attributes from custom attributes.

## Using attributes

There are two main usage scenarios for attributes: querying content blocks based on attributes and storing widget data.

### Query content blocks based on attributes

For example, when we set the properties of `progress=30` and `priority=2` for the content block, we can query all content blocks with a progress of 30 and a priority of 2 through SQL:

```c3Fs
SELECT *
FROM blocks
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT block_id
    FROM attributes AS a
    WHERE (a.name ='custom-progress' AND a.value = '30')
       OR (a.name ='custom-priority' AND a.value = '2')
    GROUP BY block_id
    HAVING count(block_id) = 2
);
```

### Store widget data

The widget can set the attributes through the interface, please refer to the development document for details.
