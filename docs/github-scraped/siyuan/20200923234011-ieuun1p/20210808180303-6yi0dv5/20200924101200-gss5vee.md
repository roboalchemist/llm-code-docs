# Navigate in the Content Block

## Link

There are two types of links in the document content:

- Standard URL hyperlinks, opened with a browser, used for Internet resource access
- The content block link established by `((id))` is used for two-way linking within SiYuan

## Zoom focus

- After selecting focus in the right-click drop-down menu on the block icon, the editor will focus on the content block
- Jump in context through the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the editor

## Graph

The relationship diagram is divided into document level and global. The relationship diagram of the document is expanded based on the current document block and presents all the content blocks (forward links and reverse links) related to the document; the global relationship diagram is all the block and link relationships in all notebooks.

Hold down `Ctrl` and click on the node: jump to the node.

## Backlinks

Backlinks are document-level, listing the blocks in the current document where content blocks are quoted and mentioned.

### Links

- Hovering the mouse over the reference block icon will pop up a preview floating window
- Click the reference block in the backlink list to jump

### Mentions

It is mentioned that the name and aliases of the content block in the current document is used as a keyword to search, and the search result is a content block containing these keywords. You can use the link button to convert the mention into a link: the mention will be replaced with `((id "content block name"))`.
