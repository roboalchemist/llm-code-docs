# Data Backup

## Backup

Backup refers to encrypting and copying all files in the `workspace/data/` folder to the `workspace/backup/` folder.

### How to use

1. Open <kbd>Settings - Cloud</kbd>, configure <kbd>End-to-end encryption password</kbd>
2. <kbd>Settings - Cloud - Local backup</kbd> select <kbd>Backup and upload</kbd>, after the backup is completed, a popup will prompt whether to upload, select <kbd>Confirm</kbd>
3. After the upload is complete, there will be a copy of the same encrypted data as the local backup in the cloud

## Recovery

Restoration refers to restoring the encrypted data in the `workspace/backup/` folder to the `workspace/data/` folder.

### How to use

1. Open <kbd>Settings - Cloud</kbd>, configure <kbd>End-to-end encryption password</kbd>
2. <kbd>Settings - Cloud - Cloud backup</kbd> Select <kbd>Download and recover</kbd>, after the download is complete, a pop-up will prompt whether to restore, select <kbd>Confirm</kbd>
3. After the recovery is complete, the application will be closed, and you can restart it manually

## Note

- The backup data is stored in the `workspace/backup/` folder by default, and the location can be modified
- Do not use a third-party synchronization disk to synchronize the folder, otherwise it may cause data damage
- Without changing the password, the data is transferred incrementally
- The password must be kept in mind, the data cannot be recovered without a password, and the password cannot be cleared or retrieved
- After restoring from the backup, the current workspace data will be overwritten and cannot be restored. Please confirm before using the backup to restore
