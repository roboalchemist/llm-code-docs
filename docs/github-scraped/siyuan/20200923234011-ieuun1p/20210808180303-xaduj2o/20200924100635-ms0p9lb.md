All favorite content blocks will be listed in the bookmark tab (<kbd>Alt 3</kbd> / <kbd>⌘ 3</kbd>). If you want to cancel the collection, select Delete in the drop-down menu of the content block ID.

## Tag

The tag is used to mark the block in the content block. The syntax is to wrap the tag identifier with two `#` in the first and one after the other, like this `#Tag#`.

Tag support hierarchical levels, so that content blocks can be sorted more easily. Use `/` to separate different levels, like this `#A/B/C#`.
