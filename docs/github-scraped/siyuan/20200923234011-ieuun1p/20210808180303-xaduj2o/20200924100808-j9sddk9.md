# Import and Export

## Import

### Markdown

SiYuan supports importing Markdown files. So if you need to import data from other note-taking software, please convert the data into Markdown files first.

If the image syntax (local relative path) like `![foo](images/bar.png)` is encountered during import, SiYuan will convert `images/bar.png` into assets. But if it is `.images/bar.png`, it will not be converted, because the path files starting with `.` are hidden files, SiYuan will not process them.

### Data

You can import and export data in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Export</kbd> on the desktop-end and <kbd>About</kbd> on the right sidebar on the mobile-end. The export here will completely copy and pack the `workspace/data/` folder into a zip archive.

The <kbd>Import Data</kbd> function only supports processing the data archive exported in the above steps. The import is copied to the current `workspace/data/` folder according to the file path in the archive:

- Duplicate files are overwritten
- Add files that do not exist
- Do not do any processing for existing files

Note: Please pay attention before use, to avoid existing data being overwritten and unrecoverable.

## Export

### Edit content copy

After selecting the content, use the copy shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, and the clipboard is standard Markdown text.

If you need to copy HTML content, please switch to <kbd>Export Preview</kbd> from <kbd>Toogle Mode</kbd> in the <kbd>...</kbd> menu in the upper right corner of the editor tab before copying.

### Full text export

After selecting the document on the document tree, right-click and select <kbd>Export</kbd> or select <kbd>Export</kbd> from the <kbd>...</kbd> menu in the upper right corner of the editor tab:

- Markdown
- PDF
- HTML
- Word .docx

There are some options in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Export</kbd> to configure export processing, please refer to the prompt information on this interface for details.
