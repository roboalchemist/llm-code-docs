# Assets

## Overview

Attachments inserted through the editor will be regarded as asset files and will be placed in the workspace data/assets folder by default.

## Insert picture

In the editor, you can directly paste the copied picture from the system clipboard, or you can also insert pictures by dragging and dropping picture files into the editor.

If you specify a title for a picture, then the title will be rendered below the image as a legend.

## Cleanup unreferenced assets

"Reference" refers to the link `[foo](bar)` through Markdown, the image syntax `![foo](bar)` or the attribute `src` of HTML tags (such as `<img>`, `<iframe>`) link the asset files. There are two situations:

1. Reference to a specific asset file, such as a picture or a file
2. Reference to a asset folder (a subfolder under the assets folder) must end with `/`, such as `[foo](assets/bar/)`

The second case is special: if a asset folder is referenced, all the following asset files will be counted as already referenced regardless of whether they are individually referenced.

In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, you can clean up unreferenced assets by one-click. If you need to retrieve files that have been deleted by mistake, please via Rollback.

Note: Using absolute paths (local or network paths) will not be included Clean up calculations.

## Notebook-level assets

If you need to place the inserted assets in the assets folder at the same level as the document by default, you need to manually create a folder named assets first, so that SiYuan will preferentially select the assets folder to store the assets.

It is recommended not to use notebook-level assets as much as possible, as this has some side effects:

- When deleting the notebook, in order to ensure that cross-notebook asset references work properly, the assets under the notebook will be copied to the global assets in batches
- Does not support viewing notebook-level assets history in data history
