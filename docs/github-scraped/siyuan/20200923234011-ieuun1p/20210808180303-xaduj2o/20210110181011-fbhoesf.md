# Daily notes

We can quickly create a document through the daily note. The entry of the daily note function in the top toolbar looks like a calendar button.

But before using the daily note, you need to select settings in the right-click drop-down menu of the notebook, and configure in the new diary settings:

- Storage path: the path under the notebook, support template variables
- Template path (optional): use this template as the initial content when creating the daily note

Tips: Use in the specified template Embed Content Block to summarize to-do items or content blocks that need to be viewed daily.
